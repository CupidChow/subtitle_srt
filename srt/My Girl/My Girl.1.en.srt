♫  Ignite the fairy stick and close your eyes, wait for him to appear  ♫

♫  A boy shared his thoughts to the tree hole  ♫

♫  Fall down and get back up, look up to the blue sky ♫

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,390
♫  Put on a suit and become the knight she wants  ♫

♫  Who hasn't been hurt before?  ♫

♫  What's wrong with being imperfect? ♫

♫  After rain it becomes sunny, meeting the light  ♫

Impressive, Miss Meng Hui.

32
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,630
Miss Meng Hui, why would you come to our show if your background is so impressive?

33
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,520
We are just looking for a contract makeup artist, aren't you overqualified?

34
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,900
I know, right?

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,100
Every professional makeup artists starts from the basics before becoming famous.

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,630
Glam and Shine is the first makeup show that I've seen after coming back.

37
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,240
Well said.

38
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,110
Miss Meng Hui, but for the show our contract makeup artist,

It's like this, Miss Meng Hui.

42
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,360
I just wanted to confirm that you really wanted to come to our show. You're not kidding?

43

Be more confident. I really like your show.

- Looking forward to our collaboration.

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,600
Then I will see you at the makeup testing session.

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,140
Okay, we'll notify you.

My dissociative identity disorder showed up again.

57
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,080
What type of person did you become this time?

58
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,300
I auditioned for a makeup show.

59
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,090
I even said that I came back after studying in France, Hollywood, and Tokyo.

60
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,510
Where are you? I will come then bring you back to our clinic.

61
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,200
What kind of disease do I have?

62
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,960
Every time my disorder gets triggered, I become a total different person.

63
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,310
I spend money, lie, and flirt with men.

64
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,170
I can literally do anything.

65
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,100
I also told the show that I'll be the makeup artist.

66
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,110
These actions are the wishes that you wanted to fulfill inside your mind.

67
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,270
Have you ever thought that interviewing for this show was something that you wanted to do the most?

68
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,120
I couldn't do it, everyone there are professionals. If I go there I would just be causing trouble.

69
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,640
These days you've posted many makeup reviews. You gained a lot of fans.

70
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,570
Meng Hui, be more confident.

Are you really not going?

73
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,430
But I lied to get this opportunity.

74
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,960
That is, you had gone to their interview hoping to get their approval.

75
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,310
Can I really do it?

Hello, talk to me about the earnings in the third quarter.

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,990
- Today I bought potatoes for 1.80 yuan, what a bargain.
- Wow, that's so cheap.

80
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,740
Is the revenue for the third quarter only 180 million? Did I even make a profit?

81
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,700
- Extracurricular activities for children are a long-term investment. They are worth it no matter what.
- I will invest 1 more billion yuan, is it worth it?

82
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,670
There is traffic on the road. There's nothing we can do when we've traffic on the way to work.

83
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:47,050
The Ferrari waste gas. The Porsche is at the repair shop. I am on the bus right now.

84
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,900
Since we work in the makeup industry, we have to be sensitive to fashion.

I am the trend. I am the trendsetter.

Hey.

89
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,170
I didn't bring the card. Can you swipe the card for me? I will transfer the money back to you via WeChat.

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,860
Sure.

Hello.

92
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,340
Didn't I tell you before that you have to bump up the sales?

93
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,180
So?

94
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,250
Hey!

95
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,280
I let you swipe the card. Why did you insert coins?

96
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,340
- Is there a difference?
- How–

97
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,420
If you pay with card, it costs 1.80 yuan. Paying with coins, it's 2.00 yuan.

98
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,300
If you didn't swipe your card, please pay for your ticket now.

99
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,990
Isn't it just a difference of twenty cents?

100
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,030
You mean, you don't care about the twenty cents?

101
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,290
Huh?

I wasn't talking about this 1.80 yuan. I was talking about the 180 million yuan,

109
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,700
and 180 million yuan doesn't make a big difference to me.

Director Shen, Director!

114
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,050
How is the liquid foundation's development going?

115
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,500
This foundation can cover blemishes, acne, wrinkles, and dark circles. It can even withstand the wind and rain. It last long, too.

116
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,600
But, it really can't cover scars.

117
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,980
Are you asking for more money?

118
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,260
It is not about the money, Director Shen.

119
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,160
Can't you respect the market rules?

120
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,860
Every foundation right now is very light, but why do we need to develop

121
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,920
a foundation thick enough to paint walls?

122
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,160
Ten thousand yuan.

123
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
- It's not about money.
- Twenty thousand yuan.

124
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,780
- No way. It's too difficult.
- Thirty thousand.

125
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,890
I'll think of another method.

Boss, please take a look.

127
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,040
Since the establishment of the company,

128
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,710
our revenue has decreased by 19 percent each year.

129
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,260
We have been losing money,

130
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,460
but it is okay. I do not mind.

131
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,140
Because I built this company not to make money,

132
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,050
I just want a foundation that can cover scars.

133
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,520
It does not matter how much money I need to invest.

134
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,500
- Understand?
- Understood.

135
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,950
Is our boss stupid? How can we make a foundation that can cover scars?

136
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,070
Don't let him hear you.

137
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,010
He has other sources of income to keep the company running.

138
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,640
His money can support everyone. If he says there is a foundation like that, then let's say there is one.

139
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,180
Let's go.

140
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,340
The sales team gave us a plan for the brand ambassador of the cosmetic product.

141
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,770
We invest in a beauty program by ourselves and let the winner be the brand ambassador.

142
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,740
The show called, "Glam and Shine" is now open for investments.

143
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,000
How much money do we need?

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,670
Oh, this production fee is not much, but we have to look for three famous people to be the judges.

145
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,280
Look for two.

146
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,390
I don't think it is a good idea. Usually, this kind of show always have three judges.

147
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,040
Look for two and count me in as one. 3 in total.

148
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,080
This... you are going to be a judge?

149
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,650
- Isn't my influence not big enough?
- It is big enough.

150
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,440
- Isn't my image not good enough?
- It is good.

151
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,650
The most important thing, I do not need to spend more money.

152
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,450
T- Then, sure. This way, we can save the money to invite another judge.

153
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,660
What other issue do you have?

154
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,590
Oh, we have an interview in a while. The journalist is already waiting for you in the conference room.

155
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,160
I already brought the clothes from Dr. Sui.

156
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,310
Take a look.

157
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,160
Why should I change my clothes?

158
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,710
Director Shen. Look at what you are wearing. You look like a Christmas tree.

159
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,740
It is not appropriate. You have to change for sure.

160
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,190
You have to change.

161
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:53,770
If I say it out loud, you guys won't even believe me. In order to save money, Shen Yi is going to be a judge himself for the show.

162
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,840
He is so stingy. Even a finance person like me can't calculate that much.

163
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,350
Human Resources Department is hard, too.

164
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,160
Team building activities are self-paid. The prize for annual staff parties are coupons to buy LS cosmetics products.

165
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,350
He is good enough to me. In order to make that foundation, he's actually spending a lot.

166
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,160
But the product development team does not have many holidays.

167
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,930
You count your own hair.

168
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,850
The sales team is actually very sad.

169
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,170
Look. This is the chart for the revenue of makeup products.

170
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,490
Pay attention to the graph.

171
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,650
If we do not clean out the lipstick storage,

172
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,830
this will become my ECG. The boss only values money.

173
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,110
Do you know why Director Shen's ex-girlfriend broke up with him?

174
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,590
Because he sent her a set of lipsticks that he made in the laboratory on her birthday.

175
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,080
Their total cost is just about $10.

176
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,360
I heard LS cosmetics is not selling well and losing a lot of money.

177
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,600
LS is a young, small company.

178
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,400
Although we are not doing well on the cosmetics part,

179
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,990
our skincare line is of high-end technology and well-form ideology.

180
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,470
We are mainly profiting off of our skincare line.

181
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,080
I heard your company is trying to produce a foundation that can cover scars.

182
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,940
- This coverage–
- Yes.

183
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,870
It is very hard to create one.

184
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,300
But I believe that we can be successful.

185
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,590
Because this liquid foundation is the reason why we entered the cosmetic industry.

186
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,020
I hope to create cosmetics that

187
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,190
can cover scars.

188
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,890
Wow, Miss Wei Lei can hold any type of makeup look.

189
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,500
Her skill is pretty good.

190
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,740
She thinks about every aspect.

191
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,280
Very meticulous.

192
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,210
You are pretty good.

193
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,890
She can even cover scars.

194
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,820
You mixed this foundation by yourself?

195
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,620
I did some research to specially mix this for you.

196
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,960
If you like it, then I can make more bottles for you.

197
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,650
Thank you.

198
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,430
Then Miss Meng Hui, welcome to the Glam and Shine Show Team.

199
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,910
Really?

200
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,870
Of course. In the next two weeks, we will have our first filming.

201
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,700
Thank you. I will treasure this opportunity well.

202
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,190
Then let's congratulate Miss Meng Hui.

203
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Miss Wei Lei.

204
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,080
When I was applying makeup for you,

205
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,560
I had something to say.

206
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,790
What is it?

207
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,860
That...

208
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,500
Your nose... you should go to your nose appointment soon.

209
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,030
If you keep dragging it, then your nose might not be straight anymore.

210
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,550
Thank you for your care. I have never done a nose job.

211
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,510
My entire face is natural. I have never done anything about it.

212
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,070
Then it could be my mistake.

213
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,450
You are wrong for sure.

214
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,570
I am sorry.

215
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,300
Although I know,you will be mad if I say it out loud,

216
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,900
but I still suggest you to go to the doctor soon.

217
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,000
I know she will be mad.

218
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,520
But if I do not say it, then what if her nose is not really straight anymore?

219
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,500
Then you are not worried that she will make your life difficult?

220
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,440
She is so beautiful. I wish she is that good looking all the time.

221
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,070
You are the same. Very beautiful.

222
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,190
Meng Hui.

223
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,310
I am fine. Now, I am slowly trying to make my dreams come true.

224
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,210
I believe that one day, I will forget all those bad things and get rid of dissociative identity disorder.

225
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,240
Then you have to control your feelings well.

226
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,760
No matter what kind of situation you face, do not be nervous, angry or sad.

227
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,480
If there is any problem, you have to call me.

228
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,880
I am always there.

229
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,390
Okay.

230
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,980
Thank you. I have to look for you all the time to lend your clothes.

231
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,190
No worries. If you are going to be on the show, it is better if you wear suits and ties.

232
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,120
Yeah.

233
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,290
Let's go.

234
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,590
The bakery has a Buy 1, Get 1 promotion. Take this free one for yourself.

235
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,410
What is this?

236
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,850
You should switch out your cellphone, too. Our hospital is giving out cellphones to the clients so I brought one for you.

237
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,900
I do not need it. I can still use mine.

238
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,550
Dr. Sui. Should I wash and return the clothes after Director Shen is done wearing them?

239
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,750
No, it's fine. That suit has wrong measurement, so I will just give it to him.

240
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,590
Look after him well next time. Every occasion has different attire to pair with.

241
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,020
I understand. Bye, Dr. Sui.

242
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,430
Bye bye.

243
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,460
Let's go, Director Shen.

244
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,740
Why didn't you take the cellphone that Dr. Sui gave you?

245
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,810
Too expensive.

246
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,000
Do you know that this set of suit is about 10 times more expensive than the cellphone?

247
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,000
Didn't he get the wrong measurements? There is no use if he doesn't wear it too.

248
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,840
I pity Dr. Sui.

249
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,720
What do you mean?

250
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,690
Dr. Sui always buy suits in wrong sizes, and you fit well into them.

251
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,830
Whenever Dr. Sui buys snacks, he always get buy 1 get 1 free.

252
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,920
And he always give you the extra one. He always come see you when he is nearby.

253
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,110
He even ask people around you to take care of you well.

254
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,530
What are you trying to hint?

255
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:54,030
Director Shen. Dr. Sui is trying to help you. He can't tolerate–

256
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,130
He can't understand your living conditions, too.

257
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,760
I want a rich friend like that.

258
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,500
Am I not that rich friend of yours?

259
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,620
No, no. You guys are rich in different ways.

260
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,790
You are insulting me that I am stingy.

261
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,880
I am praising you that average people cannot spend wisely like you.

262
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,060
- Okay. Next month—
- Hey, Director Shen.

263
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,500
Look at yourself. You can't even eat spicy food, but you still ate it. There is a pimple now.

264
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,300
I will find a makeup artist later and cover it up.

265
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,060
Let's hurry up.

266
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,720
Check the cameras.

267
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,550
Camera no.1! Are you blind?

268
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,670
Look after the judge well.

269
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,450
That middle one. Do you see him?

270
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,960
LS's CEO, Shen Yi. His dad is Shen Qian Shan.

271
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,050
Shen Qian Shan is that Shen Qian Shan I know about?

272
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,340
The CEO of Qian Shan Group?

273
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,590
Camera no.2, focus on the stage!

274
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,900
- Director, this is your coffee.
- Thank you.

275
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,890
I feel like this "sponsor daddy"

276
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,830
is not that nice.

277
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,490
Isn't he too stingy?

278
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,330
The sponsor fee is pretty low,

279
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,530
but let me tell you. Do you see those cosmetics on the table?

280
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,590
That is the new expensive collection of their company.

281
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,940
- Each of them costs at least 10,000 yuan.
- 10,000 yuan?

282
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,250
The CEO said it already. After the show is done filming, they are all ours.

283
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,360
Count how many are there on the table. Let's split them up among ourselves.

284
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,030
Sugar daddy!

285
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,460
For today's reality show, listen to me carefully, you must do well.

286
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,200
Camera no.6, let me take a look at the makeup room.

287
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,810
Y- You said the vanishing cream is worth how... how much money?

288
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,950
Come on. Let me through. Let me through.

289
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,710
You are an employee from the LS company,

290
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,140
so you don't have to be responsible for it, right?

291
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,490
No, it's not like that. Regarding the topic of money, our company,

292
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,200
always will punish their employees if required to.
(T/N: This is an idiom meaning to place righteousness before one's family.)

293
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,140
We're screwed.

294
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,010
What happened?

295
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,420
Aren't you the man from the bus?

296
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,030
It broke already. What are we going to do?

297
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,080
Who did it?

298
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,790
Your own company's employee did it.

299
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,370
How much does it cost to reimburse it?

300
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,680
96,340 yuan.

301
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,510
- Wow, that's a large sum! More than 90,000?
- Oh my god, it's almost 100,000!

302
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,500
- You can buy a car with that money!
- How will she pay for it?

303
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,240
Pay for it.

304
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,320
- That is way to much money.
- Aren't these all empty bottles though?

305
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,970
- Empty bottles? Empty?
- These are empty!

306
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,640
Aren't these bottles just for the shooting? Only the look of it matters.

307
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,240
Do they have to have anything inside of them?

308
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,570
Then why do you have to have her pay for everything?

309
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,210
If I have her pay for these exact same empty bottles, then wouldn't she have to buy a whole new set,

310
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,790
dump the product out and place the empty bottles here?

311
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,410
That makes sense. You calculated everything very clearly.

312
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,370
What are you going to do next?

313
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,680
That... how about we do the outdoor shoot first?

314
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,570
Our Director Shen does not have a lot of time.

315
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,010
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Come with me. This way.

316
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,800
Quickly.

317
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,180
Let's go. Get back to work.

318
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,320
Good, we will contact you.

319
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,500
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.

320
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,100
It's my fault again!
(T/N: "hài rén hài jǐ" literally means to hurt others and yourself)

321
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,170
Hello Director Shen.

322
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,180
How do you know that I am here?

323
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,980
Because out of all the restaurants nearby, this one is the cheapest.

324
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,130
Do you want the same cup for half price? We can buy it together.

325
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,920
Here you go.

326
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,740
We can't?

327
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,620
You should give me 7.5 yuan.

328
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,030
[Cold drinks 10 RMB]
[Second drink half off]

329
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,610
Okay.

330
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,120
Sorry, I do not have any more cash.

331
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,550
You have my WeChat.

332
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,440
You deleted my WeChat already?

333
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,800
Oh, okay.

334
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,200
If you want to gain my attention this way, then I am sorry.

335
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,840
I am not that type of CEO you think.

336
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,180
This I understand.

337
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,960
Then, why are you looking for me?

338
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,380
Can you not make Xiao Mei pay for those?

339
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,700
Actually, I accidentally caused the screw to fall off the table before so that's why Xiao Mei broke the table.

340
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,910
If those empty bottles are so important to you, I am willing to pay for it.

341
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,800
1 Value meal, and 2 drinks. The half priced one.

342
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Okay. Please wait for a while.

343
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,180
The same as him.

344
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,300
The set that just broke is the latest set from the LS high-end skincare.

345
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,420
All of the packaging is shipped from Finland.

346
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,700
So the actual value is not just 96,340 yuan.

347
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:59,280
It should be added to the cost of shipping and the millions spent on advertising.

348
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,720
So let me ask you this again.

349
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,240
Does this matter concerns you?

350
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,950
Your food is ready. You still have to wait a while for the juice.

351
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,960
I will work hard to earn money.

352
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,980
Don't you think the responsibility is very heavy?

353
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:45,290
But this is the responsibility that I need to take. I can't hurt others because of this matter.

354
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,060
Then, why do not you consider letting me pay a less amount?

355
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,230
Your juice is ready!

356
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,860
I will go grab it.

357
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,260
- No, can't you see it?
- I am sorry.

358
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,290
Do you know how expensive my clothes are? Is an apology enough?

359
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,430
Sorry.

360
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,810
Do you know how much is my clothes? 12,800 yuan.

361
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,820
H- How much?! How is that possible?

362
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,310
You are trying to trick me.

363
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,660
He is not lying. I am telling you from my own experience.

364
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,040
If you do not leave now, the consequences will be pretty bad.

365
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,460
Thank you.

366
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,830
Do you not know how to hide?

367
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,480
You drink this.

368
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,110
Is it free?

369
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,760
Do you think that I'm very stingy?

370
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,720
Do you want to hear the truth?

371
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,030
Say it.

372
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:29,040
I have a friend that is a psychological consultant, you aren't being stingy.

373
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,590
Why?

374
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,950
Have you ever met a person that you are willing to spend any amount of money for and think that it's worth it?

375
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,770
For example, a girlfriend.

376
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:46,950
My ex-girlfriend broke up with me because I am not willing to spend money on her.

377
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:55,310
Then, is there any item that you are willing to spend any amount of money on and think that it's worth it?

378
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,470
I only want a liquid foundation that can cover up scars.

379
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,410
I do not care how much money I need to invest in.

380
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,370
You do not need to pay for those empty bottles anymore.

381
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,660
Really? I knew that you weren't the type of person that worries about tiny things.

382
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,320
As long as you pay for my clothes, it is okay.

383
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,210
Then I will just pay for the bottles.

384
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,140
I just wanted you to help me wash it a bit.

385
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,960
You are really a good person.

386
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,220
Wait.

387
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,640
Let me look at it again one last time.

388
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,460
Xiao Mei, hurry up and get up. CEO Shen said you do not need to pay anymore.

389
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,040
Really? He really said that.

390
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,590
It is over.

391
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,290
He fallen in love with me!

392
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,430
What's wrong?

393
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,690
Meng Hui.

394
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,990
My CEO said I do not need to pay for the cosmetics anymore.

395
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,890
Isn't that a good thing?

396
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,370
You don't understand. If you say that our CEO is the second most stingy person, then no one can be first.

397
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,160
That much money.

398
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:59,660
He didn't even blink his eyes and let this go. If it is not love, then what is it?

399
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,400
Love?

400
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,340
If he wants me to be his girlfriend, then how do I reject him?

401
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,230
I do not want the lipstick made in the laboratory.

402
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,510
Director Shen, long time no see.

403
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,720
Why don't you even glance at me once today?

404
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,450
It isn't because you are forgetful and you don't remember me, right?

405
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,680
I didn't recognize you.

406
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,740
Because you look different from three years ago.

407
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,940
You're correct. I did straightened my teeth and my face shape became prettier.

408
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,430
And nose surgery, bone shaving, as well as autologous fat filling.

409
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,280
If you need it, I will introduce my friend, Sui An to you.

410
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,610
He is a very good plastic surgeon.

411
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,110
Let's talk about something else.

412
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,630
After we broke up three years ago, I regretted it so much.

413
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,900
Actually, the lipstick that you gave me is very hydrating.

414
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,760
Although the color is not very useful, but I shouldn't insult it.

415
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,420
You didn't just hate the color, but you also hate the price.

416
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,630
Because I made them myself, you think I am stingy and carefree.

417
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,020
But if I did gave you a set of Christian Louboutin lipsticks then you wouldn't be this mad.

418
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,760
Shen Yi, I was so carefree.

419
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,300
Actually, the lipstick that you made is better than Christian Louboutin's ones.

420
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,480
You are like this for the competition, right? Actually, you do not need to be like this at all.

421
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,300
Even without the incident from three years ago,

422
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,160
you won't become the winner, nor my spokesperson.

423
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,660
- Why?
- Your face.

424
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,330
I could've never find a face that has plastic surgery to become my spokesperson.

425
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,990
If I were to find one, I'd have to find one like hers.

426
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,670
She does not only look good, but she also has the ability to do it well.

427
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:50,340
Her? Ability to do it well? She is the most pretentious in this entire competition.

428
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,870
This is the type of attitude to beg someone.

429
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,660
You–

430
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:14,260
Everyone said the men's eyes are blind in front of beautiful girl. You, "ability to do it well"? Please!

431
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:20,440
♫ What's wrong with being imperfect? After rain it becomes sunny– ♫

432
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,330
You want to retouch your makeup? Sit.

433
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:30,450
Do you know that my face is very expensive? You do not deserve it.

434
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,860
What kind of unlicensed school is Spake? Is Claire Stone even a real person?

435
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:46,000
Yunmi Ishida? You can really make up a good story.

436
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,630
You've told such a huge lie just to become a makeup artist here. What are you even doing here?

437
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,960
Oh, you are here for Shen Yi.

438
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,970
If you are trying to get his attention,

439
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,760
then why don't you just go to his company and be the blogger who sells beauty products?

440
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:13,780
Shen Yi only values money. This way, you can gain his trust and lie to him.

441
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,880
I will go tell Shen Yi now the type of person you are.

442
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,390
You misunderstood. Please listen to my explanation.

443
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:41,170
We can distinguish between reality and illusion but your struggle is,

444
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,920
you treat it as reality.

445
00:38:50,610 --> 00:39:01,090
You want Shen Yi, then why don't you just go to his company and be the blogger who sells beauty products? Shen Yi only values money.

446
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,930
Isn't that simply selling beauty products?

447
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,150
I can.

448
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,360
You are saying that she lied?

449
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:29,150
I know it is a bit rush to change the partner,

450
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:35,930
but I really can't work with her. I can't trust her at all.

451
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,810
We can understand her point.

452
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,680
She lied to us.

453
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,810
But you have to think about it. Her technique is good, isn't?

454
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,170
But is she worth 3,000 yuan a day?

455
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:52,370
- This...
- Of course, I am not worth 3,000 yuan a day.

456
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,630
Bai Rimeng.

457
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,190
You are Bai Rimeng herself?

458
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,290
If I just send out a post on Weibo, it is not just 3,000 yuan anymore.

459
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,620
Who is Bai Rimeng?

460
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,480
Director Shen, it is Bai Rimeng.

461
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,000
She is a very famous influencer now.

462
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,240
Although she does not have a lot of fans, but the way she tests out products is very professional.

463
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:35,050
Last few days, she promoted a lipstick and it was sold out in a day. We are trying to contact her to promote our products.

464
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:42,250
Ms. Meng Hui. Can we talk about our future collaboration with our LS company?

465
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,000
Now, will you recalculate the amount back for me?

466
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,670
Hiring you for 3,000 yuan a day is pretty worth it.

467
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,870
- It is low.
- Then, how about 6,000 yuan?

468
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,400
- Sure.
- Yeah, yeah!

469
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,880
No, she lied to all of us.

470
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:03,530
You should calm down. Actually, it is like this.

471
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,560
Let go of me!

472
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,670
What's wrong with you guys? That Meng Hui is just a liar!

473
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,720
What if she apply a very ugly makeup on me? What if she takes her revenge on me?

474
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,690
You should quickly switch her out. How should we even communicate well?

475
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,700
Quickly. Quickly. Go, go.

476
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,700
What?

477
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,280
You have that many acne. Do you also like spicy food?

478
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,120
Yeah, I like it.

479
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,320
It's done.

480
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,830
Take a look at yourself.

481
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,800
Okay.

482
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,630
I really can't see it at all. What foundation did you use?

483
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,860
What are you doing?

484
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,310
Helping you wipe your clothes.

485
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,730
Don't you have a meeting in the afternoon?

486
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,280
Let's take the bus home together at night.

487
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,200
It's the more convenient way.

488
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,790
Okay.

489
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,210
This Meng Hui... has she become our crew's mom?

490
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,400
Really? That quickly?

491
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:33,180
Shen Yi is the one and only inheritor of Qian Shan Group.

492
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,890
- What's his worth? More than a billion!
- That much money?

493
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:02,360
Don't be too pleased. Do you really think that Shen Yi is the type of bossy CEO in some romantic comedy?

494
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:07,760
Everyone calls him Boss Pi, Pi from Pixiu, because of his stinginess.
(T/N: Pixiu is a mythical character that represents wealth. Pixiu draws in wealth but doesn't give it out.)

495
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:12,120
Look at Meng Hui's Weibo!

496
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,430
Do you think he really likes you?

497
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,660
Let me tell you.

498
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,270
He only has liquid foundation in his brain.

499
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,020
He won't spend any money on you, just on the foundation.

500
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,280
He only spend money on the right person.

501
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,590
For you, he's not willing to spend on lipsticks worth hundreds.

502
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:34,680
But for me, he easily let go of millions of dollars of compensation.

503
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:40,720
Shen Yi is your ex-boyfriend, right? Didn't you say that I wanted him?

504
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,820
You are right.

505
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,950
Smile a bit.

506
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,150
Interesting.

507
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,880
From now on, your ex-boyfriend, will be mine.

508
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,290
You!

509
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,590
What's the meaning of this? Counting money?

510
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:20,830

511
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:31,630
Foundation is the base of makeup. Trust is the starting point of love.

512
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,120
♫  Life is like strolling in an endless circle  ♫

513
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,130
♫  Unable to escape; unable to retreat  ♫

514
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,320
♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫

515
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:53,270
♫  But I can feel you here in this world  ♫

516
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:58,160
♫  Before approaching you, I secretly counted down the time  ♫

517
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,420
♫  I want to find you; I want to hold you tight  ♫

518
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:11,770
♫  For this, I would wait another thousand years until I meet you  ♫

519
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:18,630
♫  Unbelievably beautiful and incomparable  ♫

520
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:27,350
♫  Your eyes shines like diamonds captivating me  ♫

521
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:32,160
♫  You're the most dazzling spark in this darkness  ♫

522
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:42,410
♫  Don't let me wander in the world ♫

523
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,610
♫ Leading me ♫

524
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:52,970
♫  Like the North Star protecting all the corners  ♫

525
00:46:53,030 --> 00:47:00,200
♫  Please let me be loved, too  ♫
