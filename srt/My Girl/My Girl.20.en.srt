21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,310
Welcome sir, do you have a reservation?

22
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,030
I'm here to be fitted for a suit. I'm Mr. Shen's best man.

23
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,180
Okay, this way please.

24

Here, Doctor Sui!

Where's Shen Yi?

26

He'll be here shortly.

27
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,740
Today, we prepared about ten suits to choose from. It will be tough today.

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,150
I'll try them out first then.

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,340
Okay.

00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,040

President Shen, Doctor Sui just went in.

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,330
Mr. Shen, Doctor Sui is already in,. You can dress in another room.

35
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,340
We will use the same room.

I think this one is quite nice.

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,950
That Pikachu color? Are you being serious?

43
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,450
Does it look nice?

I'm in a very good mood.

You're worried about that night when you got drunk right?

Don't worry, I won't tell Meng Hui.

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,130
I'll keep it as a secret forever.

Of course I'm at ease.

51
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,050
What you're good at is keeping secrets.

52
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,340
A matter can be in your stomach for a thousand years.

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,700
Can you help me tighten it?

54
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,510
You've always been so tight-lipped.

55
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,310
I can't say anything with you strangling me.

What's wrong with you today? Who triggered you?

57
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,350
For so many years, I have treated you like my biological brother.

58
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,170
I gave you my back but I never thought
(T/N: Trust)

59
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,460
that perhaps one day, you'll stab me in the back.

60
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,700
It's the same for me. I also gave you my back.
(T/N: Trust)

61
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,640
It's not the same. There is no knowing what is in a man's heart.

62
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,390
Who knows whether the weakness you are showing is real or a mere illusion?

63
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,780
Why aren't you speaking?

64

Have you ever thought of telling me the truth?

72

Don't let me see you again.

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,780
Have you ever thought that I didn't tell you for your own good?

74
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,700
What a hypocrite. You just did it for yourself!

75
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,900
You're a coward and selfish. You don't dare to admit your responsibility.

76
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,830
You pushed all the responsibility on me so you could feel better.

I'm so jealous.

82
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,540
We missed out on another chance to marry rich.

That's right.

This tie is you and I.

98
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,310
From now on, the two of us cannot exist together.

What are you doing here?

100
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm here to be the gentle and sweet snail girl.

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,870
I helped you cleaned a bit.

102

If I remembered correctly, my office got messy because of you.

103

What happened to your face?

104
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,600
An accident.

About what happened last night—

107
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,290
About what happened last night, you were overworked so you forgot about the date,  so you're excused.

108
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,740
But I'm so modest so I won't take this seriously.

109
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,050
Do you remember what also happened?

110
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,370
I'm sorry. I was thinking too much last night

111
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,330
and I kept taking the initiative before and you had no response at all.

112
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,940
Of course, I don't have a lot of sense of security

113
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,750
so that's why I misunderstood you and looked for Shen Yi

114
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,770
but I promise in the future I will always believe in you.

115
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,210
Our problem is that we don't have trust.

116
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,340
Right now, Shen Yi and Meng Hui's relationship is very complicated. Can you not cause a ruckus?

117
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,120
Complicated? How complicated, can you tell me?

118
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,930
I can't.

119
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,170
Y-You, you're not admitting it?

120
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,950
- That night we already—
- Was there really that night?

121
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,480
Or do you want to lie to me to make me responsible?

122
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,580
You know everything?

123
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,090
There indeed wasn't that night.

124
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,220
You cheated me.

125
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,170
I... I didn't purposely lie to you. I...

126
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,950
I just couldn't resist the temptation.

127
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,020
- Wei Lei.
- Yes?
- Let's cool down a bit.

128
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,670
I've only dated for one day.

129
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,300
Come in.

130
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,840
President Shen, Doctor Sui made a reservation saying that he wants to meet you.

131
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,970
If anyone lets him in then I'll fire them.

132
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,030
Why, did you two fight?

133
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,210
No.

134
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,710
That's what I thought. It's been so many years. Who has seen the two of you argue?

135
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,860
Our relationship is over!

136
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,550
O-Over?

137
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,000
Bet on me?

138
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,390
Hello, Jiang Jiang. Bring all my documents to my house.

139
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm working at home today so I won't go out.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,950
Also, prepare lunch for me.

141
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,330
- Who is it?
- It's me.

142
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,830
Director Shen.

143
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,840
You're here alone?

144
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,390
Yes, it's just me.

145
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,810
Come in.

146
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,500
Director Shen, I ran into Doctor Sui on the way up.

147
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,700
Are you really not going to see him?

148
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,990
You came here at the right time. I have something

149
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,840
- for you to do.
- Okay.

150
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,970
Please remove everything from my home that has anything to with Sui An.

151
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,660
For example, those clothes, the furniture,

152
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,100
also the food. Take them away.

153
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,370
But...

154
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,270
Director Shen, the two of you were not in some romantic relationship, so why are you sending back his gifts?

155
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,200
Even if you were in a relationship, you still don't need to return the gifts.

156
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,320
It'll just make you look petty.

157
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,770
So I'm petty. I've been like this since I was little, okay?

158
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:02,210
Director Shen, don't act like this, or your house will be emptied of everything.

159
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,460
You must be kidding. Do I really owe him that much?

160
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,460
Six figures aren't even enough.

161
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,350
- It's that much?
- Little did you know, right?

162
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,730
Let me tell you. Relationships are like this

163
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,270
only the person involved doesn't know.

164
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,630
Look at what you guys went through all these years.

165
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,910
I'm an outsider and I can see it.

166
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,470
There is nothing the two of you cannot resolve if you would just sit down and talk with each other.

167
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,180
You are like brothers, right?

168
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,350
- Is he paying your salary?
- No.

169
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,530
Then why are you taking his side?

170
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,170
Director Shen, if Doctor Sui was my boss, he would have paid me enough for me to buy a house.

171
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,870
Then why don't you go and work as his assistant?

172
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,230
You.

173
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,500
It's because of affection... it's something that happens unconsciously.

174
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,130
Can you stop hurting the people that are good to you?

175
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,100
Your temper these days is really getting harder and harder to understand.

176
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,230
This will make the people beside you not feel safe.

177
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,540
My goodness. You can even argue with Dr. Sui.

178
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,420
The next step, will it be me?

179
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,580
Don't misunderstand. That's not what I meant.

180
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,490
Anyways, I'm in a hard position right now. You keep staying at home and not leaving.

181
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,170
I have a lot of duties that I can't even start.

182
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,570
Also, do you still want to get married?

183
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,830
Are you still going to wear the suit and pick the tie?

184
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,890
What does this have to do with marriage?

185
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,370
You can go pick up the tie.

186
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,500
The shop called me saying that Dr. Sui took the tie.

187
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,860
What did he take my tie for?

188
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,180
So do you want to get married or not?

189
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,610
I want to.

190
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,430
Then I'll let Sui An come in.

191
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,260
You—

192
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,100
Did you eat yet?

193
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

194
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,210
It's all on you now.

195
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,630
I had them prepare a new tie.

196
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,020
Since you like it so much then wear this one.

197
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,140
It's your wedding. As long as you're happy.

198
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,550
I don't want it. Take it away.

199
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,050
I was too hasty that day.

200
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,540
We didn't say things clearly.

201
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,290
If you want me to apologize to you then,

202
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,850
Shen Yi,

203
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm sorry. Even though this apology

204
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,930
is over ten years late.

205
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,220
If you think the apology isn't enough

206
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,400
then you can tell me your requests.

207
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,270
What should I do to make it up to you?

208
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,850
Sui An, are you belittling me?

209
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,090
Do I want an apology?

210
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,700
Then why are you angry?

211
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,230
It's been so many years and you treated me well

212
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,840
because you treated me like your brother

213
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,130
or to make it up to me?

214
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
Yes.

215
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
That matter happened long ago.

216
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,780
I already didn't care long ago.

217
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,570
I don't care how you treated me and Meng Hui before

218
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,370
but I care about who you are now.

219
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,180
Every time I need help, you're always the first one to stand out.

220
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,470
What is this?

221
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,220
I helped you prepared Mr. Smith's appointment card.

222
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,750
Every time I encounter problems that I can't figure out,

223
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,430
you'll always help me think of a solution.

224
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,660
Wei Lei doesn't care what happened between you and Meng Hui.

225
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,250
Don't worry. You still have me.

226
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,350
But you never told me your troubles.

227
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,380
There are times

228
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,230
everyone looked down on me because I was stingy.

229
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,130
Only you were willing to tolerate me.

230
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,710
On the contrary, you even compensated me.

231
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,480
It was buy one get one free at the bakery shop. You take the free one.

232
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,910
Why do you have everything in pairs?

233
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,050
I thought you probably would need it when I brought it.

234
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,820
Why?

235
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,090
I treated you as a brother but you did it to make up for it.

236
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,710
Shen Yi, this isn't just making up for it.

237
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,420
How can you prove that?

238
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,560
What about you?

239
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,400
Do you love me

240
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,060
or are making it up for me?

241
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,080
- Meng Hui.
- Zheng Jue.

242
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,900
You already married me.

243
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,940
You won't divorce me, right?

244
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,870
But if I knew the truth from the start

245
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,250
then I might not have agreed to marry you.

246
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,040
Then do you not love me after finding out about the truth?

247
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,930
Meng Hui, let's forget the past together

248
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,380
and live well, okay?

249
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,830
When we first met,

250
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,890
my face didn't have a scar.

251
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,880
You agreed  to go on a date with me

252
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,260
to get the liquid foundation that can cover my scar.

253
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,320
Yes.

254
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,390
Then after that you started to pursue me, treated me well,

255
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,930
give me samples, and make the appointment for the surgery,

256
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,870
is it because you found out that I have a scar on my face?

257
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,660
Yes.

258
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,530
Then later you said you wanted to break up with me

259
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,840
and you needed to calm down.

260
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,570
You realized that I'm not that girl you were looking for.

261
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,970
Yes.

262
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,050
Then later you said we should make up

263
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,610
because you didn't find the girl at the school reunion.

264
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,230
No, it's because at that time I knew

265
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,280
that you're the most important and even more important than her.

266
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,090
But Xiao Ba appeared later on and you treated her so well.

267
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,300
It's because you thought she was the little girl

268
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,460
and you made that scar on her face.

269
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,930
You used the same way you treated me to treat her.

270
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,420
You took care of her, tolerate her,

271
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,740
and brought her to Sui An's house,

272
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,460
right?

273
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,580
Yes.

274
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,920
Later on, you went to my house to meet my mom and were in such a rush to get married to me.

275
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,460
You realized Xiao Ba was fake

276
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,920
and I was the one that you were looking for.

277
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,450
Meng Hui,

278
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,600
I'm with you because I love you.

279
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,820
It has nothing to do with the scar on your face.

280
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,370
When you see the scar on my face everyday,

281
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,330
how do you feel?

282
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,820
Guilt, self-blame, remorse?

283
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,940
No matter what is, it won't be a positive feeling.

284
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,210
The scar on my face is reminding me everyday

285
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,840
what you want to forget in this lifetime.

286
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,920
Everytime you see me then you'll be in pain.

287
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,380
Maybe after ten years, we'll even end up hating each other.

288
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,620
- I won't.
- But I don't know if I will.

289
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,770
I already tried really hard.

290
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,160
I wanted to pretend that all of this never happened.

291
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,030
I wanted to hide all of this

292
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,540
but if one day,

293
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,820
my love for you has already been worn down.

294
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,160
Then I might really hate you.

295
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,690
Go back.

296
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,140
What's wrong?

297
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,720
I'm fine. I probably didn't rest well.

298
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,280
Sleep.

299
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,020
Goodnight.

300
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,520
Meng Hui?

301
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,840
Meng Hui?

302
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,100
Meng Hui.

303
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,850
Go away.

304
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,480
I...

305
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,690
I told you so many times.

306
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,500
If you didn't brush your teeth then don't touch me.

307
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,810
I... I was just hungry and I saw you making breakfast so I felt

308
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,230
like eating first then brushing my teeth.

309
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,160
I only made mines. If you want to eat it then make it yourself.

310
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,690
You made it for yourself?

311
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,000
Who knows what you want to eat? You don't eat bitter melon, nor do you eat cilantro.

312
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,720
Your milk needs to be heated up four times. Don't you find yourself a hassle?

313
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,760
Meng Hui, today, why

314
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,390
do you like arguing with me?

315
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,140
Who is arguing with you? Didn't you use to argue with me?

316
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,520
If you're not satisfied then endure it.

317
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,490
Hurry and eat. We have to go to the company later.

318
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,460
You said, us?

319
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,230
What else?

320
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,480
If it weren't for me, how could the company have ended up so successful?

321
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,210
What, are you trying to kick me out?

322
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,450
No. No. Of course not.

323
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,850
I'll drive you there after you finish eating.

324
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,820
I'll drive.

325
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,160
You'll drive?

326
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,250
I'm already thirty-something years old. I can't drive?

327
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,340
How old are you?

328
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,650
Thirty-five years old.

329
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,550
What year is it now?

330
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,790
2030. It's already been ten years.

331
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,800
Oh, I'll go wash up.

332
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,410
Jiang Jiang,

333
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,330
I won't look further when you threw a temper yesterday. I have a task for you right now.

334
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,940
The type of task where if you do it well, I can buy you a house.

335
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,470
Everyone.

336
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,780
We need to prepare for battle.

337
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,700
This is a matter of life or death.

338
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,430
I have to take this away too.

339
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,150
From now on, all of your phones and watches

340
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,620
the time on your computers and our office's time announcement system,

341
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,250
change it to ten years after.

342
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,410
Also, tell this to everyone, and don't leave anyone out.

343
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,370
Why are we doing this?

344
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,980
Life is too short, time flies.

345
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,990
Hurry and go.

346
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,990
Where should we even start?

347
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,970
Meng Hui, why didn't you put on makeup today?

348
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:42,660
Everyday, I have to care of the housework and go to work. I also have to manage the relationship of three families. Do I have 48 hours in a day?

349
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,460
I was just asking.

350
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,010
How do I have time?

351
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:50,060
Before, didn't you often say

352
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,420
that you didn't want to magnify your pain?

353
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,690
You didn't want to hurt others. Hence, two hours in advance, you would...

354
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,490
If it was possible, who wouldn't want to live behind a beauty filter?

355
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,370
All you'd have to do is pick out a nice filter and you wouldn't even have to do your makeup.

356
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,130
Everyone yearns for such nice things, but reality is reality.

357
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,340
I'm tired. I no longer care whether it'll hurt your eyes.

358
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,810
Director Meng, here's the coffee.

359
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,450
You're so tired all the time. Do you always rely on coffee to keep you going?

360
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,890
You and Sui An are so close. Why don't you ask him for his employee benefits?

361
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,320
If you got a 20% off, the spots on Xiao Mei's face would've been long gone.

362
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,990
Can you really get a 20% off?

363
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,610
Go to Jiang Jiang to get a discount coupon.

364
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,480
Then how much will be approximately be after the discount?

365
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,310
A few ten thousands of dollars.

366
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,750
It's not the 20% off coupon I need, it's the ten thousands of dollars.

367
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,260
The redesign procedures have been finished and transferred.

368
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,720
You can just sign here.

369
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,830
What? Did your Director Meng have a dream again?

370
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,140
She even dreamed of ten years later.

371
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,820
You...

372
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,800
Director Meng.

373
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,200
You...

374
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,750
Good morning.

375
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,070
Why are you here?

376
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,860
Wasn't I always here?

377
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,960
If there's nothing then I'll go get working.

378
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,110
Okay. Send the files to my office later.

379
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,740
Okay.

380
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,250
Didn't I tell you to leave? I thought I told you clearly. Why are you still here?

381
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,650
I... I just wanted to help you.

382
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,510
I don't need it.

383
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,580
Shen Yi, she already knows that I'm here.

384
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,660
You can explain that she remembered it incorrectly.

385
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,380
Don't worry. Once you overcome this obstacle then I'll leave immediately.

386
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,490
I just want to use this method to make up the harm that I made towards you and Meng Hui.

387
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,600
It better be like that.

388
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,920
Director Shen, don't worry. I already took care of the time on the documents.

389
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,840
We have all time traveled together.

390
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,340
President Shen, this is the finance report.

391
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,220
Bring it over.

392
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,430
Oh.

393
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,950
What year is it?

394
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,520
Of course it's 2030.

395
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,960
Director Xu,

396
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,660
as the person in- charge of sales, can you explain to me

397
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,770
why did our results shrink to those from ten years ago?

398
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,730
I...

399
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,870
These kinds of things would've been worth of praise if we were in 2020.

400
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:48,590
But to give this to me now, are you trying to ridicule me or ridicule yourself?

401
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,840
What she said is right!

402
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,930
Vice-President Xu, please go write a detailed explanation immediately.

403
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:01,080
Okay, I will adjust it.

404
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:07,670
Director Shen, Director Meng, this is the sample for market research.

405
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,380
Bring it to me. Will he be able to understand?

406
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,960
This mermaid pink was popular ten years ago.

407
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,430
Are you leading your staff to do this half-heartedly or is this just for show?

408
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,800
This color is trending right now.

409
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,890
It's been ten years and the company has nothing new.

410
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,640
Are you trying to deceive me by telling me it's trending?

411
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,450
Director Meng, it's like this.

412
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,560
Trends are recycling. It's a circle.

413
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,310
What was trending ten years ago is trending again.

414
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,100
That's right.

415
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,100
Is this what they call bringing back retro?

416
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,300
- That's right.
- That's right.

417
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,210
Bringing break retro, I approved this plan.

418
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,730
If there's anything then tell me. Don't put them in a hard position.

419
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,020
Director Shen and Director Meng,

420
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,370
This is the progress of our research on the scar-fading serum. Please sign here.

421
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,660
Did you open it before?

422
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,480
Of course I did. Don't worry.

423
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,460
Everything else I can tolerate, but it's been ten years and we still haven't developed a scar-fading serum?

424
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,640
Director Xu,

425
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,830
don't you always brag about how you're capable and efficient, and that there's nothing you can't do? Where is the scar-fading serum?

426
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,560
- I—
- Thank you.

427
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,710
Jiang Jiang.

428
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,190
How much is your salary now?

429
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,000
I-It's just like that.

430
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,250
Still no increase? It's been ten years and your salary still hasn't increased?

431
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:42,380
These matters regarding human resources... why are you asking me?

432
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,640
I'll increase it.

433
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,020
Jiang Jiang, from tomorrow on you'll have a double salary.

434
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,000
Double salary.

435
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,770
Why aren't you happy?

436
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,300
Director Meng, my salary goes up

437
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,510
and goes down multiple times.

438
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,560
I am already... no longer moved.

439
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,830
How about this? You'll be my assistant from now on.

440
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,150
What?

441
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,960
What about me?

442
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,740
It's fine.

443
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,240
Director Meng, Miss Wei Lei will be arriving shortly for the marketing photoshoot.

444
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,030
It's already been ten years. She's still the spokesperson?

445
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,630
This... can be changed.

446
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,880
That's all for today. Please implement everything after you leave.

447
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,180
Okay. Okay, Director Meng.

448
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,150
You have maintained yourself quite well. Is it because you've been single this whole time?

449
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,680
It's been ten years and I didn't handle Sui An.

450
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,280
Then do you two have a result?

451
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,890
We don't.

452
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:51,610
But Shen Yi and I are about to have a result.

453
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,680
Director Meng, Director Shen, the wedding planner is here to confirm the procession of events for the wedding.

454
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,390
Right.

455
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,880
I gave up sleep and skipped all my meals to prepare this

456
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,900
new proposal.

457
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,270
What marriage proposal?

458
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,490
I'm sorry. I overlooked the most important thing.

459
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,370
What does this mean?

460
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,960
Meng Hui, that...

461
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,120
Meng Hui, look. We already got married for ten years.

462
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,380
Meng Hui, you might think that our wedding is as bland as water, but I think

463
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,960
it's like we got married for a month.

464
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,740
You know my biggest regret

465
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,810
is that our marriage was too rush and I didn't give you a wedding

466
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,430
so I secretly prepared a gift. I hope you'll like it.

467
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,930
Look. I changed the date to ten years ago.

468
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,810
What's the situation here?

469
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,920
It's fine.

470
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,420
What kind of surprises could there possibly be?

471
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,030
What marriage? Divorce.

472
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,730
Are you joking around? Our relationship is fine,

473
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,910
why would we get a divorce?

474
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,600
Shen Yi, there's no use in saying all this.

475
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,710
Can't you tell?

476
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,270
I have no more feelings for you.

477
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,730
Stop tormenting yourself, Shen Yi.

478
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,330
In these ten years, you've already made up for everything you owed me.

479
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,550
I can't divorce you.

480
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,750
We both know there is no love between us.

481
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,800
The foundation of our marriage lies on the scar on my face.

482
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:12,260
You married me to make it up to me, but it's already been ten years.

483
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,360
Our life is dull and meaningless,

484
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,370
and both of us can't stand the sight of each other.

485
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,910
If we keep on going like this, we're going to end up hating each other.

486
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,200
It's not true that I can't get used to looking at you.

487
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,180
I really do love you.

488
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,870
How can you prove it?

489
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,450
This is where we kissed. Do you still remember?

490
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:55,210
We confirmed our relationship here and you even confessed to me.

491
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,040
This is the place I would visit whenever I was unhappy.

492
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,440
Then let's go somewhere else.

493
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,200
Look, after ten years, even the ferris wheel is tired of turning.

494
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,830
Do you still remember this claw machine?

495
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,320
Pikachu is your favorite.

496
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,910
But Shen Yi, after all these years,

497
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,680
you still haven't won a single doll for me.

498
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,280
You even brought a claw machine home.

499
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,170
But you never caught a single doll.

500
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:18,930
Okay.

501
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,730

Meng Hui, what are you doing?

522
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,500
I'm going to a hotel.

523
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,680
How could I feel at ease if you go to a hotel on your own?

524
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,980
If there's anything you want to say, let's discuss it at home.

525
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,890
Shen Yi, I'm honestly fed up with this marriage.

526
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,170
Let's not torment ourselves over remorse.

527
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,960
T-Then I'll move out. You go home.

528
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,260
I already packed up all my stuff. How much of a hassle do you want to cause?

529
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,780
Fine.

530
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,790
But don't go to a hotel. I won't feel at ease.

Meng Hui–

532
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,270
I've caused you trouble yet again.

533
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,650
No problem.

534
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,510
You're doing it again. Every time I come find you, you agree to all my requests.

535
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:10,230
Don't you know how to reject? Even biological siblings fight and bicker.

536
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,780
Why do you never have a temper?

537
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:23,890
I'm starting to understand how Meng Hui feels.

538
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,140
She can't distinguish whether my feelings towards her are love or guilt.

539
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:33,470
Just like how I can't tell whether you see me as your brother

540
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,530
or you're just trying to compensate me.

541
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:43,570
If we had met by chance,

542
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,540
I would've easily forgiven you, but all these years,

543
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,900
I considered you as my brother.

544
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,120
No matter what the circumstances are, the first person I think of is you.

545
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,990
I don't want to see you ever again. Every time I see you,

546
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,330
I will be reminded of

547
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,980
how I  considered you as my brother.

548
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,370
I really don't know how I can prove it to you.

549
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,160
Me neither.

550
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,120
She thinks you don't love her.

551
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,440
No matter how I explain, she won't listen. She keeps arguing with me.

552
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,830
It's because you lied to her.

553
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,800
So her problem this time is that she suspects

554
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,850
whether the love between you two ever existed at all.

555
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,700
It's all my fault.

556
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:59,040
You have to take responsibility for your faults. You can't run away.

557
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,170
What do you mean?

558
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,910
It's already very obvious.

559
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,470
Her wish this time is to get a divorce.

560
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,230
She can't keep going on like this any longer.

561
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,440
You have to fulfill her wish in order for her to recover.

562
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,620
That's impossible. We've only been married for a month.

563
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,790
Then you have to decide whether your marriage is more important

564
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,200
or Meng Hui's mental state.

565
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,600
Of course... of course they're both important.

566
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,610
Is there really no win-win solution?

- No.
- No.

Can't we sign already?

573
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,500
There's an unexpected situation that has come up.

574
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,350
I didn't notice this until I reviewed the documents this morning.

575

If one of the two parties involved has any mental disorders,

576
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,600
then the procedure is a bit more complicated,

577
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,110
and the process will take awhile. I hope you two can understand.

578
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:36,120
Mental disorder? What mental disorder?
