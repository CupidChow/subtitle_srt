[Song: What's wrong with being imperfect?]
[By: Huang Yali]

00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,610
♫  In the crescent moon lives a daydreaming girl  ♫

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,340
♫  In dreams smiling sweetly like cotton candy  ♫

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,750
♫  Ignite the fairy stick and close your eyes, wait for him to appear  ♫

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,520
♫  A boy shared his thoughts to the tree hole  ♫

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,320
♫  Fall down and get back up, look up to the blue sky  ♫

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,390
♫  Put on a suit and become the knight she wants  ♫

9
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,210
♫  Who hasn't been hurt before?  ♫

♫ Wounds can turn into strength  ♫

♫  What's wrong with being imperfect?  ♫

♫  After rain it becomes sunny, meeting the light  ♫

♫  Being imperfect is also beautiful;
with just half a pair of wings can also soar high ♫

[Episode 6: Hand Cream, Care in Silence]

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,610
Isn't your counseling appointment for next week? Why are you here today?

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,410
I have a class reunion in a couple days.

22
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,360
Aren't reunions a happy occasion?

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,520
Looking at your expression, it looks like you're going to a memorial service.

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,910
Do you have a secret crush on a classmate?

25
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,780
No? If you don't even have a secret crush, how did you get through that period in your youth?

26
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,430
I was ridiculed.

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,790
That's okay. You can talk to me about it.

28
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,040
I was a late developer when I was younger.

29
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,530
Later than other kids my age.

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,470
No, not that. Look up.

31
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,500
When I was in middle school, everyone began to develop an Adam's apple. As for voice changing,

32
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,770
I was the only one who didn't change. They all said I was a girl.

33
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,130
I spoke with a soft tone and that I have delicate skin and a fair complexion.

34
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,850
I can't carry heavyweights. When I was in P.E. class, all the other boys could run 800 meters.

35
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,120
They had me stay with the girls and do sit-ups. It was the same for the New Year's Day performances.

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,130
Everyone else could perform as a prince or soldiers. They made me play Snow White Princess.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,350
- Acting as a princess?
- That was going too far, wasn't it?

38
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,900
I played a prince.

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,180
Later, when I got into high school, my Adam's apple had grown.

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,900
But all my friends around me began to grow beards. But I didn't.

41
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,250
So, every evening I secretly used slices of ginger on my chin.

42
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,330
But I didn't start to grow a beard. But I lost two layers of skin.

43
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,540
I have one now. I shave twice a day.

44
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,740
Then what?

45
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,990
Then, I  finally got to university, and a beard began to grown.

46
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,160
But... they... they...

47
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,930
Wait a minute. I suddenly don't want to know.

48
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,860
They started to boast about having leg hair.

49
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,010
Even now, I don't have it.

50
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,400
Why would you want to compete with that?

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
Do you feel inferior because of that?

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,850
But now you're all adults. Relax. They won't compete in that at a reunion.

53
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,100
No. Think about it.

54
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,040
When they were studying, this group competed over Adam's apples, beards, leg hair.

55
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,030
They felt superior by looking for ways to put me down.

56
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,800
Now that we've entered society and the workplace, how will they compete?

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,050
Then, you could not go. You can ignore them.

58
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,240
But, they're always after me. I can't refuse them every time.

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,940
Doesn't your boss have two cars, cars that are like those in the movies?

60
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,670
One is a Porsche, one's a Ferrari.

61
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,130
It's time to strut.

62
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,450
Are you saying...?

63
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,200
That's right. If I promise only to use it for half a day and fill it up with gas,

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,970
he'll definitely loan one to me.

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,440
I really do like your boss' personality, the way he's so easily motivated by money.

66
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,680
You're buying coffee during work hours?

67
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,090
Jiang Jiang, have I been too soft on you recently...

68
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,670
Thank you.

69
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,630
Not only coffee but also lunch and dessert.

70
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,990
A new place opened near the hospital.

71
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,260
I think it's really good food.

72
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,570
Are you deliberately keeping yourself super busy recently?

73
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,960
I...

74
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,970
I'm afraid if I have free time, I'll think of her.

75
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,750
According to what you said, satisfying her wish would be good for her.

76
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,760
But I realized that what she wants is very little.

77
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,170
She's too easy to satisfy.

78
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,470
- That shows that she's very happy right now.
- But I want to give her more happiness.

79
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,070
This greater happiness... give it to her personally.

80
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,660
What is this?

81
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,350
Professor Smith's appointment card. I've arranged it for you.

82
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,350
A complete repair of the scar isn't possible, but we can do our best to fix it.

83
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,330
Right now, I don't know how I can thank you.

84
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,690
This is my obligation.

85
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,730
No, it's not. You absolutely have no obligation to do so much for me.

86
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
Sui An, for so many years,

87
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,800
if it weren't for your support,

88
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,900
I really don't know how I would have survived.

89
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,490
Every person has their own difficulties. You're helping me too.

90
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,200
I came here for a particular matter.

91
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,590
Hurry and think about how you're going to tell Meng Hui the good news.

92
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,310
Seeing both of you happy... that makes me really happy too.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,430
I'm sorry. I haven't finished here. I'll be finished soon.

94
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,290
Jiang Jiang told me that today you're going to look at the sales situation for new products.

95
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,820
No problem. Do what you need to do. I'll wait for you to get here.

96
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,630
Bye bye.

97
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,800
Welcome.

98
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,780
[¥96,340]

99
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,430
Such high-tech skin care products. One set for almost ¥100,000.

100
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,360
That's over the top.

101
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,700
Hello, Miss. We've applied for a patent on these ingredients.

102
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,740
- We haven't—
- Enough. Give your little excuses

103
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,410
to someone else. The brand I usually use

104
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,690
would be better than this. And it's not that expensive.

105
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,880
This product really is really effective. It uses multiple layers of liposome

106
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,460
- intensifying technology...
- Who are you? A nanny?

107
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,560
- Meng Hui.
- President Xu. Long time no see.

108
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,530
That's true. Long time no see. What?

109
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,660
You're now using this type of luxury skin care products?

110
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,320
I don't use formal wear. But I did use the sample. It really is very effective.

111
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,230
Is there a sample. Give me one. I'll see if it's effective.

112
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:38,040
I'm sorry, ma'am. We don't have samples for our luxury skin care products.

113
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,440
Meng Hui, I think you used to earn very little.

114
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,610
How is it that now there are more problems with vanity?

115
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,380
I heard that after you resigned, you went to do some sort of self-promotion thing in media.

116
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,210
If that doesn't work out,

117
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,770
why don't you come back and work for me?

118
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,840
No. I really did use their sample.

119
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,500
Enough. Don't boast. It's no use to say that you've used it.

120
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,680
- Is it necessary to try to show off in front of me?
- You're wrong.

121
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,510
There are samples of this product.

122
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,190
If there are samples, why don't you give me one?

123
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,900
Because samples are for those who use this product line. They're just given to one person.

124
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,350
Who are you?

125
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,030
Director Shen, hello.

126
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,470
This is our LS company's CEO, Shen Yi.

127
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,360
If he says we have it, we do. If he says to just give it to one person, then we just give it to one person.

128
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,820
Let's go. Let's go eat.

129
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,770
Take care, Director Shen.

130
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,910
How about we order a sweethearts meal for two? Take a look.

131
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,100
Uh... okay.

132
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,860
I think the dessert is too flashy, the sashimi is too cold,

133
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,550
the steak is too greasy. And this cheese has too many calories.

134
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,350
Why don't we just eat a vegetarian dinner? You like vegetables and it's better for your health.

135
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,980
Okay.

136
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,030
We'll take one vegetarian dinner and one sweetheart meal.

137
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,440
That's not what I meant.

138
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,030
- It's not good for health to not eat meat.
- But we can't finish all that.

139
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,190
- If we can't finish it, we can...
- Bag the leftovers?

140
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,230
I'll bag the leftovers. You can't eat leftovers.

141
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,840
Thank you.

142
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,940
Hello, everyone. Today is a very special day.

143
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,460
It's our tenth anniversary celebration. In order to thank our new and old customers,

144
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,310
next, we'll hold a lottery.

145
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,980
Does everyone like this surprise?

146
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,300
- Yes!
- What is going on here?

147
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,670
It might be one of the restaurant's marketing strategies.

148
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,150
Okay. Then, next what we'll draw for

149
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,420
is third prize. A set of LS boyfriend facial creams.

150
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,590
That is very difficult to find. I've tried to buy it many times and haven't been able to get it.

151
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,670
No problem. I can get you a set.

152
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,200
Let's congratulate table #1.

153
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,500
I really envy them. I never won a giveaway before.

154
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
I've never won those Weibo lucky draw events either.

155
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,400
I would only buy five dollars at most for lottery tickets.

156
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
It's fine. You'll have a chance.

157
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
We're picking the second winner now.

158
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,800
It is LS company's complete color lipstick set.

159
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,800
How come it's all your company's products?

160
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,700
Because our company's products are of high quality.

161
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,310
Of course, a good restaurant must be paired with good products.

162
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,600
Now, next is the special prize that everyone wants,

163
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,400
the present is... we'll keep it a secret first

164
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,000
but who's this lucky person?

165
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Let's congratulate table #7!

166
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,200
Congratulations!

167
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,700
You finally won. Take a look.

168
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,800
[Appointment with Dr Smith]

169
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,200
Do you like it?

170
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,260
I really like it.

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,200
I'll let Jiang Jiang drive the car over and I'll send you home.

172
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,800
It's fine. Let's take a walk.

173
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,300
Okay, let's walk then.

174
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
Thank you.

175
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Would you do the surgery?

176
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,000
I will. I heard that doctor is very amazing.

177
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,400
There's no such skill in our country.

178
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,000
Perhaps my scar can really be recovered this time.

179
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,600
Then... are you happy?

180
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
I'm happy.

181
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I feel like I've been luckier after meeting you.

182
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm not that good as what you say I am.

183
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Have you been bullied because of having that scar?

184
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,600
No.

185
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,100
You're lying.

186
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,000
It's fine. I'm used to it.

187
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,100
Used to what?

188
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,700
When I didn't know how to do makeup before.

189
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,800
When people see it, a lot of people turn their eyes away as their first reaction.

190
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,600
Some might think my scar looks ugly.

191
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,600
But I know that more people felt sorry for me.

192
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,100
They have good intentions and don't want to hurt me.

193
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,800
Is that really how you think?

194
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,300
Then did you never get upset because you had that scar?

195
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,600
That's the past. I'm fine now.

196
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
How could you be fine?

197
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,600
It must of hurt back then.

198
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Have you heard of someone that is one hundred percent perfect in this world?

199
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,000
No.

200
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If a girl has a nice family background,

201
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
temper, look good and has good luck,

202
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
then that's a one hundred percent girl.

203
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,800
But there's no one who is one hundred percent perfect.

204
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
This girl doesn't exist.

205
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
But in order for God to keep such a girl,

206
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,200
he made a tiny mark on her face,

207
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
and detect one percent.

208
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,200
From one hundred percent, they've become ninety-nine percent.

209
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,800
They can continue being happy without being worried

210
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,900
so I'm that ninety-nine percent girl.

211
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,200
He was being serious and told me.

212
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,800
Perhaps it's because our products are good.

213
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
You should've seen his expression during that time.

214
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,200
He doesn't know how to lie at all.

215
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,700
Why is he so cute?

216
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,500
He was beating around the bush and arranged a giveaway.

217
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,800
Don't you think he's so warm,

218
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
tender and considerate?

219
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,600
I also researched it already.

220
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,700
It's hard to make an appointment for Professor Smith's surgery.

221
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,800
I wonder how much effort he put in so that I can do the surgery.

222
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,700
He really is thoughtful then.

223
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,000
Right?

224
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Don't you think he's treating me this well because he likes me?

225
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Shen Yi is afraid that I'll feel pressured if I'm his friend.

226
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
He gave lots of takeaway coupons and samples too.

227
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
He's using a method to not disturb me and secretly treats me well.

228
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't you think he's thoughtful and kind?

229
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
There are times where I think

230
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,000
in my past life, how many galaxies did I save so

231
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,600
that I can change it into a Shen Yi this lifetime.

232
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
What does he like about me?

233
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
You're talented.

234
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,000
You're sincere, cute, and kind.

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,400
That's what makes you valuable.

236
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
So I think God really takes care of me.

237
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,200
He took about some things but gave me an even bigger present.

238
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,900
For example, you and Shen Yi.

239
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,300
Then will you get together with him?

240
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,600
Let's wait until the surgery ends.

241
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,200
Even though I know he doesn't mind my scar,

242
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
but I hope I can show up beautifully in front of him

243
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,800
and then tell him loudly, "I know you like me

244
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,000
and I also like you."

245
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,600
- When is this even from?
- It's not as good as this kind.

246
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,900
Meng Hui, you're back. Have a seat.

247
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Sit.

248
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Is there something wrong?

249
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
I... I want to request for a leave.

250
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Why are you so courteous for? I already told you

251
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
to treat this place like your home.

252
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
Come and go whenever you like.

253
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
Don't be courteous.

254
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
Are you guys busy?

255
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
We're short on hands.

256
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,700
Wei Lei's nose really is...

257
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,200
What's wrong with Wei Lei's nose?

258
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,600
Can't be cured.

259
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
Isn't prosthetic correction a really small surgery?

260
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
No, no.

261
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,000
We asked and she did her nose a few times already.

262
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,600
I heard this time that all of the experts around the world won't accept it.

263
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,800
The crux is the resurrection. I have already made the arrangement.

264
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,200
I think right now

265
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,700
this is not the problem. If the face is ruined...

266
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,000
Don't you know how important their face is to a woman?

267
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You don't know how much Wei Lei tried to make her nose beautiful!

268
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,500
Don't you know if you ruin someone's face you will...

269
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,100
so guilty!

270
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,800
[Leave application]

271
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,800
You guys work and I'll get going.

00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
- Okay. You're leaving?
- You're leaving?

273

This one.

274
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,800
This one won't do.

275
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Is this the place where she'll get her surgery done?

276
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,400
Will the surgery be safe? Is there any risks?

277
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,800
Don't worry, Professor Smith is the best.

278
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,200
His surgeries are always ninety percent and higher.

279
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,800
His team is also the most skilled. With him doing this surgery, there shouldn't be a problem.

280
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,600
What about the equipment and facilities? Are they up-to-date?

281
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,800
It's the newest here.

282
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,000
What about the medicines? Do they need to be imported in advance?

283
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Shen Yi, you're too nervous.

284
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,800
How can I not be nervous?

285
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
In two days, I have to attend a medical conference. Afterward, I will immediately come back.

286
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,600
I'll tell you the result then, okay?

287
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
Okay.

288
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,100
Are you really not going to come with Meng Hui?

289
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't dare to keep her company.

290
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,200
I can only be like now and think about how she'll be when she does the surgery.

291
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Say, if the scar on her face completely disappears

292
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,800
then will it be over between us?

293
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,400
The impediment between us

294
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,700
will disappear. Everything will be over.

295
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,200
Shen Yi, you should look ahead.

296
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,500
If you think what you did isn't enough,

297
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,400
then you keep treating her well in a different way.

298
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
Give her what she wants, fulfill her wishes,

299
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,500
help her overcome her obstacles, and always keep her company.

300
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,800
Is it useful doing that?

301
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,400
It's useful.

302
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,400
I've always been like this.

303
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,800
You made a mistake and also hurt someone?

304
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,800
On this world, there isn't anyone who made no mistakes.

305
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,300
Once it happened, all you can do is make it up.

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,200
Hello, this is Li Mei Plastic Surgery Hospital.

308
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,800
I want to ask, has Professor Smith's surgery started yet?

309
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,200
May I ask, you are...

310
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,800
I... I'm the patient's friend.

311
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,400
I just want to understand the situation.

312
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,200
The surgery is successful. Don't worry.

313

Right now, the operation is currently ending. The anesthesia has not worn off yet.

314
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,000
You can leave your phone number behind and we'll tell the patient when she wakes up.

315
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,700
No need. It's good that everything was successful.

316
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,800
You guys worked hard.

317
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,040
- Is the surgery finished?
- It's finished for a while.

318
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,480
Come in.

319
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,970
Doctor Sui?

320
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,490
How come it's you?

321
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,440
How come it can't be me?

322
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,070
You just got surgery from Professor Smith?

323
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,640
Yes, it's the one that Professor Smith personally did.

324
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,140
Professor Smith only has one surgery in China.

325
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,510
He's going back today. You stole Meng Hui's opportunity to have the surgery.

326
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,160
Tell me, what about her face?

327
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,020
What do you mean?

328
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,090
Someone notified me and I did it. How did I know who's appointment it was for?

329
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,580
You're too selfish. I told you that I'll think of a solution for your nose.

330
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,030
Think of a solution? This is an opportunity that my nose can one hundred percent recover.

331
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:41,670
I can only see it get worse everyday. Meng Hui's face is a face

332
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:46,390
but mine not? Is this what a doctor should say?

333
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,750
I lost control of myself. You should rest.

334
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,950
Wait a second.

335
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,000
What you said just then was that my surgery

336
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,460
was given by Meng Hui?

337
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,960
Shen Yi, the trip to United Kingdom for the research on liquid foundation has been brought forward.

338
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,260
So our flight is at 1 pm today.

339
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,460
I already saw the contract and there isn't any problems. You can confirm it again.

340
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,320
Furthermore, they've already received the deposit.

341
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,730
But I haven't packed up anything yet.

342
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,060
There's still time. Why don't I bring you home so that you can pack up?

343
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,550
Okay. Go make preparations.

344
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,980
Okay, then you should make the most out of the time.

345
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,280
[Sui An]

346
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,040
Hello Sui An.

347
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,530
The hospital created a mess. The person who did the surgery was Wei Lei

348
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,370
and not Meng Hui.

349
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,620
What did you say?

350
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,700
It's all my fault that I didn't handle all of this.

351
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,990
Meng Hui gave her opportunity for the surgery to Wei Lei.

352
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,210
Don't worry, I'll keep inviting Doctor Smith. He'll come tomorrow.

353
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,960
What's wrong?

354
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,060
I have an urgent matter now, so I can't go to England. Please take care of it for me.

355
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,020
Wait a second.

356
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,830
Do you know how important this collaboration is?

357
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,240
All of our competitors are keeping an eye on this formula.

358
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,330
This is the best liquid foundation right now.

359
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,060
It's something that you've always wanted. What on earth is more important than this?

360
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,540
Is it because of Meng Hui?

361
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,550
She needs me right now.

362
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,120
Shen Yi, you're the CEO of LS Group. They only want to sign the contract with you.

363
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,990
If you don't go then we'll lose this last chance for the liquid foundation.

364
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,930
We can't get our money back either. It's ¥5,000,000!

365
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,250
I also need you.

366
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:36,460
There's no point of making this liquid foundation.

367
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,300
Hello, Director. Did Meng Hui go to work?

368
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,820
Send me her address now.

369
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,430
Meng Hui!

370
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,460
Meng Hui, are you there?

371
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,940
Meng Hui!

372
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,840
Meng Hui, where did you go? You weren't at home and didn't answer your phone.

373
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,240
I went to buy food. I think I left my phone at home.

374
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,510
What's wrong? Does the show need me? I'll go back immediately.

375
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,990
No need. Go back home and rest.

376
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,760
This should be the time when the show is short in hands.

377
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,030
I'll go back.

378
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,120
I'll go with you.

379
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,050
I have to wait until the surgery finishes and tell me out loud

380
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,540
that "I know you like me, I also like you."

381
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,280
♫  The girl  ♫

382
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:18,990
♫ in the mirror is still the same  ♫

383
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:27,300
♫ Naive and also different  ♫

384
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:34,300
♫  The mood is placed in a spacious suitcase. Forgotten. ♫

385
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,920
♫  The moon that shined yesterday  ♫

386
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:45,830
♫  No one knows my pain ♫

387
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,930
♫ How drilling, painful and long it is  ♫

388
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:57,060
♫  I have already forgiven, a little forgiveness  ♫

389
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,380
♫  The long distance train has departed  ♫

390
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:08,230
♫  Taking a hot air balloon in the night sky  ♫

391
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,830
Let's not ride the bus in the future.

392
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:17,870
♫  Scars of time are gifts, Stop having future regrets  ♫

393
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
What's up, Director Shen.

394
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,530
It seems like she has chickenpox. Her face is so scary.

395
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,890
She won't spread it to us right? Let's hurry and leave.

396
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,250
Don't cry. I don't know how to console others.

397
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,600
Don't worry, I'm fine.

398
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,660
Why did you come here? I almost couldn't catch up to you.

399
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,240
I would come here when I'm in a bad mood

400
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,050
and then my mood would get better soon.

401
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,320
Then what happened to your face?

402
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,810
These chickenpox might leave scars.

403
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,330
What happens if people laugh at me?

404
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,220
If you're afraid that people will laugh at you then

405
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,360
use the scarf. That way, no one can see you.

406
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,100
No one can see me now.

407
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,320
Thank you.

408
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,650
Do you feel better after watching the stars?

409
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,400
Thank you,

410
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,100
for putting down your work to accompany me. You must be very busy, right?

411
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:50,200
Why... did you give up such an important surgery?

412
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,400
It is very hard to make a surgery appointment with Professor  Smith.

413
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,500
Who knows how long we have to line up for next time.

414
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Wei Lei is different from me.

415
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,200
She spent so much to become pretty.

416
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,300
You know how important her face is to her.

417
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,200
If it really was because of me that

418
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,000
ruined her beauty, even if I wasn't the one who did it,

419
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,900
I would live the rest of my life in remorse and guilt.

420
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,800
Is this not what you told me before?

421
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,200
I don't want to become someone I hate.

422
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,000
I really envy Wei Lei. She is so pretty.

423
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,400
I do not wish her to be the same as me.

424
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,430
I am fine. Don't worry.

425
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
I understand your good to me.

426
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,600
I also know you like me.

427
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,600
It's just that I don't have the courage to accept you.

428
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,400
I was thinking after I turned pretty,

429
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,800
then I will hurry and go confess to you.

430
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
But now I feel like

431
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,400
appearance and love itself have nothing to do with each other.

432
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,600
I know you are good to me.

433
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,900
I also know everything you did for me.

434
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,400
I saw it in my eyes and kept it in my heart.

435
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Meng Hui, let's be together.

436
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,400
The scar on your face...

437
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,200
cannot get rid of my good to you.

438
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,400
- Drink some!
- No, no, no.

439
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,600
What are you doing?

440
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,400
- Okay, okay.
- You are so good at drinking.

441
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
You are not lacking. Really something.

442
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,600
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Here, here, here.

443
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,200
If you can drink alcohol, then don't drink the juice.

444
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,000
- That's right. We finally got to get together.
- No, I am driving today.

445
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,800
Thank you.

446
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,500
Drink more. Drink more, okay?

447
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,600
My god, we haven't seen each other for so long.

448
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,400
We really haven't seen each other for so long.

449
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
Jiang Jiang?

450
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,800
You sure can. Have one?

451
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,200
I don't smoke.

452
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,300
How are you a man if you don't smoke?

453
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,400
I heard you get along well.

454
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,000
We haven't seen each other for so long, isn't it?

455
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Come, come sit. Sit.

456
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
Here, here, here.

457
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
What's keeping you busy recently?

458
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Nothing. I'm busy making money. What else could it be?

459
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,000
Here, here, here.

460
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,400
Okay, okay.

461
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,700
I have many cars at home.

462
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,000
Let me say, what car did you drove here?

463
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
I rode a bus to here.

464
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,000
Bus?

465
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,800
Wearing a suit riding a bus?

466
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,200
So respectable.

467
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
Can five or six people really do anything for protection of the environment?

468
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,800
When you take it off, you really look like a junior foreman.

469
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,800
Are you still an assistant at that cosmetic company?

470
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,600
Yes, I am the CEO's special assistant.

471
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,000
Special assistant? Isn't that still an assistant?

472
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,200
Isn't it?

473
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,600
You're not young.

474
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,200
Can't be an assistant for life, doing trivial stuff.

475
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,600
That's right.

476
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,800
Look at your skinny body.

477
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,400
Women like men with more meat on their bones for more security.

478
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,400
If you got nothing to do, go to the gym and go for a run.

479
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,800
Look at how interesting his estimate is. There's no way he can make up for it.

480
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,200
With his body,

481
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,000
who knows if he has a girlfriend or not?

482
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,800
It makes no difference whether he works out.

483
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
I have a girlfriend.

484
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
He has makeup on too.

485
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,600
Here, here, here.

486
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,400
- Let's drink ours.
- Oh right.

487
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,000
Jiang Jiang, can you go ask the waiter for two chairs?

488
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,200
Okay, please wait.

489
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
It's still the same as before.

490
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Isn't that so? He has a fate with the service staff.

491
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,000
Cheers!

492
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,600
Today, I should have found an excuse to not come.

493
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,600
I wore a formal suit and they even said that I am weaker than a woman.

494
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,900
I'm wearing a shirt.

495
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,600
And they said after working for years, I'm still an errand boy.

496
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Anyway, no matter what I say, they will still go criticize me. Based on the attitude today,

497
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,200
this receipt... I'm also paying again.

498
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,200
Say, you should just resign.

499
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,800
Look at my company.

500
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,000
Though it's small but has a great prospect.

501
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,400
Come to work for me.

502
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,800
Be my assistant. Better than that Shen...

503
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,400
Shen... Shen... what was his name?

504
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Comparing to ours, ours is not bad.

505
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,200
I heard

506
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,200
his boss is very stingy. Way too stingy.

507
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,400
Or else why would you not have a car or a home by now?

508
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Look at me.

509
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,300
I am assigned as a financial consultant for a big client.

510
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,200
I earned more than you have that year.

511
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,000
Honestly, I like the job I have right now.

512
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Our boss is good to me.

513
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,200
You are like a nanny.

514
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,800
And working 24/7...

515
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Look at me. That client was

516
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,400
young and beautiful and awfully rich too.

517
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,200
She gives me 1 million yuan each year to handle her financial investments.

518
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,800
The main point is that I make money on my own.

519
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,400
Now, look at you again. Look at others.

520
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,000
You're not making progress at all. What's going to happen in the future?

521
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
We all say this for your own good.

522
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,400
That's right.

523
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,300
Excuse me, who is Mr. Jiang Jiang?

524
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,200
Me. I am.

525
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,600
Mr. Shen Yi told me to give this to you.

526
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,400
He said that for all the years at LS accompanying him,

527
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,800
together with the development of the company. You are just like a hand cream

528
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
which is indispensable and irreplaceable.

529
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,100
He drove a Porsche but it was confiscated and borrowed by him.

530
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,200
So today's meal, he is treating.

531
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,000
Great, great.

532
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,000
How much is the bill?

533
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,400
This— Isn't this his card?

534
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,800
Mr. Shen said it. This card is yours now.

535
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,300
You can spend however much you want. There's no password.

536
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
There's no password!

537
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
How much is it? I'll use the card.

538
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,800
What else did our Director Shen say?

539
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,200
- Yes. There are some more things.
- Tell me without missing a single word.

540
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,600
Don't miss any punctuation at all. Read it.

541
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,800
Open brackets. "Don't exceed 228 yuan per person."

542
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,000
"It's hard to report the expenses."

543
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Exclamation mark, exclamation mark. Close bracket.

544
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,800
Leave, leave, leave.

545
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,100
I can't anymore! I can't!

546
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,600
What is this? Employee welfare?

547
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,000
I say your boss sure is creative.

548
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Exactly.

549
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's a small result of his hard work. Is this considered an accomplishment?

550
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,800
Say, how will you solve your major events in life?

551
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,800
You might as well stay single.

552
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,400
So what if I don't have a girlfriend?

553
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,800
With his personality, he is meant to be single forever.

554
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,400
- Yes, forever alone!
- You're right.

555
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,600
I am his girlfriend.

556
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,600
So? Am I not pretty enough?

557
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
Or is my house not enough to live?

558
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,200
How not enough cars to drive?

559
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,000
Or am I not earning enough money?

560
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,900
You even let other people say that you're single?

561
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,400
Sorry everyone, I came late.

562
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,000
It's fine, it's fine.

563
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
N- No, you're not late.

564
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,600
Let's go.

565
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,300
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by My Girl Team @ Viki.com

566
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,800
We never thought what a hand cream could do,

567
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,000
because it is too quiet.

568
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,800
However, when his good qualities shined

569
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,600
but when his qualities gradually appear, you realize  his protection is not lacking.

570
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,600
♫  Unable to escape, Unable to retreat  ♫

571

♫  I have long been used to this chaotic world  ♫
