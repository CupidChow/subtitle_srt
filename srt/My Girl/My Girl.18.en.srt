[Episode 18: Just like the truth will come out, makeup will come off]

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,200
Xiao Shen, you came to buy groceries with your girlfriend today.

22
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,160
Two potatoes.

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,880
These green beans.

24
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,700
One piece of tofu.

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,900
One piece of garlic.

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
Auntie, one piece of garlic.

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,100
Will a radish do?

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,400
The radish at the other stall is crunchier.

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,600
What about cabbage?

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,200
The cabbage at the next stall is cheaper.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,000
You're so amazing.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Your total is ¥7.60.

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,200
- That auntie—
- You brought your girlfriend here today. You can't ask me to lower the price this time.

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
Last time, because of 60 cents,

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,800
You stood here for half an hour.

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
I was afraid of you.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,800
T- Then today, I won't try to bargain.

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Auntie, we won't bargain today, but how about you gift us a sprig of green onion?

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,000
You are really predestined for each other.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,600
If I were to do business with you guys everyday, I would go broke.

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,800
No you won't. More or

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,800
less, you still earn some. We'll come often in the future.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,100
Thank you, Auntie.

44
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,100
We're leaving, Auntie.

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Auntie,  I'll take this one.

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
- How much is it?
- Four yuan.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Four yuan.

48
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,600
Let's go.

49
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,000
- Then.
- Let's go home.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
Okay.

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,400
The product I want to recommend today is this CC cream.

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,200
It combines foundation, primer, and skincare into a 3-in-1 product,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,600
but it's slightly less effective than having a separate

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,800
moisturizer, primer, and foundation.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
But for most of us women who go to work every day, this is enough.

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
And the biggest benefit

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,100
is it's quick, efficient, and lightweight.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
To people who are busy with work in daily life,

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
the most important requirement is for it to be quick to apply.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,800
But being fast,

61
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,980
it's even quicker with two people.

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
What did I say?

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,040
Did I interrupt your work?

64
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,860
It's fine.

65
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,200

I was the one who got you drunk.

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
I even cried and confessed to you?

124
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,600
I asked.

125
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,100
I... did I even kiss you?

126
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,700
I let you.

127
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm sorry. I offended you.

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,200

135
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,200
What are you thinking about?

136
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,600
I was thinking in relationship aspects,

Shen Yi.

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
It's too fast. I'm not ready.

144
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Is it fast?

145
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,700
Getting married is like putting on makeup. You can't skip any step.

147
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,800
When two people first meet, that's the skincare step.

148
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,100
Once they get to know each other, that's the primer.

149
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,600
Once you start discussing marriage, that's the foundation.

150
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
You're skipping all the steps.

151
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,400
Then can it be three in one?

152
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
No.

153
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,800
When you were filming your CC cream review, didn't you say speed is an advantage?

154
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,400
But even if there are advantages then there would be shortcomings.

155
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,000
But you promised that you'll marry me.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I did promise you

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
but this is too fast.

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,400
Also, marrying is a matter of the two families.

159
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,200
You met my dad and I met your mom before.

160
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,800
We both know each other's families.

161
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
We also get along with each other's family.

162
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,100
But I feel like something is weird as if something is missing.

163
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,400
But we're already living together right now.

164
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,000
There's no difference from getting married.

165
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,620
It does seem like that.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Do you not want to marry me anymore?

167
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
I do.

168
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Then let's go now.

169
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Shen Yi, it's still too early.

170
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Then let's come in the afternoon.

171
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Forget it. Let's do it.

172
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
Let's go.

173
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
♫  Please take me back now  ♫

174
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,600
I promise I will make you be happy forever.

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,800
♫  How could you deny me that  ♫

176
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,830
- Let's go tell everyone.
- Okay.

177
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,330
Do we have to buy some wedding candy?

178
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,790
- That's right, we have to buy some wedding candy.
- Let's go.

179
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,680
Let's rest for a bit. I'm so tired.

180
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,840
We've spent a day together. We've eaten dinner,

181
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,100
and watched the stars. It's time to go home.

182
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,090
Besides eating, hiking, and watching the stars,

183
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,080
don't you have anything else planned for the day?

184
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,670
The recovery period for the face slimming injection you got hasn't passed yet.

185
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,270
I recommend that you go home and rest.

186
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,840
Looks like I'll have to call for the car to be towed.

187
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,370
It's fine. We can take another walk.

188
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,930
Is this your plan too?

189
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,850
No, it's outside of my expectation.

190
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,600
If you've had enough, let's go home. There should be one last bus at the base of the mountain.

191
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

192
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,230
Do you have vacant rooms?

193
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,010
We have one room vacant, with a king-size bed.

194
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,980
Then can you add another bed or adjust the room?

195
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,060
She clearly told us there is only one room left. Don't be difficult.

196
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,390
Is this also part of your plan?

197
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,270
I didn't have tactics.

198
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,660
Ever since it started raining,

199
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,060
things are no longer within my control.

200
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,730
The fact that there is only one room available

201
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,330
is nothing but a surprise.

202
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,340
I don't know what you are trying to do.

203
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,500
Let's go to another hotel.

204
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,370
I'm afraid that I can't explain it later.

205
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,090
Go in. We'll just rest here for the night.

206
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,080
Then you have to trust me. I don't have any ulterior motive.

207
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,800
I came here really just to climb the mountains and walk with you.

208
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,050
I never expected the car to break down or the rain to start pouring so that we have to be stuck in a hotel.

209
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,460
I also didn't expect that the hotel will only have a couples room left.

210
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,830
I'm a model. I usually bring these with me.

211
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,800
You have to trust me. This is my illness in my career.

212
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,180
I really didn't arrange this rain.

213
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,260
You must believe in me.

214
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,580
Stop explaining yourself.

215
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,400
Go shower.

216
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,040
Is there any hidden meaning behind your words?

217
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,030
Did I think too much or did you think too much?

218
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,410
Go shower first. Don't catch a cold.

219
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,580
I'll go take a shower.

220
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,150
Meng Hui, Dr. Sui  and I are in a hotel room.

221
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,020
He's taking a shower inside right now.

222
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,340
He told me to wait for a while outside.

223
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,230
Say, what does he mean by that?

224
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,640
Does he want to do something?

225
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,040
Does he want to get me into bed or does he want me to get him into bed?

226
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,570
Should I show some self-restraint?

227
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,020
Hello?

228
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,090
What is your passcode to your phone? I'm going to call Meng Hui back.

229
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,070
1127.

230
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,820
Sui An, I already determined to make the lie into a true one.

231
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,190
I won't tell her forever that I'm  Zheng Jue.

232
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,250
You liar.

233
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,160
I already know.

234
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,480
You even dare to make such a big lie.

235
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
None of you guys are good.

236
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,000
I want to beat Shen Yi to death right now.

237
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,810
Didn't you say

238
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,770
that if you lie forever then it'll become true.

239
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,560
Is it the same? To Meng Hui, you're Shen Yi's friend.

240
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,770
You have no importance.

241
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,540
Even if she doesn't forgive you,

242
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,990
you'll just not contact her at most but Shen Yi is the person she loves the most.

243
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,160
Do you want to get along with someone that lied to her

244
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,740
forever and live in lies?

245
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,630
Based on what?

246
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,670
You already said everything.

247
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,760
You always make sense.

248
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,680
I'll go find Meng Hui right now and ask Shen Yi what's going on.

249
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,390
I'm going to go beat him to death.

250
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,440
It's raining heavily outside and the car has a flat tire.

251
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,430
We're at the mountains right now and your phone ran out of battery.

252
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,400
You're even dressed up like this. How are you going to beat Shen Yi to death?

253
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,770
I'll beat you up to death first.

254
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,010
I believe everything now

255
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,360
is not arranged by you.

256
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,970
Look. You have no solution either.

257
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,440
I'll sleep on the bed. You're sleeping on the sofa.

258
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,460
Hello, everyone.

259
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,780
Director Meng.

260
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,690
We brought things for everyone.

261
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,000
Why did you even bring us things when you came?

262
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,740
Wait a second. Giving out candies is a big gossip.

263
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,810
Could it be...

264
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,600
We got married.

265
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,850
Really?

266
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,700
Congratulations.

267
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,510
We can't call her Director Meng in the future.

268
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,000
We have to call her Boss Lady.

269
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,340
That's right, Boss Lady.

270
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,380
I'll increase your salary.

271
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,420
- Come on.
- Congrats.

272
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,990
This is so exquisite. It's even engraved.

273
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,120
Director Shen with his marriage,

274
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,980
he's so extravagant with his spending.

275
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,290
One, two, three.

276
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,140
This is the Shen Yi that I know.

277
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,070
If you finish eating the candy then it's gone but you can keep the box.

278
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,030
Money needs to be spent in the right places.

279
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,850
My budget was on the candy box.

280
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,140
That's also right.

281
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,880
I'll go give the employees over there.

282
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,260
Okay.

283
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,990
I'll wait for you in the office.

284
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,450
May you two be blessed with children soon, Director Shen.

285
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,500
Congratulations Director Shen.

286
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,740
They're finally married.

287
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,130
- They just married like that.
- That's right.

288
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,900
But this box is nice.

289
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,660
Are you still human? You didn't dare to admit what you did and even let Sui An do it.

290
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,990
It's such a big matter. Do you think you can keep hiding it?

291
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,830
What do you know? Calm down first.

292
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,960
How can I calm down? Why did you lie to Meng Hui?

293
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,680
Wei Lei, why are you here?

294
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,970
- I'm looking for you because of something.
- I also have something to tell you.

295
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,710
Let me say it first. This is a big matter and it relates to your happiness.

296
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,010
How come you know it's a big issue regarding happiness?

297
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,930
Did Shen Yi tell you?

298
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,820
We got married.

299
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,990
Shen Yi, you must've practiced your chive cutting skills.
(T/N: cutting chives means to exploit someone)

300
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,580
Wei Lei, what did you want to tell me just now?

301
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,690
I got it wrong. It's nothing.

302
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,600
Meng Hui, I wish you guys

303
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,890
a long and happy marriage.

304
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,870
Thank you.

305
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,630
Meng Hui, I feel a little bitter in my mouth. Can you give me a piece of candy?

306
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,270
I'll go get you some wedding candies. Wait for me.

307
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,260
Shen Yi, does your conscience not hurt?

308
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,850
I know what you're worried about

309
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,070
but have you thought

310
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,800
if this issue will rot in my stomach,

311
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,190
then I'll be the only one who will be in pain

312
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,500
but if you tell her,

313
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,290
then it will be the two of us.

314
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,950
She already went through a lot.

315
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,870
Does that mean you're thinking for her own good?

316
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,390
I don't need you to understand me.

317
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,720
I only hope you can cooperate.

318
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,540
I'm back.

319
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,040
Here.

320
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,580
Is it sweet?

321
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,560
It's still bitter.

322
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,970
It's coffee flavored.

323
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,230
Director Xu, aren't you going to work at Qian Shan Company?

324
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,670
That's right.

325
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,180
Shen Yi thought the issues at Qian Shan Company is more important

326
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,980
so he let me go help his dad

327
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,910
but the work at LS Company is too complicated.

328
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:20,090
Some things, I have to

329
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,730
tell each and everyone of you.

330
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,900
Say, Xiao Xu,

331
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,390
eat some candy first.

332
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,710
You always bring so many things when you come back home.

333
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,360
This house can't hold it anymore.

334
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,620
Why don't we change it into a bigger house?

335
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,730
No need. I think it's quite nice. It's so warm.

336
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,020
I'll tidy up tomorrow.

337
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,940
I'll help you when I get off work.

338
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,430
- We're...
- We're husband and wife now.

339
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,080
In the future, please take care of me.

340
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,250
Please take care of me too.

341
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,130
I'm about to consummate my marriage today.

342
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,240
If you want to wait some more then just reject.

343
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,270
But we already got married.

344
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,800
Then you're husband and wife by law. Why are you hesitating for?

345
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,270
But I'm nervous.

346
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:38,470
Meng Hui, you married me so quickly.

347
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,430
Do you regret it?

348
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,230
I don't. I'm very blissful right now.

349
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,130
Meng Hui?

350
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,970
Why did you wake up so early?

351
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,680
I'm making breakfast for you.

352
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,800
Give me a kiss.

353
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,030
You go wash up first. You have to go to work.

354
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,380
Happy wedding.

355
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,310
Happy wedding.

356
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,710
I'm sorry. I don't really know how to tie it.

357
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,000
It's fine. You have a lifetime to learn.

358
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,110
Give me a kiss.

359
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,790
I'm going to work then, wife.

360
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,880
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

361
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,240
If you don't want the new backpack then I'll

362
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,200
give this old one to you

363
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,770
since I can't wear two backpacks to school.

364
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,580
Thank you.

365
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,530
Hello?

366
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,750
Hello, Sui An.

367
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,890
You left the backpack at Shen Yi's place.

368
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,700
What backpack?

369
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,490
It's fine.

370
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,480
I'm hanging up. Bye bye.

[Previously used name: Zheng Jue]

372
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,400
What backpack?

373
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,130
Hello. Backpack? What did she say?

374
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,990
She said that she threw it away.

375
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,640
Threw it away?

376
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,090
Okay.

377
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,180
- Meng Hui.
- I'm taking a shower.

378
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,240
It's time to eat dinner.

379
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:59,630
Meng Hui, are you tired today?

380
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,640
I'm fine. I'm a bit tired.

381
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,170
Then rest early today.

382
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,750
You're tying the tie better and better now.

383
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:35,610
Are you filming today? I will try to come back and eat with you.

384
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,760
No need. I'll go look for you.

385
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,380
I'll get going then.

386
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,340
Director Shen is still in a meeting. Sit for a while.

387
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,410
I'll wait for him here.

388
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,300
There are some documents about LS's investors.

389
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,420
Can you help me remind Director Shen to check his personal details?

390
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,090
Okay, leave it here.

391
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,980
Okay. Thank you.

393
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,950
If you have time then you can also take a look.

394
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,640
I'll get going.

395
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:08,950
No matter how many times you touch up your makeup, it'll still fade.

396
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,390
You actually already know, right?

397

Shen Yi is Zheng Jue.

398
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,560
They're all lying to you.

399
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,970
You two are really interesting. One pretends to not know

400
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,140
the other one pretends he never did it. Is it fun to deceive yourselves?

401
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,020
You two keep acting.

402
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,540
Let's see how long you guys can act for.

403

404
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,570
Are you done?

Yes.
