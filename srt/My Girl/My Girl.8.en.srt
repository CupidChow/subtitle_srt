[Episode 8: Hand cream, remain in obscurity.]

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Miss Meng, CEO Shen asked me to notify you to attend tomorrow's party drink.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,330
It's to make up for the last incomplete cocktail party.

23
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,830
Why did you come?

24
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,210
This is Meng Hui, Miss Meng, our Director Shen's girlfriend.

25
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,240
Could you  be able to not without my knowing

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,670
attend my work's function.

27
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,390
I want to sort out my thoughts

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,210
and our relationship.

29
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,260
Do you think he  feels I give him a lot of trouble?

30
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,470
But he initially brought me to the company. I believe he wouldn't mind.

31
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,050
Hence, I helped the program team to deliver the proposal.

32
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,330
Plus, it is his staff asking me to attend the work evening party.

33
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,970
Who knows it's not a standard cocktail party but a 'Golf' gathering party.

34
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,570
Who would know they arranged a gathering party at the golf course?

35
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,900
How could I know that?

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,990
First, both of you have different work nature.

37
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,170
Also, the income gap is very obvious.

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,040
After the honeymoon phase, he'll want to take a break.

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,460
So he wants to keep the distance from you.

40
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,570
And he has been busy recently.

41
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,170
That meant he regretted it, right?

42
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,700
You didn't catch the main point.

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,940
The main point is Shen Yi has been busy, right?

44
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,450
The main point is Xu Xing Yao schemed against you.

45
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,390
Because of her,  you two had had an argument.

46
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,510
I just said you are naive, being tricked by someone.

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,640
What you said, I got it now.

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,700
I think I need to have a friend like you.

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,910
What could I do now?

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,210
This is not my area.

51
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,140
How about, you ask her.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,270
We might as well keep it simple and directly find Xu Xing Yao to tell her

53
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,230
who's Shen Yi's official girlfriend.

54
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,400
Stop taking small actions. With that small idea of hers,

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,730
she merely thinks after working hard with Shen Yi for many years and working by his side too,

56
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,550
can she still expect a water-front pavillion to get the moonlight first?
(T/N: advantage of being in a favored position)

57
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,830
Just tell her that when a man and a woman who have been working together for many years,

58
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,830
didn't develop any sparks in love,

59
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,840
can she still expect to be Shen Yi's wife in a few years?

60
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,510
- You want me to say this?
- Just say this.

61
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,560
You... put on your makeup and go.

62
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,030
First, we must now show our weaknesses.

63
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,940
You can lose people but you can't lose. Understand?

64
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,970
[Tick Take]

65
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,480
Why did you call me here? Let's make it clear.

66
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,640
- Do you like Shen Yi and that's why you deliberately go against me?
- Yes.

67
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,200
Are you trying to tell me that after knowing Shen Yi

68
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,840
for many years and there's nothing between us, it will never happen in this lifetime?

69
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,640
Even if this is the case, Shen Yi and I are together.

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,870
If you like him, you can publicly announce this.

71
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,590
You can't do something like what has happened at the cocktail party.

72
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,420
What did I do?

73
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,070
I merely let you put on the wrong dress. It was just a minor mistake.

74
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,740
Is this a serious matter?

75
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,240
Do you know what kind of work Shen Yi and I are busy with?

76
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,590
As for you, you are quibbling just over a dress?

77
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,430
Do you know ever since he met you,

78
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,280
Shen Yi made a lot of mistakes?

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,370
Because of you,

80
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,510
he even gave up his many years of research for the liquid foundation's formula.

81
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,420
Didn't he tell you that LS Company is now facing financial crisis?

82
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,100
It's that serious?

83
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,220
- I'm not aware. He didn't tell me.
- Why do you want him to tell you?

84
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,220
Would you understand?

85
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,920
When you gave up the surgery, in order to accompany you,

86
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,300
he gave up the opportunity to negotiate with the England Laboratory. He paid them ¥5 million deposit.

87
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,690
In order to accommodate you, he even messed up the cocktail party for the bidders yesterday.

88
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,980
I went to England to clean up the mess for him.

89
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,270
What were you doing then?

90
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,950
You were at a team building.

91
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,900
You offended the colleagues till there's nothing left, Miss Meng.

92
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,640
Shen Yi and I pioneered this. We advanced and retreated together.

93
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,030
Without a career, he's not a match for you.

94
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,500
You think love can guarantee your love.

95
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,580
How long can it last?

96
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,030
Shen Yi is a workaholic.

97
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,450
His goal in life is to research and launch that liquid foundation.

98
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,690
He will never allow anyone to hinder his career.

99
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,510
I'm the only one who can help him in this undertaking.

100
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,980
As for you,

101
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,240
you can only make him cough up compensations.

102
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,530
I won't be drinking the coffee. I have matters to attend to.

103
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,610
You have more time. Take your time to drink it.

104
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,540
You think Meng Hui is not suitable but Shen Yi thinks she's suitable.

105
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,210
He's deeply in love and can't extricate himself from her.

106
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,340
I'm an official ex-girlfriend and I'm not even jealous.

107
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,620
What stance do you have to make decisions for Shen Yi?

108
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,330
You also know that you are his ex-girlfriend?

109
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,430
You sound so dignified but insincere in substance. You said you are Shen Yi's business partner and soulmate.

110
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,180
Frankly, you are only borrowing Shen Yi's status

111
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,140
to serve as a foil for your independence, capability, and ambition.

112
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,030
You think you are strong, capable in your work and are always intoxicated by this, "Look at how outstanding I am."

113
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,910
With your career, why don't you compare yourself with Wu Zetian?
(T/N: only female Emperor in Chinese history)

114
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,900
You keep thinking that LS company can't do without your capability.

115
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,160
But why is the company always in deficit?

116
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,670
Am I more beautiful than you? Do I discriminate you?

117
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,040
Do I make more money than you? Do I flaunt off in front of you?

118
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,270
Many men like me more than you. What should I say?

119
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,640
Move aside.

120
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,660
Miss, are you okay?

121
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,000
What are you doing?

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,070
She pushed me.

123
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,250
What's going on? Are you okay, Miss?

124
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,990
We have a monitor here. We can replay it for you.

125
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,880
Forget it. She's such a scoundrel too.

126
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,590
Thank you.

127
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,670
Shen Yi, sorry.

128
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,230
I wanted to help you and go with Miss Meng to the cocktail party. It was for your sake.

129
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,540
I didn't expect her to misunderstand my intention.

130
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,130
She threw her temper at me just now.

131
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,130
She even misinterpreted our relationship.

132
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,960
I explained to her. She refused to listen.

133
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,880
This has nothing to do with you. It has been hard for you.

134
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,990
Have a good rest this weekend.

135
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,430
Don't worry. I won't let this minor matter affect my work.

136
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,340
It's my fault. I will clarify this with Meng Hui.

137
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,800
Shen Yi and I pioneered this. We advanced and retreated together.

138
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,550
Without a career, he's not a match for you.

139
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,100
You think love can guarantee your love. How long will it last?

140
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,190
I have thought it through. I think we are still not compatible.

141
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,160
Let's break up. Sorry.

142
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,950
In order to accompany you, he gave up the opportunity to negotiate with the England Laboratory.

143
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,970
He paid them ¥$5 mililion deposit.

144
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,970
Can you, without my knowledge,

145
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,760
enter my work area?

146
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,180
I want to sort out my thoughts. Also,

147
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,330
our relationship.

148
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,890
Shen Yi

149
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,740
will never allow anyone to hinder his career.

150
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,750
I'm the only one who can help him in this undertaking.

151
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,740
As for you, you can only make him cough up compensations.

152
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,500
Let's break up.

153
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,860
Isn't it just a career? I can make money for LS too.

154
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,370
Xiao Mei, hurry up. We're running out of time, help me out.

155
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,430
The stencil, give me the eyebrow stencil.

156
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,880
Stop for a moment.

157
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,330
What are you guys doing during work?

158
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,690
- You scared me.
- You scared us to death.

159
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,440
It's Assistant Meng.

160
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,880
Good morning.

161
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,970
Assistant Meng. Who told you I am an assistant?

162
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,000
Did Shen Yi say that?

163
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,840
Why are you here so early? Director Shen is not here yet.

164
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,780
Take a seat here first and have a cup of coffee.

165
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,330
Have a seat.

166
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,890
What are you guys doing?

167
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,160
We—

168
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,870
We're preparing to develop a new eyebrow pencil.

169
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,850
We're investigating the current trends for eyebrow shapes.

170
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,050
- What's wrong with your eyebrows?
- The company has rules—

171
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,100
Yesterday everyone worked overtime till very late.

172
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,750
We're not really in a rush today. So we didn't really handle it very well.

173
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,760
Sit.

174
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,710
Cotton pad.

175
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,240
Eyebrow razor.

176
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,470
Your eyebrows are too thick. They just need to be trimmed a bit.

177
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,690
Filling in your eyebrows will only overdo it. Using eyebrow stencils will cause even more of a disaster.

178
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,600
Right?

179
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,840
You say I'm a fifty year old man who has to wear makeup at work.

180
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,260
I'm already a disaster.

181
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,440
You know that we're quite busy with work.

182
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,870
We had no choice but to use these stencils to fill in the brows.

183
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,180
After a while, we end up losing one of the pairs.

184
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,740
Sometimes we use it backward and it ends up even more awkward.

185
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,400
This really is too tragic to look at.

186
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,580
Next time don't put on makeup when you come to work.

187
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,000
- Really?
- Can this work?

188
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,900
Of course it'll work.

189
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,370
It's working hours. What are you guys doing?

190
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,950
- Director Shen.
- Good morning, Director Shen.

191
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,700
- Meng Hui.
- What are you doing during working hours?

192
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,170
What's wrong with you? You're the last person to arrive to work.

193
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,540
Are you throwing away your work attendance?

194
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,980
Is your workaholic self only for me to see?

195
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,710
She's changed into another person again.

196
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,880
Well... let's go into my office first.

197
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,570
It's my first time seeing an assistant giving the boss a lecture.

198
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,210
It was even a harsh lecture.

199
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,480
I feel like they have something on.

200
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,360
It's been cleared up, but who would believe that?

201
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,270
- I don't believe it.
- I don't believe it either.
- Me neither.

202
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,900
I'm begging you guys please stop talking.

203
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,140
Sit down and talk.

204
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,130
Do you feel uncomfortable now?

205
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,490
- Do you remember who you are?
- I came to the office at 9 am. And you?

206
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,570
Don't you know the company's rules and regulations? You're only arriving at this time.

207
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,290
I—

208
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,170
You mean that you're now an employee of my company, right?

209
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,570
We're all part of the company. We're all employees.

210
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:32,780
What I mean is... right now, are you... my assistant?

211
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,100
- You said the opposite?
- Said the opposite?

212
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,060
I am the assistant?

213
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,120
- Meng Hui, please try to recall your memories.
- I told you to call me Director Meng at the office!

214
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:50,600
Director Meng... this company... can not only have you as the boss, we can have two. You see?

215
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,070
What nonsense are you saying? Our company is a listed company.

216
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,000
So naturally, we have shareholders and a director.

217
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,140
You are not even clear about the regulations.

218
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,880
So that's to say, you're the only boss of the company.

219
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,210
Then... the company has got nothing to do with me at all?

220
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,770
I just said that you're my assistant.

221
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,520
But I'm also the CEO.

222
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,660
Fine. You're the CEO's Special Assistant. I'm the CEO and you're the assistant.

223
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,410
I—

224
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,210
- Enter.
- Enter.

225
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,340
Miss Meng is here too.

226
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,880
She's Director Meng.

227
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,410
Director... Meng.

228
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,900
- Then... if I'm the special assistant, he is?
- The special assistant's special assistant.

229
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,820
Director Shen, Miss Meng is...

230
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,460
so I got demoted just like that.

231
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,720
I've been demoted too.

232
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,900
Has my salary been cut as well?

233
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,110
If you can't find a perfect explanation to hide this situation, then your salary gets cut as well.

234
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,500
What are you guys whispering about?

235
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,620
Tell me what you guys were saying.

236
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,680
- Uh...
- Well...

237
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,730
Let's have a meeting.

238
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,950
At the last team-building exercise,

239
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,670
I said that Meng Hui is my assistant.

240
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,710
That's actually not the case.

241
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,900
Boss! So I can tell the truth, right?

242
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,120
She's the other boss that I looked for.

243
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,790
After the team-building exercise last time, I did some reflection.

244
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,040
I think I really am not suited to be the boss of a cosmetics company.

245
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,830
So I found Meng Hui who is more professional to be the boss.

246
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,830
I got it so I need to ...

247
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,560
- So she's not Assistant Meng.
- Yes.

248
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,510
From now on you will have to call her... Director Meng.

249
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,330
- Director Meng.
- Director Meng.

250
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,350
Today's earth-shattering gossip!

251
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,130
Director Shen finally admits that he is not specialized in the field of cosmetics.

252
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,210
Do you not understand the current situation?

253
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,920
Since Director Meng's arrival, aren't we working for two bosses now?

254
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,640
Shouldn't we get double the salary?

255
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,820
How is that possible? But

256
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,780
just close your eyes and buy the stocks of the companies Director Shen invests in.

257
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,680
Guaranteed profits. No losses.

258
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,930
Just take that as your double salary.

259
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,280
Don't you think the it's weird between the female boss and our boss?

260
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,830
I don't know anything.

261
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,220
Stop the car.

262
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,630
- Don't stop.
- This—

263
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,690
Are you the boss or am I the boss? Also, you clearly have a driver so why did you ask Jiang Jiang to drive the car?

264
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,320
Exactly. How did I become a driver?

265
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,330
Aren't I the special assistant's special assistant?

266
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,450
You are the boss. But right now we have a very important collaboration to discuss.

267
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,980
We can discuss the collaboration at the company. We still have a meeting in the afternoon.

268
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,170
- Turn around and go back to the company.
- We're going to go discuss the collaboration.

269
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,110
Are we going back to the office or discuss the collaboration?

270
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,670
You are the driver, so you listen to me.

271
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,430
You are the assistant, so you listen to me.

272
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,860
I am your assistant so I will arrange your work.

273
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,920
We're discussing the collaboration. Listen to me.

274
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,770
Go to Ah Tao's to discuss the collaboration.

275
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,840
Okay, okay.

276
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,850
Why are you looking at me? Look at him! There's definitely something wrong with him.

277
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,640
Not only are you stingy but stubborn as well.

278
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,770
You are self-centered and never care about other people's feelings.

279
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,890
You have an emotional disorder and don't understand human language.

280
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,900
You ridiculously went back on your words.

281
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,660
The entire company can't stand him. If you don't believe me, ask Jiang Jiang.

282
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,640
I can understand the big stress because of work.

283
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,500
But you cannot bring this negative mood to the company.

284
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,270
Him being this way has severely impacted his other colleagues.

285
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,240
As the boss, I can't just not interfere in this.

286
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,680
That's why I brought him here.

287
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,720
Well, Director Meng, the company has some matters for you to attend to.

288
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,490
Why don't we go out first

289
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,620
and let Dr. Ah Tou and Director Shen...

290
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,230
Assistant Shen have a talk.

291
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,890
Fine. Then have a good talk.

292
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,990
I'll reimburse him the money.

293
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,890
What on earth happened?

294
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:48,020
At the cocktail party the other day, Meng Hui was still fine. What triggered her PTSD so suddenly?

295
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,720
That girl was the pupil at No.3 Primary school.

296
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,390
But Meng Hui first started studying at No.5 Elementary School and went to Chong Hai later.

297
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,470
And it's impossible she studied at No.3 Primary school.

298
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,730
I think we're moving forward too quickly.

299
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,990
She suddenly charged into my world and I didn't prepare myself enough for it.

300
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,750
So... I broke up with her.

301
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,160
From my observations, Meng Hui thinks her career is not on par with yours, causing you to break up with her.

302
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,650
So she is imagining herself as a highly successful

303
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,960
career woman that is good enough to be with you.

304
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,670
What should I do?

305
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,630
All you can do now is to cooperate with her.

306
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,050
Let her firmly believe that she is the CEO of LS.

307
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,180
Once her innermost wishes are fulfilled,

308
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,300
you can smoothly get through this episode of PTSD.

309
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,570
I understand. This happened because of me.

310
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,380
I'll take responsibility.

311
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,830
As for your relationship,

312
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,210
if you really feel that you're not suitable,

313
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,250
then you can wait till she's stable, and then have a talk with her.

314
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,790
As a friend, I hope that you're more genuine.

315
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,630
Tell her why it doesn't work

316
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,460
instead of breaking up with her through a simple Wechat message.

317
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,500
It was my problem. I worried too much.

318
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,700
The priority now is to stabilize her mood. Don't let her suffer any trauma again.

319
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,800
I will have to trouble you for this period of time.

320
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,600
It's a given.

321
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,000
You both decided to break up and you are still taking care of her.

322
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,300
You are already doing well. I should thank you instead.

323
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,230
I have wronged her.

324
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,200
Director Meng.

325
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,700
This isn't right.

326
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,400
What?

327
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,600
Why did you bring me here?

328
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,000
Back to home.

329
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
Who's house?

330
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Your house.

331
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,100
Why would I live in such a small place?

332
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,000
Director Meng,  you have to know that

333
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,800
some directors don't even live as well as you.

334
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I don't understand this.

335
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,200
The profit from my investment for the past years was a total of ¥60 million

336
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,400
including the bonuses from the shares.

337
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
Even if we deduct LS Company's operating costs and the expenses for research,

338
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
no matter how, there's still a balance of  ¥10 million.

339
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,200
How do you know my salary?

340
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,800
Why can't I live in a better and more comfortable place?

341
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,000
I understand.

342
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
What do you understand?

343
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,400
I will eventually return what I owe you.

344
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
I will pay you back. Let's go.

345
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,500
Wait a moment.

346
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,000
So who's house is this?

347
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,790
Mine.

348
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,400
Then you're pretty hard working.

349
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
Where's Meng Hui?

350
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
She conned me into doing spa.

351
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,200
It's almost time now.

352
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,400
Why don't I forget about this?

353
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
It's too inconvenient to stay in your house.

354
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,800
I will look for a better hotel apartment for her.

355
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,500
You are living next door.

356
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,600
You have two houses in your small suburb?

357
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,800
When I bought them, I had a feeling you may need them.

358
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,400
I'm going now.

359
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,500
This is more like it.

360
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,400
Director Meng, is this place acceptable?

361
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,400
I already said,

362
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,000
when we are alone, just call me Xiao Hui.

363
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,770
Okay, fine. Xiao Hui.

364
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Although the quality is slightly lacking

365
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,000
but it's still okay. I will put up with it and live here.

366
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
Then... I caused you inconvenience.

367
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
Your ability to execute tasks

368
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,600
is rather fast.

369
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,800
Then... have a good rest and relax.

370
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,600
Don't think about the company matters. Just leave them to me.

371
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,400
Actually, I'm rather tired.

372
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,800
Okay, put down my stuff

373
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,300
and prepare the bath water for me.

374
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,600
Bath water? What's that for?

375
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I want to take a bath.

376
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,700
T-T-Take a bath.

377
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,000
Okay.

378
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,500
You can relax then.

379
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,800
No one has lived here for a long time, right?

380
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,600
There are some scented candles in my suitcase. Light them for me.

381
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,100
Okay.

382
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,400
Hang my clothes in the cloakroom and place my coat on the rack.

383
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,000
Just place my undergarments in the drawer.

384
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,600
Why are you still here?

385
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,300
I- I was thinking to leave after you fell asleep.

386
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,400
So, we are having a 24-hour service relationship?

387
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,400
You can't call it a service.

388
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,200
What about... collaboration?

389
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,200
We have a lovers relationship.

390
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,400
I remember now.

391
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,300
What did you remember?

392
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I started LS Company from scratch

393
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,600
and had feelings for my male assistant after knowing each other for a long time.

394
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
They were originally in perfect harmony.

395
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,900
A pity that later, the woman became stronger than the man.

396
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,600
As long as you are happy, you can think whatever you like.

397
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,000
Are we considered to have reconciled now?

398
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,600
I know I'm a very strong person.

399
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,800
It has been tough for you but it's too cold sleeping on the  sofa.

400
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,100
Why don't you go back to sleeping on the bed?

401
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,500
You... you are mistaken.

402
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,700
No. We didn't reconcile.

403
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,180
Are we still having a fight?

404
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,200
There's definitely a problem in our relationship.

405
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,500
This requires time to resolve.

406
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,400
I think we should now

407
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,900
maintain our distance. It's more appropriate.

408
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,200
Don't tell me I have been using my authority to pressurize you?

409
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,300
You weren't willing?

410
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,200
By the way,

411
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,800
the latest eyeshadow color you were talking about today,

412
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,300
I didn't really understand. Could you explain it to me again?

413
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,000
I...

414
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,130
We are already home.

415
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,900
Don't talk about work here.

416
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,900
Then... what should we do?

417
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,400
Assistant Shen.

418
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,200
I want to do something which only two people can do.

419
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,400
Please arrange it.

420
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,300
T- Two people.

421
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,100
Sure.

422
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,700
Why did you bring me here?

423
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,800
[Buy One Get Second Half Off]

424
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
The second is half off.

425
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,400
I think it's not worth it for me to buy it alone.

426
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,500
Choose one.

427
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,600
I want fried rice cake with cheese

428
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
and spaghetti too.

429
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,600
These two are not...

430
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,800
discounted.

431
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,600
You can choose first and take it.

432
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,200
Hello. Did something happen at the company?

433
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,400
Everything is going well at the company but I'm not.

434
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,400
My small suburb is repairing the electrical circuit. They stopped the electricity and water supplies.

435
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
I went downstairs to find a power bank to charge my cellphone,

436
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
but I left my keys at home.

437
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,600
When I was downstairs, I then realized that

438
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,000
all the power banks have been borrowed.

439
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
My phone only has

440
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,200
twenty percent of battery left.

441
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,000
It's Friday today and all hotels in the city are full.

442
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,600
Aren't you and Miss Meng staying at Doctor Sui's condominium for a few days?

443
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,400
Then... can I go to your house for a night?

444
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay. Come and get the keys from me.

445
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,200
My phone only has eight percent left, can you pick me up?

446
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,600
I have to look after Meng Hui, I can't leave.

447
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,000
There's only seven percent left.

448
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,100
I can't do anything then. Think of another solution.

449
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,800
Director Shen, Shen—

450
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,800
Ah Tao, help me. My house's water and electricity supplies have been cut off.

451
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,900
I don't have any cash with me and my cellphone has only

452
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,000
three percent of battery left. I left my keys at home too.

453
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,800
I don't want to sleep in the street for the night and walk to work again tomorrow morning.

454
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,200
Wait there, I'll pick you up.

455
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,800
Really? Okay.

456
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,400
Then I'll... wait for you.

457
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,400
What's with "A friend in need is a friend indeed"?

458
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,030
Shen Yi, you loser.

459
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,690
Why do you have two sets of this?

460
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,270
Even the bathrobes too?

461
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,510
How is it the same? Mine is grey, yours is navy blue.

462
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,630
What do you think about Meng Hui?

463
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,940
Will it affect work?

464
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,560
Of course.

465
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,360
Do you think it's very annoying?

466
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,450
This affair is because of me.

467
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,060
I'll take responsibility.

468
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,890
Thanks to you. If not, I would have slept on the street tonight.

469
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,080
It's okay. Just make yourself at home.

470
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,960
I will get a pajama for you.

471
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,770
Thanks.

472
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,700
It's almost your size.

473
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,220
- Go and change.
- Okay.

474
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,130

475
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,180
The bathroom's over there.

476
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,660
This—

477
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,530
I'll do it myself.

478
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,300
Sure, I'll get the plates then.

479
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,310
Sorry, I usually live by myself, so it's pretty messy.

480
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:02,360
I... I imposed on you. I didn't think too much about this.

481
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,500
It's okay. Have some supper.

482
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,420
Come and sit here.

483
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,340
A can each. Just nice for two people.

484
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,400
I better not drink.

485
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:31,630
Didn't you say to drink together and watch the movie?

486
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,620
It's not good for a girl to drink too much.

487
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,230
Girl?

488
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,270
Net assets per share,

489
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,300
bid per share.

490
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,700
Come in.

491
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,360
Love Psychology

492
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,710
Establishing Gender Awareness.

493
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,040
It's okay. Just make yourself at home.

494
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,470
Girl?

495
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,930
Because men and women process problems differently in their brains.

496
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,890
When a man handles a problem, it's done from a perspective of the core

497
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,340
but a woman handles it from a perspective of feelings

498
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,680
to look at the problem.

499
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,960
Working overtime will affect the rest. This problem is very simple.

500
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,540
As long as the staff's overtime exceeds 10 pm the day before,

501
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,490
they will be exempted from wearing makeup for the second day. Perfectly solved.

502
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,900
Furthermore, I don't understand why every staff must be issued a makeup kit.

503
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,710
It takes up a lot of budget. Is there a need for this?

504
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,930
You can't just simply solve the staff's problem this way. You should consider their feelings too.

505
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,700
Why don't we cancel the system for staff to wear makeup at work? It will be more convenient for everyone.

506
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,490
Because we are a cosmetics company.

507
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,540
Give everyone a set of makeup kit then.

508
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,100
I—

509
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,150
Cancel the system of wearing makeup at work.

510
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,870
Okay.

511
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,840
The system of wearing makeup at work is canceled]

513
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,710
What's up?

514
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,920
- Where are the documents that Director Zhou send to us?
- It's in the red file.

515
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,730
Red? There's no red file. Found it.

516
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,400
Also, where's that financial report?

517
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,000
It's in the blue file.

518
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,000
Found it.

519
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,770
There's only ten percent of battery left on my cellphone. I'm hanging up.

520
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:05,770
By the way, if there's anything in the future, use the internal line. Don't call my personal cellphone. Thank you.

521
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,400
- Where's that proposal?
- There's still eight percent left.

522
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,740
- I need this for the afternoon meeting.
- Six percent.

523
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,590
Hello?

524
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,450
Isn't there still 98 percent battery left?

525
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,970
The 98 percent battery is to maintain my private life unless

526
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,440
I roam in the street.

527
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,640
Sorry about what happened yesterday.

528
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,140
I really couldn't leave and take care of you.

529
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,500
But I really have lots of matters to seek guidance from you.

530
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,540
This is my first time as an assistant. I don't know what to do.

531
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,880
Here's your bank card and password.

532
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,540
This is your work schedule.

533
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,340
This is your private schedule too.

534
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,060
All these belong to Director Meng now.

535
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,000
I need to remember all this?

536
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,830
Anyway, you wanted to accommodate Miss Meng, right? You should do it till the end then.

537
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,420
In any case, what's important is that you should do a self-check.

538
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,060
Those documents which you handed to her were not that urgent.

539
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,610
Those in red files are important documents you should handle.

540
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,550
Those in blue files are for Miss Meng to handle. They are not urgent.

541
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,550
The kind that won't even matter if you threw it into the paper shredder.

542
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,260
Don't ever mix up these two files.

543
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,080
What's this?

544
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,000
Miss Meng personally stuck those on.

545
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,130
Boss. Boss?

546
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:53,340
Don't use those evil eyes to look at the files, okay?

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,040
The shape of the eyebrows is the soul of a makeup look.

549
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,810
If  your eyebrows look good, your makeup will look more three dimensional.

550
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:14,930
If your eyebrows stand out too much, your makeup will look unnatural.

551
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,630
I'm that eyebrow.
