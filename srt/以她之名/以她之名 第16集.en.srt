350
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,000
Be sure to note down

351
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,240
this special expenditure first.

352

If Ms. Ling doesn't find anything,

353
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,960
you

354
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,200
should go to the Finance Department
to pull the accounts.

355
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,330
Understood, Ms. Ye.

356

[Mare Nubium]

357
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,570
I found nothing.

358
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,400
I've checked the Finance Department's

359
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,960
accounts for the past 5 years.

360
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,620
They're balanced perfectly,

361
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
with no discrepancies whatsoever.

362
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,510
The more perfect they appear,

363
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,400
the less they seem like the accounts

364
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,160
of a company

365
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,490
as large as Mare Nubium.

366
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,920
Even this payment

367
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,640
has been balanced so neatly.

368
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,480
So,

369
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,720
I may need to request

370
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,050
2 more years of accounts

371
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,270
for a re-audit.

372
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,750
Will we finally find something

373
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,750
if we go back two more years?

374
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,720
In this world,

375
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,830
there's no such thing

376
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,920
as a perfectly airtight record.

377
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,780
As long as we keep investigating,

378
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,040
we'll eventually find some clues.

379
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,120
Alright.

380
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,270
Then have the President's Office
issue a formal request

381
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,590
for the Finance Department to prepare

382
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,520
an additional 2 years of accounts.

383
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,510
Tan Xin, you follow up

384
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,440
and make sure

385
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,480
to find any overlooked

386
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,550
or hidden financial expenditures.

387
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,280
Understood.

388
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,750
Now...

389
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,350
I have some personal matters

390
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,550
I'd like to discuss with you in private.

391
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,950
I'll get back to work now.

392
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,920
Since it's personal matters,

393
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,450
let's talk when we get back.

394
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,970
Back where?

395
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,880
Should I go with you to Cloud Manor,

396
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,080
or will you come with me to my penthouse?

397
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,540
Stop beating around the bush.

398
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,900
Just tell me straight.

399
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,830
About Lu Siyu?

400
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,640
You're with him now?

401
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,160
Yes.

402
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,350
Why?

403
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,720
I like him.

404
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,110
I knew you would come ask

405
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,240
why I'm with him

406
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,680
and why it has to be Lu Siyu.

407
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,940
I have only one answer—

408
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,680
I like him.

409
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,880
Have you forgotten

410
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,830
how the Lu family treated you?

411
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,030
Of course I remember.

412
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,200
But does that mean I should be

413
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,240
trapped in the Lu family forever?

414
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,440
But isn't being with Lu Siyu

415
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,200
just the same as going back
to the Lu family?

416
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,510
Lu Siyu is Lu Siyu.

417
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,830
He's different from Lu Sinan.

418
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,640
How is he different?

419
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,240
Isn't he Lu Sinan's

420
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,110
biological brother?

421
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,920
Don't they have

422
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,000
the same father?

423
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,510
Haimeng, I'm begging you,

424
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,030
don't delude yourself

425
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,070
into thinking

426
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,110
that Lu Siyu is different from Lu Sinan.

427
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,110
They're the same.

428
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,550
They're both from the Lu family.

429
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,030
They're both sons of the Lu family.

430
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,640
They share

431
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,240
the same blood

432
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,830
and the same genes!

433
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,480
What are you smiling at?

434
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,400
Am I wrong?

435
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,170
I knew you'd come to argue with me.

436
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,350
I'm just glad

437
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,310
you didn't mention to my face

438
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,170
that I was once married to Lu Sinan

439
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,200
or that I was once the eldest
daughter-in-law of the Lu family,

440
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,960
using those things

441
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,720
against me.

442
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,550
I couldn't care less about that.

443
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,680
I don't care either.

444
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,590
I don't care

445
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,240
what relationship I have
with the Lu family.

446
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,200
I also don't care about

447
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,750
what kind of relationship
I once had with Lu Siyu,

448
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,610
nor do I care about that he and I...

449
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,270
I have the right

450
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,480
to decide what I want to do.

451
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,510
As for what you said—

452
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,040
that he's just like Lu Sinan

453
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,370
and that they're both from the Lu family—

454
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,750
Siyu is different.

455
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,830
He has never been corrupted

456
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,070
by his family.

457
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,160
He's never learned

458
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,400
those underhanded tactics.

459
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,510
Everything he has,

460
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,240
he earned by himself,

461
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,550
clean and honest.

462
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
And I believe

463
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
he will continue to

464
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,550
walk his path

465
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,150
with resilience, simplicity,
and integrity.

466
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,720
In this world,

467
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,580
perhaps all darkness is the same.

468
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,210
But in this world, there's always someone

469
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,880
who shines differently.

470
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,680
I don't believe Lu Siyu is

471
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,960
any different from Lu Sinan.

472
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,070
In men's hearts,

473

love is

474

just the cheapest means to an end.

475
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,310
They only need to offer some simple

476
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,160
sweet talk

477
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,110
and a little effort,

478
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,970
and they can trap you completely.

479
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,480
You've already fallen for it once.

480
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,070
Are you really going to fall for it again?

481
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,830
Was it my fault

482
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,240
that I fell that time?

483
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,790
Of course it wasn't your fault...

484
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,680
So what then?

485
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,270
Should I be trapped

488
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,720
or have a new relationship?

489

If you're just another tourist from China,

523
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,310
that's quite a coincidence, isn't it?

524
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,240
So only someone like you,

525

526

Who sent me is none of your business.

534

But I advise you

535
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,640
to spend your time keeping an eye on

that husband of yours instead.

into an abyss
from which you can never escape.

566
