[Return of the Queen]

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,340
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,130
The secret document

4
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,410
is hidden behind the painting.

5
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,590
Siyu is still missing.

6
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,630
Everything is going downhill

7
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,960
and turning more and more against us.

8
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
What should we

9
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
do next, Chairman?

10
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,000
Or maybe we could...

11
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,890
What's going on?

12
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,040
I'll go check it out.

13
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,630
Chairman.

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,460
W-What's happening here?

15
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,690
Could it be that the wind was too strong

16
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,440
and just blew it away?

17
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,660
Check the CCTV footage

18
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,970
and alert security.

19
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,050
This is the most critical moment.

20
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,079
We need to make sure

21
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,470
everything is secure,
both at home and at the company.

22
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,530
I'll go right away.

23
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,310
Got it.

24
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,800
Our insider just delivered this,

25
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,079
and nobody has opened it yet.

[To Ye Haimeng]

27
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,430
This is...

28
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,520
Lu Sinan left it for you?

29
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,960
Tan Xin,

30
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:12,910
open it.

31
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Haimeng,

32
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,920
it's me.

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,510
Today, we just

34
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,430
completed our marriage registration.

35
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,270
The wedding ceremony
will be held the day after tomorrow.

36
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,270
After that,

37
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,560
we'll be heading to Monaco

38
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,950
for our honeymoon.

39
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,560
I'm leaving this video message

40
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,000
for you today

41
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,310
to admit

42
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,530
that I lied.

43
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,430
From the moment

44
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,360
I met you at the book café a year ago,

45
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,650
it was all a premeditated plan.

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,220
Six months ago,

47
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,040
my family faced

48
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
the worst credit crisis

49
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
in its history.

50
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,310
My father's

51
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,640
Changlu Capital Group,

52
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,990
suffered massive credit losses

53
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,950
following

54
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,080
the real estate industry's downfall.

55
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,140
My family is about to fall.

56
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,360
Actually,

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,260
I could have ignored them.

58
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,270
But if I

59
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,630
ran away on my own,

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,270
my father,

61
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,070
sister, and brother

62
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,630
would face the greatest crisis

63
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,720
of their lives.

64
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,000
They'd lose

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,800
everything they currently own—

66
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,800
property,

67
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
finances, education, and their future.

68
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,190
I can't even imagine

69
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,520
what they'd go through.

70
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,750
Also,

71
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,950
my father took my son away.

72
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
He is the child I had

73
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,180
with my college lover,

74
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,190
born overseas.

75
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,000
My father used him

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,870
as a leverage

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,330
to force me into a final choice:

78
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,680
choose my son,

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
or choose to deceive you.

80
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,630
In the end, I chose

81
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,630
you.

82
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,310
I know that no matter how many times

83
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,360
I say I'm sorry,

84
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,480
it can never make up

85
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,310
for what my family and I

86
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,560
did to you—

87
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,160
a fraudulent marriage,

88
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
tricking you out of

89
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,760
your Mare Nubium shares,

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,270
using marital co-ownership

91
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,160
to carve up

92
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,560
your family's vast fortune.

93
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,160
I have no right

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,760
to ask for your forgiveness.

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,510
But Haimeng,

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,730
I'm leaving this video message

97
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,480
to tell you that

98
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,150
I want to change the plan.

99
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,960
I won't follow my father's plan.

100
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,830
I've already made the arrangements.

101
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,950
Once my local friends

102
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,430
at the honeymoon hotel—

103
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,870
acting on my father's orders—

104
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,000
make you disappear,

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,920
I will secretly

106
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,430
get you out of the hotel.

107
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,190
My friends will take you away immediately

108
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,070
and make sure

109
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,040
you're safe.

110
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,710
I will return to China

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,270
and take, according to my father's plan,

112
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,950
some of your Mare Nubium shares.

113
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,350
After we use those shares

114
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,680
to obtain enough resources to support

115
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,360
Changlu Group

116
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,800
for its revival,

117
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,390
I will return to you

118
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,560
and personally explain

119
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,070
everything that happened.

120
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,800
This is already

121
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,830
the only solution I could come up with

122
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,830
under such extreme circumstances—

123
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,360
the only way

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,480
to protect my family,

125
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,560
my love,

126
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,960
and to avoid hurting you.

127
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,560
So Lu Sinan actually

128
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
had people at the hotel ready

129
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,510
to fake your death

130
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,070
and get you out.

131
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,220
I don't believe it.

132
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,700
If his plan was to take me away,

133
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,390
why did he push me

134
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,360
into the pool?

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Why did someone rush into the room?

136
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,330
And why did we still get into

137
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,270
that car accident?

138
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,390
Was that accident...

139
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,930
really an accident?

140
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,400
There's one last thing.

141
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,680
If my plan fails,

142
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,040
if I stay in Monaco

143
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
and never return—

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,330
What is Lu Sinan saying?

145
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,450
Haimeng,

146
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,240
if I die in Monaco,

147
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,950
please,

148
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,040
do whatever it takes

149
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,180
to take back Mare Nubium completely.

150
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,630
I already sense that,

151
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,480
to prevent the Lu family
from being destroyed,

152
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,310
my father

153
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,920
would do anything,

154
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,560
even make you and me

155
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,710
disappear together.

156
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,330
What Lu Sinan meant was

157
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,820
that he was forced by his father
to marry you.

158
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,030
He wanted to use this sham marriage

159
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,840
to take over

160
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,270
your shared Mare Nubium shares.

161
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,870
But three days before departure,

162
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,200
he recorded this video.

163
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,850
In the video, he said

164
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,580
there was a good chance

165
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,520
that he and you would both be made

166
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,360
to disappear.

167
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,600
Lu Sinan said

168
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,550
he might stay in Monaco forever.

169
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,240
He had a feeling

170
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
that his father

171
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,520
would want him dead.

172
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
How could that be?

173
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,910
Lu Sinan is the eldest son
of the Lu family.

174
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,790
He's Lu Changdong's biological son.

175
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,390
Lu Changdong using Lu Sinan's son

176
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,510
to threaten him

177
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,120
is already unbelievable.

178
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,080
How could he possibly

179
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,280
want to kill Lu Sinan?

180
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,130
Could it be that,

181
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,550
besides Lu Sinan wanting to harm me

182
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,530
and make me fake my death in Monaco,

183
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,270
his father

184
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
wanted to kill us both?

185
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,860
[Mr. F]

186
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,960
The honeymoon hotel footage

187
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,160
you asked me to check—

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,120
I could only find one clip,

189
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,360
just a few dozen seconds long.

190
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,720
I've sent it to your phone.

191
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,780
Please take a look.

192
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,840
This is the CCTV footage

193
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,240
from the hotel back then.

194
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,870
So...

195
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,150
someone really did try

196
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,150
to kill Lu Sinan.

197
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,320
Today, I suddenly remembered

198
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
that Sinan once sent me

199
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,120
some unexpected photos

200
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,790
and a strange message
when you were overseas.

201
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,360
I don't know

204
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,650
with your equity case.

205
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,240
Are you safe these days?

206
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,950
When are you coming back?

207
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,760
[Lu Sinan]

208
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,220
[Someone is following us.]

209
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,920
[Four years ago, Monaco]

210
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,910
What happened?

211
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,720
Sir,

212
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,670
are you alright?

213
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,360
Haimeng!

214
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
What's going on?

215
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,080
Do you need help?

216
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,630
Excuse me?

217
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
Room service.

218
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,810
We didn't order room service.

219
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,410
It was your wife who ordered room service.

220
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,450
What are you doing?

221
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,080
You work for Mo.

222
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,880
My father wants me dead.

223
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,600
He wants to get rid of Haimeng and—

224
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,390
Only the dead can keep secrets.

225
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,840
Sinan?

226
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,440
Sinan!

227
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,870
Go!

228
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,120
Let's go!

229
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,550
Get in the car.

230
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,720
Sinan,

231
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,750
who are they?

232
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,510
Thieves or robbers?

233
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,320
Should we call the police?

234
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,380
I'll make the call.

235
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,360
If anything happens to us,

236
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,620
don't contact anyone.

237
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,200
Don't ask anyone for help.

238
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,240
Don't trust anyone!

239
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,770
What are you talking about?

240
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,440
Remember what I said.

241
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,200
Haimeng.

242
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,120
Haimeng, calm down.

243
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,390
Haimeng!

244
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,200
Haimeng.

245
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,160
That's impossible.

246
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,200
Lu Sinan and I

247
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,600
could never be like that.

248
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,600
No.

249
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,550
I have to find him.

250
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,290
I need to get to the bottom of everything.

251
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:36,910
Ms. Ye!

252
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,550
Haimeng!

253
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,090
Where is she going?

254
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,200
She's not going to Cloud Manor

255
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
to find Lu Changdong, is she?

256
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,530
Follow her.

257
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,090
That's roughly the situation.

258
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,680
I'll go check it out.

259
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,120
Ms. Ye,

260
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
it's so late. You—

261
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,480
Ms. Ye!

262
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,360
Dad!

263
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,390
Haimeng!

264
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,150
What are you doing?

265
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,750
If your intention in trying to kill me

266
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,750
was to gain control of Mare Nubium,

267
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,870
why did you kill Lu Sinan?

268
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,630
He was your son,

269
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,720
your own flesh and blood.

270
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,910
Today,

271
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,510
you're not here because of my younger son,

272
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,600
but because of my eldest son.

273
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Even a tiger will not eat its own cub.

274
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,630
Why were you so cruel

275
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,960
to Lu Sinan?

276
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,510
He was the heir to Changlu Capital—

277
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,240
my own eldest son—

278
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,960
yet he never once sought

279
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,090
to seize the company

280
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,870
or enlarge our fortune.

281
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,270
He even went behind our backs

282
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,000
to get married and have a child.

283
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
Just because he lost his mother,

284
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,150
does that mean he also lost

285
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,480
the warmth of a family?

286
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,910
I let him grow up freely.

287
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,390
Was that my failure

288
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,200
as a father?

289
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,720
He was weak, timid,

290
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,960
and had no ambition.

291
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,840
How could he ever be worthy

292
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,080
of being my son?

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,510
How could he possibly

294
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,240
succeed me at Changlu Capital?

295
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,510
So you decided to kill him?

296
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,150
Being able to sacrifice for the family

297
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,630
is his glory.

298
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,080
To me,

299
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,910
other than Changlu Capital,

300
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,480
which I've built with

301
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,910
all my blood and sweat,

302
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,710
no one is exempt from sacrifice.

303
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,510
If anyone harms

304
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,960
the Lu family's interests

305
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,150
or stands in the way of Changlu Capital,

306
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,440
no matter who they are—

307
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,630
even my eldest

308
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,200
or my youngest son—

309
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,670
they must die.

310
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,730
That's all twisted logic.

311
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,840
In this world,

312
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,120
there's more—

313
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,270
far more precious—

314
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,310
than money, profit,
capital, and your desires.

315
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,589
Rubbish.

316
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,349
All that so-called

317
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,720
affection, love,

318
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,000
family, friendship—

319
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,510
nothing but trash.

320
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,270
Your trash can't be traded

321
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,670
for a single cent of gain.

322
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,510
It can't buy you

323
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,920
any means to survive.

324
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,200
In a world

325
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,829
this cruel and ruthless,

326
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,160
there's only fighting—

327
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,829
no compassion.

328
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,440
Why are you laughing?

329
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,350
I'm laughing

330
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,310
because you're truly pitiful.

331
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,680
What did you say?

332
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,070
In your world,

333
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,900
there's only darkness

334
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,070
and no light,

335
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,550
only malice

336
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,030
and no goodness.

337
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,400
You've never felt

338
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,750
a family's love,

339
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,070
You've never

340
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
been looked up to by your sons

341
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,240
or admired by your wife.

342
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,680
Your whole life is nothing

343
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,750
but money,

344
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
ruthlessness,

345
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,240
and murder.

346
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,590
You think

347
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
that by accumulating wealth,

348
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,110
you can control the world.

349
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,500
Let me tell you,

350
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,090
that's impossible.

351
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,720
