3
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,150
I already had high expectations

4
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,039
for him.

5
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,200
Who would've thought he'd be this great?

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,789
Exactly!

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,310
You're really incredible

8
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:03,790
and so handsome!

9
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,430
Can we take a photo together?

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,560
Sure.

11
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,800
Thank you.

12
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,400
Could you sign an autograph for me?

13
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,080
Just sign it on my phone case, please.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,590
Sure.

15
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,360
Done.

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,030
Thank you.

17

Could you...

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,150
You're welcome.

19
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,360
Sign on my hand?

20
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,360
Please sign one for me.

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,630
Help me.

22
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,430
Hello.

23
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,800
My surname is Song.

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
I'm Song Yang.

25
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,870
Lu Siyu and I

26
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,280
met at a club competition

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,140
abroad before.

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,470
We're kind of

29
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,730
competition friends.

30
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,750
Hello.

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,470
I noticed you were here

32
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,560
throughout the entire competition today.

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,310
Did you come

34
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,079
specifically to accompany Lu Siyu?

35
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,000
Are you two also

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,079
good friends?

37
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,960
Friends?

38
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,560
No.

39
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,310
Then are you

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
his relative?

41
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,810
His cousin?

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
No, not that either.

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,820
Then are you his agent?

44
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,210
Training partner?

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,400
Coach?

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,170
What exactly are you trying to say?

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,120
I'm saying if you two

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,470
don't have any relationship,

49
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,310
could we exchange

50
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,570
contact information?

51
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,310
No.

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,960
You...

53
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,400
This

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,240
is my boyfriend.

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,000
Is that so hard to believe?

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,150
What misconception made you think

57
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,910
she's my coach,

58
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,710
agent,

59
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,560
or relative?

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,910
Let me tell you.

61
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,710
She is my

62
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,590
official,

63
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,520
genuine,

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,050
and properly acknowledged

66
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,150
This is so unfair!

67
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,680
It's fine that I lost to you
in the competition.

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
But I finally find someone...

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,630
Sorry.

70
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,190
And I lost to you again.

71
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,430
Lu Siyu, you're unbelievable!

72
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:44,840
I...

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,560
I hate you.

74
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,110
Why did you talk to him like that?

75
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,960
He was trying to steal you

76
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,090
right in front of me.

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,030
You

78
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,430
are mine.

79
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,190
Don't go.

80
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,960
Why are you ignoring me?

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,030
You've said everything.

82
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,120
What else can I say?

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,630
Of course you should respond

84
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,870
to my love confession.

85
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,360
No matter what happens,

86
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,750
you are my whole life.

87
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,520
What about you?

88
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,070
What do you think?

89
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,060
Is your whole life

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,970

I'm clearly a "senior toddler"!

Are you implying

I'm a kid again?

My heart aches for

138

all the pain you've suffered.

I hate myself

140

for not being able to share

141
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,630
the pain with you.

142
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,500
None of those has anything to do with you.

143
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,680
Forget those things

144

okay?

146
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,650
Besides, none of these

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,600
is your fault.

148
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,320
I've already forgotten all about them.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,240
You should too.

we won't break up.

160

I promise you.

No matter what happens,

162
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,870
we

163

will never break up.

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,720
All the financial records inside

357
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,030
are identical to what we have here.

358
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,690
Why continue investigating?

359
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,750
Because I don't believe there could be

360
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,080
such perfect accounts.

361
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,270
There must be something wrong.

362
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,870
We just haven't found it yet.

363
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,790
If we look carefully enough,

364
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,720
we'll definitely find some clues.

365
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,440
Are you suspicious of the finances

366
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,400
or of our Ye family?

367
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,110
Or are you

368
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,030
actually suspicious of my father?

369
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,740
What are you really trying to say?

370
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,830
The Ye family has always been

371
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,830
the controlling family

372
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,360
of Mare Nubium Hotel Group.

373
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,550
The group's finances for the past decade

374
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,310
have always been in my father's hands.

375
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,030
Since you arrived at Mare Nubium,

376
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,160
you've been constantly auditing

377
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,880
all of the group's accounts.

378
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,170
Earlier it could be understood

379
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,270
as Haimeng's return requiring

380
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,600
you to reorganize the finances and taxes.

381
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,590
But now,

382
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,000
my father has already shown

383
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
all the hidden financial summaries

384
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,920
to you.

385
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,640
Why do you still

386
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,170
persist in investigating?

387
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,920
Ling Ke.

388
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,680
Your persistence doesn't make me think

389
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,960
that you're doing this

390
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,750
to help Haimeng regain control

391
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,240
after her return.

392
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,400
It makes me think

393
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,070
you're targeting our Ye family

394
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,790
and my father specifically.

395
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,120
Your feeling is correct.

396
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,030
I am targeting

397
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,270
your Ye family.

398
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,510
I am specifically targeting

399
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,270
your adoptive father, Ye Yuezhi.

400
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,030
And then?

401
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,310
Are you going to turn against me

402
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,040
and stand on the opposite side?

403
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,960
I'm not.

404
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,830
After you and Haimeng returned,

405
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,760
I've never wanted to be your enemy.

406
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,270
But

407
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,440
if you want me to be your partner,

408
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,880
at least you need to tell me

409
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,200
what exactly you're looking for,

410
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,060
what you want to do and how to do it!

411
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,310
Ling Ke.

412
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,550
I don't want to hurt you.

413
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,960
I want to help you.

414
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,310
Save it.

415
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,830
You don't even dare to stand up
to your adoptive father.

416
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,560
How could you possibly help me?

417
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,520
I don't care what you think of me.

418
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,110
Today I need you to tell me the truth.

419
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,110
Go away!

Have you ordered yet?

432
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,350
I heard this restaurant's

433
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,590
signature dishes are really delicious.

434
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,050
It's my treat. I'll order.

435
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,480
Look at the time.

436
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,860
You just now remembered
to treat me to a meal?

437
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,830
Fine.

438
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,170
Next time when you're not around,

439
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,680
I won't drink again.

see me drinking again,

442
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,730
you have to keep an eye on me.

443
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,960
I really don't want to sleep

444
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,760
with my cardboard cutout again.

445
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,350
How about

446
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,610
I don't go back to my room tonight?

447
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,070
Are you serious?

448
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,680
Let's eat.

449
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,400
You saved this for me?

450
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,960
Yes.

451
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,130
It's delicious.

452
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,550
But Siyu,

453
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,200
the competition is over

454
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,400
and you've got the medal.

455
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,070
Let's head back to Haijiang

456
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,330
first thing tomorrow.

457
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,720
I still have

458
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,550
a pile of things to deal with

459
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,410
at Mare Nubium.

460
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,550
Okay.

461
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,550
The archery club

462
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,510
just called me too.

463
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,000
They said they found a new location
for the club

464
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,510
and wanted me to go back to check it out.

465
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,160
Then let's

466
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,400
pack our luggage this afternoon

467
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,030
and head back early tomorrow morning.

468
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,550
Okay.

469
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,720
Haimeng.

470
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,110
Even though

471
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,790
you're here with me for the competition
this time,

472
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,240
being away from Haijiang

473
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,900
and from the Ye and Lu families

474
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,270
gives me a sense

475
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,310
of peace

476
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,540
and happiness.

477
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,590
So after we go back,

478
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,560
let's keep things this way,

479
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,590
okay?

480
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,000
Of course.

481
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,730
As long as we're together,

482
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,880
even when we return to Haijiang,

483
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,720
we don't need to care about

484
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,380
others' opinions and stares.

485
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,510
As long as you're with me,

486
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,280
we can always be this happy.

487
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,880
Let's go back to our rooms

488
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,080
and pack our luggage.

489
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,110
Okay.

490
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,550
I'll call you later.

491
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,400
Okay.

492
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,790
What?

493
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,840
You're just leaving like that?

494
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,750
You're really leaving?
