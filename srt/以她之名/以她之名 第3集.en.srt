00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,490
[Return of the Queen]

2
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,450
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
Siyu?

4
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
It's you.

5
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,180
That day at the lounge bar—

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,410
Yes, that was me.

7
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,720
So?

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,079
I just

9
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,440
didn't expect

10
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,570
to run into you here.

11
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,410
I'm here to see Haimeng.

12
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Oh, right.

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,810
You came back together.

14
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
We haven't gotten

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,200
to know each other yet.

16
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,460
I'm Haimeng's cousin.

17
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,040
My name is Ye—

18
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,079
Ye Bochen.

19
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,160
You know my name?

20
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,920
I don't just know your name.

21
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,560
I know your position

22
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,480
at Mare Nubium.

23
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,579
I know everything about the Ye family

24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,400
you and Haimeng belong to—things you know,

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
and things you don't.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,720
You...

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,400
Don't stick your nose

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
where it doesn't belong.

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,920
Don't meet people

30
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
you shouldn't.

31
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,720
Focus on holding onto

32
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,480
your spot at Mare Nubium.

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
Guard

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,120
your heart.

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,520
Otherwise,

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,320
you'll lose it someday
without even realizing it.

37
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,280
Bochen,

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
what's wrong?

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,060
Did Ye Bochen give you a hard time?

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,170
This has nothing to do with him.

41
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,930
Sometimes I really want to ask—

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,440
why did you come back?

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,360
Was it to get close to the Lu family,

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,480
or the Ye family?

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,960
What secrets

46
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
are you hiding in your heart?

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,050
You really want to know?

48
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,399
Aren't you afraid

49
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,200
I might turn out to be your enemy?

50
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,180
I already have plenty of enemies.

51
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,220
One more won't make a difference.

52
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,360
What did you find

53
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,520
in Lu Siyu's suite?

54
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,320
Show me.

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,360
Time was too tight this time.

56
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,960
I couldn't open the lock box.

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,080
But—

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,900
I did find something else.

59
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,460
[Siyu, don't forget to check in with Dad.]

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,760
What's strange about this?

61
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,159
[Siyu, don't forget to check in with Dad.]

62
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
This is Du Meiyun's handwriting.

63
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
This is just Du Meiyun's

64
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
note of instructions

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,680
to her youngest son.

66
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,760
What does it have to do

67
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,740
with the clues we're looking for?

68
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,170
[Siyu, don't forget to check in with Dad.]

69
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,840
[Tianyang]

70
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,480
The term "Tianyang"

71
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,800
doesn't sound like something

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,240
a normal business would use.

73
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Unless it's a pharmaceutical company

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,000
or a business

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
in health

76
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,160
and wellness.

77
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,240
Du Meiyun would only use the term

78
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,760
on a document

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,000
in two cases:

80
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,520
either at the sanatorium of

81
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,040
Lu Changdong,
who's been ill away from home,

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,160
or at a health-related business

83
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,400
secretly owned

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,920
by Du Meiyun—

85
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,120
or even

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
by the Lu family.

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
Could it be...

88
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,159
They sent my mother

89
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,400
to a wellness center?

90
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,480
I've already looked into

91
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,280
all of the Lu family's businesses
on the surface.

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,600
There's no such company.

93
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,560
Then we need to dig deeper.

94
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,880
Pull up everything

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,800
on Changlu Capital—

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,840
all shareholders,

97
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,800
directors,

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,640
silent partners,

99
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,680
and affiliated businesses
under their name,

100
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,040
especially those connected

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,520
to the healthcare industry.

102
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,720
Check them one by one.

103
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,490
We will definitely find it.

104
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,520
And we will, without a doubt,

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,920
get to her before they do,

106
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,890
and rescue your mother.

107
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

108
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,570
Why are you still up so late?

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,920
Ye Haimeng forced me into

110
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,080
such a tiny room.

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,800
As soon as I go in,

112
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,720
I can barely breathe.

113
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,160
How am I supposed to sleep?

114
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,440
It's not that bad.

115
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
It's still a suite, isn't it?

116
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,040
How could a guest room on the first floor

117
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,800
ever compare to

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,240
the master bedroom upstairs?

119
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,320
And your wife

120
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,650
is being pushed around,

121
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,720
but you're just standing there
doing nothing.

122
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,760
I don't know

123
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,840
what possessed me

124
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,370
to go along with my mother's wish
to marry you.

125
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,560
Don't take everything out

126
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
on me, will you?

127
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,920
All these years in your Lu family,

128
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I've been working diligently,

129
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,760
almost like a son.

130
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,420
Like a son? That's not enough.

131
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,320
You're my husband.

132
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,520
You should be fully devoted

133
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
to the Lu family.

134
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,080
Especially now—

135
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,440
my father's away,

136
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,480
my brother's still immature,

137
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,640
and my mother and I
are under attack from all sides.

138
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,280
This is when you need to

139
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,480
step up.

140
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,480
I get it now.

141
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,600
Whatever you have to say,

142
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,460
just be direct.

143
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,650
My mother said the other day

144
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,320
that she has a way

145
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,640
to transfer Ye Haimeng's uncle's

146
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,040
Mare Nubium shares

147
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,890
into the Lu family's hands.

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,040
But to me,

149
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,480
it doesn't sound too reliable.

150
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,440
Still, the fact that Ye Haimeng

151
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,360
dared to return to Cloud Manor

152
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,840
means she must already have a plan
in place.

153
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,720
Jiang Lin,

154
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
Mare Nubium is still

155
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,770
in our hands for now.

156
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,440
We can't just stand by

157
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
and watch Ye Haimeng

158
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,450
and that woman she brought back

159
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,200
take Mare Nubium away from us.

160
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,460
What plan do they have?

161
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,180
If we just wait for them to act,

162
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,760
we're sitting ducks.

163
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,940
What do you want to do then?

164
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,280
We must

165
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
strike first.

166
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,930
Go ahead.

167
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

168
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,960
Siyu,

169
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,440
are you heading out?

170
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:30,840
Yes,

171
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Bochen mentioned

172
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,600
a new sports center

173
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,039
that'd be perfect
for starting an archery club.

174
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm thinking of checking it out tonight.

348
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,880
and now this accident...

349
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,280
I said I don't need it.

350
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
I'll try to persuade her.

351
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,840
Alright.

352
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,920
Call me if you need anything.

353
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Thank you so much.

354
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,500
Be careful.

355
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,160
How is he?

356
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,600
You're asking about Lu Siyu?

357
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,400
In this accident, apart from me,

358
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,980
he was the only one else involved, right?

359
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,320
Just a mild concussion,

360
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,250
some scratches.

361
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,360
That's good.

362
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,200
He's the youngest son of the Lu family.

363
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,840
Everyone in the Lu family

364
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,320
treats him like a precious gem.

365
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Even if something happened to him,

366
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,080
there'd be a crowd rushing to save him.

367
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,240
In that moment,

368
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,680
the last person who should have been there

369
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,520
was you.

370
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,280
He was driving my car.

371
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,920
I didn't want to involve innocent people.

372
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,800
Innocent?

373
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,320
Don't forget—

374
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,440
he's a Lu.

375
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,720
Remember

376
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,360
what you've been through

377
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
these past three years.

378
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,200
And remember

379
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,760
why you came back to the Lu family.

380
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,360
Don't let someone
who shouldn't even be here

381
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,880
disrupt

382
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,280
three years of planning.

383
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,370
And don't throw around
words like "innocent"

384
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
just to get close to
someone you should stay away from.

385
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,080
I remember.

386
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,440
Don't worry.

387
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,900
[Tea Room] [Duty Room] [Inpatient Area]

388
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,120
Mom.

389
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,500
What are you doing?

390
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,200
You want to hit my mother?

391
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
Open your eyes and see

392
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,480
who started it.

393
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,220
I'm not just going to start it—

394
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,560
I'll teach you a proper lesson

395
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,280
on behalf of Sinan

396
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
and your dead father.

397
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,800
What did you say?

398
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,240
What's wrong?

399
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,240
Can't handle it

400
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,440
when I mention Sinan?

401
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,320
I don't care

402
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,850
why you came back this time.

403
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,480
Direct all your strength

404
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,560
at the Lu family.

405
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,280
Come at me.

406
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,240
But don't you dare touch my son.

407
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,880
If it weren't for me today,

408
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,320
your son would already be dead—

409
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,400
If it weren't for you today,

410
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,000
he wouldn't have run into

411
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,960
such bad luck.

412
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,920
So instead of going after

413
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,040
the person who sabotaged my car

414
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,800
and tried to hurt others,

415
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,960
you're blaming me

416
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,280
for saving your son.

417
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,720
Am I right?

418
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,640
Why are you looking at me like that?

419
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,170
I don't care who caused this

420
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,160
or who's targeting you.

421
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,920
Anyway,

422
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,240
your survival

423
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,160
is your own concern.

424
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,080
Siyu

425
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,140
only suffered minor injuries today,

426
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,880
so I'll let you off this time.

427
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,800
But remember,

428
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,400
stay away from Siyu from now on.

429
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,800
If I ever find you

430
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
near him again,

431
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,400
causing him even the slightest harm...

432
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
I will never let you get away with it.

433
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,480
Siyue.

434
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,400
Tell Jiang Lin to send someone

435
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,060
to guard your brother's room.

436
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,840
No one may enter

437
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,480
without our permission,

438
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,460
particularly those specific individuals.

439
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,200
Yes, Mom.

440
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,010
I'll arrange it right away.

441
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,000
Madam instructed us

442
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,920
to take her potted plants

443
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,080
out into the sun.

444
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,320
Siyu.

445
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,520
Why are you out of bed?

446
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,560
I've been sleeping
all the time in the hospital.

447
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,800
Then I slept for several more days
after coming home.

448
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,920
I've slept so much that my head hurts.

449
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
But the doctor said

450
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,720
that during this accident,

451
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,800
you hit your head.

452
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,800
You should be resting in bed.

453
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,800
Why is the house so quiet?

454
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,680
Is nobody home?

455
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,480
Madam left early this morning.

456
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,280
She said
she had something important to do.

457
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,600
Siyue is meeting friends.

458
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,060
Mr. Jiang Lin went to work.

459
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,880
And the others?

460
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,320
The others?

461
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,840
Do you mean

462
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,280
Ms. Ye upstairs?

463
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,400
No,

464
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,560
I was just asking.

465
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,440
Siyu.

466
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,240
Don't mind me rambling.

467
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,280
Ms. Ye...

468
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,640
I thought you weren't here.

469
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,480
I've been back

470
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,400
from the hospital for several days now,

471
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,920
but I haven't seen you at all.

472
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,120
I need to talk to you.

473
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,610
But I have nothing to say to you.

474
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,040
Does it have to be like this?

475
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,700
Why are you being so cold to me?

476
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,640
Did I do something wrong?

477
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,160
Or do you just dislike me?

478
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,640
Yes,

479
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,640
I dislike you.

480
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,040
Why?

481
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,600
Dislike is dislike—

482
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,800
there doesn't have to be a reason.

483
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,730
Get out of my way.

484
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,320
If you dislike me,

485
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,480
then why did you save me?

486
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,160
Because you were in my car.

487
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,280
I didn't want anyone

488
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,800
to have an accident in my car.

489
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,720
If it were a stranger,

490
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,180
I would have done the same.

491
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,560
Is this explanation

492
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,820
satisfactory enough?

493
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,170
You didn't want to watch me die,

494
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,800
did you?

495
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,960
Is it because

496
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,810
my brother died in front of you?

497
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,840
Don't try to analyze me,

498
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,300
and don't pretend you understand me.

499
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,000
That night,

500
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,280
it was just on a whim

501
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,320
that I staged a little accident.

502
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,400
It had nothing to do

503
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,360
with who you are.

504
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,280
You'd better

505
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
erase it

506
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,160
from your mind.

507
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,610
Keep your distance.

508
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,330
Don't provoke me again.

509
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,860
Don't come any closer.

510
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,560
What if I don't want to?

511
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,480
I don't want to stay away from you.

512
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,810
I want to be close to you.

513
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
Can you please stop pushing me away?

514
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,560
Lu Siyu.

515
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,440
I can't pretend

516
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:10,960
nothing happened

517
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,360
that day.

518
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,840
Even though

519
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't know what happened

520
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,440
between you and my family,

521
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440

with my brother,

in my most dangerous moment,

525
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,440
you saved me.

from the person who saved my life.

528

I've been waiting for you.

530
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,720
I just wanted

531
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,980
