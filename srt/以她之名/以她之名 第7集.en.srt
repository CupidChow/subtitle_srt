00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,080
or my family?

180
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,950
[Dictionarium Latino-Sinicum]

181
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:11,030
[Dictionarium Latino-Sinicum]

182
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,840
So you two met through

183
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,640
a Latin literature dictionary.

184
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,050
No wonder my brother taught you Latin.

185
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,940
That also explains

186
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,560
why my brother valued

187
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,890
these old books so much.

188
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,680
My brother

189
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,170
must have treated you well, right?

190
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,840
I-I don't mean anything by that.

191
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,200
I just noticed

192
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
the huge painting hanging in our home.

193
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,160
I heard my brother

194
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,690
had it custom-made for you.

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,600
And in my memory,

196
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,840
he was always

197
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,640
such a gentle and caring person.

198
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,450
Actually, I took up archery

199
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,850
because of his encouragement.

200
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,920
Sinan,

201
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,120
it's so heavy.

202
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,500
I can't lift it.

203
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,050
You can do it.

204
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,640
Siyu,

205
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,480
you need to believe in yourself.

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,320
You can draw the bow

207
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,880
and hit the bullseye with one shot.

208
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
One day, you'll be

209
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,240
the most accomplished among the Lu family.

210
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,680
You'll bring home

211
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,160
the most, the best,

212
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
the most dazzling championships.

213
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,120
I can do it.

214
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,400
I'll bring home

215
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,600
the most, the best,

216
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,810
the most dazzling championships.

217
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
Brother, I hit it!

218
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,880
I really hit the target!

219
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,280
One day, I'll win championships.

220
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,000
I can bring home many championships

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
for the Lu family.

222
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,880
Actually, when I was little,

223
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,080
no one in my family

224
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,680
allowed me to learn archery.

225
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,960
Only my brother

226
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,970
firmly supported me all along.

227
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,520
Even my studies abroad

228
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,160
were all thanks to my brother

229
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,560
who constantly helped me.

230
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,160
School,

231
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,120
coach,

232
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,160
accommodation—

233
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,800
everything was personally

234
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,920
arranged by him.

235
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
My brother often told me

236
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,290
to bring back more championships,

237
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,360
so that

238
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,120
when people

239
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,720
think of the Lu family,

240
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,000
they wouldn't just think of
the Changlu Group,

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,260
but also the youngest son of the Lu family

242
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,480
achieving outstanding results

243
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,800
on a bigger, broader stage.

244
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,280
Sinan.

245
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,930
Sinan, look.

246
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,720
I won an excellence award
in this competition.

247
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,240
Just an excellence award isn't enough.

248
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,760
From now on, you

249
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,820
must only bring back championships.

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,480
This little butterfly

251
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,810
will serve as your motivation.

252
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,760
When you win all the league championships,

253
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,520
only then can you take it off.

254
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,840
All league championships?

255
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,160
I believe you can do it,

256
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,120
right?

257
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,600
My brother has always been
gentle and understanding,

258
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,530
yet determined.

259
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,680
Right?

260
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,200
Do you still miss him?

261
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
He's gone.

262
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,410
The moment I received
the death certificate,

263
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,080
my marriage with Lu Sinan

264
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,920
legally

265
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,120
came to an end.

266
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,120
I have no connection

267
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,770
with the Lu family anymore.

268
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,480
I know.

269
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,600
Between you and our family,

270
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,480
all that remains now is

271
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,740
the matter of dividing the inheritance.

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,880
Cloud Manor

273
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,220
and the Mare Nubium Hotel—

274
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,980
they all belong to you.

275
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,130
What did you say?

276
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,640
Even though I've been studying abroad,

277
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,560
I know

278
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,900
that the Mare Nubium Hotel

279
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,180
has always been your parents' property.

280
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560
My brother only obtained

281
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,120
the shares

282
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,380
as marital property after marrying you.

283
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,680
Even Cloud Manor

284
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,840
was purchased

285
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,040
after your marriage.

286
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,900
My brother is gone now.

287
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,840
They shouldn't use this as an excuse

288
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,370
to forcibly take everything from you.

289
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm sorry.

290
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,080
Why are you apologizing?

291
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,920
I apologize for my family,

292
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,650
for not being able to stop them,

293
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,480
for not being able to do anything

294
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,200
to help you.

295
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,160

aside from the archery club,

297
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,320
I don't have much influence

298
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,480
over anything.

299
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,840
But if there's anything

300
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,000
I can help you with,

301
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,160
please come to me.

will you really help me?

304

in terms of project details.

387
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,040
There are calculation errors
in some items,

388
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,400
and there are even

389
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
a few minor reporting mistakes.

390
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
Take them back and redo them.

391
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,240
Why did the Engineering Department
only submit

392
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
this year's maintenance projects?

393
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,680
What about last year's?

394
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,140
And the years before that?

395
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,300
Manager Ye,

396
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,040
please go back

397
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,920
and compile all project records
of the Engineering Department

398
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,480
from the past five years

399
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,800
for me.

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Five years?

401
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,060
Is there a problem?

402
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,080
Engineering Department's audit reports

403
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,400
are finalized every three years.

404
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,240
The past five years' reports

405
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,640
have already been audited and archived.

406
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
It's impossible to retrieve them now

407
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,680
for a re-audit.

408
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,800
Who decided

409
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,040
that archived reports
can't be re-examined?

410
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,840
The former Vice President.

411
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,920
Mare Nubium's annual audit

412
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,400
concerns the entire group's income

413
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
and expenditures.

414
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,120
With the new president just returning,

415
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
a review

416
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,400
is absolutely necessary.

417
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,720
Not just the Engineering Department,

418
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,120
but the entire group's projects

419
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,450
from the past five years

420
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,480
must be re-examined if necessary.

421
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,740
Audit Manager,

422
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,040
re-examine all
of the Engineering Department's accounts

423
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,880
from the past ten years.

424
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,040
All of them?

425
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,080
Yes.

426
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
Any other questions?

427
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,800
No.

428
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,090
Meeting adjourned.

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,760
Are you dissatisfied
with the new president

430
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,640
or with me?

431
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,530
I wouldn't dare.

432
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,010
You're the new Vice President of Finance.

433
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,420
I can only follow your instructions.

434
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,810
How could I possibly be dissatisfied?

435
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,260
But your eyes and your expression

436
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,280
seem to tell a different story.

437
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,040
I understand

438
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,680
that Haimeng needs to take control

439
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,440
of the entire Mare Nubium
when she returns.

440
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,400
But now,

441
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,760
carrying out such an extensive audit
across all departments,

442
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,520
I really don't believe

443
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,780
it serves the company's best interests.

444
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,520
Then may I ask, Manager Ye,

445
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
what should Haimeng and I

446
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,680
do at this moment?

447
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,520
If Haimeng wants to reclaim
Mare Nubium's shares,

448
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,600
she should address the Lu family properly.

449
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,800
After Sinan's death,

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,400
the division of inheritance
should either follow

451
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,560
legal procedures,

452
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,920
or the elders
of both the Ye and Lu families

453
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,760
should come together,

454
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,880
place the interests

455
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,560
of both families first,

456
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,290
and resolve the matter fairly,

457
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
without harming anyone.

458
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,960
As for Mare Nubium,

459
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,400
our focus should be

460
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,640
on maintaining unity and stability,

461
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,760
not letting shareholders

462
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,200
feud and settle personal scores,

463
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,480
which would only create internal turmoil.

464
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,960
Have you ever heard the term

465
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,120
"idealist"?

466
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
An idealist

467
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,680
hopes that the world

468
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,920
is pure and just.

469
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,400
They believe

470
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
that people in the world

471
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,720
are kind at heart.

472
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,890
But what about reality?

473
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,760
If you don't know how to protect yourself—

474
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
or if all you know
is protecting only yourself—

475
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,400
then you

476
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,240
and everything you own

477
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,200
will eventually be carved up

478
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,280
and torn apart.

479
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
There's nothing wrong with being kind.

480
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,800
But being kind alone—that's the mistake.

481
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,000
This has nothing to do with kindness.

482
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,280
The Ye family and the Lu family

483
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,160
could never achieve

484
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,320
what they want

485
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,520
through ordinary legal means.

486
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,960
Cloud Manor and Mare Nubium

487
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
will never return

488
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,560
to Haimeng without a fight.

489
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,280
Even the Ye family

490
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,080
you've humbled yourself to protect

491
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,040
can't possibly

492
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,500
remain peaceful forever.

493
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,580
Those secrets buried underwater

494
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,000
will eventually

495
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,400
come to light one day.

496
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,720
The Ye family's secrets?

497
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,040
Know where you stand.

498
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,580
Take care of yourself.

499
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,320
Have you seen enough?

500
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,040
What if I say no?

501
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,240
Then next time,

502
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,580
please come in five minutes earlier.

503
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,640
Why do I feel

504
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,740
that your attitude toward him

505
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,640
is quite peculiar?

506
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,520
I'm just doing my job.

507
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,000
Nothing like some people

508
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,860
who spend all their time together

509
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,580
in far more delicate circumstances.

510
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,730
What do you want from me?

511
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,280
President Ye,

512
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,040
Ms. Ling,

513
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,120
I just received a call.

514
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,080
Director Xia from our company

515
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,600
has rallied several group shareholders

516
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,840
and secured nearly half

517
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,760
of the board's authorization.

518
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,240
They're carrying
the authorization resolution

519
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,280
and are already on their way

520

to the President's Office.

[Mare Nubium]

524
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,160
I got a call from Director Chen yesterday

525
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,840
asking about it.

526
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,640
The board meeting
still has to be convened.

Otherwise,

all of these company decisions—

[Mare Nubium]

530
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,560
President Ye is here.

Please get up.

532
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,720
So what if she's here?

533
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,640
I came today

534
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,250
specifically to speak with President Ye.

535
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,980
I was only gone for a few minutes,

536

[Mare Nubium]

537
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,940
yet everyone's already in an uproar.

538
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,840
Director Xia,

539
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,220
what's the matter?

540
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,760
I've been following your father

541
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,520
and your uncle

542
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,920
in working with Mare Nubium

543
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,800
all these years.

544
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I watched helplessly

545
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,360
as your Ye family went through upheaval.

546
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,920
Fortunately, the Lu family
you married into

547
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,440
had the backing of a major capital group,

548
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,400
Changlu Group.

549
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,040
Their support

550
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,520
kept Mare Nubium

551
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,120
from collapsing.

552
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,160
Back then, we all thought

553
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,680
you had left with Lu Sinan,

554
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,650
yet here you are, alive.

555
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,770
As a human being,

556
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,770
you shouldn't be so heartless.

557
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,920
Just say what you want to say.

558
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,120
Since you don't want to listen,

559
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
I won't beat around the bush either.

560
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,360
This is Mare Nubium's resolution,

561
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,720
signed by nearly half

of the board's shareholders.

563
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,800
We demand that the Ye and Lu families—

564
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,760
specifically Lu Sinan and Ye Haimeng—

565

566
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,800

567

We further demand

568

[Mare Nubium]

569
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,240
that a general shareholders' meeting
be convened

570
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
to determine who holds

571
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,400

575

577
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,280
that in seven days,

on the fourth anniversary
of Mr. Lu Sinan's death,

a meeting will be held
for all shareholders and the press.

We also request that President Ye

attend on time.

583

Director Xia,

584
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,600
you issued a public announcement

585
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,860
without senior management's approval.

586
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,650
That's effectively a coup.

587

Ms. Ling,

588
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,610

You'll destroy Mare Nubium this way.

Seven days later,

597
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,460
see you at the public meeting.

598
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,080
Why did you agree to that?

599
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,280
They're just carrying out
the Lu family's orders,

600
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,440
doing their dirty work.

You mean Du Meiyun?

602
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,280
Before we returned to the Lu family,

603
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,160
we had a plan:

604
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,800
[Mare Nubium]

605
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,240
Return to Cloud Manor

606
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,800
and gain the upper hand.

607
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,200
Following the leads,

608
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,120
we found my mother's whereabouts.

609
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
With my mother's inherited shares,

610
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,760
we regained

611
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,400
control of Mare Nubium.

612
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,000
Last time,

613
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,920
we also recovered
Mare Nubium's official seal

614
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,170
[Mare Nubium]

615
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,040
and intercepted

616
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,760
their application
to change the legal representative.

617
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,920
And before the Lu family could react,

618
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,480
we secured

619
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,210
Lu Sinan's death certificate.

620
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
So the actual control

621
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,980
rests firmly in our hands.

622
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,000
The only thing I'm missing is

623
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,440
outright control

624
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,520
of Mare Nubium's board.

625
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,480
Without a clear majority stake

626
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,920
in Mare Nubium,

627
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,420
if the minor shareholders unite,

628
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,000
my authority as President won't be secure.

629
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,560
And to win the majority,

630
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,960
we need to divide

631
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,520
the joint shares Sinan and I held.

632
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,960
That's the only leverage
the minority directors have over me

633
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
and the Lu family's last trump card.

634
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,960
You mean

635
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,400
the property custody agreement

636
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,680
Lu Sinan left behind?

637
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,520
Yes.

638
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,320
We've never managed to obtain

639
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,250
that agreement.

640
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,080
As long as it remains
in the Lu family's hands,

641
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,960
they'll continue to hold on to

642
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,640
37% of Mare Nubium's shares.

643
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
That means I can't become
the company's majority shareholder,

644
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,280
and certainly can't secure

645
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,010
absolute control of the board.

646
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,240
This is indeed

647
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
the Lu family's biggest trump card.

648
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,850
So what do you plan to do?

649
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,540
Return to Cloud Manor.

650

You're going back there yourself?

652
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,000
The item is in Lu Siyu's room.

653
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,600
And it's the room
where Lu Sinan used to live.

654
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,280
No one but me

655
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,330
could possibly open it.

656
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,040
No, it's too dangerous.

[Mare Nubium]

658
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,180
You were almost caught last time.

659

No matter how dangerous it is,

660
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,460
can it be worse than death?

661
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,800
Three years ago,

662
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,880
I already died once.

663

This time,

Where is Lu Siyu?

668

He's been in his room the whole time.

692
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,120
where you put

693
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,000
all that money.

694
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,040
That's my own money.

695
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,960
Do I really need to report

696
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,120
to the family every time I spend?

697
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,650
Let's go.

698
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,160
Mom wants to ask you herself.

699
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,760
Sis.

700
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,600
Let's go.

701
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,640
Wait a moment.

702
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,880
What's wrong?

703
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,040
Something's off today.

704
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,300
You'd better not go in.

705
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,780
Haven't fixed the surveillance?

706
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,080
It's not about the surveillance.

707
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
It's about Lu Siyue who just appeared.

708
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,400
Don't you find it strange?

709
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,760
They were checking accounts
in the middle of the night

710
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,890
and took Lu Siyu away

711
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,460
without closing the door.

712
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
It must have been Lu Siyu

713
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,440
who invested a large sum of money,

714
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,040
and now his family is asking about it.

715
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,000
The open door

716
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,680
doesn't seem odd

717
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,280
Lu Siyu

718
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,520
wouldn't have set a trap.

719
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,290
Why do you trust him so much?

720
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,770
[Don't forget—]

721
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,320
[he's a Lu.]

722
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
We're out of time.

723
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,760
We must get the agreement today.

724
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,000
Tell Jie

725
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,400
to take care of the surveillance cameras.

726
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,080
Ye Haimeng!

727
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,920
Are you half asleep?

728
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,960
What's this about checking accounts

729
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,420
in the middle of the night?

730
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,730
Mom isn't even here.

731
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,280
Siyu, open the door.

732
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,520
I need to talk to you.

733
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,560
What is it now?

734
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,400
Can't whatever it is

735
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,600
wait until tomorrow?

736
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,720
It's so late.

737
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,680
No.

738
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,200
I have to tell you now.

739
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,840
Open up!

740
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,520
I'm already in bed.

741
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,480
Open the door, Siyu.

742
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,450
Who's there?

743
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,320
Who is it?

744
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,290
What's happening in your room?

745
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,440
Open the door, Siyu!

746
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,640
Open up!

747
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,760
Lu Siyu, open the door!

748
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,040
Siyu, open the door now.

749
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,760
Open up, Siyu!

750
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,720
Open the door!
