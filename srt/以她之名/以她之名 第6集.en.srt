00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,160
I didn't see you just now.

19
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,480
I thought you couldn't get out of bed.

20
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
I usually get up early
for morning training.

21
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,440
Besides, for an important appointment
like this,

22
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,080
I usually

23
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,560
arrive earlier than the other person.

24
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,890
Do you have many important appointments?

25
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,200
Give me.

26
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,280
What?

27
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,720
My medicine.

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,320
Don't tell me you forgot again.

29
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,120
Of course not.

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,640
Although I don't care much

31
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,800
about family matters,

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,930
I would never forget

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,250
what I promised you.

34
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm very reliable, sis.

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,760
Just leave it to me.

36
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,360
You don't need to be so close.

37
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,480
Last time when you had a fever
and passed out,

38
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,800
the doctor gave a lot of instructions,

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,040
but you didn't hear them.

40
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,840
The doctor prescribed

41
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,600
different medications for your symptoms.

42
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,520
Some are for reducing fever.

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
Some are for reducing inflammation.

44
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,960
Some are oral and some are topical.

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,760
I'm worried you might

46
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,240
take the wrong medicine or miss doses.

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,760
So

48
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,040
I've sorted them all

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,320
and put them in this little box.

50
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,360
When you go to work,

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
take this box with you.

52
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
Time and dosage are marked on it.

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,680
You can follow these instructions.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,399
Every day...

55
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,160
Lu Siyu.

56
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,680
Whether I take

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,320
these medicines

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
or not

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,280
is my own decision.

60
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,120
So

61
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,320
you really do hate me.

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,120
I don't.

63
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,280
I don't hate you.

64
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,480
I'm just not used to

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,880
people getting so close.

66
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,810
For all these years,

67
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,490
I've been taking care of myself alone.

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,560
I'm used to it.

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,840
You don't hate me.

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,880
That's great.

71
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,000
Remember

72
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,320
to take these medicines on time.

73
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,680
The doctor said
your old injury is infected.

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,560
You should take your medicine on time

75
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,890
so you can recover soon.

76
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,240
What's wrong?

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,360
It's so bitter.

78
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
What are you laughing at?

79
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm laughing because

80
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,960
when you argued with my mom

81
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,520
and Siyue,

82
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,260
you were so fierce,

83
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,000
but now, just taking the medicine

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,530
makes your face scrunch up.

85
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,200
When I was little,

86
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,400
I didn't like taking medicine either.

87
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,080
My family would

88
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,010
often give me these fruit candies.

89
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,400
Just one tiny piece

90
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,159
can take away the bitterness
in your mouth.

91
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,560
If someday you feel

92
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,960
your medicine is bitter,

93
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,960
your work is tough,

94
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,090
or your life is hard,

95
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,000
then just

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,440
unwrap one and eat it.

97
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,330
It will surely bring sweetness
to your heart.

98
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
Childish.

99
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,080
There weren't this many books before.

100
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
Did you buy them

101
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,260
after you moved in?

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,800
No.

103
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,480
I asked Mr. Mo

104
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,200
to help me

105
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,660
sort these out in advance.

106
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,800
These are your books?

107
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,640
Most of these books

108
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,730
were actually bought for me by my brother.

109
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,560
Actually,

110
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,490
I started learning archery

111
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,260
because of my brother's encouragement too.

112
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Since there are

113
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
very few books on archery theory here,

114
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,880
every time my brother goes
on a business trip abroad,

115
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,240
he brings back some theory books

116
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,640
for me.

117
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,400
German.

118
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,560
English.

119
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,000
Latin.

120
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
All these books

121
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
are original foreign editions.

122
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,520
Can you understand them?

123
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,880
I can manage

124
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,000
German and English.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,730
For Italian,

126
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
I rely on the translator too.

127
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,280
But Latin...

128
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,760
I don't know why

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
my brother bought

130
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,500
these Latin originals for me.

131
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,960
In this day and age,

132
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,559
who can still understand Latin?

133
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,159
I can.

134
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
You know Latin?

135
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,720
Just a little bit.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
And

137
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,299
it was Sinan who taught me.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
That's still better than me.

139
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,400
Do you have time these days

140
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,360
to help me

141
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,730
translate the tables of contents?

142
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,680
Just use these short

143
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,560
morning hours.

144
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,640
You only need to translate the contents

145
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,700
of one or two books.

146
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,400
There are also my brother's notes in them.

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
If you can understand them,

148
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,660
that would be perfect.

149
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,120

gives me less trouble

than Sinan and Siyue.

386

for the past few years

388

But Siyu,

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,400
have you ever thought

390
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,720
about taking over Changlu Group for me

391
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,319

392

398
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,440
As for

399
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,000
Mare Nubium,

400
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,440
I don't think

401
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,840
we should take it back.

402
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,560
Why did you say that?

403
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,440
Because

404
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Mare Nubium

405
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
was originally the Ye family's property.

406
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,520
It was only after my brother
married Ye Haimeng

407
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,640
that he obtained it

408
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,770
as shared property.

409
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,760
After such a major accident,

410

my brother is gone,

411
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,800
and the Ye family
has suffered greatly too.

412
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,720
Ye Haimeng barely

413
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,780
made it back alive.

414
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,560
We shouldn't use marriage

415
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,690
to hold her hostage.

416
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,600
Besides, I think

417
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,820
Ye Haimeng did nothing wrong.

418
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,920
We shouldn't treat her this way.

419
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,120

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,080
don't apologize now.

519
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,040
I'll tell you everything.

520
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,560
Please spare me, President.

521
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,200
Tan Xin,

522
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,560
take her away

523
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,440
and hand her over to the police.

524
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,480
Please spare me, President.

525
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,600
I'm begging you.

526
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,400
President!

529
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,620
Answer the phone, Ye Haimeng.

Hello.

532
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,000
You finally answered my call.

533
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,720
Ye Haimeng.

534
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,640
Kid,

535
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
who gave you permission
to call me by my name?

536
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,280
You should call me...

537
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,940
This isn't the time for jokes!

538
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,080
I just ran into Jiang Lin

539
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,140
in the parking lot.

540
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,920
I saw him holding

541
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,880
a document

542
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,400
with my brother's name

543
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,260
and photo on it.

544
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
If I'm not mistaken,

545
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,840
he's probably filing

546
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
a death declaration for my brother.
