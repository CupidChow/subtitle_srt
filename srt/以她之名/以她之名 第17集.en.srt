00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,510
I have a conference call

176
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,200
at 2 p.m. tomorrow

177
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,960
and an overseas video call

178
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
at 4 p.m.

179
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,390
And at 5 p.m., I...

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,630
Tomorrow is

181
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,000
my first competition
since I came back to China.

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,910
Plus, I'm the top-seeded player

183
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,600
in the tournament.

184
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,360
If you don't

185
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,200
show up tomorrow,

186
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,750
I might get nervous,
and my hands might shake.

187
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,120
Then the entire archery club's reputation,

188
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
along with over a decade

189
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,270
of my competition points,

190
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,910
would all be gone.

191
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,970
Is it that serious?

192
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,910
So,

193
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,040
President Ye,

194
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,510
could you possibly spare a little time

195
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,120
amid your busy schedule

196
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,000
to accompany me

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
to this important competition?

198
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,600
The busy President Ye

199
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,550
prioritizes her career, of course.

200
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,810
You focus on your competition tomorrow.

201
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,240
The view up there looks nice.

202
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
Let's go check it out.

203
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,630
Didn't you come

204
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,630
to accompany me to the competition?

205
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,670
Why are you busy with work again?

206
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,390
Haimeng.

207
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,390
Haimeng?

208
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,320

just ran up there.

213
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,080

Me?

Thank you.

219
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,750
Bye bye.

What is it

290
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,750
that you had to arrange a private meeting

291
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,720
at a place like this?

292

Is our house not enough for you?

293
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,200
I just thought

294
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,240
it's been a long time

295
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,550
since I had a meal alone with you.

296
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,240
I want to treat you
to some signature dishes here.

Signature dishes?

298
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,440
You make it sound so good.

299
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,480
Go ahead.

300
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,340
What do you want to say to me alone?

301
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
I want to ask you...

302
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,270
about this.

303
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,930
Where did you get this?

304
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,390
Dad!

305
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,360
So this thing

306
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,840
really is yours?

307
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,550
It really is the secret ledger

308
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,510
of Mare Nubium?

309
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,750
You're here to trick me into talking?

310
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,270
Using this to threaten me?

311
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,150
Are you trying

312
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,150
to get me killed with this,

313
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,270
or drag the entire Ye family down

314
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,200
with you?

315
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,870
Ye Bochen,

316
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,480
you'd better get your head straight.

317
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,320
You were adopted by me and Xiao Ting

318
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,030
from the orphanage.

319
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,600
And we raised you

320
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,840
with our own hands!

321
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,510
Even though we're not

322
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,720
your biological parents,

323
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,870
we at least deserve

324
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,320
some gratitude for raising you.

325
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
Instead of showing your gratitude,

326
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,510
you're biting the hand that fed you!

327
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,750
Of course I remember

328
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,320
Mom and you

329
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,000
painstakingly

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,390
raised me.

331
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,720
But

332
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,610
I've spent the past 20 years

333
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,360
repaying your kindness.

334
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,000
Is that still not enough?

335
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,080
What did you say?

336
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,240
I've been an adopted son

337
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,840
in the Ye family for 20 years.

338
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,270
Have you ever once

339
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,720
treated me as your son?

340
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,510
At home, I've always

341
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,910
obeyed your every word.

342
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,080
I've been devoted to Mom too.

343
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
I did whatever you told me

344
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,030
to do.

345
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,360
Whatever life you wanted me to live,

346
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
I lived

347
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,120
under your direction.

348
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,840
But

349
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,790
you've never been satisfied with me.

350
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,030
Then you should

351
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,240
reflect on yourself!

352
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
How come everything you did

353
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,030
could never satisfy me?

354
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,750
No!

355
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,720
It's not what I did

356
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,670
that couldn't satisfy you!

357
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,080
It's me

358
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,130
who couldn't satisfy you!

359
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,270
It's because

360
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:35,870
my very existence

361
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,200
is a daily reminder

362
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,240
that your marriage with Mom

363
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,910
has an irreparable flaw.

364
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,960
It's because

365
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,670
although I'm called your son,

366
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,480
I'm also proof

367
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,390
that you can never have

368
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,990
a biological son of your own.

369
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,320
You bastard!

370
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,320
I adopted you from the orphanage,

371
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,670
raised you for over 20 years,

372
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,440
gave you the Ye family name,

373
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,630
just so you can

374
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,670
humiliate me,

375
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,510
mock me,

376
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,910
and betray me here today?

377
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,630
Ungrateful jerk.

378
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,360
Talk if you want.

379
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,960
Don't think hitting your son

380
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,440
makes you look like a father.

381
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,600
It's you again.

382
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
This is my family matter.

383
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,850
It's none of your business.

384
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,480
I have no interest

385
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,480
in your family's affairs at all,

386
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,000
but...

387
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,200
You're spineless out there,

388
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,030
so you can only take your anger out

389
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,390
on your own son.

390
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,320
Someone like you

391
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,000
doesn't deserve to be called Father

392
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,120
by Ye Bochen.

393
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,510
What did you say?

394
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,630
Someone like you

395
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,840
doesn't deserve to be called Father

396
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,720
by Ye Bochen!

397
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,510
I'm giving you two options now.

398
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,270
Either

399
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,870
go back to Mare Nubium's office tomorrow

400
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,870
and obediently open

401
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,870
all those secret flash drives

402
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,480
in the drawer,

403
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,550
or

404
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,760
I'll call the police right now.

405
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,940
And we'll meet at the police station.

406
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,750
You're threatening me?

407
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,400
Yes,

408
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,200
I am threatening you.

409
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,400
From today onwards,

410
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,680
your opponent is me

411
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,750
and Mare Nubium,

412
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,720
not Ye Bochen.

413
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,640
If you ever again despise him

414
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,550
or mistreat him

415
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,510
because of his background,

416
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,270
I will

417
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,070
settle this score

418
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,270
with you

419
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,720
bit by bit.

420
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,280
Come with me.

421
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,830
There aren't many shops around here.

422
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,590
Just this.

423
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,450
Make do with it.

424
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,680
Feeling better now?

425
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Actually, I've imagined many times

426
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,960
how it would be

427
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,090
to revisit old matters with my father.

428
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,790
But I never thought

429
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
it would be today,

430
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,000
here,

431
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,200
in front of you.

432
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,640
In front of me,

433
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,440
there's no need to feel ashamed.

434
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,950
After all, I'm the one

435
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,650
who pressed you for the password.

436
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,600
It has nothing to do with you.

437
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,610
The relationship between him and me—

438
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,750
I've really endured it for far too long.

439
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,830
Outwardly,

440
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,350
I'm his nominal son.

441
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,510
But in this family,

442
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
I'm his lifelong shame.

443
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
How could you tell

444
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,750
our brother and sister-in-law

445
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,720
that he was adopted from an orphanage?

446
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,440
But that's the reality.

447
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,030
You never said I couldn't tell anyone.

448
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,960
What did you say?

449
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,590
Telling them

450
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,440
proves

451
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,830
that I, Ye Yuezhi, am impotent.

452
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,070
Isn't it the same as telling them

453
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,350
we can't have a son?

454
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,480
That we have no heirs
and we're a dead branch?

455
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,010
How can you think like that?

456
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,880
Bochen is already part of our family.

457
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,000
He is our son.

458
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,920
Bullshit!

459
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,240
He's just a bastard!

460
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,720
Every time he stands in front of me,

461
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,110
I feel like he's slapping me in the face!

462
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,240
Do you understand?

463
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,100
Let me tell you!

464
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,240
Not a single cent

465
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
of my family's wealth will go to him!

466
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,400
I, Ye Yuezhi,

467
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,920
have no son!

468
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,640
From that day on,

469
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,550
I knew clearly

470
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,440
that I could never become

471
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,840
the child he envisioned.

472
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,920
So I could only carefully

473
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,480
obey his every word

474
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,880
and follow every arrangement he made.

475
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Sometimes, even I myself

476
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,720
didn't know

477
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,180
what I was actually doing.

478
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,240
I didn't know where my future

479
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,270
lay either.

480
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Sometimes,

481
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,070
we fall too deep—

482
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,270
not because
the other person is so captivating

483
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,830
or manipulative,

484
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,550
but because we subconsciously believe

485
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,400
that if we just hold on a little longer,

486
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,880
if we try a little harder,

487
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,350
they'll change for us,

488
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,400
and we can win their favor.

489
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,350
But Ye Bochen,

490
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,350
do you know what

491
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,750
Haimeng's life motto is?

492
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,240
Haimeng?

493
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,110
She told me

494
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,450
her greatest wish in life is

495
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,750
to see herself.

496
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,070
To see...

497
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,640
herself?

498
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,200
She said

499
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,510
sometimes we get trapped

500
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,880
in our original families.

501
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,720
Sometimes,

502
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,030
we get trapped

503
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,430
in our original emotional relationships.

504
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,880
We always strive outward,

505
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,250
but often neglect ourselves,

506
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,090
overlook our own emotional needs,

507
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,200
and forget that we

508
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,750
matter too.

509
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,290
Your adoptive parents

510
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,210
took you in from the orphanage,

511
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,270
provided you with food,
clothing, and shelter,

512
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,330
changed the trajectory of your life,

513
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,440
and influenced your entire life.

514
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,300
That kindness—

515
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,720
you should repay it.

516
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,890
But the path of your future life

517
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,450
needs to be walked by yourself.

518
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,000
The path of my life

519
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,170
should be walked by myself?

520
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,190
Take a good look at yourself.

521
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,750
Ask yourself

522
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,350
where you want

523
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,200
to go.

524
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,400
Be brave!

525
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,650
Think clearly,

526
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,640
and then

527
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,310
move forward.

528
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,480
Madam.

529
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,400
Madam's journey this time

530
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,550
will take over 10 hours.

531

You've misunderstood, Madam.

Chairman is

538
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,680
just concerned about your migraines.

539
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,550
This time, he's hired

540
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,350
better doctors

541
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,810
and a better nursing team.

542
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,230
You make it sound so good.

543
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,890
But you're just trying to silence me.

544
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,800
Getting you medical treatment—

545
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,000
what's wrong with that?

546
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,640
Fine.

547
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,920
I'll go.

548
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,830
I won't appear before you.

549
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,880
But

550
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,240
Lu Changdong,

551
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,000
my son and daughter are

552
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,640
under your care now.

553
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,300
Since you're sending me away,

554
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,490
you'd better treat them well.

555
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,480
If I hear even the slightest hint

556
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,590
of trouble concerning them

557
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,550
while I'm away,

558
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,580
I'll haunt you even as a ghost.

559
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,550
Madam,

560
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,480
we should leave early.

561
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,240
Don't miss the flight.

562
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,170
Get out of my way.

563
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,200
Chairman.

564
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,440
Send someone to keep a close eye on her.

565
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,640
Don't return until her plane takes off.

566
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,510
We can't let her reveal anything

567
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,790
that would ruin our plans.

568
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,070
Rest assured.

569
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,960
When will the people

570
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,840
from the Middle East arrive?

571
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,070
I contacted them a few days ago.

572
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,110
They expressed

573
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,750
strong interest in collaboration.

574
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,750
They should formally send the letter

575
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,830
within a few days.

576
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,200
Mm.

577

Everything hinges on this.

578

We don't have much time left.

579
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,750
Indeed.

Where is Siyu?

Ye Haimeng?

586
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,310
Of course,

have also been keeping tabs.

She still has the leisure

590

to attend an invitational tournament?

591
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
It seems

592
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,590
the pressure Sinan put on him back then

593
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,270
was too light.

594
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,070
Do you have confidence

595
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,350
in winning this match?

596
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,950
Of course.

597
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,110
I've done a lot of targeted training

598
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,640
for this match.

599
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,920
Winning this match is something

600
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,450
I'm determined to achieve.

601

Someone you know?

602

Mm.

in university leagues before.

607
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,940
Based on past records,

608
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,680
it's about 40-60.

609
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,220
You're 40, and he's 60?

It's fine.

613
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,440
It's just an invitational tournament.

614
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,030
Even if I lose,

615
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,240
it's not a big deal.

616
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,300
Anyway, no one in the Lu family now...

617
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,880
I no longer have to carry the burden

618
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,350
of winning glory for the Lu family,

619
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,400
nor do I have to think about the pressure

620
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,260
of winning for my brother's sake.

621
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,720
So,

622
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,510
if I lose, so be it.

623
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,070

the butterfly on my shoulder guard
