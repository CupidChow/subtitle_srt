[Episode 4]

3
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,240
Kid,

4
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,940
I'll give you one more chance.

5
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,600
Look me in the eyes

6
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,560
and repeat

7
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,160
what you just said.

8
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,780
What do you want to hear...

9
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,640
sister?

10
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,900
Who are you calling "sister"?

11
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,620
Say it a few more times.

12
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,840
Let me hear it.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,660
Wasn't that what you taught me

14
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
in the study that day?

15
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,680
I taught you,

16
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,010
and you learned it well?

17
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,420
I didn't expect you

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,090
to be such a good boy.

19
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,680
Too bad.

20
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
In this lifetime,

21
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,880
I will always be a Ye,

22
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,840
never a Lu.

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,680
Lu Siyue

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,920
is your dear sister.

25
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,460
As for you and me...

26
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,000
Stay away from me.

27
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,800
Ye Haimeng!

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Have you forgotten

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,640
all the warnings I gave you?

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,040
I told you long ago that

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,240
if you dared to approach my son again...

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,840
Haimeng.

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,820
You don't remember me?

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
No, that's not it.

35
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,120
I understand

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,560
that this situation is

37
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,120
quite difficult for you.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Although

39
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,760
you and Sinan

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,400
used to call me "Dad,"

41
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,840
Sinan is

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,480
no longer with us.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,360
If you're willing,

44
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,040
you can still call me

45
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,000
Uncle Lu, like you did

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,960
when your father and I worked together

47
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,200
back then.

48
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,370
Please, sit.

49
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,520
A few days ago,

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,980
they told me you were back.

51
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,170
I couldn't believe it at first.

52
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,560
After all, it's been 3 years,

53
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,800
and you've been completely out of touch.

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,360
I sent people everywhere to look for you,

55
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,640
but they found nothing.

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,839
I thought I would

57
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,200
never see you again in this lifetime.

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,320
Even now,

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,840
I often recall

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,240
the first time Sinan brought you

61
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,040
to meet me at the hotel.

What's wrong?

66

I'm a bit scared.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
I feel uneasy about this.

What are you afraid of?

70

What if

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,080
your father doesn't like me

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,480
and disapproves

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,760
of our relationship?

[Gan Jiang 12]

How could that be?

76
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
My dad and your father are
business partners.

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,760
He's watched you grow up.

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,880
And you're sensible and gentle.

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,460
He couldn't ask for
a better daughter-in-law.

You don't need to
worry about anything else.

Dad.

86
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,320
I've brought her with me.

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,840
Hello, Uncle Lu.

88
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,640
Sinan,

89
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
no wonder you've turned down

90
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,520
all the blind dates

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,920
Auntie Du set up for you.

92
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,840
Turns out

93
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,440
you've secretly fallen for Haimeng
all along.

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,800
Dad,

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
please stop talking about blind dates.

96
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
If Auntie Du knew

97
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,600
that the girl you love is

98
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,530
the only daughter of the Ye family,

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,440
she wouldn't set up
any blind dates for you.

100
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,200
She would be pushing you two

101
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,520
to get married right away.

102
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,080

Haimeng,

104
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,330
I hope you don't mind

105
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,440
joining our Lu family.

106
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,730
It's such a tragedy that...

107
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,520
my poor son

108
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,800
is gone.

109
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,000
Haimeng,

110
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,160
for the past 3 years,

111
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,440
where have you been,

112
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,040
and what have you been doing?

113
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Why, for 3 whole years,

114
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,960
did you not contact us?

115
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,760
During these 3 years,

116
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,500
I narrowly escaped death time and again.

117
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,850
It's all thanks to Sinan

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,520
that I'm alive today.

119
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,159
Once I sort everything out

120
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,360
between him and me

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
and between the Ye family
and the Lu family,

122
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
I will find an appropriate public occasion

123
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
to reveal everything that happened

124
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
in these 3 years.

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,120
Okay.

126
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,920
Since you don't want to talk about it,

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,960
I won't force you.

128
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,010
As an elder of the Lu family,

129
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,520
I cannot mistreat you.

130
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,360
This Cloud Manor

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,960
was originally purchased by
both our families

132
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,040
as a wedding home

133
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,600
for you and Sinan.

134
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
Give me a few weeks.

135
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,360
I'll have them clean

136
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
the manor until it's spotless

137
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,860
and hand it over to you.

138
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,130
I'll take everyone in my family

139
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
and move to the villa in the suburbs.

140
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,240
As for Mare Nubium...

141
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
when

142
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,440
such a big incident happened

143
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,960
to you and Sinan back then,

144
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,200
I took it upon myself

145
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,560
to have Jiang Lin and Siyue

146
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
manage it on your behalf.

147
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,760
Now that you're back,

148
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,840
I'll have them hand it all over to you

149
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,240
as soon as possible.

150
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,420
Are you really going to

151
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,120
return Mare Nubium to me?

152
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,400
It must be.

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
Because this company

154
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
was your parents'

155
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,120
life's work,

156
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,280
wasn't it?

157
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,159
If it weren't for the huge incident

158
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,320
that happened to you and Sinan back then,

159
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,520
our two families—the Ye and Lu families—

160
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,120
should have formed

161
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,280
a powerful alliance.

162
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,210
Our position in the business world

163
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,920
would be

164
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,800
much stronger today.

165
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,760
If you really can arrange

166
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,600
to return Mare Nubium and Cloud Manor

167
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,560
to me,

168
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll be...

169
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
eternally grateful.

170
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,600
What are you saying, silly child?

171
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,000
We should be

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,600
the ones apologizing to you.

173
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,960
Now, if anything happens,

174
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,840
or anyone dares to make things difficult

175
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,200
for you in this family,

176
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,120
just tell me.

177
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,620
As long as I'm here,

178
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,500
I promise you won't suffer

179
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,280
even the slightest grievance.

180
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
In 2 days,

181
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,280
it'll be my 60th birthday.

182
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,039
I've been thinking of

183
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,280
hosting

184
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,360
a family banquet here.

185
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,490
During the banquet,

186
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,039
you can also make an announcement

187
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,920
about Sinan

188
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
to everyone.

189
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,520
After the banquet,

190
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
we'll return everything

191
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,080
that rightfully belongs to you.

192
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,320
Having second thoughts?

193
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,360
No.

194
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,240
I just feel that something's off.

195
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,300
Don't let a small gesture of kindness

196
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,160
fool you into trusting someone

197
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,020
who has never revealed his cards.

198
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,280
In business,

199
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,920
Lu Changdong and my father worked together

200
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,160
for over a decade.

201
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,930
When profit is at stake,

202
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,410
you choose to believe in human nature?

203
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,420
Have you found anything about Tianyang?

204
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,640
After that car accident last time,

205
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
they must have noticed

206
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,840
our activities.

207
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,360
We need to rescue my mother

208
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,360
before we alert them.

209
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,120
Tonight,

210
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,240
many people will attend Lu Changdong's

211
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,570
60th birthday banquet.

212
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,560
My second uncle's family

213
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,280
will also be there.

214
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,400
If I see them,

215
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,280
I'll ask about the shares

216
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,120
they've been holding on my mom's behalf.

217
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,720
We've found information

218
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
about Tianyang.

219
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,640
What?

220
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,720
It turns out

221
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,200
what's on the note isn't "Tianyang"

222
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,130
but "Yang Tian."

223
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,450
What do you mean?

224
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,960
There's a large

225
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,200
retirement community in the suburbs.

226
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,160
Its official name

227
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,420
is "Yi Yang Tian Nian."

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,000
We traced through layers of ownership
and shell companies

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,120
and finally found

230
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,720
a nominee shareholder.

231
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,320
She's the wife of

232
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,980
a Changlu Group board member.

233
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,720
A retirement community?

234
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,930
Changlu Group's people hold shares in it?

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
It's common practice

236
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,640
for hidden shareholders
to use their wives as proxy holders.

237
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,800
Plus, there are multiple layers

238
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,960
and changes
in corporate equity structures.

239
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,480
And Changlu Capital Group

240
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,740
is a company that started in real estate.

241
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,680
All that evidence

242
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
clearly proves

243
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,640
that the retirement community

244
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,560
is one of the businesses

245
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,890
owned by Changlu Group.

246
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,240
And then?

247
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Does that mean...

248
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,360
Within that community,

249
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,480
there's a very high-end,

250
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,240
very secretive medical center.

251
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,000
It means that after your accident,

252
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,480
your mother has very likely been

253
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,240
hidden in

254
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
that medical center.

255
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,880
Notify Tan Xin

256
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,680
to immediately dig up all information

257
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,640
about the shareholders

258
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,000
and actual controllers
behind that medical center

259
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,320
and investigate Changlu Group thoroughly.

260
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,600
By any means necessary,

261
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,640
get the list

262
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,080
of all patients—

263
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,320
age, blood type,

264
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,480
symptoms, medical conditions—
and cross-check everything.

265
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,080
We must

266
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
find my mother.

267
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,330
Haimeng.

268
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,380
It's been too long.

269
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
We saw each other

270
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,560
at my funeral that day.

271
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,640
But with everything happening that day,

272
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,560
I really didn't have time

273
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,760
to come over and talk to you.

274
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,880
Later, I heard

275
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,010
you'd moved in here.

276
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
I actually came once,

277
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,480
but I still didn't get to see you.

278
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,120
I know.

279
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,760
Ke told me about it.

280
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,570
So that's what you call her.

281
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,760
Well...

282
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,840
is she a new friend of yours?

283
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
I remember when we were little,

284
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,680
I never

285
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,960
saw her around you.

286
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,820
How did you two meet?

287
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,040
Or...

288
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,500
You're interested in her?

289
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,040
No.

290
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,800
I'm just

291
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,960
a little curious about

292
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,220
the people around you.

293
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,120
Ye Bochen.

294
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,920
You're my cousin.

295
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,880
We grew up together.

296
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,440
I know exactly

297
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,170
what's on your mind.

298
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
If you really knew

299
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,450
what I was thinking,

300
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,760
then you wouldn't have married

301
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,800
Lu Sinan.

302
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,040
I remember warning you.

303
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
The Lu family is complicated—

304
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,440
parents and siblings

305
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
all have their own grudges.

306
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Behind Changlu Group,

307
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,360
there's a complex web of capital—

308
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
various investors,

309
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,000
shareholders,

310
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,680
and board members,

311
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,840
all tangled in interests.

312
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,160
It's much harder to navigate than

313
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,200
our Ye family and Mare Nubium.

314
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,260
But do you remember

315
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,700
what you told me back then?

316
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,360
I forgot.

317
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,800
You said

318
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,840
you believed

319
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,480
Sinan truly loved you.

320
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,600
Cousin,

321
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,040
don't you think

322
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,280
what you're saying right now

323
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,040
is rather offensive?

324
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,920
On the contrary, I think

325
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I should have had

326
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,120
this conversation with you 3 years ago.

327
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Then you wouldn't have experienced

328
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,040
such a terrible accident

329
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,240
and suffered so much.

330
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,560
I know.

331
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,730
Whether it was back then or now,

332
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,040
in such a complex situation

333
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,900
with our family

334
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,480
and the Lu family,

335
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,640
you've always been

336
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,440
the one who truly cared about me.

337
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,940
But I couldn't see you,

338
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,160
because I was afraid that once I saw you,

339
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,880
I'd lose my courage to fight.

340
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,120
Not everyone

341
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,640
in this world is like you—

342
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,560
able to hide their wounds

343
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,600
and forgive everyone,

344
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,640
even after being hurt

345
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
and betrayed.

346
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,800
Not everyone

347
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,960
deserves forgiveness.

348
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,080
Not everything

349
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,280
is worth tolerating.

350
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,200
I must take back

351
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,930
everything that belongs to me.

352
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,730
As for you...

353
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Whether you choose to be my friend
or my enemy,

354
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,800
let me know

355
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
once you've decided.

356
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,760
Haimeng.

357
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
Where are you going?

358
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,680
Tonight,

359
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,160
I might...

360
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,120
It's my 60th birthday banquet

361
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,440
tonight.

362
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,480
You're not going to tell me

363
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,440
that you're going out now

364
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,280
to meet a friend

365
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,800
more important than me, are you?

366
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,440
I...

367
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,160
I want to formally

368
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,080
introduce you to

369
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,520
the shareholders and board members

370
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,360
of Changlu Group,

371
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,400
who used to work

372
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,760
with your parents.

373
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,240
I hope

374
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,680
our Changlu and your Mare Nubium

375
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,600
can still maintain

376
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,800
the same strong cooperation

377
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,880
as

378
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,000
when your parents were here.

379
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Tonight,

380
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,520
you can't go anywhere.

381
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,700
The board members of Changlu Capital...

382
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,480
Maybe

383
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,800
I can get some clues

384
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,360
about Mom from them.

385
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,160
Today

386
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,560
is my 60th birthday.

387
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,120
It's also

388
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,560
my first time back

389
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,640
after half a year of recuperation.

390
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,560
All of you here

391
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,360
are my family

392
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,760
and my relatives.

393
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,040
Everyone, please don't be reserved

394
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,000
or stand on ceremony.

395
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,840
In the future,

396
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll still need

397
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,560
all of your support.

398
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,400
Come on.

399
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,320
Let's raise our glasses.

400
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,720
Chairman, with you here at Changlu,

401
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,440
we're just

402
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,160
following your lead.

403
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,120
-Yes.
-Yes.

404
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,240
These past few years, Mare Nubium

405
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,970
has owed a lot to Changlu Group.

406
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,200
With Chairman Lu's

407
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,560
help and support,

408
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,680
we've achieved...

409
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,360
Director Xia is a straightforward person.

410
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
Every word he speaks

411
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,840
is honest and sincere.

412
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,480
Mare Nubium has gone through
ups and downs in recent years,

413
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,680
and it's all thanks to

414
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,210
the unwavering support of Changlu Group.

415
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,240
My daughter Siyue

416
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,640
and son-in-law Jiang Lin

417
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,320
are only acting as managers,

418
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,440
but

419
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,280
they work diligently and professionally
every day,

420
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,240
which has prevented Mare Nubium

421
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,040
from having any major problems.

422
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,960
I just don't know

423
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,400
whether Mare Nubium can remain

424
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,080
as strong as it is today

425
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
once it's divided

426
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,080
according to shareholding.

427
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,400
Mare Nubium

428
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,120
will never be divided.

429
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,520
Half of the group's shares

430
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,480
belong to Sinan.

431
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
And your second uncle

432
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,250
holds another portion.

433
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,600
No matter who holds the shares,

434
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,480
Mare Nubium

435
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,280
will never be divided.

436
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,200
I'd like to see who dares to

437
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,880
try to split up my Mare Nubium.

438
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,520
You...

439
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,240
What are you doing?

440
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,240
It's my 60th birthday banquet tonight.

441
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,800
Over such a trivial matter,

442
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,980
you have to make a scene in public?

443
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,960
Don't let the shareholders

444
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,600
laugh at our two families.

445
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,160
Dad,

446
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,720
on behalf of Mom, Jiang Lin,

447
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,920

450
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,720
I wish you

451

boundless fortune

452
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,400
and good health.

453
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,119
Okay.

454
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,119
Quite a few people came today,

455
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
but why do I feel...

456
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,359
Jiang Lin isn't here.

457
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,380
From our family, only Ye Bochen came.

458
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,250
Uncle Yuezhi and his wife aren't here.

459

the family banquet!]

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,080
What?

464

want to do here?

466
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
We won't do anything.

there's another

very important guest

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,480
I'd like to reintroduce to you.

484

Ye Haimeng.

491
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,560
You've probably seen me

on the news.

493
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,440
I am Ye Haimeng,

494
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,920
the only daughter

495

of Mare Nubium Hotel Group.

498
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,720
Haimeng is right.

499
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,920
She was once

500
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,600
the president of Mare Nubium.

501
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,060
But from now on, she will be

502

Haimeng to everyone today

508
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,960
because I want to
lay a stronger foundation

509
