Go ahead.

22
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,240
Why did you insist

23
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,170
that I bring the authentication report
to the scene?

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,850
Did you do it on purpose?

25
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,720
Yes.

26
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,480
Why?

27
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,720
You have so many people working for you.

28
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,800
You could have easily asked

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,320
them to get the book from me,

30
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,000
and then had Bochen

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,460
take the handwriting analysis
to the scene.

32
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,760
Why did it have to be me?

33
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,610
What do you think

34
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,760
is the reason?

35
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,720
Because your last name is Lu.

36
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,240
Only when you show up
with the authentication report

37
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,640
can I gain the trust

38
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,280
of the media and reporters at the scene.

39
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,440
Only when you personally

40
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,680

I don't.

50
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,760
I don't believe you're
this kind of person.

51
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,880
I don't believe you got close to me

just to use me

to hurt my family.

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,200
I told you long ago.

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
Don't get close to me.

56
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,120
Don't trust me.

Don't take my side.

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,880
I fought desperately

61
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,980
to survive that car accident,

62

for over 10 years,

151

due to the feud with the Lu family.

152
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,800
First of all,

153
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,840
choosing sides in the workplace

154
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,440
is something that

155

Secondly,

157

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,120
and misunderstood her.

176
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,680
Then...

177
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,460
What about you?

178
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,080
Me?

179
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,650
Where did you come from?

180
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,690
Where did you meet Haimeng?

181
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,280
How did you end up

182
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,000
coming back here

183
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,040
with her from abroad

184
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,370
after the car accident?

185
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,090
What's your real identity?

186
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,100
How long will you stay by her side?

187
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,920
Or

188
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,760
what exactly do you want?

189
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,760
You're so curious about me?

190
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,400
Yes, I am.

191
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
If you want to know my true identity,

192
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
why not trade one of your secrets

193
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,680
with me?

194
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,610
Secrets?

195
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,420
What secrets do I have?

196
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
For example,

197
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,140
your surname isn't really Ye.

198
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,160
Is it a secret?

199
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,400
How does it feel

200
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,800
to be the subdued adopted son
of the Ye family

201
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
for 20 years?

202
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,450
How did you know?

203
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,240
I've told you before.

204
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,280
I know all the secrets of your family,

205
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,210
whether they're

206
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,720
on the table, under the water,
hidden at home,

207
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,560
or buried underground.

208
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,440
I know them all.

209
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,600
Before I find evidence

210
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,760
for each one

211
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,170
of these secrets

212
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,880
and dig out the truth,

213
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
you'd better put away your kindness

214
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,740
and protect yourself.

216
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,370
[Mare Nubium]

217
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
Please be seated, everyone.

218
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,960
From today onwards,

219
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,880
Mare Nubium

220
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,780
has returned to the Ye family.

221
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,040
The control of the board

222
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,160
has also been transferred to me.

223
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,880
Everything from the past

224
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,810
is now behind us.

225
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,240
Today

226
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
is Mare Nubium's

227
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,680
first new workday.

228
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,360
We're starting fresh.

229
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,440
From now on,

230
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,320
you will all be the ones

231
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,470
moving forward with me.

232
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,930
[Mare Nubium]

233
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Please be seated.

234
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,720
[Mare Nubium]

235
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,770
Begin your reports.

236
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,680
From November 1st last year to now,

237
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,360
our property rental rate

238
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,560
has reached 79%.

239
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,800
Regarding operations,

240
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,320
we have already developed

241
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,440
the new year's marketing plan.

242
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,120
All major objectives

243
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,400
are progressing steadily.

244
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,560
The Legal Department

245
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
has accumulated quite a lot of work

246
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,090
over the past two quarters.

247
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,640
Besides

248
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,160
the termination contracts

249
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,440
from the HR Department,

250
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,800
there's also
the overseas investment agreement

251
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,600
that Mr. Jiang

252
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,000
and... Ms. Lu

253
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,640
pushed through

254
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,840
3 or 4 months ago.

255
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,460
Overseas investment?

256
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,480
Yes.

257
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,160
It's about our group's

258
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,290
joint venture brand stores overseas.

259
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,120
Before you returned,

260
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,120
Jiang Lin

261
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,560
and Ms. Lu

262
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,680
specifically went abroad

263
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,080
to visit 4 to 5 countries.

264
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,360
They planned

265
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,280
to purchase large parcels

266
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,800
of land there

267
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,040
to establish our new

268
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,820
overseas brand division.

269
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
They want to buy land

270
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,360
instead of acquiring hotels?

271
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,880
Yes.

272
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,560
But actually

273
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,680
when the former chairman was around,

274
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,360
our group

275
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,440
rarely purchased

276
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,240
land overseas.

277
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,000
We always bought

278
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,080
local brands

279
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,200
to develop them into

280
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,530
our own joint ventures.

281
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,920
That's right.

282
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
When my father expanded the market,

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
he never got involved in land deals.

284
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,560
Furthermore,

285
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,480
the transaction amount is indeed enormous.

286
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,600
So our department

287
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,530
didn't report it promptly.

288
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
But unexpectedly,

289
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
this delayed reporting

290
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,400
has caused

291
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,460
this investment agreement to stall.

292
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,200
It's still stuck like this until now.

293
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,060
And you've returned from abroad.

294
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,280
Being cautious was the right move.

295
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,240
Sort out this investment agreement.

296
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,480
Take it to the Secretary's Office

297
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,600
and hand it to Tan Xin.

298
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,200
Okay.

299
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,720
Tan Xin.

300
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,080
After you get the contract,

301
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,680
immediately investigate both parties
of the transaction,

302
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,880
their accounts, transaction records,

303
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,320
as well as the background and details

304
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,520
of the land involved.

305
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,400
After the investigation,

306
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,800
report everything to me.

307
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,490
Understood, President Ye.

308
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:53,120
[Mare Nubium]

309
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,320
Thank you, President Ye.

310
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,850
Anything for me to sign?

311
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,640
No.

312
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,250
So you're just going to stand there

313
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,200
staring at me?

314
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,119
I'm staying behind

315
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,740
to admire your beauty.

316
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,359
Alright.

317
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,280
I have two things to tell you.

318
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,839
First,

319
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,319
I would like to audit the accounts
of the Construction Department,

320
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,640
including but not limited to

321
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,280
all the projects handled
by your uncle Ye Yuezhi

322
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,560
during his tenure.

323
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,839
Approved.

324
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,800
But I should warn you.

325
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,119
Be careful about

326
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,480
Ye Bochen's reaction.

327
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,360
What?

328
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,400
You're worried I can't handle him?

329
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,560
I'm worried

330
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,640
he'll handle you.

331
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
The second thing?

332
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,300
I want to invite you

333
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,900
back to the penthouse.

334
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,120
Cloud Manor and Mare Nubium

335
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,000
have been successfully reclaimed by us.

336
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,400
The plans we made

337
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
in the penthouse

338
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,000
have all been accomplished.

339
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,000
So I think

340
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
all those files and photos

341
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,760
on the penthouse walls

342
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,160
should be taken down by you personally.

343
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,120
You should know

344
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,400
my goal

345
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,660
isn't just Cloud Manor

346
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,240
and Mare Nubium.

347
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,280
Of course I know.

348
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,200
Otherwise, after helping you secure

349
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,920
Cloud Manor and Mare Nubium,

350
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,120
I would have left already.

351
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,320
I still remember

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,560
the deal we made

353
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
at the missionary hospital abroad.

354
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,080
You haven't told me yet

355
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,360
who your target is.

356
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
Come back to the penthouse with me,

357
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,080
and I'll tell you everything.

358
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,680
Alright.

359
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,560
Tomorrow at 8 p.m.,

360
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,080
I'll be there.

361
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,360
Good.

362
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
I'll head out now.

363
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,400
Oh, by the way,

364
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,680
that young friend of yours...

365
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,740
What young friend?

366
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,980
Better not to have any.

367
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:42,840
I've realized

368
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,200
I like you more and more,

369
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,360
President Ye.

370
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,380
[Mare Nubium]

371
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,520
He's amazing!

372
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,800
Every single shot

373
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,280
hits the bullseye.

374
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,920
I just asked

375
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,320
the receptionist about him.

376
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,000
He's the owner of this archery club,

377
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,640
who just returned from abroad.

378
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
The earring is beautiful.

379
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
I just wonder

380
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,400
if the ruby

381
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,560
is real or fake.

382
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,080
It's gorgeous.

383
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,760
Excuse me.

384
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,400
The earring is mine.

385
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,840
I've been keeping it here.

386
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,440
It must have

387
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,770
fallen off by accident.

388
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
What are you doing?

389
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,360
The earring belongs to me.

390
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,400
I found it in the hallway

391
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,560
to the changing rooms.

392
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,600
I asked all the girls around

393
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,200
and couldn't find the owner.

394
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,040
How could it possibly be yours?

395
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,640
And the earring

396
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,840
is for women.

397
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,880
The earring is indeed mine.

398
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,520
I brought it back from abroad.

399
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,080
I always keep it

400
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,400
pinned to my archery armor.

401
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,680
It probably fell off

402
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,540
in the changing room by accident.

403
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,480
Excuse me.

404
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,360
Keep your hands to yourself.

405
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,210
My girlfriend already said

406
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,520
no girl reported any missing earring.

407
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,960
Besides, you're a man.

408
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,440
How could you claim it's yours?

409
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,520
And who would ever pin something

410
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,760
like this to his armor?

411
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,520
Exactly.

412
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,280
This is indeed mine.

413
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,920
Fine.

414
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,370
If you insist it's yours, that's fine.

415
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,120
Your bow looks quite professional.

416
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,980
How about this?

417
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,460
Let's have a match.

418
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,600
If you win,

419
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,280
we'll just bite the bullet
and give you the earring.

420
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,160
If you lose...

421
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,440
They're going to compete

422
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,600
for that earring.

423
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,400
There's no way that guy wins.

424
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,280
This guy is a professional player.

425
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,740
There's no way to beat him.

426
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,930
I agree with you.

427
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,800
He definitely can't beat the boss.

428
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,360
Fine.

429
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,760
Three arrows to decide the winner.

430
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,040
Whoever scores the higher total wins.

431
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,360
The winner takes the ruby earring.

432
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,760
The loser must accept the outcome.

433
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
You can start now.

434
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,960
Wow, bullseye!

435
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,400
Bullseye!

436
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,840
I told you.

437
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,170
This guy is really good.

438
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,600
That person definitely can't beat him.

439
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Another bullseye!

440
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,640
No wonder he's a professional player

441
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,760
who has won championships.

442
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,600
He's amazing.

443
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,520
Wait a minute.

444
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,920
You're a professional, right?

445
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,400
A professional who's won championships

446
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,920
competing against an amateur like me,

447
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,250
isn't that a bit unfair?

448
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,000
What do you want then?

449
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,330
You're a professional.

450
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,300
We can't play by normal rules.

451
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,820
For the last arrow,

452
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,760
do you dare to blindfold yourself?

453
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,840
As long as you hit the target,

454
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,880
no matter what score you get,

455
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,440
I'll return the earring.

456
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,400
It's not fair.

457
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,020
Do you dare?

458
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,000

How could we

486
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,240
move to a place like this?

487
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,880
My room is as tiny

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,520
It's not even half the size of my old one.

490
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,210
What happened to our villa?

491
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,920
Be grateful you have a place to live.

492
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,380
All our assets are
in your father's control.

493
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,850
He asked us to live here.

494
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,360
You think I want this?

495
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,720
Doesn't our Changlu Group focus

496
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,760
specifically on real estate investment?

497
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,280
How could we suddenly

498
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,920
lose even our own villa?

499
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,800
Could it be that Dad's business

500
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,600
is in trouble?

501
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,640
Don't talk like that

503
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,440
Your father doesn't let us get involved
with the company.

504
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,760
I don't know

505
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,560
the specific situation either.

506
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,120
You've been married to Dad
for so many years,

507
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,680
yet you're not even allowed

508
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
to lay a finger on the family assets.

509
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,600
I really wonder

510
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,400
if he sees you as his life partner

511
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,660
or just because Sinan's mother died,

512
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,300
he's using you as a backup.

513
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,960
How dare you talk to me like that?

514
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,160
No manners at all.

515
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
Mom.

516
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,240
Please help Jiang Lin.

517
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,600
He really

518
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,760
has nothing to do
with Ye Haimeng's mother's death.

519
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
You can't just watch him

520
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,560
being detained

521
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,360
and suffering in there, right?

522
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:06,960

523
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,780
Why don't we go find Chen Mo

524
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,980
to get your son-in-law out first?

525
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,040
Didn't I just say

526
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,400
that Changlu's resources

527
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,640

528

530

535

for 10 days already.

536

Stop shouting.

537

539
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,920
Mom, how can you be like this?

540
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,780
Mom, do you really not care
about us anymore?

544

they complained he wasn't capable enough.

545
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Now he's sacrificing for this family,

546
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,460

547

Fine.

548
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,200

552
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,320
Mom was just speaking
out of anger that day.

553

You're not that old,

Sinan's death was suspicious?

593

safe and sound?

And

595
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,440
during these three years she was missing,

596
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,000
where exactly was she?

597
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,520
Is she hiding something?

598
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,480
Or did she deliberately cover up the truth

599

Yes.

00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,040
You must immediately

695
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,360
contact your Legal Department's

696
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,120
lawyer team

697
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,920
to get Jiang Lin

698
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,000
released right away.

699
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,280
He has nothing to do

700
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,740
with your family's death.

701
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,680
That night, it was me

702
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,920
who asked him to go out.

703
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,560
He couldn't possibly have gone
to the sanatorium.

704
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,240
And he definitely wasn't

705
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,920
the one who hurt your mother.

706
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,880
You don't need

707
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,900
to tell me all this.

708
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,490
Go tell it to the police.

709
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,130
What did you tell the police

710
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,090
about that car accident back then?

711
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,120
What?

712
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,280
Back then,

713
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,440
how did you evade

714
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,970
the police's questioning,

715
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,240
use an accidental car crash

716
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,160
as the excuse,

717
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,680
and get the police to conclude

718
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,080
that it was just

719
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,810
an ordinary traffic accident?

720
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,320
What exactly are you trying to ask?

721
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,280
I want to ask

722
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,440
why my brother died

723
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,130
and why you're still alive.

724
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,800
You came back safely after three years.

725
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,650
Were you really lucky to escape death?

726
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,760
Or

727
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
was it you

728
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,120
who killed my brother?
