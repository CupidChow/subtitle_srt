[Return of the Queen]

2
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,259
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:41,759
Let me go!

4
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,000
Siyu!

5
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,120
Chairman misses you.

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
He asked us to bring you home.

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,920
I don't believe my father

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,380
would allow such methods!

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,479
Siyu, don't be angry.

10
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,140
We're just following orders.

11
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,110
Drive faster.

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,039
Back to Cloud Manor.

13
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,870
Cloud Manor?

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,509
Why Cloud Manor?

15
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,759
Wasn't Cloud Manor already

16
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,960
returned to Haimeng?

17
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,590
Has my family

18
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,050
moved back to Cloud Manor?

19
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,220
What happened to Mare Nubium?

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,120
Mo!

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,750
Dad,

22
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,520
you're back from the sanatorium?

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,630
What's going on?

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,079
Didn't we already move out of here

25
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,280
and into our own home?

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,340
Why are we back at Cloud Manor?

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,120
Also,

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,650
my mother called me and said

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,360
she's going abroad for a while.

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,120
Jiang Lin and Siyue

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,310
won't tell me why.

32
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,079
I was busy going to Xiamen

33
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,800
for the national invitational tournament.

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,470
Mo sent people to the hotel,

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,150
saying you needed to see me urgently.

36
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,150
They even forcibly brought me here.

37
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,710
Dad,

38
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,910
I don't believe you would allow them

39
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,640
to do something like that to me.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It was me.

41
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,840
I told them

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,420
if you wouldn't come home willingly,

43
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,910
they must bring you back

44
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,510
even if they had to tie you up.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,120
Why?

46
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,710
Because your status

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,310
has changed.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Status?

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,280
The shares

50
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,710
of Mare Nubium

51
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,400
left by your brother, Lu Sinan,

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,530
during his marriage

53
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,630
will all be inherited by you.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,000
You are now the largest shareholder

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,430
of Mare Nubium.

56
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,120
That famous

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,430
7-star hotel group

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,530
will entirely belong to you

59
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,140
in the near future.

60
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,310
Sinan's inheritance?

61
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,630
Mare Nubium's shares?

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,440
You must be mistaken.

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
Before Sinan went abroad
for his honeymoon,

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,680
he personally notarized a will

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,310
witnessed by Changlu's legal team.

66
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,520
It specifically stated

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,590
that after his death,

68
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,360
all marital assets and shares

69
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
would be transferred to you.

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,190
Once this will

71
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,320
takes legal effect,

72
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,680
you will become
the largest controlling shareholder

73
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,210
of Mare Nubium Hotel Group.

74
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,760
Impossible.

75
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,600
Impossible.

76
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,360
I have nothing to do

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
with this.

78
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,030
Lu Sinan didn't like me.

79
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,240
He always wanted to drive me

80
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,870
out of the Lu family!

81
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,000
Didn't he hate me?

82
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,510
Hate?

83
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,120
He left his entire fortune

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,829
to you.

85
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,829
Is that hatred?

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
If Sinan truly hated you,

87
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,570
why didn't he leave this inheritance

88
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,720
to his parents who raised him?

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,720
So,

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,630
Sinan really left

91
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,680
everything of Mare Nubium

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
to me?

93
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,630
No.

94
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,450
Mare Nubium belongs to the Ye family.

95
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,720
It's Haimeng's.

96
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,000
Sinan left all the major shares

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
to me.

98
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,000
Then Haimeng and I...

99
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,280
What exactly happened?

100
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,630
No matter what happens,

101
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,470
you must always remember

102
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,260
I will always believe you.

103
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,630
So,

104
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,270
Haimeng already

105
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,870
knew about this back then.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,870
So,

107
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,240
I am the heir

108
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,770
to Lu Sinan's inheritance.

109
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,000
I am the owner of Mare Nubium's shares.

110
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,360
That means now I am...

111
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,830
her enemy.

112
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,400
Of course she knows.

113
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,360
Not just her,

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,920
all the investment shareholders

115
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,040
of Mare Nubium,

116
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,120
as well as
the reporters and media outlets outside—

117
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,510
they all

118
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,040
know very clearly.

119
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,560
You are no longer

120
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,270
the youngest son of the Lu family.

121
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,600
You are now the future new owner

122
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,870
of Mare Nubium.

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,360
Therefore,

124
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,630
from now on,

125
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,600
you must obediently

126
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,360
stay at home.

127
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,130
Without my permission,

128
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
you are not allowed to step outside.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,270
Before Mare Nubium's board

130
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,470
announces Lu Sinan's will takes effect

131
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,430
and you become
the largest controlling shareholder

132
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,630
of Mare Nubium,

133
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,190
you can't meet with anyone.

134
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,800
Why?

135
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Dad!

136
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,210
You can't lock me up at home.

137
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,190
You can't stop me

138
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,790
from meeting anyone either.

139
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm not your puppet.

140
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,870
I'm not your pawn

141
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,670
to fight for Mare Nubium either.

142
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,360
I am myself.

143
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,360
I want to be with Ye Haimeng.

144
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,000
What did you say?

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
I want to be with Ye Haimeng!

146
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,800
You still dare mention that Ye Haimeng?

147
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,720
She lured you away last time.

148
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,040
I didn't hold it against her.

149
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,840
That was already generous of me.

150
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,070
Now you dare tell me

151
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,510
you want to be with her?

152
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,270
Lu Siyu,

153
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,480
get your head straight.

154
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,360
She is the wife of your brother,

155
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,680
Lu Sinan!

156
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,510
She is not!

157
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,120
She was never

158
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,360
Lu Sinan's wife.

159
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,159
She's just a victim

160
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,310
of this conspiratorial marriage.

161
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,800
My brother didn't love her.

162
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Lu Sinan only wanted to deceive her.

163
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,870
Lu Sinan was instigated

164
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,430
by so many people,

165
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,430
using love and marriage as a pretext

166
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,750
to set an enormous trap for her.

167
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,270
What you all wanted

168
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,480
was never Ye Haimeng.

169
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,480
What you wanted

170
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,190
was her identity

171
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,040
as the only daughter of the Ye family.

172
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
What you wanted

173
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,480
was her vulnerable, helpless status.

174
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,190
What you wanted

175
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,630
was the immense wealth of her family!

176
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,390
You plotted against her
for her money and her life.

177
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,950
How can you

178
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,810
still call her my brother's wife?

179
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,870
Get this straight:

180
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,070
I am your father.

181
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,830
This is your family.

182
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
If you want to defy the entire family

183
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,190
for a woman,

184
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,720
you should first ask

185
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,159
if the skin on your body

186
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,720
will allow it.

187
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,560
I'm ashamed of this family.

188
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,750
I...

189
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,750
A long time ago,

190
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,120
Ye Haimeng told me

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
this world is evil.

192
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,320
I didn't believe it.

193
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,190
But I watched with my own eyes

194
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,600
my family

195
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,000
become completely blinded

196
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,870
by immense wealth,

197
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
committing one heinous act

198
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,000
after another.

199
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,560
Yet everyone

200
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,530
still masks their desires and ambitions

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,270
with circles, capital,

202
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,800
and necessary means.

203
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,830
But no matter

204
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,140
how much you try to cover it up,

205
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,150
you can't hide

206
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,789
your filthy desires

207
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,909
and your nature of plotting for wealth
and harming others.

208
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,320
I am ashamed

209
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,200
of my family.

210
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,270
I am ashamed

211
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,630
to be a son of you,

212
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,390
Lu Changdong.

213
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,000
You...

214
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
You can keep slapping me!

215
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,600
But I will absolutely not

216
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
collude with you.

217
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,030
I would rather give my life

218
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,000
back to you

219
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,080
than join you

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,000
in hurting Ye Haimeng.

221
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,360
You bastard!

222
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,270
Siyu.

223
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,770
Are you alright?

224
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,910
What's the situation?

225
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,080
We've figured it all out.

226
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,870
Lu Siyu

227
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,080
was indeed taken away
by his father's assistant,

228
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,670
Chen Mo.

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,910
They've already returned to Haijiang

230
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,310
and entered Cloud Manor.

231
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,440
Cloud Manor?

232
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,790
The Lu family is using the notarized will

233
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,790
to cause trouble.

234
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,720
They claim

235
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,790
that Cloud Manor is also

236
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,200
part of Lu Sinan's inheritance.

237
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,270
While we were away,

238
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,670
they got rid of our people

239
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,080
and moved back in.

240
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
Lu Siyue and Jiang Lin

241
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
have squeezed back

242
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,630
into temporary seats on the board.

243
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,840
And because they've laid the groundwork
in Mare Nubium

244
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,720
for 3 years,

245
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,960
some shareholders on the board

246
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
still remain close to the Lu family.

247
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,510
After the board's temporary meeting

248
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,630
last time,

249
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,840
the shareholders are now divided
into 3 factions:

250
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,700
pro-Lu family,

251
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,200
pro-us,

252
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
and a neutral peace faction.

253
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,390
Because of this turmoil,
Mare Nubium's headquarters

254
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,480
has returned

255
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,910
to a state of chaos.

256
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,270
Have the headquarters and branch offices

257
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,600
suspended operations?

258
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,870
Branch offices are also

259
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,240
very dissatisfied with the headquarters.

260
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
Many commands from top to bottom

261
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,330
are stuck in the middle.

262
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Right now, the entire Mare Nubium is

263
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,510
in disorder.

264
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,280
President Ye,

265
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,880
aren't you going to ask about Ms. Ling?

266
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,850
If Ling Ke were here,

267
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,720
Lu Siyue and Jiang Lin

268
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,120
wouldn't be so arrogant.

269
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,970
But I know what she's doing.

270
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm afraid she herself is

271
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,230
probably struggling

272
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,460
to stay afloat.

273
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,970
So should we return to Mare Nubium now

274
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,290
or go to Cloud Manor to get him back?

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,720
Neither.

276
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,550
Now is not the best time

277
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,910
to confront the Lu family head-on.

278
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,790
It could cause

279
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,480
greater harm

280
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,030
to Siyu and the company.

281
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,860
Then what should we...

282
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,330
Notify our insiders

283
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,080
to maintain internal order,

284
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,740
reassure the branch offices,

285
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,150
and ask them to operate normally

286
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,210
without any chaos.

287
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
As for Siyu,

288
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,240
I need to figure out

289
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,750
a bargaining chip
to negotiate with the Lu family first.

290
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,600
We need to get him out

291
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
before Mare Nubium's board meeting

292
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,150
begins.

293
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
You're right.

294
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,760
Return to the penthouse first.

295
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,390
Give me time

296
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,600
to plan the next move.

297
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,730
Understood.

298
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,760
[Mare Nubium] [Property Custody Agreement]

299
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,600
[Ink brand] [Tianyang, Yangtian]
[Lu family, Ye family]

300
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,850
[Profiles of the Ye family members]
[Profiles of the Lu family members]

301
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,910
Wait.

302
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,120
Do you have to go personally?

303
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,960
If I don't go, would you go instead?

304
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,910
Do you have any idea

305
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,170
how important this is?

306
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,270
If Ling Ke

307
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,270
really is

308
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,720
Zhang Yujie's daughter,

309
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,240
we're in serious trouble.

310
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,720
But...

311
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,670
But Zhang Yujie

312
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,550
has already been in prison

313
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,550
for 10 years, right?

314
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,320
Given her charges and sentence,

315
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,150
there's no way she'd be released so soon.

316
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,280
If she can't get out,

317
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,150
what can Ling Ke do

318
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,360
even if she is her daughter?

319
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
She still won't be able
to get any evidence.

320
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,080
Don't underestimate Ling Ke.

321
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,150
She stayed with Ye Haimeng

322
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,390
lying low overseas for 3 years,

323
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,870
then fought all the way back with her,

324
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,390
and even turned the Lu family upside down.

325
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,910
These young women

326
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:46,870
are no longer

327
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,600
what we used to think they were.

328
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,270
They're smart, resourceful,

329
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,030
and fierce.

330
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,750
Don't scare yourself just yet.

331
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,120
From what I know,

332
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
the Lu family has reopened the case.

333
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,150
Sinan actually left a notarized will.

334
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,080
It even caught Haimeng

335
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,150
completely off guard.

336
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,270
There's also news from the board

337
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,550
that Mare Nubium is now leaderless

338
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,280
and in chaos.

339
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
So those two young women

340
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,270
might not be as formidable

341
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,150
as we think.

342
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,550
Better safe than sorry.

343
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,360
There's one more thing.

344
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,120
You'd better

345
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,910
keep a close eye on that adopted son

346
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,870
we brought into the family from now on.

347
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,870
He's now

348
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,870
very close to Ling Ke.

349
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,290
I'm warning you—

350
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,600
don't let us

351
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,790
be betrayed by him

352
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,120
without even

353
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,720
knowing that.

354
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,270
Bochen isn't that kind of person.

355
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,240
Only he knows

356
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,440
what kind of person he is.

357
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,030
All I know is

358
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,440
he's not our biological son.

359
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,910
No matter how much effort

360
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,200
you pour into him,

361
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,800
an outsider will always be an outsider.

362
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,440
His heart will always drift away.

363
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,960
Forget it.

364
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,390
I've arranged to meet someone

365
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,200
to find out
about Zhang Yujie's current situation.

366
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,390
If anything goes wrong…

367
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,340
Could something really go wrong?

368
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,400
It'll be fine.

369
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,370
It'll definitely be fine.

370
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,450
They definitely won't find anything.

371
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,480
Bochen.

372
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,270
Son.

373
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,910
Where are you?

374
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,780
What's wrong, Mom?

375
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,550
Nothing.

376
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,960
I just miss you.

377
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,410
I wonder if you're busy these days.

378
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,960
When will you come home for dinner?

379
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,480
Mom,

380
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,360
right now,

381
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,550
I'm with a friend.

382
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,120
With a friend?

383
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,750
Then...

384
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,550
Then bring your friend home too.

385
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,320
That...

386
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,380
That might not be very proper.

387
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,200
I'll talk to you later, Mom.

388
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,130
I still have some things to handle.

389
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,710
Stop investigating.

390
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,860
Don't touch me.

391
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,320
For the past few years,
we've been conducting a forward audit.

392
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,030
Now I'm starting to trace it backward.

393
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,910
I've already uncovered

394
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,630
a few major projects
that concluded back then.

395
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,630
As long as I can separate the major items,

396
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,630
I can conduct a comparative investigation—

397
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,600
a 3-way match.

398
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,120
Then

399
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll be able to locate

400
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,730
the source of the fund leakage.

401
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,510
Stop looking into it!

402
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,550
If you continue like this,

403
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,510
you'll get into trouble.

404
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,670
Even if I do,

405
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,270
I'll definitely keep investigating.

406
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,030
Why?

407
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,360
You won't understand even if I tell you.

408
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Even now,

409
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,840
you still want to hide it from me, huh?

410
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,720
Your mother is

411
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,320
Zhang Yujie.

412
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,349
She was the CFO

413
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,880
of Mare Nubium 10 years ago.

414
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,680
Because she tampered with the accounts,

415
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,349
she was sentenced to 20 years in prison

416
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,069
for embezzlement and financial fraud!

417
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,160
Nonsense!

418
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,400
It was your mother who messed

419
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,440
with the finances!

420
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,589
Your family members are the embezzlers!

421
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,030
Zhang Yujie

422
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,829
was sentenced to 20 years in prison

423
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,230
because she took the fall
for the Ye family!

424
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,920
So,

425
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,350
Zhang Yujie

426
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,090
really is your mother?

427
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,310
Don't try to trick me
into admitting anything.

428
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,030
You're an adopted son of the Ye family.

429
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,030
I won't trust you.

430
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,240
That's not it, Ling Ke.

431
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,750
This has nothing to do

432
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,920
with my background.

433
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,160
I just want

434
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
to help you

435
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,170
as a friend, as much as I can.

436
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,440
Ke,

437
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,310
please trust me.

438
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,310
Hello?

439
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,070
It's me.

440
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,440
What did you say?

441
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,590
What's wrong?

442
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,160
Ling Ke!

443
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,030
Wait for me!

444
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,000
Chairman.

445
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,240
The surveillance and security

446
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,480
around Siyu's room

447
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,810
have all been arranged.

448
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,920
We guarantee before the board meeting,

449
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,180
nothing will go wrong.

450
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,960
I know he's developed

451
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,920
a rather straightforward character

452
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
during his years abroad.

453
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,550
But I never thought he would be bewitched

454
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,200
by Ye Haimeng to this extent.

455
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,160
It seems I underestimated

456
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,830
that woman from the Ye family.

457
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,880
All on her own,

458
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,270
she has managed to play my 2 sons

459
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,350
right into her hands.

460
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,350
I have to say,

461
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,550
she does have some skills.

462
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,830
Sinan...

463
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,440
doesn't count, right?

464
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,550
Of course he counts.

465
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,750
Back then, we sent

466
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,280
the group's legal director

467
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,280
to personally supervise him
making the will.

468
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,920
Yet somehow, he still found

469
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,750
a loophole.

470
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,960
On the notarized will,

471
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,830
the beneficiary

472
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,680
was actually written as Siyu.

473
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,830
That was indeed our oversight.

474
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,920
We didn't expect the legal director

475
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,550
to actually be a friend of Sinan's

476
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,720
during college.

477
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,550
After helping Sinan

478
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,830
complete this matter,

479
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,560
he resigned.

480
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
He went overseas,

481
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,530
and his current whereabouts are unknown.

482
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,750
The key point is

483
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,000
he specifically noted

484
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,600
to exclude Changlu Capital.

485
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,830
That was truly unexpected.

486
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,400
It seems my eldest son

487
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
had quite a few tricks up his sleeve.

488
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,920
It's just a pity

489
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,310
he died too early.

490
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,640
Next,

491
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,640
I need you to do 3 things.

492
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,750
First,

493
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,110
notify Siyue and Jiang Lin

494
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,920
that they must lay the groundwork

495
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,520
within Mare Nubium's board.

496
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,900
Be ready for a public meeting at any time.

497
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,830
Second,

498
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,310
tell the Middle Eastern investors

499
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,710
to get their money ready.

500
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,880
What they want

501
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,900
will soon be within reach.

502
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,510
Third,

503
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,620
keep a close eye on Lu Siyu.

504
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,550
Don't allow him

505
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,550
any contact with the outside world.

506
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,240
Before the meeting takes place,

507
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,880
there must be no mistakes.

508
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,950
Rest assured, Chairman.

509
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,160
Also,

510
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,090
make all necessary preparations.

511
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,400
I'll be waiting for Ye Haimeng

512
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,590
to come to me personally.

513
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,350
Open the door!

514
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,960
Open this door now!

515
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,110
It'll be okay.

516
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,510
Siyu will be fine.

517
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,040
Right now, I need to stay calm

518
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,880
and think carefully about how

519
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,110
to break the Lu family's scheme.

520
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,540
Only by invalidating Lu Sinan

521
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,010

Hello, Haimeng.

699
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,840
Are you still at Mare Nubium?

700
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,010
Yes, we are.

What happened?

705
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,170
Just a small issue.

706
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,180
There's something I need your help with.

707
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,000
Go ahead.

708
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,400
There was a land transaction

709
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,070
in West Asia

710
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,200
4 years ago.

711
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,790
It was facilitated by Changlu Group

712
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,830
as the investor.

713
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,200
The buyer was Mare Nubium,

714
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,310
but due to some internal reasons,

715
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,070
my father

716
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,400
rejected the deal.

717
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,030
Afterward,

718
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,630
we didn't follow up further.

719
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,380
Now, based on what I've found,

720
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
this piece of land

721
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,640
was purchased by a group in West Asia.

722
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
It's been 4 years,

723
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,110
and it has never been developed.

724
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,040
You want me to help you investigate

725
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,790
this land deal that was already completed

726
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,850
4 years ago, right?

727
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,750
Someone strongly recommended this land

728
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,150
to Mare Nubium back then.

729
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,550
After Mare Nubium pulled out,

730
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,160
other buyers also pulled out
one after another.

731
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,750
The group

732
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,610
that eventually bought the land—

733
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,680
their transaction background
and details are

734
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,720
all very vague.

735
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:45,920
It doesn't seem

736
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,980
like a genuine West Asian group to me.

737
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,720
I'd like to ask you

738
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,350
to investigate this transaction in detail

739
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,830
and the investment background

740
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,360

741
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,680
from
an international investment perspective.

behind these large transactions,

764
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,680
but

765
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,310
if someone was eager

766
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,920
to push it through urgently,

767
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,590
it must be something

768
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,990
they desperately wanted

769
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,000
and would benefit greatly from.

770

this would be your best bargaining chip.
