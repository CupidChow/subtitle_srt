[Episode 24]

3
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,680
I've sent you

4
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,120
all the evidence of my father's
secret foreign dealings

5
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,750
through underground channels
over the years,

6
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,680
including communication records

7
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,090
and financial discrepancies.

8
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,680
Also...

9
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,260
those silver flash drives

10
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,320
you found in the drawer last time

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,000
were indeed Mare Nubium's

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,520
secret account records,
just as you suspected.

13
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,650
It's just that my dad

14
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,910
hid and deleted

15
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,440
all the data sheets on them,

16
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,960
then restored them

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,000
with software

18
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,910
whenever access was needed.

19
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
The seemingly perfect account books

20
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,360
in the archives room

21
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,920
were actually doctored

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
by external accounting firms

23
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,450
my father hired.

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,960
And also...

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,560
Enough.

26
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,560
Ye Bochen.

27
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,570
That's enough.

28
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,520
Also...

29
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,440
from today onward...

30
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
I'm no longer a son of the Ye family.

31
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,240
You've done well,

32
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,430
Ye Bochen.

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,170
You've been very brave.

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,040
It's okay now.

35
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,000
All of this

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,430
will pass.

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,079
From now on...

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,060
you are just yourself.

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,240
Why are you staring at me?

40
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,670
I'm afraid you'll leave and disappear.

41
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,130
From now on,

42
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,560
I'll always be by your side.

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,610
I won't disappear anymore.

44
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,290
Then you can't go back on your word.

45
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,400
I won't.

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,040
Just like I promised you before.

47
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,490
We'll stay true to each other,

48
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,250
stand side by side,

49
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,570
and move forward together.

50
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,630
Where have you been

51
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,760
these past few days?

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,830
After you fell into the sea that day,

53
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,800
the maritime rescue teams
and fire department

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,360
searched that area

55
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,270
but found nothing.

56
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,000
You jumped in

57
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,800
after me that day?

58
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,240
I...

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,520
Don't ever do that again.

60
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,510
Do you think you can

61
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,240
handle everything on your own?

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,830
Don't do

63
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,190
such risky things ever again.

64
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,000
But...

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No buts.

66
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,690
But that day you fell into the sea.

67
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,630
When I jumped in after you,

68
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,560
I didn't think about what I'd face.

69
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,690
I just saw you jump into the water,

70
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,270
and I couldn't let you

71
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,190
face life-threatening danger alone.

72
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,950
I couldn't let you

73
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,480
bear all this burden alone.

74
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,120
You said

75
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,830
we love each other.

76
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,950
Facing danger together

77
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,310
is the true meaning of love,

78
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,950
isn't it?

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,600
You're right.

80
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,870
Next time,

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,070
if something dangerous happens again,

82
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,530
I'll definitely tell you.

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,000
So where

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,060
exactly did you go?

85
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,900
I didn't go anywhere that day.

86
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,390
Falling into the sea that day

87
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,750
was a plan I devised.

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,750
Because I didn't want to

89
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,680
become a pawn in my family's hands.

90
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,480
I didn't want to appear at

91
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,310
Mare Nubium's

92
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,560
public hearing.

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,600
Because of

94
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,530
my brother's notarized will,

95
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,240
I would become the greatest weapon

96
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,190
to hurt you.

97
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,680
I especially didn't want to...

98
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,120
face my dad.

99
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,630
Actually, even before that day,

100
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,070
your mole and I had already devised

101
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,800
a plan for me to fall into the sea.

102
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,680
He helped me arrange for

103
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,810
a reliable rescue boat near the shore.

104
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,190
Roughly 10 minutes

105
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,680
after I fell into the water,

106
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,630
they took me away

107
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,090
under the guise of rescue.

108
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,390
My mole?

109
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,190
You mean him?

110
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
He specifically instructed me

111
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,950
not to reveal

112
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,409
the plan to you in advance.

113
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,040
Otherwise, if you had known

114
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,370
I was staging an escape,

115
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,040
your reaction wouldn't have been genuine.

116
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,159
My dad and Uncle Mo

117
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,390
have been in business for decades.

118
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,600
To fool them,

119
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,600
secrecy was essential.

120
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,040
You thought of everything.

121
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,870
It's just...

122
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,070
you suffered.

123
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,800
I didn't suffer.

124
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
But when you jumped in after me,

125
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,260
you nearly scared me to death.

126
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,770
Haven't I told you before?

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,630
You must take care

128
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,600
of yourself.

129
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't try to be the hero,

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,930
and don't carry everything alone.

131
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,840
Now that I'm by your side...

132
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,840
leave everything to me.

133
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,000
Got it.

134
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,800
Siyu.

135
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,870
In the coming days,

136
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,160
I still have

137
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,480
a brutal battle ahead.

138
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,100
My opponent...

139
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,190
is your family—

140
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,950
your father.

141
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,810
But you must believe me:

142
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,920
my feelings for you are real.

143
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,270
When all this is over,

144
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,270
we can truly

145
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,510
start our life anew.

146
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,700
No matter how long it takes...

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,530
and no matter
how many difficulties arise...

148
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,450

we've received news
from Mare Nubium shareholders.

162
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,270
The hearing

163
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,890
has been rescheduled to 9 AM next Monday.

164
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,100
Then keep driving the price down.

165
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,960
Before next Monday,

Just as you predicted,

170
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,730
they've lowered the price.

171
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,270
Follow them down.

172
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,120
Then we'd be spending money

173
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,240
to crash our own stock price.

174
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,150
Every point we follow them down

175
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,080
