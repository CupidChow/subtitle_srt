she clearly told me

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,590
the purpose of her return

41
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,360
was to take back Mare Nubium

42
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,079

48
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,030
has all come to light tonight.

49
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,310
Come to light?

50
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,190
Mare Nubium has already returned

51
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,320
to Haimeng's hands.

52
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,150
Tonight, you all saw

53
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,240
that Lu Sinan had someone else he loved.

54
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
That marriage

55
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,960
was just a stepping stone

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,820
to a scheme against the Ye family.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,750
Is that

58
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,590
all there is to it?

59
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,430
What else?

60
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,910
Do you want Haimeng

61
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,710
to be trapped in that marriage forever?

62
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,400
Let alone that Sinan

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
has been dead for four years,

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,710
Haimeng was the victim

65
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,150
in that marriage.

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,150
Now that everything

67
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,630
has come to light,

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,560
as her cousin and friend,

69
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,840
I hope she can

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,240
let go of everything soon

71
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,870
and return to her normal life.

72
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,080
So your idea of letting her return
to a normal life

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,910
is just watching her

74
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,430
be with Lu Siyu?

75
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,910
Isn't Siyu good enough?

76
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,839
Between the two Lu brothers,

77
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,920
I didn't have much contact with Sinan,

78
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,380
but I know Siyu quite well.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,950
Although he is

80
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,610
the youngest in the Lu family,

81
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,430
he has always been pure.

82
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,430
He's never been caught

83
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,430
in the whirl of wealth,

84
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,070
nor tainted

85
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,600
by social games.

86
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,720
Everything he has achieved—

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,040
all his accomplishments and honors—

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,390
is the result of his own effort.

89
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,590
Isn't a Siyu like that

90
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,200
truly worthy of Haimeng?

91
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,360
Should we be discussing

92
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,240
whether he is worthy

93
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,870
or not worthy

94
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,800
of Haimeng right now?

95
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000
Then what is the issue?

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
Lu Sinan is a Lu,

97
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,510
and so is Lu Siyu.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,750
Someone from the Lu family

99
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,409
has already crushed her once.

100
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Now that she has another shot,

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,360
should she risk diving

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,870
into the Lu family's fire again?

103
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,600
Don't just look at
whether they're compatible or not

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,870
on the surface.

105
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:57,720
If you really are

106
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,380
Haimeng's cousin and friend,

107
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
you should persuade her

108
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,630
to get out of the Lu family chaos
as soon as she can.

109
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,830
Don't let her make

110
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,510
the same mistake over and over again.

111
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,070
But—

112
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,800
Cut it out.

113
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,460
I don't want to comment on Lu Siyu.

114
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,000
And I don't want him to ever appear

115

Therefore,

175
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,360
I will now announce

176
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,150
the following decisions on his behalf:

177
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,630
Starting tomorrow, Siyue and Jiang Lin

178
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,720
will move out

179
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,650
of the Lu Mansion

180
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,200
and establish their own household.

181
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,320
Jiang Lin can come with me

182
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,080
to Changlu

183
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,520
and become a member of Changlu Capital.

184
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,360
Siyu,

185
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,000
you are

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
to liquidate all domestic investments
within this week.

187
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,910
Next week, someone will escort you

188
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,770
back overseas.

189
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,840
As for Madam,

190
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,030
lawyers will assist you

191
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,290
in completing the divorce proceedings.

192
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,130
Please leave the Lu family.

193
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,150
You want to drive me away?

194
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,720
As the Lu family's mistress,

195
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,200
you have neither run
the household responsibly

196
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
nor raised your children properly,

197
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,870
and you even instigated Sinan

198
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,600
to commit horrible deeds.

199
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,910
How can the Lu family keep you?

200
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,270
I instigated him?

201
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,430
Do you have any evidence?

202
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,600
Lu Sinan is your son

203
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,750
with your ex-wife.

204
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,360
All these years,

205
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,790
he never treated me as his mother.

206
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,600
He only held resentment toward me.

207
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
He's the eldest son of the Lu family—

208
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,670
why would I try to manipulate him?

209
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,440
And why would he even listen to me?

210
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,390
So now that Sinan is gone,

211
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,470
you're pushing all the blame

212
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,080
onto him?

213
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,270
What blame am I pushing onto him?

214
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,080
Did I force him
to fall in love with Ye Haimeng,

215
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,960
or did I force him

216
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
to marry her?

217
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,080
It was your precious eldest son

218
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,320
who plotted against
the Ye's only daughter,

219
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,390
doing everything he could

220
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,840
to trick her into marriage,

221
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,720
and then using marital rights

222
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,120
to seize her family's fortune.

223
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,240
These were all

224
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Lu Sinan's own plans.

225
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,480
What does it have to do with me?

226
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
Nothing to do with you?

227
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,940
That's easy for you to say.

228
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,880
If you had nothing to do with it,

229
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,600
then why did Ye Haimeng

230
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,840
come looking for you?

231
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,270
Why did Ye Haimeng present

232
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,390
at Lu Sinan's funeral

233
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,000
with so much evidence?

234
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,790
And why was that evidence

235
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,080
all over the news?

236
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,510
Are you blind,

237
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,750
or am I blind?

238
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,210
Or is everyone else blind?

239
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,960
The reporters made it all up.

240
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,550
Siyue and I didn't do anything.

241
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,600
We were just following

242
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,510
Sinan's will

243
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,200
and handling his funeral arrangements.

244
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,670
Yet you, his own father,

245
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,000
show no gratitude

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,150
and pin all the blame

247
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,510
on me.

248
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,550
It's no surprise Sinan could do

249
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,550
something like that,

250
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,200
given a father like you.

251
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,910
What did you say?

252
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,670
I said,

253
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,960
all these years

254
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
you've neglected to discipline Lu Sinan.

255
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,080
You didn't even know

256
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,030
he got married

257
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,840
or had children,

258
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,960
matters of such importance.

259
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,600
That's why he dared to murder

260
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,910
someone else's daughter.

261
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,150
What nonsense are you talking about?

262
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm not talking nonsense.

263
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,870
A father who fails to guide his son
is to blame.

264
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,910
Every single one of Lu Sinan's schemes
to murder his wife

265
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,320
came from you!

266
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,240
You...

267
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,630
Don't hit my mom!

268
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,840
Dad.

269
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,870
All these years,

270
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,320
you've been completely focused on
Changlu Group,

271
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,480
while all the household matters

272
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,210
have been handled by Mom alone.

273
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,910
The Lu family has survived until now

274
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,670
thanks entirely to Mom.

275
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,120
How could you say

276
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,720
that Sinan was instigated by Mom?

277
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes,

278
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,480
Mom is your second wife.

279
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,030
So since she first arrived,

280
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,030
Sinan never once

281
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,890
called her Mom.

282
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,840
How could he possibly

283
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,360
have listened to her?

284
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,840
On the contrary, Lu Sinan

285
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,360
never considered us

286
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,030
his family.

287
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,360
I still remember

288
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,170
how much he hated me as a child.

289
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,840
He even said

290
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
that in the next life,

291
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,790
he still wouldn't recognize us

292
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,150
as siblings.

293
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,910
And when it comes to Siyu,

294
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,230
he went even further.

295
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,440
Sinan always hated Siyu the most.

296
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,630
Don't you all know that?

297
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,330
Siyu was just a little kid then.

298
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,320
He didn't understand anything.

299
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,480
But I did.

300
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,270
Since Siyu was seven,

301
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,630
he kept telling Uncle Mo

302
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,160
to kick Siyu out of the Lu family.

303
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,240
He never wanted Siyu
to have the Lu surname,

304
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
or to get his hands on

305
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,690
the Lu family business.

306
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,750
All that talk about archery championships

307
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,510
and bringing honor to the family—

308
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,910
those were just excuses.

309
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,200
He didn't want

310
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,630
Siyu to stay in China.

311
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,910
He hated his half-brother,
the son of his stepmother.

312
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,480
He hated Siyu!

313
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,120
Chen Mo,

314
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,750
what Siyue said

315
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,600
is all true?

316
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,630
Sinan

317
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,560
indeed didn't like Siyu very much.

318
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,790
Probably because

319
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,290
they have different mothers.

320
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,670
There's no need to act this way.

321
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,180
Of the three children in this family,

322
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,080
which one have you ever truly cared for?

323
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,000
The Lu family

324
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,720
has come to this today

325
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,840
all because of you.

326
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,150
Dad,

327
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,430
you can't drive Mom away.

328
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,440
If you drive Mom away,

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,150
then I'll leave too.

330
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll take Siyu with me,

331
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,600
and we'll never use the Lu surname again.

332
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,320
Lu Siyu.

333
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,120
Say something.

334
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,150
Say something, Siyu.

335
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,200
Siyu!

336
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,360
Siyu, say something!

337
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,670
Siyu!

338
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,840
Chen Mo,

339
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,000
keep an eye on him.

340
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,550
The Lu family has already

341
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,600
lost one son.

342
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,390
We can't lose another.

343
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,360
Send someone

344
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,040
to get him out of here.

345
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,190

Tonight,

518
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,000
the youngest son of the Lu family,

519
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,750
Lu Siyu,

520
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,030
will be sent abroad

521
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,490
by Lu Changdong's people.

522
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,640
What a mess.

523
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,480
So Changlu

524
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,440
must now be left

525
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,200
with only Lu Changdong?

526
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,290
There's still Chen Mo.

527
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,940
Chen Mo is still there.

528
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,260
Aren't you surprised?

529
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,090
Surprised about what?

530
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,480
The youngest son of the Lu family

531
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,310
is leaving.

532
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,350
No need to beat around the bush.

533
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,680
You just want to ask me

534
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,480
why I kissed Lu Siyu

535
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,960
that night

536
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,590
under the tree.

537
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,070
He's from the Lu family.

538
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,830
He's Lu Sinan's own brother.

539
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,920
That night,

540
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,240
in that moment,

541
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,270
I wanted to kiss him,

542
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,030
so I did.

543
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,360
I didn't care who he was,

544
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,550
or whether

545
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,440
he was Lu Sinan's brother.

546
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,550
Haimeng,

547
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,750
I know you don't care,

548
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,790
but others definitely will.

549
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,720
The Lu family

550
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,960
will certainly care.

551
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
My business

552
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,580
has nothing to do with others.

553
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,700
I've already reclaimed Mare Nubium,

554
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,640
and I have no ties

555
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,790
to Lu Sinan anymore.

556
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,590
What I need to do now

557
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,830
is to live my own life well.

558
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,560
I don't care what others think.

559
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,680
I only follow my heart.

560
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,590
If I'm good to someone,

561
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,110
it's only because I want to be.

562
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,160
If I like someone,

563
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,200
it's simply

564
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,330
because I like them.

565
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,160
Haimeng,

566
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,880
I...

567
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,790
Don't worry.

568
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,880
I know

569
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,310
what I want.

570
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,720
Ms. Ye,

571
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,790
there's a visitor downstairs.

572
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,320
She says she's your friend.

573
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,830
My friend?

574
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,790
Is this

575
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,990
where he used to live?

576
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,270
It looks like his style.

577
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,070
Are you here to gloat?

578
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,680
This

579
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,310
is my home.

580
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,030
Ms. Ye,

581
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
I want to

582
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,370
ask you for something.

583
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,760
What do you want?

584
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,240
I want Sinan's death certificate,

585
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,310
his memorial photo,

586
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,240
and the address of his burial site.

587
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,160
Actually,

588
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,920
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

589
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,960
Since I saw your return

590
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,160
reported in the news,

591
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,730
I've wanted to contact you.

592
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,030
But I knew

593
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,440
it wasn't the right time.

594
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,750
You

595
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,480
might not want to see me either.

596
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,350
But

597
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,630
now that everything's settled,

598
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,030
I'm bold enough to come

599
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,030
ask for these things.

600
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,070
Why would you think

601
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,960
I'd give them to you?

602
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,610
I'm not certain.

603
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,070
So today, I've come

604
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,750
to beg you.

605
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,640
I know Sinan hurt you.

606
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,920
Back then,

607
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,550
he made the wrong choice,

608
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,850
and it caused you tremendous pain.

609
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,240
You've come a long way

610
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,100
to get where you are today.

611
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,400
So,

612
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,750
it's understandable that you hate him.

613
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,590
So what?

614
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,720
Are you here to plead for him?

615
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,440
I've hated him

616
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,040
for as long as he's been gone.

617
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,410
I hate him not only for deceiving me

618
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,710
but also for hurting you.

619
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,000
Just one fleeting thought,

620
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,800
and all that was peaceful

621
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,640
and joyful

622
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,510
was ruined.

623
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,010
Are you saying all this

624
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,240
to make me feel sorry for you?

625
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,680
I want to tell you

626
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,550
that in this world,

627
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
there's someone else

628
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,770
who suffers just like you.

629
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,830
But

630
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,550
aside from resenting him,

631
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,790
I don't understand either

632
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,000
what Sinan's deeper motive was

633
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,720
for doing this

634
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,350
in the first place.

635
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,510
You know,

636
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,960
his ties with the Lu family

637
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,070
were terrible.

638
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,590
When he was nine,

639
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,080
his mother became gravely ill.

640
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,000
His stepmother

641
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,830
moved in with her two children,

642
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,590
and all he could do

643
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,550
was watch helplessly

644
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,440
as his mother suffered and died.

645
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,110
Meanwhile,
his father and those two children

646
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,570
lived happily as a family.

647
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,440
He had no one but himself

648
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,200
to rely on—

649
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,860
You didn't come to apologize.

650
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,970
So why are you telling me all this?

651
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,800
No matter what he went through,

652
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,270
it doesn't excuse the pain he caused me.

653
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,720
He took Mare Nubium from me

654
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
and ruined everything I had.

655
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,640
Whatever reasons he had,

656
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,310
I will never forgive him.

657
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,240
Mm.

658
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,910
I understand.

659
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,160
I just

660
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,160
wanted to share this information with you.

661
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,690
If you don't want to hear it,

662
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,090
then let's drop it.

663
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,590
But...

664
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,790
Could you please

665
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,880
let me take him away?

666
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,750
Take him away?

667
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,790
Mm.

668
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,430
Remove everything of his

669
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,440
from this apartment

670
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,070
and from your life,

671
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,920
completely,

672
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,520
without leaving a single trace.

673
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,960
I'm so curious.

674
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,810
Why are you doing this?

675
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,310
Because I love him.

676
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,830
Even though

677
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,550
he made

678
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,830
a terrible mistake,

679
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,550
I still love him.

680
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,550
Even though

681
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,440
he's been gone for four whole years,

682
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,550
I still

683
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,960
can't forget him.

684
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,240
Ms. Ye,

685
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,920
I know he made

686
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,270
a terrible mistake.

687
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,160
Now

688
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,350
he has already paid

689
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,480
with his life.

690
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Could you please

691
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,810
let me see him one more time

692
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,440
and take him away completely?

693
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,830
You can pursue

694
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,000
the life you want.

695
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,510
You can also pursue

696
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,970
the person you truly love.

697
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,790
But my son and I have only him.

698
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,550
Alright.

699
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,000
His belongings and photos

700
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,200
will be organized

701
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,750
and delivered to your address.

702
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,960
The location of his burial

703
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,510
will be sent

704
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,680
to your phone.

705
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,340
As for his death certificate,

706
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,720
it's still
in the inheritance litigation process.

707
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,920
When the process is complete,

708
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,590
I'll have my lawyer

709
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,640
deliver it to you.

710
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,000
Ms. Ye,

711
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,830
I...

712
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,750
Take him away.

713
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,920
Just like how

714
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,960
he suddenly appeared

715
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,880
in my life.

716
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,270
Please

717
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,750
take him away

718
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,720
without leaving

719
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,550
anything behind.

720
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,790
I won't forgive him,

721
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,050
but for the rest of my life,

722
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,540
I don't want to think of him again.

723
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,510
Ms. Ye,

724
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,210
I'm sure
things will turn out well for you.

725
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,070
You will definitely meet

726
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,670
someone who truly loves you.

727
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,840
You definitely will.

728
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,680
Haimeng!

729
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,310
Haimeng!

730
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,680
Haimeng.

731
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,060
I'm so glad you're still home.

732
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,790
I've been running

733
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,250
back and forth for an hour.

734
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,920
Finally made it

735
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,550
to bring them to you.

736
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,830
These are from Siyu.

737
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,830
He asked me

738
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,690
to give them to you before he left.

739
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,180
I don't know what they are.

740
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,300
Your earrings?

741
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,750
Anyway,

742
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,350
he insisted that I

743
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,790
give them to you personally.

744
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,000
He also wanted me to tell you

745
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,680
that these are your very own

746
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
wishing stars.

747
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,550
Wait,

748
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,160
so instead of four-leaf clovers,

749
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,350
they're using diamonds

750
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,480
to make wishes now?

751
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,240
Haimeng.

752
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,350
Haimeng!

753
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,400
Don't you want these?

754
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,830

asked me to deliver something to Haimeng.

789
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,720
I've already

delivered it.

with these earrings?

795
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
I'll take the earrings.
