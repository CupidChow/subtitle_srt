You can't go in.

Xuanxuan,

I...

11

Okay?

Who, Mom?

Mr. Jiang!

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,600
Mrs. Lu, long time no see.

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,800
Mare Nubium's been turned into this mess.

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,930
I'm sure you'd rather not see me at all.

36
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,480
None of us wanted things

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,400
to turn out this way between our families.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,840
Yuezhi and Bochen

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,520
have always tried to reason with Haimeng.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,720
But she...

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,240
she's too strong-willed.

42
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,560
As her uncle and aunt,

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,160
it's not proper for us to say too much.

44
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
Is it that it's not proper

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,770
or that you have no right at all?

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,920
What do you mean by that, Ms. Lu?

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm mocking you.

48

You...

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,800
Enough!

Today is not the day for falling out.

51
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,560
The media outside released a statement,

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,420
and the board inside is prepared.

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,500
Whether Sinan's inheritance

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,260
can be transferred smoothly,

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,120

58
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,440
That's true.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,680
But I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

60
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,600
So,

61

you two

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,920

63
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,040
Don't forget

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
those things you want to bury.

65
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,490
Here we go again.

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,000
You're Sinan's only sister.

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960

Siyu is locked up at home.

72

It's better he doesn't show up
on an occasion like this.

Of course I'm here to speak openly.

As Lu Sinan's wife

of Mare Nubium's shares,

141
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,120
I firmly oppose the freeze.

142
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,320

Now this is the big news

we've been waiting for.

148
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,680
The Lu family has always wanted
to take the shares

149
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,120
just because of their eldest son.

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,049
But that's simply not acceptable.

151
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,240
This inheritance dispute

152

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,960
As an executive director,

164
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,040

and even stealing
important company seal and certificate

Stealing company seal and certificate?

That same day,

175
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,200
Director Xia, you made a total of 12 calls

176
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
to the Secretary's Office.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,840
In your communication records,

178
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,240
you were found

179
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,960
providing escape funds and a vehicle

180
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,200
to the other party.

181
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,680
How do you have

182
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,640
my call records?

183
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,920
They must be forged!

184
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,120
The company has reported to the police.

185
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
If you have any explanation,

186
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,520
tell it to the police.

187
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,840
I...

188
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,840
Haimeng.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,840
I...

190
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,720
Your aunt and I—

191
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,200
we didn't do anything.

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,960
Hand over the agreement you signed

193
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,100
with the Lu family.

194
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,320
Agreement? What agreement?

195
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,080
The Ye family's shares

196
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,680
must stay with the Ye family.

197
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
Ye Haimeng!

198
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
Stop throwing your weight around here.

199
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,880
At the last public funeral,

200
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,760
we gave in to you.

201
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,020
Do you think this time,

202
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,800
we'll still be afraid of you?

203
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,280
In our Lu family,

204
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,920
you're nothing but an expelled,

205
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,520
unwanted daughter-in-law.

206
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,720
Let me finish.

207
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,120
Don't think that by taking

208
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,440
my brother's death certificate,

209
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
you can steal

210
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,320
my brother's inheritance.

211
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
Mare Nubium and Cloud Manor

212
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,120
both belong to my brother.

213
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,360
And why are you still alive

214
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
when he's dead?

215
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,540
You're his murderer, aren't you?

216
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,840
Speaking of murderers—

217
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,360
Ke,

218
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,120
where's my car's repair record?

219
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,560
Here.

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,640

[Vehicle Maintenance Service Receipt]

223
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,280
I just moved into Cloud Manor.

224
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,480
One night,

225
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,480
my car was deliberately sabotaged.

226
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,800
Not only were the brakes tampered with,

227

[Vehicle Maintenance Service Receipt]

228
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,560
but it was also set
to accelerate past 100 km/h.

229
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,320
If I had been in that car that day,

230
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,380
do you think I could make it back alive

231
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,200
or I'd die for sure?

232
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
What does your car

233
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,320
have to do with me?

234
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,360
My car

235
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,160
showed clear signs of sabotage.

236
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,880
That person...

237
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,520
Ms. Ye.

238
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,280
Even though there's evidence

239
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,080
to prove your car was sabotaged,

240
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,240
it has nothing to do with Siyue.

241
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,320
She's the young lady of the Lu family.

242
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,800
She's never even had

243
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,560
to lift a finger.

244
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,360
How could she possibly

245
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,440
sabotage your car's braking system?

246
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,700
The young lady of the Lu family wouldn't,

247
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,480
but someone around her...

248
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,080
might.

249
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,240
Three years ago,

250
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,560
Ms. Ye Haimeng's mother,

251
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,920
Ms. Luo Yanxin,

252
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,120
was secretly sent

253
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,520
to a private sanatorium.

254
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,210
Her health continued to deteriorate.

255
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,760
On the night of the 12th last month,

256
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,560
she unfortunately died all of a sudden.

257
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,080
So,

258
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,340
we conducted a detailed investigation.

259
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,330
We found that that very afternoon,

260
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,760
Mr. Jiang Lin, the husband
of the Lu family's daughter,

261
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,880
Lu Siyue,

262
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,520
left the sanatorium in a hurry

263
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,040
just 10 minutes

264
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,240
after Ms. Luo Yanxin's death.

265
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,640
[To the Inpatient Building]

266
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,240
Impossible!

267
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,440
This must be fake!

268
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,360
You must have used

269
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,000
AI technology

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,060
to fabricate this!

271
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,320
Jiang Lin was out
handling business that day.

272
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,560
He couldn't possibly be at the sanatorium!

273
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,120
It wasn't me.

274
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,280
I didn't do anything.

275
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,480
I didn't kill anyone!

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,330
In the face of evidence,

277
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,680
explanations are meaningless.

279
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,680
Take Jiang Lin and Director Xia outside.

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

What's wrong?

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,080
Why don't you let me deliver it for you?

322
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,720
Didn't we promise

Ye Haimeng and Ling Ke

324
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,280
that we'd get the authentication report?

325
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,010
Besides, I promised Ye Haimeng

326
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,020
that I would personally be there.

327
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,880
She asked you to deliver it yourself?

328
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,320
Yes.

329
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,440

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,400
Jiang Lin was taken away by them.

333
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,530
You can't just sit here and do nothing!

334
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,040
Ye Haimeng,

335
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,080
I'm truly impressed.

336
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,040
But

337
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,080
does any of this change the fact

338
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,760
that you and Sinan were once married?

339
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,880
Can it make

340
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,280
all the inheritance Sinan left behind

341
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,010
fall entirely into your hands?

342
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,160
Stop dreaming.

your father personally placed your hand

into Sinan's,

entrusting you to our Lu family.

At that time, I told myself

Haimeng,

557
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,560
do you really have to sever all ties

558
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,720
with the Lu family?

559
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,360
At my age,

560
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,520
I thought
losing a son was the greatest pain.

561
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,520
I never imagined I'd end up facing

562
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,800
the hatred of old friends

563
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,240
and in-laws.

564
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
I always believed

565
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,440
that the Ye and Lu families

566
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,040
would never come to this.

567
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
And we wouldn't become a spectacle

568
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,440
over the mere shares

You're the head of the Ye family now.

Since you've said it yourself,

573
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,040
the Ye and Lu families

574
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,340
will part ways from now on.
