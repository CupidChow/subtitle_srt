[Episode 12]

3
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,800
If...

4
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,240
you don't want our Lu family

5
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,360
to seize

6
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,320
your Mare Nubium Hotel Group

7
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,250
and Cloud Manor,

8
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
then you need to

9
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,620
tell me clearly

10
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,400
how my brother really died.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,800
You think I killed your brother?

12
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,920
In your mind,

13
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,800
I'm the murderer—

14
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,240
the one who killed your brother, right?

15
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
I just want to know the truth!

16
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,080
The truth?

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,100
You want to know the truth?

18
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,720
Fine,

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,530
I'll tell you the truth.

20
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,320
I never wanted to

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,600
kill Lu Sinan.

22
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,360
It was my newlywed husband—

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
your most beloved brother—

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,440
who wanted to kill me.

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
What did you say?

26
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,690
[Library Card]

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,680
Excuse me,

28
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,520
I got this book first.

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,280
I'm sorry,

[Library Card]

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,040
but I renewed the borrowing period first.

32
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,960
One month?

33
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,880
Three weeks?

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,730
One week. Just one week.

35
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,840
I can see that your Latin

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,300
has improved a lot lately.

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,300
How about this—

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,730
write down a name for me.

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,160
No, no.

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
I still need more practice.

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,490
My writing is terrible.

42
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
Not at all.

43
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,560
I think

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,360
your Latin writing is
as good as your Chinese now.

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,160
You're lying.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,970
If you don't believe me,

47
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,840
write down your Chinese name

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,640
so I can see it.

49
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,400
Stop trying to trick me into
signing anything.

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
When we go back to Mare Nubium

51
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,720
and I start handling the documents,

52
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,520
you'll see plenty of my writing.

53
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,560
Your brother, Lu Sinan,

54
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
orchestrated our meeting

55
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,010
and tricked me into signing blank papers.

56
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,080
He wanted to drown me

57
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,640
in the swimming pool

58
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,500
at our overseas honeymoon hotel!

59
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,440
Everyone thought

60
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,560
we were a perfect match.

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,080
But no one knew

62
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,480
that the man I loved completely—

63
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,200
the son-in-law my parents had welcomed

64
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,530
with everything we had,

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,130
and the man I thought

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,520
I could be happy with

67
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,320
forever—

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,460
was someone who had been plotting

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,960
against me from the moment we met.

70
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,840
He tricked me into marriage,

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,770
swindled me out of my money,

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
and tried to kill me—

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,760
turning our honeymoon

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,240
into a death trap!

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,280
You ask

76
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,720
why I escaped from the hospital

77
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,240
despite being badly injured?

78
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,440
Because your brother wanted to kill me.

79
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,600
You ask why I went to

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,280
a poorly equipped hospital for surgery?

81
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,520
Because your brother wanted to kill me!

82
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,000
You ask why I didn't dare return

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,320
to China for 3 years?

84
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,040
Because your own brother

85
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,480
wanted to kill me!

86
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,890
That's not true.

87
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,080
No way.

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,600
My brother wasn't that kind of person.

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,400
You think

90
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,560
he was really as you described

91
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,040
in the study?

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,400
That he was such a gentle,

93
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,560
kind-hearted person?

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,960
He never was!

95
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,040
Your own brother

96
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,360
set a trap from the very start,

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,520
using love as bait

98
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,640
to lure me in.

99
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,280
And as for you...

100
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,920
he never treated you

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,280
as a real brother.

102
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,370
That's not true.

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,080
My brother wasn't like that.

104
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,659
He was always so good to me.

105
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,960
He was always especially good to me!

106
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,560
That was just your illusion!

107
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,760
Your mother

108
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,900
drove his mother to her death.

109
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,800
He was there

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,200
when his stepmother gave birth to you.

111
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
How could he possibly care for you?

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,320
He didn't want you

113
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,720
involved in the family business

114
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,320
because he wanted to
push you out of the family.

115
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,080
That's why he had you learn archery
since childhood.

116
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,800
He simply didn't want to see you,

117
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,720
so he used this tiny

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
championship butterfly medal as an excuse

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,560
to keep you trapped abroad for 10 years!

120
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,920
No!

121
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Lu Sinan

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,000
was never

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,200
the perfect brother you thought he was.

124
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,800
Nor was he

125
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,600
the perfect husband others saw.

126
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,840
He was just like the rest of your family—

127
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,720
for my family's Mare Nubium,

128
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,840
he used marriage as a trap

129
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,680
to kill me.

130
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
That overseas honeymoon...

131
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,760
was never a case of

132
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,620
a rich woman killing her husband,

133
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,250
but rather your Lu family's eldest son

134
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,600

to Cloud Manor?

152
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,520
Fortunately, Tan Xin was sharp enough

153
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,780
to have you follow her.

154

It's good that she went back.

What should we do about Lu Siyu?

156

Lu Siyu?

157
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,900
Don't bother with him.

158
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,960
Over the next few days,

159
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,920
I'll be at the company

160
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,000
handling some business.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,840
As for Haimeng,

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,100
keep a closer eye on her

163
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,760
and watch out for

164
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,220
any strangers around her.

165
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,160
Got it.

166
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,060
Contact me anytime if anything happens.

167
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,160
You're awake.

168
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,320
I don't usually stay up late.

169
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,880
It's already

170
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,680
past my normal bedtime.

171
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,480
Well, I'm really sorry about that.

172
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,440
You probably won't

173
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,600
get any sleep tonight.

174
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,800
Do we really need to audit

175
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,680
all the construction project finances

176
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,720
from the past 5 years?

177
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,360
Do you think I've pulled you

178
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,480
into overtime

179
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,640
because I have nothing better to do?

180
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,880
No, I don't.

181
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,080
But I think...

182
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,850
you're looking for something.

183
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,260
What are you trying to say?

184
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,200
Or did someone tell you something?

185
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,860
"Someone?"

186
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,530
Who exactly?

187
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,960
Haimeng?

188
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
Stop making wild guesses.

189
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,160
My business

190
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,800
has never had anything to do with Haimeng.

191
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,600
Instead of wasting energy on
these speculations,

192
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,400
you should focus

193
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,440
on your work.

194
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
Perhaps

195
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,640
after we finish going through
all these files,

196
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,200
you'll find

197
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
the answers you're looking for.

198
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,000
[Defacing her car like that is too much.]

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,300
[Despise and condemn this behavior; Bump!]

200
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,050
[You need evidence to call someone
a murderer.]

201
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,870
[Vandalizing her car with black paint;
that's low.]

202
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,700
[Ms. Ye is very beautiful and gentle.]

203
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,540
[I don't believe she's a murderer.]

204
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,520
[Maybe she was framed.]

205
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,450
[Or maybe her husband tried to kill her?]

206
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,450
[Word is, the person who sprayed the car
got caught by the cops.]

207
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,250
[These bad guys should be punished.]

208
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,000
[Mare Nubium has always belonged to
the Ye family.]

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
[The Lu family is staking their claim
and trying to seize her company.]

210
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
[They're pushing Ye Haimeng out.]

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,990
[A crowd of shameless fools bullying
a defenseless woman.]

212
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,560
What did

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,730
Ye Haimeng do behind the scenes

214
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,060
to turn public opinion like this?

215
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,360
Siyue.

216
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,600
Go get the door.

217
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
What have we come to?

218
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,080
Since when do I,

219
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,240
a daughter of the Lu family,

220
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,970
have to answer the door myself?

221
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Can't believe it.

222
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,640
Who is it?

223
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,920
What's with the silence?

224
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,920
Here,

225
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,360
finish all of this.

226
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,970
You've lost weight.

227
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,850
While you were away these past few days...

228
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,780
I've been especially worried about you.

229
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
You don't look

230
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,920
very well.

231
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,330
Where's Dad?

232
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,520
Dad would never live with us

233
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
in such a shabby place.

234
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,240
Stop talking nonsense.

235
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,400
Your dad's not feeling well,

236
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,640
so he went to a sanatorium.

237
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,920
There's something wrong

238
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,960
with our villa,

239
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,680
so your dad wants us

240
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,200
to stay here

241
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,260
just temporarily.

242
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,120
Mom.

243
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,330
Has something happened...

244
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
to our family?

245
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
We can't live

246
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
in our huge villa.

247
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,160
Jiang Lin and Siyue

248
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,880
can't get involved in
our company's business.

249
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,040
And we're even trying to take over

250
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Mare Nubium,

251
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,570
which never belonged to us.

252
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,220
That car accident overseas years ago

253
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,640
was never an accident...

254
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,140
but something
you all planned together, right?

255
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,920
It was you all who planned it,

256
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,380
trying to kill Ye Haimeng.

257
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,920
Lu Siyu!

258
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Who told you this?

259
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,720
I came back this time

260
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,620
just to ask you:

261
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,280
was

262
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
my brother's marriage to Ye Haimeng

263
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,400
only because she's

264
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,460
the only daughter of the Ye family...

265
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,480
and the sole heir

266
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,140
to all of her family's wealth?

267
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,480
As long as my brother could become
the Ye family's son-in-law,

268
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,880
all their assets,

269
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,360
including Mare Nubium,

270
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,160
would fall into his
and our family's hands, right?

271
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,400
These are all rumors

272
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
spread by outsiders!

273
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,880
Our family isn't short of money.

274
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,740
Our overseas investments

275
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,680
far exceed

276
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,960
Mare Nubium.

277
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,420
You are a son of our family.

278
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,520
Are you looking down on your own family

279
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,040
or your family members?

280
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,520
I wish this weren't true too.

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,240
But why was the property custody agreement

282
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
that you've always emphasized

283
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
forged

284
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,720
by my brother alone?

285
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,880
Why would such an important agreement

286
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,760
be reprinted

287
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,960
at Mare Nubium?

288
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,320
Why did you immediately

289
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,080
move into Cloud Manor

290
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,040
after my brother went abroad?

291
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,280
Why did you have

292
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,800
the property deed to Cloud Manor?

293
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,920
And even when Ye Haimeng's mother

294
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,600
suddenly collapsed,

295
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,760
why was she sent to

296
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,040
our Changlu's private sanatorium?

297
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,720
Siyu...

298
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,280
If all this isn't enough,

299
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,920
then why

300
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,000
didn't you immediately search for

301
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,160
Sinan and Haimeng

302
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,200
when the accident suddenly happened?

303
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,600
You had Jiang Lin

304
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,800
hastily settle things
with the overseas police

305
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,720
and quickly moved into Mare Nubium.

306
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,760
Using Sinan's estate management
as an excuse,

307
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,720
you took over

308
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,880
the Ye family's Mare Nubium.

309
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,200
This evidence is enough to prove

310
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,160
that you plotted everything
from the start.

311
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,560
You deliberately wanted to

312
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,080
kill the Ye family's only daughter.

313
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,960
You wanted to take over

314
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,640
Mare Nubium, built on generations

315
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,970
of the Ye family's toil.

316
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,000
How could we possibly

317
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,480
scheme against their only daughter?

318
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,760
And how could Sinan

319
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,020
possibly listen to us?

320
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
Who told you all this?

321
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,400
Ye Haimeng?

322
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,400
Mom!

323
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,960
I just want to ask you—

324
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,760
when my brother Lu Sinan

325
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,400
proposed to Haimeng,

326
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,240
was it on his own accord?

327
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,720
Answer me.

328
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,840
Mom.

329
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,079
Lu Siyu.

330
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,760
Listen up.

331
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,420
I don't care what you've heard

332
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,680
from others outside.

333
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,680
I'll tell you one thing only:

334
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,660
the one who died abroad

335
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,839
was the eldest son of our Lu family.

336
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,770
The one who returned to Mare Nubium

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,200
alive

338
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,619
was Ye Haimeng.

339
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,520
Whether or not we conspired

340
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,800
with your brother,

341
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,200
he

342
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,600
is dead.

343
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,040
Our Lu family

344
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,200
has lost a son.

345

Mom,

354
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,160
how did Siyu find out about everything?

355
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,720
Could it really be

356
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,120
that Ye Haimeng told him?

357
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,280
Wouldn't that mean...

358
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
Ye Haimeng knew all along

359
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,100
that Sinan wanted to kill her?

360
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,720
It seems

361
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,930
she knew about it all along.

362
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,140
That's why she hid away for 3 years

363
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,320
after being injured,

364
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,490
waiting until we let our guard down

365
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,220
before secretly coming back.

366
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Ye Haimeng actually waited for 3 years.

367
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,760
That's terrifying.

368

Don't panic.

369
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
From Siyu's tone,

370
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,400
he probably only knows

371
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
that Sinan tried to kill her,

372
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,600
but he doesn't know why.

373
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,080
