You all prefer death, right?

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,270
Then you can die!

181
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,720
I, Lu Changdong,

182
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,750
don't need sons,

183
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,770
don't need daughters,

184
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,930
and don't need a family.

185
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,280
You're nothing but my burdens.

186
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Just dead weight!

187
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,670
Purely useless!

188
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,510
Dad.

189
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,150
Dad!

190
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,790
Siyue.

191
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,320
Dad!

192
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,080
Siyue.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,550
Haimeng.

194
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,080
I brought your favorite...

195
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,440
Haimeng.

196
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,960
Doctor!

197
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,790
Nurse!

198
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,590
What's wrong?

199
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,390
Didn't I ask you to watch Haimeng?

200
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,270
Where is she?

201
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,390
The doctor asked me to sign something.

202
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,920
I thought I'd be right back.

203
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,390
Never mind that now.

204
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,590
Let's find her first.

205
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,720
Siyu.

206
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,200
Where are you?

207
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,870
I'm coming to get you.

208
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,600
Siyu.

209
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,300
Come back quickly.

210
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,300
I'm waiting for you under my tree.

211
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,440
I'll wait until you return.

212
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,630
Tell me

213
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,670
[I'll wait until you return.]

214
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,630
when you're back.

215
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,510
[Tell me you'll come back.]

216
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,180
You will come back.

217
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,520
[You will come back.]

218
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,870
Jie.

219
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,550
Go to the Fire and Maritime

220
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,840
Rescue Bureau immediately

221
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,670
to get Siyu.

222
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,390
Go get Lu Siyu!

223
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Mr. Fei.

224
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,120
Could you

225
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,390
help me find Siyu?

226
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,480
He jumped into the sea.

227
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,960
But I know he must still be alive.

228
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,240
He must still be alive.

229
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,700
Could you help me find him?

230
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,150
Haimeng!

231
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,750
Haimeng!

232
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,360
Haimeng!

233
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,080
Haimeng.

234
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,240
Ling Ke.

235
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,240
You came at the right time.

236
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,750
I've sent Siyu

237
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,600
many messages,

238
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,870
but he hasn't replied to any of them.

239
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,510
Could you help me

240
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,480
call him?

241
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
Help me find him.

242
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,960
Please help me find him.

243
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,840
Haimeng.

244
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,510
-Don't be like this, Haimeng.
-Ling Ke.

245
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,550
Where's your phone?

246
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,670
Where's your phone?

247
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,510
Haimeng.

248
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,370
Haimeng, get a grip.

249
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,270
Lu Siyu fell into the sea.

250
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,480
The rescue teams

251
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,080
had searched for him all day.

252
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,720
He's gone.

253
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,320
He has disappeared!

254
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,520
He's not coming back!

255
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,450
That's impossible.

256
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,360
Siyu wouldn't disappear like that.

257
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,270
He promised me

258
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,790
he would come back.

259
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,670
He said he'd always be by my side.

260
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,150
Siyu has said

261
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,390
as long as I'm in pain,

262
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,650
he will come back to me.

263
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,790
I need to call Siyu.

264
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,840
Haimeng.

265
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,320
Haimeng, get a grip!

266
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,670
Stop fooling yourself!

267
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Lu Siyu is already...

268
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,000
Ling Ke.

269
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,630
It's a message from Siyu.

270
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,600
Haimeng.

271
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,670
It's me.

272
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Do you still remember

273
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,240
the three requests

274
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
I mentioned to you

275
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,630
that night

276
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,830
we just got together?

277
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,150
Back then,

278
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,840
my third request

279
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,010
was left empty.

280
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,870
Now,

281
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,480
I want to use the third one.

282
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,390
My final request to you

283
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,750
is as follows:

284
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,240
Ye Haimeng,

285
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,030
keep living.

286
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,790
No matter what happens

287
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,760
and no matter what hardships you face,

288
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,360
please remember

289
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,840
how you survived

290
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,480
that terrible disaster

291
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,150
and how hard you fought

292
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,280
to come back from it.

293
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,600
I hope

294
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
even in the days without me,

295
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,910
you'll still be brave and firm,

296
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
and follow your heart

297
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,750
to live freely.

298
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,630
Haimeng,

299
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
I really love you.

300
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,510
Haimeng.

301
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,270
If you want to cry,

302
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,910
just let it out.

303
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,130
How's it going?

304
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Did they find him?

305
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,760
Is there any news about Siyu?

306
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,440
Did they rescue him?

307
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,130
Where's Dad?

308
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Forget Dad.

309
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,310
Tell me the news first.

310
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,590
Dad's in the study, right?

311
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,990
I'll go talk to him first.

312
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,510
Tell me first!

313
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,110
Tell me now.

314
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,030
Did they find Siyu?

315
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,610
Did they rescue him?

316
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,640
Siyue.

317
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
I don't want to tell you the details,

318
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,160
because I'm afraid
it will break your heart.

319
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,750
The rescue teams

320
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,550
had done a thorough search

321
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,010
for three days and nights.

322
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,500
But apart from finding

323
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,400
Siyu's jacket,

324
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,800
they found nothing else.

325
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,480
The most experienced

326
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,810
rescue team leader said

327
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,670
where Siyu fell into the sea,

328
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,140
the undercurrents were the most dangerous.

329
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,550
When Siyu fell in,

330
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,200
it was during high tide

331
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,130
and he got swept away immediately.

332
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,240
It was already

333
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,720
a miracle that they even

334
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
found Ye Haimeng.

335
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,270
We've already passed

336
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,930
the golden window for rescue.

337
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,480
Siyu...

338
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,550
I'm afraid...

339
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,790
Siyue.

340
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,810
But I don't believe it.

341
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,990
I don't believe Siyu is just gone
like that.

342
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,300
He didn't leave a single word.

343
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,720
He didn't leave a single word

344
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,200
to me, his own sister.

345
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,850
He couldn't have just left
like that.

346
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,680
Although he's been mischievous
since childhood

347
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,940
and never regards me as his elder sister,

348
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,800
he is still my younger brother.

349
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,810
He's my own brother.

350
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,590
We might fight

351
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,110
and argue.

352
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,790
I might complain that in this family

00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,480
into Lu Changdong's scheme too early.

525
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,110
However, later on, Mare Nubium

526
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,830
still had a situation
where large amounts of funds

527
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,240
were secretly withdrawn.

528
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,830
Ye Yuezhi is very cunning.

529
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,590
For the past five years,

530
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,550
all the accounts

531
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,350
have been balanced flawlessly.

532
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,830
Did all those funds

533
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,440
go to the land buyers?

534
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,880
We're not sure about this yet.

535
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,110
How about the domestic information?

536
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,270
It's far more dramatic

537
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,200
than we thought.

538
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,830
Changlu Group

539
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,550
has developed rapidly
over the past decades.

540
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,750
From south to north across the country,

541
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,810
their investments were everywhere.

542
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,350
After making enough money,

543
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,160
six years ago

544
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,070
they made a hasty decision

545
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,200
to expand overseas.

546
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,750
But Changlu lacked the capability
for overseas operations.

547
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,590
They struggled to build relationships
with local authorities

548
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,830
and faced excessive labor costs abroad.

549
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,960
The company was forced

550
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,310
to use

551
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,920
a large amount of reserve funds.

552
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
Later,

553
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,240
when a challenging period came about,

554
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,480
their massive investments

555
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,000
in the domestic and foreign real estate
sectors

556
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,200
vanished overnight.

557
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,070
So Changlu's domestic cash flow

558
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,530
collapsed dramatically.

559
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,180
To make matters worse,

560
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,720
they also fell into the trap

561
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,920
of high-interest, large-scale loans.

562
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,640
Legitimate channels

563
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,750
or underground channels?

564
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,030
Such a huge loophole

565
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,640
couldn't be covered

566
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,930
by legitimate channels at all.

567
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,310
I see.

568
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,110
So six years ago,

569
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,790
Changlu expanded overseas,

570
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,160
resulting in massive losses.

571
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,200
This pushed the company

572
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,830
into high-interest financing.

573
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,890
To prevent Changlu from collapsing,

574
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,070
Lu Changdong

575
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,070
came up with a plan to plunder Mare Nubium

576
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,000
and use the Ye family as the cash cow

577
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,600
to cover Changlu's losses.

578
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,440
That's right.

579
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,890
That should be the starting point

580
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,880
of everything.

581
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,240
How's the situation inside Mare Nubium?

582
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,500
We had already secured

583
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,350
our share of Lu Sinan's inheritance,

584
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,310
but the sudden emergence

585
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,510
of the notarized will

586
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,310
led to the re-freezing

587
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,310
of that 37% stake

588
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,710
jointly owned by you two.

589
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,310
Moreover,

590
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,790
the shareholders Lu Changdong placed

591
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,680
on the board

592
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,030
are restricting you

593
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,090
in both board seats

594
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,750
and overall control.

595
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,960
There are also

596
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,110
those branch companies
that announced their separation

597
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,440
from the headquarters.

598
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,440
Have they closed off both financial
and administrative channels

599
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,920
to the headquarters?

600
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,960
Haimeng,

601
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,240
what's your plan

602
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,930
to break through this time?

603
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,590
Give me some time.

604
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,530
I need to think about it.

605
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,790
Think carefully

606
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,440
about your strategy to break the deadlock.

607
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,590
I'll go back first

608
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,880
to gather more useful information

609
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,210
and bring it back to you.

610
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,810
Is there anything else you want to say?

611
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,750
I'm sorry for keeping

612
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,550
my situation from you

613
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,440
for so long.

614
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,440
Do you think

615
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,510
I didn't know who you were

616
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,890
when I kept you by my side for so long

617
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,690
and told you all my secrets?

618
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,690
Are you certain

619
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,160
she's the only daughter

620
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,550
of Zhang Yujie,

621
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,970
the former CFO of Mare Nubium?

622
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,480
Got it.

623
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,040
Thank you.

624
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,110
So you've known

625
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,070
who I am since then.

626
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,960
Since I landed at the honeymoon hotel,

627
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,160
you had been following me the whole time.

628
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,480
If you weren't trying to kill me,

629
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,510
you must have wanted something from me.

630
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,160
But that accident

631
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,420
disrupted your plans.

632
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,110
To clear your mother's name

633
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,550
and get access

634
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,610
to Mare Nubium's senior leadership,

635
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,750
you had no choice but to help me.

636
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,750
Isn't that right?

637
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,110
Yes.

638
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,920
If I had trusted a stranger

639
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,480
who suddenly appeared

640
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,160
by my side

641
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,820
just because I was in trouble,

642
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,440
then I wouldn't be qualified

643
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,100
to run the entire Mare Nubium.

644
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,600
But along this journey,

645
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,270
I've stopped seeing you

646
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,600
as just a pawn in my game.

647
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,370
It's because of you

648
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,620
that I've made it this far.

650

Haimeng.

652
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Thank you.
