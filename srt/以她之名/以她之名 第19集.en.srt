Does it hurt?

18
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,520
Haimeng.

19
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,190
How do you know

20
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,390
the name Zhang Yujie?

21
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,520
She worked at Mare Nubium

22
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
as a financial officer for 20 years.

23
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,790
She was my uncle's most trusted person.

24
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,630
Even though Ms. Zhang and I

25
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,680
don't know each other,

26
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,210
I met her only daughter once

27
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,800
back in those days.

28
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,400
Though your appearance
has changed somewhat,

29
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
I remember this mole on your ear.

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,030
So what if I am her?

31
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,280
So what if I'm not?

32
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,680
Being her

33
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,240
doesn't change

34
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,370
what I have to do now.

35
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,560
And if I'm not,

36
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,630
that still doesn't hide the secrets

37
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,160
the Ye family wants to bury.

38
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,080
What exactly are you looking for?

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,480
What secrets do you have?

40
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,240
Let go!

41
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,450
You must tell me today.

42
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,000
If you don't tell me,

43
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,920
I won't let go.

44
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,240
If you refuse to tell me,

45
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,360
then I will really

46
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,480
stand against you.

47
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,870
I'll expose everything

48
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,070
you've been doing here.

49
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,330
I'm looking for money.

50
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,480
Money?

51
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,390
Yes.

52
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,680
I'm looking for a huge sum of money—

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
funds secretly siphoned

54
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,190
from Mare Nubium's Finance Department

55
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,159
ten years ago

56
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,020
and are still missing to this day.

57
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,330
If that money isn't found,

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,120
Mare Nubium will collapse.

59
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,159
If it isn't found,

60
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,070
someone will have to pay

61
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,630
with their life.

62
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
Does it hurt?

63
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,310
No.

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
This is much better

65
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,790
than the surgical wound.

66
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,780
You're lying to me.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,330
It really doesn't hurt.

68
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,950
But your hand...

69
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,330
You have a match coming up.

70
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,810
What will you do with an injured hand?

71
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,600
They only had table knives.

72
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,330
It's just a superficial wound.

73
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,040
But you...

74
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,920
Haimeng.

75
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,270
Could you please

76
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,360
stop protecting me?

77
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,800
Please take care of yourself, okay?

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,920

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,480
The police took the surveillance footage.

176
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,630
If they find anything,

177
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,480
they'll immediately

178
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,150
notify us.

179
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,320
I'm not worried about
those two getting away.

180
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,870
I'm more concerned about Siyu.

181
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,440
They were clearly

182
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,600
targeting him.

183
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,510
Ms. Ye, have you ever suspected

184
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,510
that they might be

185
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,920
sent by the Lu family?

186
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,550
That's unlikely.

187
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:32,840
This is

188
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,750
beyond

189
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,080
normal comprehension.

190
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,000
What is this?

191
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,120
[Notarized Personal Will of an Individual]

192
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,870
As you can see,

193
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,600
this is Lu Sinan's personal will

194
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,720
that he wrote

195
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,670
after marrying you.

196
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,390
It was handled in full accordance
with legal procedures,

197
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,490
witnessed by a professional legal team,

198
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,000
[The person who made the will: Lu Sinan]

199
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,320
and properly filed

200
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,850
as a Notarized Personal Will
of an Individual

201
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,150
So Lu Sinan

202
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,080
not only left

203
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,510
that custody agreement.

204
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
He had already notarized

205
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,850
his personal will long ago.

206
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,390
To be precise,

207
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,270
that custody agreement

208
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,320
was forged by the Lu family

209
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,270
after they received

210
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,150
Lu Sinan's signature

211
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,080
on blank paper.

212
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,810
But this notarized will

213
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
was personally created by him

214
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,270
witnessed by a professional legal team

215
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,070
in full compliance with the law.

216
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,240
It is

217
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,570
fully legally binding.

218
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,200
And in this notarized will,

219
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,670
Lu Sinan left

221
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,240
to his younger brother.

222
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,790
That means all the Mare Nubium shares

223
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,840
he acquired

224
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,200

come from?

232
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,040
The Lu family.

233
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,600
And they didn't just

234
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
send it to us.

235
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,510
They also sent it to the media

and all parties

237
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,640
involved in this matter.

238
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,510
The Mare Nubium presidential couple's

239
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,240
inheritance case

240
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,720
sees a major twist today.

241
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,480
The Lu family
has revealed a notarized will

242
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,150
personally left by their eldest son
while he was alive.

243
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,200
The large stake in Mare Nubium,

244
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,120
once thought settled,

245
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,910
may now return to the Lu family.

246
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,080
Lu Siyu,

247
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,200
inheriting

248
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,670
all of his late brother
Lu Sinan's estate,

249
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,840
he will become the largest shareholder

250
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,700
of Mare Nubium.

251
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,840
The Lu family could reassert control
over Mare Nubium

252
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,900
under the name of their youngest son.

253
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,550
I always said that one day

254
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,080
we would fight our way back.

255
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,630
This time when we return,

256
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,630
we'll not only take back

257
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,030
the acting presidency of Mare Nubium,

258
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,840
we'll also storm the board

259
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,260
and become the largest shareholder.

260
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,840
Ms. Lu Siyue, Mr. Jiang Lin,

261
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,790
are you really planning to

262
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,120
return to Mare Nubium?

263
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Did Mr. Lu Sinan really

264
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,240
leave all inheritance rights

265
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,720
to his brother Lu Siyu?

266
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,910
Can the Lu family regain control

267
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,030
of Mare Nubium

268
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,230
through Lu Siyu's large shareholding?

269
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,390
Please share your thoughts.

270
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,360
Ms. Ye,

271
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,680
are you alright?

272
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,390
I'm fine.

273
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,360
So now,

274
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,630
Lu Siyue and Jiang Lin

275
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,910
have returned to Mare Nubium

276
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,510
and taken seats on the board.

277
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,080
Cloud Manor

278
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,840
has also been reoccupied

279
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,320
by Lu Changdong and Chen Mo.

280
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,000
Even though we anticipated

281
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,870
that probate process for Lu Sinan's estate

282
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,130
wouldn't go smoothly,

283
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,750
what was completely unexpected

284
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,360
was that the Lu family

285
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,030
had another card up their sleeve.

286
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,960
They've now presented

287
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,000
a notarized will that Lu Sinan

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,260
personally arranged while he was alive.

289
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,120
The legal effect of this notarized will

290
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,910
far exceeds

291
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,600
all the judicial procedures

292
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,130
we've gone through before.

293
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,390
Under the principles

294
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,720
of spousal inheritance,

295
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,840
the Lu family does have the right

296
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,930
to contest and seek a division

297
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,200
of both Mare Nubium's equity

298
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,790
and the ownership of Cloud Manor.

299
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,910
Moreover, there's now

300
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,510
an even more crucial figure,

301
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,870
Lu Siyu.

302
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,360
Yes.

303
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
He is now Lu Sinan's

304
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,150
sole heir

305
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,410
designated in the notarized will.

306
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,630
Following the principle
that whoever benefits

307
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,870
has the strongest motive,

308
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,750
can we really believe Lu Siyu truly

309
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,000
knows nothing about your car accident

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,840
years ago?

311
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,790
Was his invitation for you

312
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,480
to participate in the competition

313
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,840
also directed by the Lu family?

314
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,910
It's quite possible

315
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,080
that he sent you away on purpose,

316
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,480
giving the Lu family time

317
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,270
to seize control of Mare Nubium

318
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,120
and Cloud Manor

319
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,000
and gain a tactical advantage.

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,670
Impossible.

321
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,320
Where profit is concerned,

322
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,650
nothing is impossible.

323
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,440
After four years,

324
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,320
are you going to use the same approach

325
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,000
to trust his own brother?

326
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,030
Lu Siyu now holds

327
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,270
inheritance rights to half of Mare Nubium,

328
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,870
financial assets worth

329
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,510
tens of billions.

330
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,240
It's impossible that he

331
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,720
knows nothing about this matter.

332
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,750
From the moment his name appeared

333
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,080
in the notarized document,

334
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,600
he became the Lu family's deadliest weapon

335
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,870
to manipulate you.

336
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:35,960

everything now.

340
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,110
You all go back first.

341

Ms. Ye, we've already...

343
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,630
Listen to me. Go.

[Notarized Personal Will of an Individual]

345

Aren't he and Lu Sinan

blood brothers?
