I have performed

9
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
a comprehensive examination on her

10

as requested by Ms. Ling Ke.

11
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,440
Her vital signs are

12
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,320
relatively stable.

13
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,880
But

14
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,079
the prognosis for her wrist fracture

15
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,880
and the spinal implant surgery
in her lumbar region

16
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,200
is quite poor.

17
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,920
Some time ago,

18
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,520
while she was undergoing treatment
at my clinic,

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,000
signs of infection had already emerged.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
At that time, I advised her

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
to undergo another surgery.

22
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
But it seems now

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,800
she has no intention of doing so.

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,640
Spinal implant surgery?

25
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,760
Her high fever and loss of consciousness

26
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,240
are likely due to discitis

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
and the recurrence of old injuries.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,720

and severe emotional distress

30
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,360
have further exacerbated her condition.

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,320
For now, all we can do is

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,880
alleviating her inflammation and pain.

33
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,760
Beyond that,

34
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,690
there are
no more effective medical interventions.

and anti-inflammatory medications.

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,800
nor do I hold equity shares
in Mare Nubium.

352
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Then what gives you the right

353
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
to call yourself the president

354
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,280
of Mare Nubium?

355
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,440
Ms. Ye,

356
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,120
you are Lu Sinan's wife.

357
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,080
Mare Nubium is

358
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,810
your shared marital property.

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880
Moreover,

360
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,520
according to your

361
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,000
postnuptial asset trusteeship agreement,

362
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,600
the Lu family holds

363
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,200
inheritance rights
to half of Sinan's shares.

364
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,320
As the eldest son-in-law of the Lu family,

365
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,800
I've been entrusted by my parents-in-law

366
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,520
to manage them on their behalf.

367
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,180
So it's
your parents-in-law's authorization.

368
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
You're the Lu family's eldest son-in-law.

369
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,240
However,

370
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,680
does anyone in the Lu family

371
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,940
actually respect you?

372
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,840
You're

373
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,520
just a frontman for the Lu family

374
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,120
and a scapegoat for Lu Siyue.

375
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,080
Know your place in the Lu family

376
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,580
before you speak to me.

377
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,320
The president of Mare Nubium Hotel Group

378
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,560
can never be handed to someone

379
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,040
without a single share.

380
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,240
From now on,

381
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,880
Jiang Lin

382
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,600
will no longer serve

383
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,080
as the acting president of Mare Nubium.

384
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,800
What?

385
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,570
[Jiang Lin,
Acting President of Mare Nubium]

386
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,880
What's going on here?

387
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,440
Haimeng.

388
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,020
Haimeng, you're here.

389
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,400
You guys really...

390
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,040
Haimeng is family.

391
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,480
Why the fuss?

392
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
I thought something serious had happened.

393
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,000
Don't mind them.

394
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,530
Haimeng.

395
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,520
Since you're here today,

396
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,560
and it's been so long
since we uncle and niece met,

397
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,160
let's take this opportunity

398
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,120
to sit down

399
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,040
and

400
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,600
have a chat.

401
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,940
Who said you could sit?

402
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,200
Haimeng.

403
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,040
This is the President's Office

404
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,480
at Mare Nubium.

405
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,360
Who wants to call you Uncle and chat

406
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,850
about family matters here?

407
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,000
Haimeng,

408
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,540
Dad didn't mean to offend you.

409
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
We can all still sit

410
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,280
and talk things through.

411
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,520
I asked you

412
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,580
whether you wanted to be my friend or foe.

413
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,880
Now it seems

414
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,530
you've chosen to stand against me.

415
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,770
That's not true.

416
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,520
Get out.

417
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,320
You don't get to speak here.

418
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,000
Haimeng.

419
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,720
Haimeng,

420
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,920
let me explain, okay?

421
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,440
Haimeng,

422
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,760
it's not what you think!

423
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,480
Haimeng!

424
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,400
During my 3-year absence from Mare Nubium,

425
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,570
Ye Yuezhi mismanaged operations,

426
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,360
causing internal chaos.

427
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,400
From now on,

428
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,490
Ye Yuezhi will be relieved of his role
of Vice President.

429
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,520
Haimeng.

430
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,170
Am I hearing correctly?

431
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
You want to dismiss me too?

432
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,200
Let's not even discuss

433
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,400
whether you have the authority.

434
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,970
On a personal level,

435
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,200
I am your uncle.

436
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,440
For 30 years,

437
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,920
your father, mother,

438
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,480
and I

439
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
have managed Mare Nubium.

440
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,520
At least half of this

441
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,160
was managed by me for your father.

442
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,280
During

443
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,960
your 3-year absence,

444
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,840
Bochen and I

445
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,920
worked diligently

446
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,520
to guard Mare Nubium for you.

447
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,520
How can you

448
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,840
kick down the ladder
right after you came back?

449
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,000
Why target me?

450
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,040
You guarded Mare Nubium for me?

451
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,690
You guarded Mare Nubium for me,

452
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,080
but my mother was sent

453
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,480
to a private sanatorium—

454
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,180
her whereabouts unknown.

455
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,280
Yet those with ulterior motives

456
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
took high positions at Mare Nubium.

457
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,360
You hold my mother's shares,

458
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,840
but you let the Ye family

459
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,040
lose actual control.

460
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,890
That's how you guarded Mare Nubium for me?

461
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,140
Ye Yuezhi is dismissed
from his role of Vice President,

462
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,080
effective immediately.

463
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,160
Ye Haimeng!

464
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,600
Ye Haimeng!

465
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,320
Why did you remove

466
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,680
Jiang Lin's president nameplate?

467
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,440
Do you really want to seize

468
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,640
Mare Nubium?

469
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,970
What did you say?

470
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I said you want to seize Mare Nubium!

471
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,280
Half of Mare Nubium

472
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,640
belongs to my brother.

473
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,130
You're trying to take it all for yourself!

474
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,200
Mention Lu Sinan in front of me again,

475
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
and I'll show you

476
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,760
who the true owner

477
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
of Mare Nubium is.

478
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:58,960
You...

479
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,490
Who are you trying to scare?

480
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,340
You're scared?

481
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,800
Save the threats.

482
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,320
Today, even if you

483
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,600
dismiss Jiang Lin

484
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,520
and drive out your Uncle Yuezhi here,

485
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,640
Mare Nubium

486
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,240
will never be yours alone.

487
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,800
Never?

488
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,960
Since your marriage with Sinan,

489
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,880
Mare Nubium

490
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,680
has become your shared marital property.

491
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,040
Before your incident,

492
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,760
you signed

493
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,720
a property custody agreement.

494
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,000
It clearly bears

495
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,120
your signature.

496
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,660
You agreed that after Sinan's incident,

497
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,960
your shared assets

498
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,080
would be managed

499
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,760
by the Lu family.

500
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,680
Now,

501
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,800
Sinan's death declaration

502
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,080
hasn't been processed yet.

503
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,760
The shareholding structure
of Mare Nubium's major shareholders is

504
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,960
disorganized.

505
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,040
It's still unclear

506
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,440
how many shares you truly hold

507
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,360
in Mare Nubium.

508
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
What right do you have
to dismiss Jiang Lin?

509
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
What right do you have

510
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
to be Mare Nubium's president?

511
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,440
Madam is right.

512
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,840
We haven't even confirmed

513
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,560
if you're
Mare Nubium's largest shareholder.

514
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
I'm afraid

515
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,520
you can't

516
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,960
be the president.

517
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,280
You think

518
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,680
bringing a dead person's photo

519
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,280
will make Mare Nubium yours?

520
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,760
To have a say here,

521
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,720
you need shares.

522
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,640

If you didn't answer,

630
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,280
I'd have no choice

631
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,340
but to go to Bochen.

632
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,480
Have you forgotten

633
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,210
every word I said to you before?

634
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,200
What you said?

635
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,680
That I should stay away from you?

636
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,840
But I also said

637
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,180
I don't want to.

638
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,760
Do you even know

639
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,880
what's happening between me

640
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,810
and your family?

641

643
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,720

645
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,920

646
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,040
I know

647
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,320
the conflict between you is

648
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,450
because of my brother and Mare Nubium.

649
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,360
Those hotels and company shares—

650
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,080
I'm not interested in any of them.

651

In life,

652
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,280
money matters.

653
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,680
But beyond money,

654
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,410
there are things you can't buy,

655
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,450
can't obtain, and can't force.

656
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,040
Those 2 things are called

657
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,800
affection

658
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,800
and sincerity.

659
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,370
Don't say such strange things.

660
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
It's not strange.

661
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,520
Actually,

662
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,170
after I woke up that day,

663
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,440
I realized

664
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,540
you were already gone.

665
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,000
I called you,

666
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,260
but you didn't answer.

667
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,600
I have no idea

668
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,040
what you've been busy with these days

669
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,240
or where you've been.

670
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,320
I just want to give you the medicine.

671
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,620
You were very sick that night.

672
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,920
The doctor prescribed you
a lot of medicine:

673
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,680
painkillers,

674
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,440
anti-inflammatory medications,

675
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,400
and fever reducers.

676
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,930
You didn't take any of them.

677
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,720
I guess

678
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,040
you haven't taken

679
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,920
a single pill these days, have you?

680
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,120
Are your old injuries

681
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
still flaring up?

682
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,770
Do they hurt?

683
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
The doctor told me

684
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,680
you can't stop taking your medications.

685
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,440
So

686
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,560
I just want to give you the medicine box.

687
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,160
No need.

688
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,440
Wait.

689
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,240
Don't go yet!

690
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
The medicine box.

691
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,840
The medicine box?

692
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,760
It's in my room.

693
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,560
I'll go get it now.

694
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,360
Don't bother.

695
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
It's quite late.
