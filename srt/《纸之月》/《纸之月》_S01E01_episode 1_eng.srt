00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,850
 Kim Seo Hyung

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,770
 Yoo Sun / Seo Young Hee

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,830
 Lee Shi Woo / Gong Jung Hwan

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,580
 Lee Chun Hee / Yoon Hee Seok

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,320
 Pale Moon

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,080
 The characters, places, agencies, incidents, organizations in this drama have no connection to real life.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,050

8
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,760
 The unidentified woman in her 20s found dead near the Geumeun River last week

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,520
 was found to be an employee fired from SD Savings Bank,

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,700
 where the embezzlement incident took place recently.

11
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,090
 The police are investigating the two cases, believing them to be related.

12
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,560
 Back to Reporter Shin Seung Ho.

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,960
 Suvarnabhumi Airport

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,750
This way! Come quickly!

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,730
 Episode 1 
 Let's get on the bus quickly!

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,390
Please hurry up!

17
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,590
That is a nice pair.

18
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,000
Baht! Only baht! 
 (Thai currency)

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,580
She must be crazy. 
 (in Thai)

20
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,410
Look, she gave me her whole wallet! 
  (in Thai)

21
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,110
One thousand and three hundred baht!

22
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,650
Dirty!

23
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,290
No! Dirty.

24
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,080
Next!

25
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,630
 Dirty money...

26
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,180
That woman who ran away with tens of billions of won last time.

27
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,570
How could she carry that much money?

28
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,000
I know, right? Where do you think she's hiding right now?

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,580
She might not be hiding.

30
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,580
A hundred thousand won!

31
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,790
Should I exchange it for you?

32
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,180
Pardon me.

33
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,730
I saw you at the currency exchange center earlier.

34
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,090
You couldn't get 100 thousand won exchanged, right?

35
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,500
That currency exchange center... Dirty money is still money.

36
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
How could he heartlessly deny you, just because the money was slightly torn?

37
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,250
He should've just done it for you.

38
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,300
Hey! Just leave her alone and mind your business!

39
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,550
Should we just go to Chiang Rai and take the reward money?

40
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,580
Reward money?

41
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,690
Wanted criminals for crossing borders are a dime a dozen there.

42
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,840
If we can catch just one, jackpot!

43
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,110
Jackpot, my foot!

44
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,960
A-all right!

45
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,940
We're in the room right next to yours.

46
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,500
You've seen me before, right?

47
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,630
I've seen you around.

48
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,200
 So, is she with you right now?

49
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,870
In her room.

50
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,480
She's bringing the money to exchange.

51
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,920
Sleep by yourself tonight!

52
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,050
 When someone disappears from this world, what would it look like?

53
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,850
 What would the end of someone

54
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:26,750
 who betrayed her real life for fake happiness look like?

55
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,660
Is there anything you want for dinner?

56
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,460
You remember your doctor's appointment, right?

57
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,120
You told Deputy Manager Je to bring a tennis racket to the luncheon meeting, right?

58
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,070
I'll tell Seon Yeong when I meet her.

59
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,870
Did you set an alarm for your schedule?

60
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,650
You know you're leaving work early that day, right?

61
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,610
I'll only have fruits for breakfast from now on.

62
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,480
- Is your stomach still upsetting you?
 - No.

63
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,470
My mouth is busy eating, and my head is working.

64
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,880
But your questions are relentless.

65
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,750
Let's start our mornings quietly!

66
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,520
Simple, fast, and efficient.

67
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,300
Get your makeup and hair done on the day of the luncheon meeting.

68
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,960
So you don't look like an ajumma*.
 (middle-aged woman)

69
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,000
Hello, ma'am!

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,220
 In the cosmetics section...

71
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,710
 products with various ingredients that assist your skin to preserve...

72
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,900
Why are you packing it like that?

73
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,540
This is all money, too.

74
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,070
I have multiple uses for the bags.

75
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,710
Let's go!

76
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,810
I'm jealous.

77
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,990
Your in-laws have emigrated and your husband tells you not to prepare breakfast.

78
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,330
Meanwhile, I live in a cooking hell.

79
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,120
You still prepare meals for both sets of parents every time?

80
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,250
It's the consequence of an only daughter marrying an only son.

81
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,610
You live in heaven, don't you?

82
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes, it's a boring heaven.

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
Life's so comfortable that it's boring?

84
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,570
I'm leaving first. I need to feed my mother-in-law her herbal medicine.

85
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,510
Yes.

86
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,930
Why is everything so expensive?

87
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,360
These good-for-nothings.

88
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,750
Please give me your card.

89
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,180
I gave you my card.

90
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,650
Sorry?

91
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,130
You didn't.

92
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,180
You're accusing an innocent person.

93
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,080
I just gave you my card. I gave it to you!

94
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,060
You didn't give me your card.

95
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,870
You're the one accusing the wrong person.

96
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,320
I want to speak to your superior!

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,740
Ma'am, I'll assist you.

98
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,430
I'm positive I gave this woman my card, but she's-

99
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,300
Are you looking for this?

100
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,120
I think she placed the card on the rail, and the items must've pushed it off.

101
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,840
Oh, I see.

102
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,330
You should've given it to me directly.

103
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,880
This is a senior transportation card.

104
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,180
Transportation card?

105
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,230
But I don't even ride buses.

106
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,340
Here you go.

107
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,310
Please take this one... and this one out.

108
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,760
This, too.

109
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,160
Gosh, this is cutlassfish.

110
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,590
You don't have a card?

111
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,600
Fish get discarded if they're returned.

112
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm sorry. I only brought cash.

113
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,050
Excuse me!

114
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,540
Lend me another 10,000 won!

115
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,460
I called a taxi, but I don't have money.

116
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,950
 Je In's House

117
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,780
 #1 / #2
Daeyunro 9-gil

118
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,900
What will you wear to the luncheon meeting?

119
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,360
Will it be pretty?

120
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,530
 You're at Ga Eul's house?

121
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,850
I haven't thought about it.

122
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,100
Then think about it now!

123
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,620
What color? What style?

124
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,700
Elegant, sexy, or formal?

125
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,680
You choose first. I'll make sure not to overlap with you.

126
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,320
The company won't give out uniforms to wear to get-togethers for families?

127
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,100
With the major company's logo, "A.F." embroidered right on the chest.

128
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,180
You make a fuss about clothes every time.

129
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,600
I saw these in this month's issue of a magazine.

130
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,970
I bought them last year.

131
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,330
Should I wear white?

132
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,860
The dress Ga Eul said makes me look like a nun.

133
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,650
You still have that?

134
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,500
That makes you look too noble!

135
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,010
That's from three years ago!

136
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,900
Who cares? I'm an ajumma.

137
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,020
Right! You're an ajumma.

138
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,930
Make sure to wear that. Look noble!

139
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,080
All right. I'll see you then.

140
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,120
 Yes.

141
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,570
Hey, not a chance!

142
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,800
I haven't even removed the tag.

143
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,210
Wear it now! Lend it to me after wearing it!

144
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,600
Hurry and wear this!

145
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,800
I'll put it on for you, my Ga Eul.

146
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,430
Not a chance.

147
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,180
Goodbye. Hurry and go!

148
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,510
Hey, is there anything you want to eat?

149
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,820
Ga Eul!

150
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,910
- This is nice. 
 - Whoa.

151
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,510
Auntie's over there.

152
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,580
I'm Choi Gi Hyeon.

153
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,190
Hi!

154
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,260
Hi!

155
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,120
There we go.

156
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,140
Oh, the chicken looks good.

157
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,490
Eat shrimp, not the chicken.

158
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,920
Five thousand won per shrimp. Have twelve.

159
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,100
- Eat up! 
 - Who is she?

160
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,570
Who do you think?

161
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,400
She's General Manager Choi Gi Hyeon's wife.

162
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,340
- Right! 
 - That guy who's full of himself?

163
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,720
How is she so tall and slim?

164
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,440
She got something done for sure.

165
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,320
Whether it's Ulthera or Shurink*. 
 (rejuvenation procedures using ultrasound energy)

166
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,220
It's DNA! Genetics for the win.

167
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,690
She never got a single stitch.

168
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,380
We've been best friends since middle school.

169
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,060
Who knows? She could've got something done in grade school.

170
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,370
People get rejuvenating surgery in grade school?

171
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,910
Ms. Yu Yi Hwa?

172
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,760
It's you, right?

173
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,910
Hello.

174
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,070
Ms. Yi Hwa, you were an employee of ours.

175
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,910
Wow, how long has it been?

176
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,950
We haven't met since I changed companies, right?

177
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,750
But when did you change your job?

178
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,120
Which department are you in?

179
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,230
I transferred to headquarters recently.

180
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,460
Anyhow, do you still avoid using cards?

181
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,870
Senior Managing Director!

182
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,130
It's been too long.

183
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,340
This is my wife.

184
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,460
Ms. Yu Yi Hwa is your wife, Team Leader Choi?

185
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,950
A housewife? Why in the world?

186
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,040
You were HR's ace.

187
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,660
You should work. Why let those skills rot?

188
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,730
My wife is a director at SD Savings Bank.

189
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,440
Yu Yi Hwa is an angel, but she's sharp as a knife at her job,

190
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,730
so she was called "Angel Knife."

191
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,970
Is that so?

192
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,200
Our company has a support program for women who took a career break.

193
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,540
Let's grab some tea sometime!

194
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,860
SD Savings Bank, Director Seo Hye Ji

195
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,720
I've heard a lot about you, Director.

196
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,630
I'm Choi Gi Hyeon.

197
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,920
- Thank you! 
 - I had fun.

198
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,110
Senior Managing Director!

199
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,480
I practiced the grip Djokovic uses.

200
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,190
Yi Hwa!

201
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,390
You bought food for your parents?

202
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,380
Je In, let's go.

203
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,480
You never got a card even when you worked at a card company?

204
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,740
What's the real reason you don't use cards?

205
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,280
Breathe, will you?

206
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,010
Why don't you use cards? Why not?

207
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,900
Why not?

208
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,810
I once lost my card but never received a transaction notice, even after two or three days.

209
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,290
I thought I lost it at home, so I didn't report it.

210
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,790
I had forgotten about it, when I suddenly received a transaction notice.

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,140
But after reading it, I really couldn't report it.

212
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,390
Why not? Who used it?

213
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,380
Who was it?

214
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,620
A hospital.

215
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,520
The first transaction notice was for a pediatric hospital.

216
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,750
Then, after some time, it was for fried chicken.

217
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,460
The pediatric hospital, pharmacy, pediatric hospital, then pharmacy again.

218
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,500
Only for things like that.

219
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,500
Then they stopped using it for over a year.

220
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,850
I got scared, so I deactivated the card and didn't use cards after that.

221
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,010
Scared? You're talking nonsense again.

222
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,090
Of what?

223
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,230
"What if I get a transaction notice for an emergency room one day?"

224
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,770
"What if it's for a funeral home?"

225
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,140
"I wonder if the child has been treated."

226
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,780
I found myself having those thoughts.

227
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,550
That's really weird.

228
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,850
- That's so pretty.
- This is expensive.

229
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,590
- Let's go.
- Sure.

230
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,320
Take good care of the classroom!

231
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,520
Let's go! Let's go!

232
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,080
Seon Yeong!

233
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,930
Seon Yeong, put it back!

234
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,530
No.

235
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,920
I'll see you later.

236
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,300
You're warm when you're weird.

237
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,510
Name one person who's as decent as you.

238
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,840
Have you ever crossed the street on a red light?

239
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,730
- No.
- Why not? Because it's illegal?

240
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,570
Why not?

241
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,370
I had no reason to.

242
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,350
- Hey, Honey! 
 - Hello.

243
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,840
What about dinner?

244
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Bring it to the study!

245
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,060
I have a lot to think about.

246
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,550
They call it tennis, but it's all politics.

247
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,750
You should eat something, too.

248
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,690
Something amusing happened at the mart last time.

249
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,930
 I gave it to you!

250
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,120
What's wrong all of a sudden?

251
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,660
Here, use this.

252
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,600
Don't insist on using cash like an old lady.

253
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,550
I'll get my own if I need it.

254
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,860
What use is a card under your name?

255
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,870
It'll be charged to my account anyway.

256
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,260
You told me all that to get me to get you a card.

257
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,390
While I'm in the middle of dinner.

258
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,010
Stop refusing and just take it!

259
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,490
Why are you beating around the bush about wanting to spend money?

260
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:12,560
♫  Sunday that is in the afternoon  ♫

261
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:22,280
♫  There were children playing  ♫

262
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,750
♫  Like a yellow balloon  ♫

263
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,670
 OB/GYN

264
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,300
 Husband

265
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,930
♫  I wanted to run away  ♫

266
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,890
Did you leave yet?

267
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,330
Are you on your way?

268
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,250
 There's an emergency at work today.

269
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,140
 I might not make it home tonight.

270
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,850
Then should I postpone the appointment to tomorrow?

271
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,780
♫  I wanted to fly away  ♫

272
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,100
Oh, yes. Right there.

273
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,250
How is it? Your back is less tense, right?

274
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,900
Yes, it's less tense than before.

275
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,950
I'm contemplating whom I should send to the Japanese branch.

276
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,720
I heard you're proficient in Japanese and English.

277
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,340
Yes, I am, Senior Managing Director.

278
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,800
Freeze my eggs?

279
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,910
Your AMH* levels and egg conditions are good, 
 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone - it reflects the size of the ovarian supply)

280
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:58,810
but freezing is a way to secure healthy eggs while undergoing treatment.

281
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,740
If your husband doesn't attend consultations like this every time,

282
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,330
the ovulated eggs will have to be discarded.

283
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,700
Sorry, I'm late.

284
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,390
This is a gift for Tae Mi.

285
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,040
Here.

286
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,470
Mom!

287
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,220
- Yes?
 - Yes?

288
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,300
Can I accept this?

289
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,790
You can. Your mom is giving it to you.

290
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,600
Make it rare. A glass of champagne for me.

291
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,620
You can put it on this card.

292
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,570
Have I ever come here with you, dear?

293
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,650
Have you and I ever dined here, Tae Mi's mom?

294
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,040
Yes, Seonbae-nim.

295
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,900
Right? No wonder.

296
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,390
Our Tae Mi placed seventh in the entire school.

297
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,850
Don't!

298
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,930
My daughter's incredible!

299
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,800
You take after your stepmom, the older you get.

300
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,550
Thank God you don't take after me.

301
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,840
They say even dogs take after their owners.

302
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,000
That's inappropriate.

303
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,660
Good thing you didn't live with me.

304
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,400
Excuse me for a moment.

305
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,310
- A day drink? 
  - Just one glass.

306
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,420
Seon Yeong is on her way, too.

307
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,410
Shouldn't you two prepare dinner?

308
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,660
Did your husbands go to another tennis meeting?

309
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,600
We're inviting you so the two of us don't just talk about our husbands.

310
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,030
Sorry.

311
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,590
Let's keep men out of the conversation.

312
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,390
 A day drink sounds good.

313
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,110
Instead of meeting there, I'm at the QK Hotel right now. Can you come to the Chinese restaurant here?

314
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,020
I have a meal ticket.

315
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,500
Wait in the room a bit with Seon Yeong! I'll head over as soon as I finish up here.

316
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,150
All right, I got it.

317
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,720
Okay.

318
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,370
Together.

319
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,190
You like it?

320
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,700
 Yes, it's delicious.

321
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,490
Team Leader, your card was suspended.

322
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,820
- Here.
- Thanks.

323
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,450
 Aeternew

324
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,220
- This one is also over its limit. 
 - This one.

325
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,100
I gave you the wrong one.

326
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,760
Here.

327
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,540
- Um...
 - Hold on!

328
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,990
Sure...

329
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,190
Hey, Yi Hwa!

330
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,820
Do you do smart banking?

331
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,500
Humiliation.

332
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,400
Pure humiliation.

333
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,510
What do I do?

334
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,210
Honey?

335
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,660
Let's go straight to the room!

336
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,280
Exercise should be done on an empty stomach.

337
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,530
Fasted cardio is the best.

338
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,600
I reserved a room, though.

339
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,040
Stamina-boosting food? Just how sweaty are you going to make me?

340
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,100
Will I get a taste of heaven today?

341
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,760
Okay!

342
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,520
- Hey! 
 - Hey!

343
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,100
Hey!

344
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,480
Oh, you're here?

345
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,520
Tae Mi's dad?

346
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,200
Ga Eul, where are you going?

347
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,860
Ga Eul!

348
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,880
I'm right.

349
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,400
Judging by your inability to talk, I'm right.

350
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,450
Hey, Seong Si Hun!

351
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,040
I-I...

352
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,060
You moron...

353
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,840
I ought to...

354
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,030
Ga Eul, Ga Eul! Tae Mi's mom!

355
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,640
Let's talk this out!

356
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,680
Your wife?

357
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,330
You said she was young and pretty.

358
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,990
Who is she?

359
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,590
There's no way she's your wife.

360
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,580
Is she another partner?

361
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,300
My ex-wife.

362
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,440
I'm the ex-wife.

363
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,240
I thought it was weird.

364
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,400
Hey! You knew he was married, didn't you? Am I right?

365
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,510
Let go of me and talk, Ex-wife!

366
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,960
Did you think he'd lavish money on two families since he's a doctor?

367
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,540
That piece of trash is totally penniless.

368
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,790
His family of 12 feeds off him.

369
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,860
- I know.
- You know?

370
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,200
Let go of me!

371
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,810
I said, let go!

372
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,240
And if I don't?

373
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,290
Damn it.

374
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,600
- Let go!
- Hey, hey!

375
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,300
You think I'd let go when my daughter's about to get a third mom?

376
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,200
She won't!

377
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,260
Let go!

378
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,650
- Hey! 
 - Yi Hwa!

379
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,620
Hey!

380
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,710
You!

381
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,800
- Hey!
- Ow, my hair!

382
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,300
Hey! Hey!

383
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,000
- You!
- My hair!

384
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,880
Hey!

385
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,230
Is your wife up next?

386
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,850
Is she on her way?

387
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
You little piece of shit—

388
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,890
Ms. Ex-wife.

389
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,490
Let's have a rational conversation.

390
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,450
I also feel like shit for being mistreated

391
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,310
by the ex-wife, who's not even his current wife.

392
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,160
"Rational"?

393
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200
Wow, you really don't give a shit, do you?

394
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,790
What kind of person are you?

395
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,190
He's remarried, penniless,

396
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,680
and has a child. Why would you date him?

397
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,840
- You're—
- He's good at it.

398
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,620
- What? 
 - He's good at it.

399
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,710
Didn't you hear me?

400
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,750
I said he's good at it.

401
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,720
You said you're his child's mother.

402
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,950
You should know.

403
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,490
Money? Marriage?

404
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,430
I don't need any of that.

405
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,560
He just needs to be good at it.

406
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,560
We're just both good at it.

407
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,220
Say something!

408
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,440
At least disagree with her.

409
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,780
He is... good...

410
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,500
He's good at it.

411
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,840
Well, I am the ex-wife.

412
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,540
And he is... good...

413
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,850
- What's wrong with you?
- That's so funny!

414
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,300
Are you all crazy?

415
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,250
Get out!

416
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,400
Are you going to tell Ms. Se Ju?

417
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,680
Are you crazy? Why set fire to someone else's house?

418
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,950
I'm the ex-wife.

419
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,210
I should've been the current wife in that situation.

420
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,010
If he was cheating on me, I could've justifiably killed that bastard!

421
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,030
Is that why you divorced him?

422
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,510
That's not it.

423
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,420
You'll just look the other way?

424
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,380
They said they just meet occasionally to get it on.

425
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,650
- Hey!
 - It doesn't seem like she'll make them divorce.

426
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,410
If they break up, do you think Seong Si Hun wouldn't see another woman?

427
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,530
If they're just banging, they're basically just dirty workout partners.

428
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,160
I expect no less from him. He was like that with me, too.

429
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,960
What do you mean? You were sex partners with Tae Mi's dad?

430
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,800
Just once, after we broke up!

431
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,770
Before he married Ms. Se Ju.

432
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,980
But I feel rather guilty.

433
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,530
I suddenly wondered if I had the right to act like this.

434
00:32:54,530 --> 00:33:00,090
Since I also... did that because he's good at it.

435
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,160
But that was all!

436
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,420
Then why did you divorce him?

437
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,040
I had nothing to do.

438
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,490
They say the reason for divorce is personality differences, which means sexual incompatibility,

439
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,730
but we were nothing except sexually compatible!

440
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,400
After fighting fiercely, I'd loathe him to death.

441
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,700
And when we became ice cold, I'd detest myself.

442
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,760
When we fought like hell, I lived to fight.

443
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,230
But once we even stopped fighting, there was nothing to do.

444
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:36,680
There was nothing we could do together except to get a divorce.

445
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,300
They must've left without paying. They didn't take this.

446
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,000
Those crazy bastards ate buldojang*!
  (A variety of shark fin soup, an expensive Chinese delicacy)

447
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,760
I'll pay. I said I'd pay today.

448
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,510
 SD Savings Bank, Director Seo Hae Ji 
They stuffed their faces, too.

449
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,320
Hey, forget it! Don't pay!

450
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,380
- I—
- Mother and Father in-law's

451
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,990
burial period for the ossuary has expired.

452
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,620
Let's move them to the woodland burials.

453
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,430
They didn't contact me.

454
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,470
Why did they call you and not me, their daught—

455
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,020
They probably called the person who paid for their burial.

456
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,900
I want to apply for a job at the savings bank.

457
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,720
You plan to save up for your parents' move starting now?

458
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,760
I set up a contract with the woodland burials.

459
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,130
I want to work.

460
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,110
Do you need more money for living expenses?

461
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,520
No.

462
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,520
I need a place to go to work every day, like you.

463
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:59,660
If it's not money... do you feel bad about staying home as a housewife?

464
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,860
It's all right.

465
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,860
Housework is difficult, huh?

466
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,360
You are at an age where it's hard on your body, too.

467
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,800
Working at a savings bank isn't just about sitting in a chair.

468
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,430
I also need a place to return to.

469
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,340
Can you tell me so I can understand?

470
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,860
I feel as if I were ... this house's built-in.

471
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,110
I feel I'm just taking up meaningless space.

472
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,460
I asked you to tell me so I can understand.

473
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,740
I want this house to be somewhere I want to return to.

474
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:45,500
I want to long to return to this house every day.

475
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,490
I'll want to leave work once I get to work.

476
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,690
I'll want to quickly return home to rest.

477
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,660
I need something like that, too.

478
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,250
Do you want something refreshing?

479
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,300
Drink this...

480
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:14,310
and talk to me once you've calmly written down your thoughts.

481
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,390
What's this? The blade is missing.

482
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,340
Where did it go?

483
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,170
The razor blade is missing.

484
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,970
There's a disposable razor in the bedroom, right?

485
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,670
Is this it?

486
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,700
Are you being like this because I couldn't make it to the hospital today?

487
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,600
I told you I was swamped with work.

488
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,550
I want to stop going to the hospital.

489
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,920
Wait, you want to stop treatment? Why?

490
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,980
You insisted even when you struggled with the side effects of the fertility drug.

491
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,540
I want to stop.

492
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,340
Well, smart people these days do remain DINK couples.

493
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,850
"Double income, no kids."

494
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,300
You know the saying.

495
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,100
"Kids are the family's biggest moths."

496
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,580
They nibble away until they die.

497
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,770
Do as you'd like.

498
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,770
"Parasites"?

499
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,320
How could someone ...

500
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,120
How could someone say something like that?

501
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,930
"How could someone"?

502
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,370
"How could someone"?

503
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:23,360
She acts all refined... when she does whatever she wants to.

504
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,870
Take another look at the drawers in the study!

505
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,510
My bath water will turn cold.

506
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,160
 Ossuary Tax Invoice

507
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,400
 Money spent on in-laws

508
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,110
 Father in-law's funeral costs
Mother in-law's funeral costs

509
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,400
 In-laws' hospital expenses

510
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,770
 In-laws' birthday gift expenditures

511
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,020
How ridiculous!

512
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,980
The money I spent on you adds up to hundreds of millions.

513
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,980
You don't know your place.

514
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,480
 In-laws' birthday gift expenditures

515
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,360
Fine.

516
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,800
I shouldn't be shameless.

517
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,380
Since I'm so grateful to you.

518
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,820
 After talking to other people at the luncheon meeting,

519
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:55,400
 I noticed women with vast work experience are in control, not housewives.

520
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,500
 SD Savings Bank

521
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,720
 In order to become someone helpful to you,

522
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,320
 I want to try working at the place

523
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,490
 noted on the Senior Managing Director's wife's business card from last time.

524
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,580
 SD Savings Bank

525
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,860
Customer No. 7!

526
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,290
Are you all right?

527
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,130
Are you hurt?

528
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,560
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

529
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,200
Are you all right?

530
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,940
Welcome.

531
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,190
 Senior Staff, Lee Ru Ri

532
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,380
Welcome.

533
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:02,760
I spilled makgeolli* on it. 
  (Alcoholic rice drink)

534
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,420
The pastor made me an account, so I couldn't just disregard it.

535
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,290
 Welcome.

536
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,100
I'll count it. Please give it to me!

537
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,170
Fifteen thousand won?

538
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,030
Yes, that's correct.

539
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,120
Welcome.

540
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,070
Thank you so much!

541
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,220
Welcome.

542
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,070
Welcome.

543
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,050
I have a bad feeling.

544
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,440
Right?

545
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,470
He was really thankful.

546
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,580
Rehiring women with career breaks is the government's economic policy for 2016.

547
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,870
It has to do with the headquarters. What can we say?

548
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:07,310
They say she took a career break. But isn't she just a chair warmer?

549
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,750
She receives the four major insurances without even doing anything.

550
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,110
Be nice!

551
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,510
Welcome.

552
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,700
Welcome.

553
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,320
Sit here!

554
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,530
- Hello.
 - Yes!

555
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,580
Hello.

556
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,240
What's with the coffee?

557
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,580
Isn't that from the lounge?

558
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,900
She bought it out of pocket earlier.

559
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,430
She makes work for us.

560
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,610
She must not know that making her colleagues' lives difficult is a nuisance.

561
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,220
But it all worked out.

562
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,430
You were whining about wanting to avoid VIP customer service.

563
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,910
I hope it changes for good, not just for a week.

564
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,030
I don't know if Ms. Yu Yi Hwa will make it today.

565
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,310
She looks so soft-hearted.

566
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,360
Geez, I even had my farewell party.

567
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,900
I need to come back for a handover, huh?

568
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,610
I guess one week will be enough for you.

569
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:21,540
With VIP customers, you're already halfway successful if you maintain a smile.

570
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,160
 Many of our customers live in this townhouse development.

571
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,580
 They have the money but nowhere to spend it.

572
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,200
 There are many rude customers who make us run errands,

573
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,210
 so Miss Ru Ri and I went through quite a lot.

574
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,790
Ma'am, hello!

575
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,990
I hope you've been well.

576
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,220
Hello.

577
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,610
42,400 won!

578
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,910
Come inside and take your money!

579
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,910
For the tissues and taxi fare.

580
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,450
Oh!

581
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,290
Yes, hello.

582
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,670
 Oh Suk Ja

583
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,910
I rounded up the change since I'm so thankful to you.

584
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,470
I'm paying you interest.

585
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,510
Thank you!

586
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,140
Ma'am, which bank do you use these days?

587
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,640
After that young lady quit, I had no one to grocery shop for me.

588
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,930
Look at the state of this house!

589
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:35,590
There's no one to run errands or call in an emergency.

590
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:40,490
I see. You were quite close to our former employee.

591
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,060
We should go now.

592
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,040
There it goes again!

593
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,770
Aigoo, I'm sick of it.

594
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:49,080
Please stay seated! I'll help you.

595
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,420
Do you go around with that young lady now?

596
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,350
I recently transferred to a different branch.

597
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:04,700
- Only for today, Ms. Yu Yi Hwa-
- Her name is very pretty, too.

598
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,190
She even looks as if she belongs in my house.

599
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,420
You're out of laundry detergent.

600
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,780
Should I buy some on my next visit?

601
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,110
You secured a client for a certificate of deposit

602
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,340
of 200 million won as soon as you start customer outreach?

603
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,600
You said you used to work at a card company. Your sales skills must still be up to par.

604
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,590
Good work!

605
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:32,370
Ms. Yi Hwa, you can just take over the VIP customer service.

606
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,560
The townhouse community's worst customer entrusts 200 million to her?

607
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,920
Assistant Manager Jang, complete your handover.

608
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,550
 Oh Suk Ja, Park Byeong Sik 
 Is it an elderly male client?

609
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,420
A middle-aged bachelor? A divorcé?

610
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,520
A wild goose dad?
 (A man supporting his wife and kids who live in a Western country)

611
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,230
Miss Jin Young Seo, what's the meaning of this?

612
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,130
Watch what you say!

613
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,980
That mouth will get you in trouble.

614
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,500
You're here.

615
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,550
Dong Hun! Dong Hun, put the knife down! Put the knife—

616
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,650
Dong Hun, what's wrong?

617
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,790
Stab him to death after you eat chicken!

618
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,630
Im Ga Deun, are you crazy?

619
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,330
Wait, why are you the sound director?

620
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,050
I thought this was your graduation project.

621
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,180
It is...

622
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,110
But who are you to yell "cut"?

623
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,770
The director is Yun Min Jae.

624
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,600
Yun Min Jae?

625
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,500
What the ...? You got discharged from the military?

626
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,120
The military doesn't want you, either? Why are you the director?

627
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,570
And why are you drenched in blood?

628
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,940
The actor who agreed to get beaten up

629
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,580
went into shock after one cut and went home.

630
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,050
Hey, are you hurt anywhere?

631
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,390
I can't breathe.

632
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,890
What? Are you really hurt?

633
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,430
- Are you all right?
 - Director!

634
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,070
- What's this?
- Director, are you all right?

635
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,530
- Director, are you all right?
- Are you all right?

636
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,290
Dang it! You scared the heck out of me!

637
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,050
What the heck?

638
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,440
You scared me.

639
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,430
Can you give me the marinated one?

640
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:27,770
You can have everything.

641
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,670
He's all for show.

642
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,540
What is that unproductive behavior?

643
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:34,730
Let's eat!

644
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:36,770
I heard you got a job at a foreign company.

645
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,110
It seems you're good.

646
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,500
Yeah, I'm good.

647
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,440
Right? You're good, right?

648
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,410
Min Jae, let's just choose her.

649
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,850
Let's film Ga Deun!

650
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,910
What? Film what?

651
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:51,300
No, Ga Deun isn't the one.

652
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,220
What's the image in your head?

653
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:59,780
Someone like a white dress pulled out of clear water?

654
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,120
Hey, rookie, where's the windshield?

655
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,310
Just a second!

656
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,370
 - Don't get closer!
- Is he all right?

657
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,910
 - Watch out!
- His feet! His feet!

658
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,580
 - Hey, lift it! 
 - Oh, no!

659
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,210
Hey, are you all right?

660
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,970
- Is he all right?
 - Get it together!

661
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:31,220
- What should we do?
 - Call 911!

662
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,160
- Hurry and call 911! You all right?
 - Are you all right?

663
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,400
 - He lives alone with his grandma. 
 - We'll go in first.

664
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,680
 She'll be shocked to find out what happened to him.

665
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,220
She's over 80 years old. I'll do it.

666
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,460
I'll take care of this.

667
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,560
What's wrong with you?

668
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,470
Is the card loan the issue?

669
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,610
He can't use his hand without surgery right away.

670
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:52,970
Why should you?

671
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,650
I can just take out my rent deposit.

672
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,940
I'll pay it even if I go into debt. I'm the director.

673
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,970
Director?

674
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,530
Hey, there's a time and place to be pretentious.

675
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,330
They said "right away."

676
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,060
Surgery is possible only after payment.

677
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,810
- Ga Deun! 
 - Min Jae!

678
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,090
What happened to Wu Hyeok?

679
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:48,590
If you apply for the 36 months for this special product...

680
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,450
Three!

681
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,220
It's 2.6%.

682
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:57,320
Don't bother talking if it's under 2.7%.

683
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,560
Open the window!

684
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,610
Deposit this into my previous account.

685
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,530
 SD Savings Bank, Park Byeong Sik

686
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:37,350
I forgot about it.

687
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:39,800
I need it for something.

688
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,540
 Park Byeong Sik

689
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,660
I didn't eat anything yet!

690
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,380
How did ten abalones become nine? Huh?

691
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,110
What happened?

692
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:06,010
Y-You—

693
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,090
Gosh, I just tried it!

694
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:12,340
- Please calm down.
 - Do I look like I can calm down?

695
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,010
- I just tried one!
 - Why would you try it?

696
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,310
- Huh?
 - Oh, gosh! Seriously!

697
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,060
That little...

698
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,940
This is so unfair! I'm furious!

699
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,430
You still have to pay me for my work before I go!

700
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:28,690
I don't have money to give you!

701
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,080
You stuffed your face!

702
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,980
What? Enjoying the show?

703
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,770
What are you looking at?

704
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,310
You!

705
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,220
Come here!

706
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,330
Come back here! Come here!

707
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,200
- Enough.
- Don't touch me, punk!

708
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,980
- I said "enough".
- You scum.

709
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,560
Go! Leave, you bastard!

710
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,560
- That's enough—
 - Leave, you bastard!

711
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,310
- That's enough.
- Leave, you bastard!

712
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:22,540
Go!

713
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,020
I said leave.

714
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,250
Five million won? You're asking for money?

715
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:35,350
Hey, who would give money to a bastard groveling for a mere 5 million?

716
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,900
Please help me, Grandfather!

717
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,940
I absolutely need it by tonight.

718
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,730
When begging, use your head!

719
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:47,380
Your head!

720
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,800
If you need 5 million, you should've asked for 50 million!

721
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,090
If you don't even have 5 million won,

722
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:57,100
that means you don't even have collateral except your body!

723
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,830
What is it you want?

724
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,540
I'll...

725
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,280
I'll do anything you ask.

726
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:17,390
Clean it up!

727
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,750
Oh-ho?

728
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,290
Your eyes.

729
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,540
Your eyes!

730
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:32,290
You said you'd do anything.

731
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:38,920
What would you like to do about our special product?

732
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,500
A viper who slithered out after killing its mother doesn't even have 5 million won?

733
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,700
What scum.

734
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,910
That...

735
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,510
That good-for-nothing bastard!

736
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,270
 Anyone home?

737
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:15,130
 We're from the Gyeonggi-do Government Office.

738
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:20,080
 Mr. Park Byeong Sik! Are you there, Mr. Park?

739
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:25,770
 Mr. Park! We're from the Gyeonggido Tax Collecting Agency!

740
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,310
 - Mr. Park! 
 - Come here!

741
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:31,570
 We know you're home! Open the door!

742
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,640
 We'd like to ask you a few questions about your arrears of local taxes.

743
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,220
Take this with you...

744
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,220
- and bring it back.
 - Please open the door! If you don't...

745
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,650
 according to article 35 of the Local Tax Collection Act,

746
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,920
 we can force entry and search your house!

747
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,170
Will 300 million do?

748
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,380
For the savings product you came to sell me!

749
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,740
 Open the door, Mr. Park!

750
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,680
I'll open one! Here.

751
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,820
 Mr. Park, open the door!

752
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,010
Take this!

753
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,570
 Park Byeong Sik!

754
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,400
 500 million.

755
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,990
 800 million.

756
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,960
 420 million.

757
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,100
 There's not a single withdrawal.

758
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,420
 A borrowed-name account?

759
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:38,290
Thanks!

760
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,530
Thanks to you, they treated him in time.

761
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,200
If you took out your deposit of 4 million, does that mean you're broke now?

762
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,050
How did you know I took out my deposit?

763
00:56:51,110 --> 00:57:00,200
♫  Stranger than heaven  ♫

764
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:05,000
Cut!
♫  The black and white world  ♫

765
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:12,020
♫  A situation where there's nowhere to hide  ♫
How about jumping off that roof?

766
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,250
Action!

767
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,220
Where's the chicken I ordered?

768
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,050
♫  A situation where there's nowhere to hide  ♫
What, what?

769
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:28,010
♫  The meaningless glances  ♫
- What, what?
- I'm sorry.

770
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:35,810
I have a year left until graduation, so I'd like to return to school.

771
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:40,120
You have overdue student loans and credit card debt,

772
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,770
so you're not eligible for a loan review.

773
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:46,580
I'm sorry I'm unable to assist you.

774
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,970
 SD Savings Bank 
Welcome Customer!

775
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,850
Take an umbrella, sir!

776
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,820
 What's fine about this situation?

777
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,220
 So you can't return to school this time?

778
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,620
 Then ask your grandfather—

779
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,080
 You have to graduate.

780
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,040
 And the accident on top of that...

781
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,560
 At any rate, you're so unlucky.

782
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,180
Nothing new.

783
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,700

784
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,800
- Hyeong! I'm going out for a job interview.
- All right.

785
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,610
Are you going dressed like that?

786
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,340
That's a bit better.

787
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,650
Good luck with your interview.

788
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,960
Thank you, Seonbae-nim!

789
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,120
You gave me a free room and your clothes, too.

790
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,750
 Wear it carefully.

791
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,940
 I bought it for my in-law gathering.

792
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,700
 Hyeong, I'll definitely buy you a nice suit in the future.

793
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,720
Please read it over and sign it.

794
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:45,130
 Oh Suk Ja

795
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,460
- It's payday.
- Yes.

796
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,970
If the VIP consultation gets too long, don't come back

797
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:56,160
and eat something delicious with your husband!

798
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,300
Then with me next time.

799
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,700
Thank you, Assistant Manager Na.
  Oh Suk Ja

800
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,920
 Guil Department Store

801
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:14,970
It's nice.

802
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,250
 Résumé

803
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,930
Please come in and take your time looking.

804
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,980
It suits you.

805
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,430
But you do have some dead skin.

806
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,050
We have this scrub for dead skin.

807
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:01,690
It's really luxurious.

808
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,190
If you look at it...

809
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:07,220
It adds up to 367,000 won,

810
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:10,810
but there's a 5% discount if you have a store card.

811
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,820
How much will it be if I take out the sunblock?

812
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:23,320
Without the sunblock, it'll be 307,000 won.

813
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,840
If I buy the full set from the Prestige line,

814
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,770
how much can you discount from 1.8 million?

815
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:29,960
Just a second.

816
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,050
Ma'am, think about what you want.

817
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,490
The prices are written on the box.

818
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,760
Yes!

819
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,380
I heard there's a new ampoule that came out.

820
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,170
A new ampoule...

821
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,350
If you take a look...

822
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:46,120
this is the new product.

823
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,790
 Oh Suk Ja

824
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,910
Excuse me!

825
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:12,110
Just give me everything!

826
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:14,650
Oh, my. All right!

827
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:16,020
Just a moment.

828
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,000
Good choice.

829
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,600
This product is...

830
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,670
 It was 100,000 won?

831
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:30,890
 The money needed to redirect your focus toward me?

832
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,800
 Welcome. If you want to...

833
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,910
 Yu Yi Hwa

834
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:07,280
 Oh Suk Ja

835
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,750
 Thank you for using our bank.

836
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:20,370
 Please be sure to take all your belongings.

837
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:38,300
 Lunch won't work.

838
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,520
 I can't go home today.

839
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,200
Are you all right?

840
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,310
Wait...

841
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,010
I'll pay for it.

842
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:59,730
Oh, it's all right.

843
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:27,890
 Résumé

844
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:39,930
 Seon Yeong, how much does a suit cost nowadays?

845
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,960
Ms. Yu Yi Hwa, you've got a call.

846
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,140
Yes, this is Yu Yi Hwa.

847
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:50,910
 You're taking good care of it, right?

848
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,770
 How much is it?

849
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:59,180
If you're inquiring about the amount, should I open it now and check?

850
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,610
You haven't opened it?

851
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,810
Bring it over.

852
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,920
I heard women like these things.

853
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,620
It's a roll cake.

854
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,590
- Then ...
- As for the special sale ...

855
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:41,600
I promised you.

856
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,880
Three hundred million won.

857
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:48,230
The branch is closed for today.

858
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:50,990
I'll visit you another day.

859
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:54,540
Hold onto this for a few more days.

860
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:58,660
They might come back since they didn't find anything.

861
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,110
Let's do our best!

862
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:29,320
 Résumé

863
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:33,730
I'm sorry for damaging your clothes.

864
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,700
It's a gift certificate for men's clothes.

865
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:54,910
Is it all right for you to drink when you hurt your neck?

866
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,430
The wound looks big. Did you go to the hospital?

867
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,820
No, I'm fine.

868
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:04,530
My insurance payments are overdue, anyway.

869
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,480
Would you like cake?

870
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,340
Your grandfather gave it to me.

871
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,680
Give me a second.

872
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,520
 Lee Hyeon Jae

873
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,380
 Please insert your card.

874
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,000
 Withdrawal

875
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,280
 Caution: Voice phishing

876
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:51,840
 I'm just changing the location of the money.

877
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,270
 From the disgusting old man who doesn't even know how much he has

878
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:00,040
 to his desperate grandson who needs it more.

879
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:16,970

880
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:25,830
 Pale Moon 
 Preview

881
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,320
 This is a borrowed-name account.

882
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,710
 You're aware now, so we're accomplices.

883
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:32,760
 Even if it's fake, kindness makes you happy.

884
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:37,350
 The older you are, the better things you should wear, to be treated with respect.

885
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,800
 What's your relationship?

886
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,430
 Did you think you wouldn't get caught?

887
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:43,820
 They didn't come yesterday, either.

888
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,390
 Who do you keep leaving an open seat for?

889
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,360
 What's your reason for treating me like this?

890
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,710
 You're the person I've been looking for.
