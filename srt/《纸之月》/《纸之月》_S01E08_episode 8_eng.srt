 The characters, places, agencies,  incidents, organizations, and occupations in this drama have no connection to real life.

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,930
Oh, Hyeong, don't touch that! Sit down.

9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,150
Sit down.

10
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,200
 This isn't my first time.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,470
 After the owner of the subsidiary company, it's the city councilman.

12
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,500
 Come to this address this evening!

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,560
 Otherwise, I'll send this photo to people at work and your husband.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,380
 You went into the hotel holding hands.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,900
 Mutilated currency?

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,800
 Look!

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,560
 Not bad, right?

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,340
 Lee Ru Ri?

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,100
 She won't break.

20
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,280
 Episode 8 
 Who do you mean? Ms. Yi Hwa?

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,750
What does she have that she refuses to back down?

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,690
I've been living for breaking and destroying people to this day.

23
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,870
Could she have a man?

24
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,970
What? Are you drunk?

25
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,650
Gosh, let's go!

26
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,630
Let's just go! Let's go!

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,020
- I mean—
- Let's go, let's go.

28
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,300
Maybe she has a man. You know how she's been glowing these days.

29
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,500
A man?

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,510
Geez, come on.

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,130
But she lives with a man like me.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,520
Let go, let go, let go.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,850
Have a seat! Yes.

34
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,290
Not many husbands are away from their wives for so long like you.

35
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,520
I ended up divorcing Ga Eul because we were apart from each other.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,880
Both of you are so busy all the time.

37
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,530
You see each other maybe an hour per day, the rest is sleeping time.

38
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,190
It's hard even for people who live in the same house. But you're...

39
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,280
How many months a year are you at home?

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,100
- Come on. 
 - How dare you compare us? You think I'm the same as you?

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,710
 - That's enough! 
 - Fine! You're different from me, bastard!

42
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,370
 Gosh, seriously.

43
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,530
 You're nothing but a player!

44
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,190
 Let's just go, I said. Let's just go.

45
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,680
Is she serious right now?

46
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,430
No, not yet!

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,830
 Stab me! Stab me, I said. Please!

48
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,910
What are you doing here?

49
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,230
Come out! Let's go!

50
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,100
I... can never let go of your hand.

51
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,200
I'm here to turn myself in.

52
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,300
I think I killed someone.

53
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,100
- Right? 
 -  The ER said there's nothing they can do to an alcoholic.

54
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,360
 They're recommending a lockdown ward for him.

55
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,590
All right. Got it.

56
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,420
Is he not dead?

57
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,600
You said you hit him with a baseball bat on his back, right?

58
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,950
He doesn't even have a bruise, apparently.

59
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,500
Are you his girlfriend?

60
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,110
Report to 911 from now on for something like this, all right?

61
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,700
Do you know how to reach his family?

62
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,060
They recommend hospitalization because he's an alcoholic.

63
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,160
I don't know.

64
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,640
There's a bank account he tells me to send money to sometimes.

65
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,620
- I think that's his family's account. 
 - You send them money?

66
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,020
Are you in common-law marriage?

67
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,980
He can't make bank transactions because he filed for bankruptcy.

68
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
I did it out of pity at first.

69
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,180
Has he taken money from you, threatened you with sexual assault,

70
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,160
or assaulted you before?

71
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,550
He got arrested at illegal gambling venues many times.

72
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,700
Aren't you interested in reporting him?

73
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,850
Is it because you're afraid?

74
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,000
He was fined multiple times. He had many misdemeanors, too.

75
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,810
Did he go to Samguk University?

76
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,200
- What happened? 
 - They commit all kinds of crimes, just like how they study all sorts of majors.

77
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,920
He was a promising young man, but now he'll become a promising prisoner.

78
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,830
Gosh, I feel bad for that woman.

79
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,450
How did she end up with a bastard like him?

80
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,030
What are you thinking about?

81
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,680
- She's charismatic. 
 - Right?

82
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,610
No, the woman who was next to her.

83
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,640
 Janghyeon Police Station

84
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,470
 Tax credit for donations

85
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,570
Yes, this is why she refused to come along.

86
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,990
What is she, Mother Teresa or something?

87
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,400
Where's that money?

88
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,360
You gave it to that one, didn't you?

89
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,800
That one?

90
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,320
Me?

91
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,140
I know you pretended to be Mother Teresa with my money!

92
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,500
You feel guilty about taking more from home,

93
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,590
so you want to make money to give her?

94
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,130
How much have you been giving away, anyway?

95
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you even have receipts?

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,160
You need receipts to get at least tax credits!

97
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,790
It's not like you're stupid. But why do you always suffer loss?

98
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,090
Haven't you learned anything from me?

99
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,480
She's my co-worker. She said she was having issues—

100
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,420
Do you know what kind of work I'll be doing in the future?

101
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,160
How dare you make me stand in front of the police station!

102
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,140
How much ... I mean ...

103
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,100
How much did you give her?

104
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,090
How much?

105
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,230
I borrowed 50 million.

106
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,700
I borrowed it to pay the security deposit.

107
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,740
But I'll move out and pay her back immediately.

108
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,100
50...

109
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,410
See you at work, Eonni.

110
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,700
 Savings Bank

111
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,670
Hello.

112
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,400
Thank you.

113
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,500
Thanks to you, he was sent to a psychiatric ward.

114
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,830
I'll delete this.

115
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,760
It's all right if you don't.

116
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,180
He's my husband.

117
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,780
Is he really your husband?

118
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,880
Yes, he is.

119
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,010
You're lying. Why would you go to a hotel with your husband?

120
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,570
We tend to eat out often.

121
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,790
Then, why did you come to my place if you weren't even having an affair?

122
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,070
You sounded desperate.

123
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,620
"Help me!"

124
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,780
That's how you sounded to me.

125
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,630
Let's have lunch together today!

126
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,420
I'll pick what we'll eat.

127
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,100
Next customer.

128
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,790
 Welcome.

129
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,760
You didn't see these pouches?

130
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,550
No, I didn't see the pouches that day.

131
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,070
We have too many mutilated currencies because homeless people come here.

132
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,230
I was only managing the bills with oil on them that day.

133
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,950
So you only handed in the mutilated currency in the box?

134
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,750
How about a copy of the vault cash ledger?

135
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,960
- You must've made a copy of this and handed it in.
 - Yes.

136
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,640
The vault cash amount must be off, then.

137
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,890
Is managing mutilated currency a joke to you now that you've worked here for a bit?

138
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,730
Of course not. It's still money.

139
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,060
Oh, they might break if you aren't careful.

140
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,460
It's better not to count it.

141
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,690
Break? Why? Is it burnt?

142
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,070
They were kept under the flooring. So they're worn out.

143
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,790
The bugs were crawling on them, too.

144
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,890
Since our branch works with the homeless support center,

145
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,290
we have all sorts of mutilated currency.

146
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,180
If it isn't one thing, it's the other.

147
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,640
Gosh, just forget it.

148
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,330
If you can't count the amount, just send them like this.

149
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,870
All right. I'll cross-check there.

150
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,790
 SD Savings Bank

151
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,410
It's nice inside.

152
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,130
You said you're from the Jeongwon Branch, right?

153
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,020
Hand me the ledger!

154
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,360
Excuse me! Can't you hear me?

155
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,350
- Pardon? 
 - Hand me the ledger!

156
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,600
The mutilated currency ledger.

157
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,530
All right. The director is waiting for us. Let's go in!

158
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,930
You should eat with him alone.

159
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,880
Let's go in!

160
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,160
 Welcome.

161
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,000
 Customer 9, please come to the window 3.

162
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,090
Hello.

163
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:59,200
- I'll take out just one million won from here.
 - Welcome.

164
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,400
- You're taking out one million won, correct?
- Yes, that's correct.

165
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,030
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

166
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,230
You get 50% off the lunch menu if you bring your company ID.

167
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,370
But I'm sure someone like you doesn't care about that.

168
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,590
If you give me 100 million, I'll give you 50 million.

169
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,450
If you give me 100 million,

170
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,840
I'll give 50 million back to your husband.

171
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,390
In just one day?

172
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,840
It's easy to make 50 million, right?

173
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,380
Where did you spend it on behind your husband's back?

174
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,540
You make money, too.

175
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,780
I invested in something very valuable.

176
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,400
I see...

177
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,540
You invested it as a gift to someone.

178
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,340
That usually ruins your life.

179
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,280
I invested in something that's like a gift to me.

180
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,410
You're the best, Ms. Yu.

181
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,440
 No.

182
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,400
Well...

183
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,680
Drink this!

184
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,230
- Thank you! 
 - And this.

185
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,140
It's not much.

186
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,360
I'm sorry.

187
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,590
You're embarrassing me.

188
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,510
 It's dangerous.

189
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:36,110
It's my dream to celebrate my 70th birthday with friends on a yacht.

190
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,350
I'm thinking of setting some money aside without letting my family know.

191
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,630
Do you recommend anything?

192
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,590
I'm a member of a noblesse group in Gangnam, and it was my turn this time.

193
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,220
My husband doesn't know about this money.

194
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,040
I don't mind waiting three or more than five years.

195
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,000
Is there some kind of special management account?

196
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,010
Let me know if there's one with a good interest rate.

197
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,000
How dare you talk to your employer's asset manager?

198
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,760
Isn't this yacht nice?

199
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,840
 200 million.

200
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,010
 Premium model: 600 million won

201
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,910
 600 million?

202
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,000
How much are you thinking of depositing?

203
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's called a noblesse group, but everyone except me is a stay-at-home mom.

204
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,210
So it won't be much.

205
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,330
I'll just go with the 10-year plan.

206
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,080
Everyone knows about your connection with the Samguk University's director.

207
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,030
You have a reputation. I should trust you, too.

208
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,740
Sure.

209
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,570
Put in your phone number here.

210
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,670
Please call the branch!

211
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,440
I'm not allowed to share personal phone numbers.

212
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,360
Gosh, how heartless!

213
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,540
You should stop by and have lunches here.

214
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,460
Our maid is a good cook.

215
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,670
Our branch is kind of strict.

216
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,600
There are mischievous customers sometimes.

217
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,920
It's just between us.

218
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,900
Actually, a special exclusive account is being released just for VIPs today.

219
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,130
Would you call the branch before we close today?

220
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,330
Exclusive account?

221
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,460
You mean it has a higher interest rate?

222
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,910
It's an event at the HQ. If you don't sign up in time, you might not get the chance.

223
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,510
I didn't know there was such a thing.

224
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,400
I shouldn't tell anyone you told me in advance, right?

225
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,560
Did you receive it in cash?

226
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,520
200 million?

227
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,210
You're so accurate, Assistant Manager. Na.

228
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,370
You can tell by just looking.

229
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,620
- Is it a fixed deposit? 
 - Yes.

230
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,220
 200 million won

231
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,330
 SD Savings Bank

232
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,190
 Husband

233
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,670
 Husband

234
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,970
 The bank must be closing. Why aren't you sending the money?

235
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,270
I said "immediately," didn't I?

236
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,400
Did you even ask for it back?

237
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,120
 Do you not even get nervous anymore?

238
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,650
- If you can't ask for it back, just transfer to the EC Center and raise sales— 
 - I'll send it today.

239
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,260
 Today—

240
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,900
Yes, this is SD Savings Bank, Jeongwon Branch.

241
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,800
Gosh, Professor Min, have you been well?

242
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,160
 Ms. Yu Yi Hwa is there, right?

243
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,630
Well, yes.

244
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,330
Ms. Yi Hwa!

245
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,430
Yes?

246
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,130
 Ms. Yi Hwa, I can sign up for the exclusive account you mentioned now, right?

247
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,050
The thing is...

248
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,210
It would be difficult.

249
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,630
 Gosh, I missed my chance. What a shame.

250
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,220
 Just bring me the time-deposit bankbook, then.

251
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,700
Yes, all right.

252
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,400
No, I'll bring it to you now.

253
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,710
She wants to cancel the account she just opened.

254
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,230
They usually ask for that if they're calling right before closing.

255
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,410
They back out immediately if they can get a higher interest rate somewhere else.

256
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,900
Did she want you to bring cash at this hour?

257
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,710
Yes.

258
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,860
 Close account

259
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,390
It's been closed.

260
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,380
Where's the closed account bankbook?

261
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,300
Ms. Yi Hwa shredded it just now.

262
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,450
 SD Trust Timed-Deposit Bankbook

263
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm sorry we're doing this outside.

264
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,310
My husband mustn't know about this.

265
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,570
He's eating right now.

266
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,030
But I'm kind of disappointed I missed the chance.

267
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:37,060
I'll let you know first if there's another product like that next time.

268
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,950
Oh, wait...

269
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,650
 Oh Suk Ja

270
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,390
Are you here to see my mom?

271
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,830
You have a good appetite, Mom.

272
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,890
By "mom," you mean...

273
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,840
Eat!

274
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,990
I'm acting like her daughter instead of paying rent.

275
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,510
She's not my mom.

276
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,490
I don't have a mom.

277
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,040
W-What's this?

278
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,190
It's a special VIP treatment, ma'am.

279
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,540
You requested it.

280
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,880
What time is it right now, miss?

281
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,400
Finish your meal!

282
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,920
How much will you give me as a tip today?

283
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,660
Are you my client Ms. Oh Suk Ja or my mom now?

284
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,800
How about cleaning?

285
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,930
You're supposed to clean and do the laundry instead of paying rent.

286
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,110
When will you bring the security deposit?

287
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,880
You've been working for years. You don't even have a few million? Aigoo...

288
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,150
I cleaned. But I'm changing your diapers instead of paying the security deposit.

289
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,340
She was trained by the person who worked before you

290
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,820
and she came to see me at the hospital.

291
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,020
To borrow money from me.

292
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,010
So I told her to work for me instead.

293
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,880
If you came here because you're after my money, you'd better give up.

294
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,050
I don't trust women who make money with their bodies.

295
00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:00,450
It's nice to live like me after working hard to make a lot of money.

296
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,720
We're a global cosmetics company.

297
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,630
Would the streaming marketing be effective?

298
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,530
That'd be the trend from now on.

299
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,780
The quality of home multimedia has improved a lot

300
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,690
and it'd be very effective, especially in Korea, because we're a tech-forward country.

301
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,710
Here's the reference you requested.

302
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,430
Thank you.

303
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,590
How about a commercial TV drama?

304
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,350
You mean a TV drama with explicit commercials?

305
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,540
How about a minute-long web series on social media?

306
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,050
That can promote the product itself,

307
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:54,580
but it's too short to show the brand's personality or spirit.

308
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,890
Instead of promoting it explicitly,

309
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,080
how about we create a story instead?

310
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,840
This is kind of suspicious.

311
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,330
Does Yun Min Jae need money?

312
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:14,380
I guess independent films don't make money.

313
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,170
Im Ga Deun.

314
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,400
Do you like Yun Min Jae?

315
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,040
I just feel sorry for him.

316
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,870
You could say it's out of friendship.

317
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,040
Or as a fan, perhaps?

318
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,680
A fan?

319
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,310
I want him to do the things he wants to do quickly

320
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,350
and go back to where he belongs as soon as possible.

321
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,180
He seems dangerous these days.

322
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,690
Sounds like you want him to fail.

323
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,820
Are you really his friend?

324
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,970
To be honest, being a director doesn't suit him.

325
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,720
If it doesn't, what suits him, then?

326
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,340
Being a writer. He's a better writer.

327
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,080
I think he could get a perfect score as a novelist

328
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,760
but only get a B- as a director.

329
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,780
Director Yun Min Jae is like a master in Bongsan mask dance

330
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,310
doing ballet in someone else's shoes.

331
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,970
You definitely like Min Jae.

332
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,400
Are you doing this because he won't fall for you?

333
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,870
I wonder if he met a rich married woman or something lately.

334
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:33,820
He's acting like... floating above the ground these days.

335
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,150
A married woman?

336
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,320
Yun Min Jae is saying that?

337
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,800
That he's seeing a married woman?

338
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,790
You said you're trying to make your major useful.

339
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,770
I guess married men weren't your type.

340
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,740
Why Assistant Manager Geum?

341
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:33,760
Can't you check the HQ employees' personal records, as a team leader?

342
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,410
Pardon?

343
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,270
In Korea, if you sit at a coffee shop with a cup of Americano,

344
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,570
you always hear gossip.

345
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,980
I find that so fun.

346
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,510
Do they not gossip in America?

347
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,560
They do.

348
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,030
But it takes some time for me to understand.

349
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,380
I'm not a native speaker, you know.

350
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,620
You fear things getting messy the most, don't you?

351
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,030
You need to get a bit messy to have fun.

352
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:20,540
If you're too fearful, you die before experiencing everything.

353
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,720
What are you trying to say, Department Head So?

354
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,140
I just wondered if you didn't check your team members' personal records as a team leader.

355
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,010
I guess you don't know.

356
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,670
 Aureole

357
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,820
Ms. Kang Seon Yeong?

358
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,460
Ga Eul never goes to the office lounge area.

359
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,350
She's not interested in eating what others eat.

360
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,160
She used to pack new snacks all the time.

361
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,150
She never went to the school cafeteria, either.

362
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,230
So there's no way we'd run into her here.

363
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,830
Why don't you want to run into her?

364
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,510
Oh, right.

365
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,580
Because she'd get angry if she saw her ex-husband's mistress and her best friend together?

366
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,330
You're easy to talk to.

367
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:35,360
Gosh, why did it have to be Tae Mi's dad?

368
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,260
Should I sign contracts with these people, then?

369
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,760
First of all, let your face be known through houseware companies' social media pages

370
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,670
and subtly show our new products while promoting other companies.

371
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,530
As if it were a coincidence.

372
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,240
And take care of your skin, too.

373
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,760
I already spoke to Dr. Seong Si Hun.

374
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,040
Get any treatment you need.

375
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,750
Am I going alone?

376
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,820
Haven't you been to a business meeting?

377
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,330
You think all I do is cook at home?

378
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,560
I asked because I thought you might want to come along.

379
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,530
It's nice to have a lamp like this for photoshoots.

380
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,720
I see.

381
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,130
The most effective ones are aqua peel and skin botox.

382
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:37,310
Laser treatment and booster shots take a few days to recover.

383
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,140
By the way, your skin looks a bit rough.

384
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,150
What's wrong? Your husband is a dermatologist.

385
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,860
Are you pregnant, by chance?

386
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,450
No.

387
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:57,140
You said Mr. Si Hun works hard every night. No?

388
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,110
I'm not going to have a baby.

389
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,700
Why not?

390
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,500
What if I like the baby more than Tae Mi?

391
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,540
I can't love the baby more than Tae Mi.

392
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:18,770
I won't be able to forgive myself if I end up hurting her.

393
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,710
I like to cook.

394
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,590
I'll start a kimchi stew restaurant in Thailand someday.

395
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,330
Aren't you leaving? Don't you have to cook for your husband?

396
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,120
Have you been living here?

397
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,170
I asked when I was at the hospital, and her dementia progressed quite a bit.

398
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,680
Didn't you know?

399
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,440
I found out because of the recent accident.

400
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,710
You manage Ms. Oh's assets, right?

401
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,390
I was thinking of stealing something, but she had nothing.

402
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:39,590
The bankbook would be useless unless I knew the password and had the debit card.

403
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,000
Did you steal it?

404
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,880
Why Thailand?

405
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,780
It's like destiny.

406
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,580
It was the only place I took a trip to with that bastard.

407
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,440
I thought I'd change my life by seducing a Samguk University student who came for a student loan.

408
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,310
I used to try all sorts of things, then.

409
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,470
I ran into a friend from the orphanage there.

410
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,690
She runs a Korean restaurant in Thailand.

411
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,440
She made a lot of money. She has a servant at home, too.

412
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,310
She said she'd let me open the second location if I got a chef's license.

413
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,490
I'll ask you a favor, since she's a good eater.

414
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,440
She likes pollock roe stew.

415
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,370
Is this everything?

416
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,160
You owe me 50 million.

417
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,870
Including the 50 million you owe your husband.

418
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,280
In total, it's 100 million.

419
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,800
Right. What was I thinking?

420
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,460
No one just carries 100 million around.

421
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,520
I'll give you some time.

422
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,000
Hurry up.

423
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,360
I might tell your husband you spent that money elsewhere.

424
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,960
It's 50 million, isn't it?

425
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,970
The money you need to start a restaurant in Thailand.

426
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,640
So, your wife can't switch jobs?

427
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,610
She will switch after the next quarter ends.

428
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,830
I heard the EC Center only deals with the same customers.

429
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,280
They don't get new customers, either.

430
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,810
Even if they get new customers, they're usually acquaintances of the core customers.

431
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:21,300
So, I guess it takes time to transfer the current VIPs.

432
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,530
How about Singapore after Japan?

433
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,710
And I'd like you to try to take my position, too.

434
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,760
I want to go rest.

435
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,720
Hold on. Hold on.

436
00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:00,400
You're really making it clear you won't listen to me.

437
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,160
You don't seem to know what kind of power you get as the chair of Elysium.

438
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,730
As long as the personal seal on the company bankbook and statement matches, and with the PIN,

439
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:19,900
you can send the corporate funds anywhere in the world in that room.

440
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,030
That's what true business is.

441
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:30,280
Is the vice president's wife doing money laundering through

442
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,000
Cheongmyeong Gallery's welfare foundation?

443
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:40,300
They need a trusty private banker to evade taxes, too, right?

444
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,910
The vice president must know, too.

445
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,070
In order to be appointed as the chairman in a few years,

446
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,340
he must have a paper company, too.

447
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,850
What in the world... are you?

448
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:15,000
 Someone who's been giving you countless opportunities and possibilities.

449
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,590
 Hurry up, Mi Ri!

450
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,740
 Hey, hey, hey!

451
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,920
Are you serious right now?

452
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,020
We have to. It's a glorious day. Here we go!

453
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,040
You should've gotten beer if you couldn't afford a champagne.

454
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,700
You think we have money for that?

455
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,670
This is all we have after the production cost.

456
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,130
I suggested getting some alcohol, too.

457
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,100
Guys! Take these makgeolli bottles!

458
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,280
Ga Deun!

459
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,200
Hey, Ga Deun!

460
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,600
- Meat, too?
- Ga Deun!

461
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,110
Take the makgeolli.

462
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,540
Gosh, you worked so hard.

463
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,310
This is tasty stuff. Finish it!

464
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,850
Yun Min Jae!

465
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,940
Congratulations.

466
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,080
Well done. Thank you.

467
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,320
Ga Deun. We would've starved to death without you.

468
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,110
You contributed so much to receiving the award.

469
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,600
I know.

470
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,310
Congratulations on winning the Audience Award at Sundance. Cheers!

471
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,520
 Cheers!

472
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,190
Good work.

473
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,740
Let's eat until we die.

474
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,830
The director isn't going? What do you mean?

475
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,000
You think we'd get invited to Locarno again?

476
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,950
Are you crazy?

477
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,770
We won an award at Sundance.

478
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,470
I'm sure Locarno would give us something, too.

479
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,730
I'm not refusing to go.

480
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,810
It's because I can't.

481
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,130
It's not like we have production money left.

482
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,310
We won an award. We didn't make money.

483
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,570
I don't like the makgeolli smell today.

484
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,670
What's wrong with the makgeolli?

485
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,110
I brought it all the way here.

486
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,520
So, will you keep making films?

487
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,440
Will you only make short films? Art films?

488
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,920
It's even harder to make commercial films.

489
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,800
And you know you're poetic, right?

490
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,350
You know you're pedantic, right?

491
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,200
What if I did?

492
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,000
I was just making sure.

493
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,230
Let's just drink. Empty your cups.

494
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,320
I said I don't want makgeolli.

495
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,730
And I drove here, too.

496
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,120
Since when did you have a car?

497
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,700
You returned all the filming equipment.

498
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,200
- You said you returned the rental car, too.
- Hey, stop nagging him!

499
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,880
- You were editing something all night.
- Stop changing the subject.

500
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,450
Did you get a car?

501
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,200
You can't even afford a wrap-up party, but you got a car?

502
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,560
You said you were renting it.

503
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,300
Stop probing. Don't get hung up on every word.

504
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:15,040
Did you win a lottery? Or did you win 100 million for another script?

505
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,030
Or did you find a magic lamp somewhere?

506
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,620
Did you find a rich married woman or something?

507
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,590
Sorry.

508
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,320
I'd prefer it if you quit apologizing.

509
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,390
Let me just stay this way for a second.

510
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,160
Let's not touch or move away. Stay like this.

511
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,870
Just for a moment.

512
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,550
Just for a hundred years.

513
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,540
Yes. "Hysteria Seoul."

514
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,900
Everyone tells me to change the title.

515
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,640
Change the subject and story, too.

516
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,500
They want me to get a female lead instead, too.

517
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,950
Did they say stuff like that?

518
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,580
Yes.

519
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,260
But since the script is so good,

520
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:40,540
they thought it'd be perfect if I change those little things.

521
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,410
If I go there, I think I should take

522
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:51,070
the core staff members or at least Dong Il with me.

523
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:56,960
You think the cinematographer should go, too?

524
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,060
Go to Switzerland.

525
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,030
Let me know how many people you need to take.

526
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,020
 Welcome.

527
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:29,150
He deposited 30,000 won, but he's taking 10,000 won worth of stuff.

528
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:33,120
The bank didn't pay for that. Ms. Yi Hwa bought it herself.

529
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,300
They won't come if we remove the coffee, right?

530
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,520
Those homeless people have three-year installment savings accounts.

531
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,890
Is it probably quicker for us to disappear than for the homeless to stop coming in?

532
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,210
 Welcome.

533
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,900
I'd like to buy them a coffee per day for a month, and I'll pay in advance.

534
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,690
That's a bit...

535
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:01,620
We do mostly take-out, but the shop's ambiance is important, too.

536
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,950
Gosh, it's all right.

537
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,310
This is all we need.

538
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:16,940
I had too much drip coffee when I did construction. I don't like it.

539
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,500
Right. We used to drink it all the time.

540
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,860
We smoked and drank coffee a lot.

541
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,560
You worked in construction?

542
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,820
He had a major interior design business.

543
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,670
He used to clean buildings.

544
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,410
He waterproofed the exterior of buildings, too.

545
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,360
But he lost his mind when his wife suddenly died.

546
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,810
And I used to repair boilers.

547
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:56,880
Would you let me pay a year's worth of coffee for them now?

548
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,890
My gosh, thank you.

549
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,090
Thank you so much.

550
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,110
I suppose you have enough money to waste.

551
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,090
I saw you buying coffee.

552
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,100
Paying for their coffee for a year won't make them suddenly deposit billions of won.

553
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,130
She spends money as if it's not hers.

554
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,910
 You know the exclusive account you mentioned?

555
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:55,600
We're thinking of pooling money and signing up for it.

556
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,070
The exclusive account?

557
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,080
I'm sorry. I think I made a mistake that day.

558
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,540
I'll leave now.

559
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,630
No. We're actually all either in-laws or relatives.

560
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,780
There's no way anyone would hear about this.

561
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,770
If you keep acting this way, I'll regret opening an account with you.

562
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,770
Our husbands don't know about the money we're investing.

563
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:42,130
This account is suited for a small company—

564
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,220
I understand what you're saying.

565
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,730
You mean you manage it separately, right?

566
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,390
I'll keep it a secret.

567
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,240
I won't tell anyone.

568
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,410
You can trust me.

569
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,580
I promise.

570
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,010
Don't worry.

571
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,900
Just trust us.

572
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,630
 Director Yun Min Jae

573
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,530
I bought it with the prize money I got. What do you think?

574
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,100
You got prize money?

575
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:56,770
I thought I should pay you back all at once.

576
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,040
I'll make sure to be successful.

577
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,220
 Geuring Townhouse

578
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,360
 Modu Coffee

579
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,170
Mr. Lee. Here.

580
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,950
Have some coffee.

581
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,550
We're drinking coffee Ms. Yu paid for.

582
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,010
Hey, hey, hey.

583
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,040
 Geuring Town Hardware Store

584
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,540
Yes, charcuterie.

585
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,030
You'd like it, too.

586
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,410
I'll meet you in front of your office, then.

587
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:56,880
Have I been here with you before?

588
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,440
Not a lot of people know about this place.

589
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,140
The owner learned how to make charcuterie boards in France.

590
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,200
Their jambon blanc and paté are good.

591
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,640
They have good wine, too.

592
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,600
Have you been here with someone?

593
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:15,530
Thanks to a VIP client I see often...

594
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:18,410
I get to eat good food often.

595
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,280
Thank you.

596
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,070
I got us the best one.

597
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:34,420
I thought you should look more mature at the EC Center.

598
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,260
It's normal to need reading glasses when you get old.

599
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:46,540
I'm glad you decided to do it.

600
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,710
I think this business trip will take about 15 days.

601
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,320
But you'd be so busy.

602
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,120
I don't know what kind of work I'd do at the HQ.

603
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,740
I should prepare for it.

604
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:04,770
How much bonus do you get at the EC Center?

605
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:11,230
How much should I make to satisfy you?

606
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,590
I should've suggested getting foie gras.

607
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,940
 Bring me the money!

608
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,150
 Bring me the money, I said! Give me 50 million!

609
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,190
 The audit team is here right now.

610
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,410
A VIP client wants to see me.

611
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:56,920
I'll have to take a taxi there.

612
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,680
Wait, H-Honey—

613
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,080
Wait...

614
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,390
You can leave this way.

615
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,830
- Review this carefully.
- Yes.

616
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,830
You can't do this during business hours without notice.

617
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:24,320
That's how auditors work.

618
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,130
Customers usually avoid coming in during lunch hour, too.

619
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,860
There were exactly three customers here.

620
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,760
You...

621
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,070
You took Oh Suk Ja's money, right?

622
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:48,090
If you don't bring the money, I'll tell the audit team everything.

623
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,040
Got it.

624
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,570
Where's Ms. Yu?

625
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:24,450
She said she was having lunch with her husband.

626
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,650
You can start with this seat.

627
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,490
You can all have a seat.

628
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,170
Excuse me.

629
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:43,360
Are you an employee in there?

630
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,600
I'm from the HQ's audit team. You're an employee, right?

631
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,480
Excuse me!

632
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,860
 Compound interest time deposit account. 5.2%

633
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:10,010

634
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,130
 Pale Moon 
 Preview

635
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:23,270
 I knew all along.

636
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,910
 That you've been stealing money.

637
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:29,220
 I love it. Want to come to my place?

638
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,650
 Life is short.

639
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,580
 We rarely get to have a picnic. We should have fun.

640
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:38,610
 The fact that you slept with another man means my youth was wasted on someone else!

641
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:43,280
 How are you doing business with Chairman Park's grandson?

642
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,120
 Close this account. Right now. We want the entire amount.
