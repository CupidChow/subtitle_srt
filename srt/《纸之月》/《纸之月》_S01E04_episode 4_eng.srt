 The characters, places, agencies, incidents, organizations, and occupations in this drama have no connection to real life.

8
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,170
 Assistant Manager Na Min Su

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,080
 Welcome.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,000
 Yes, Assistant Manager Na.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,730
 Where are you right now?

12
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,120
 Come to the bank immediately.

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,600
Not just 10 or 20 million, but 100 million?

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,300
Several 100 million?

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,700
Ms. Lee Ru Ri, go to Ms. Yu's house!

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,590
- Yes. 
 - Ajumma ...

17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,550
she'll come if I call her. Give me her phone number!

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,400
She asked me to bring something.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,920
I can't give out personal phone number or address because of the bank's policy—

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,810
Assistant Manager Na?

21
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,260
If you touch that, I'll put all of you in jail.

22
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,980
Try another.

23
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,550
 I got caught.

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,700
What's all this?

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,210
Oh, here you are!

26
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,150
 Please deposit this into my account.

27
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,370
 Don't even try to run away.

28
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,660
 It'd only take me three days to find you, bitch!

29
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,830
 Episode 4

30
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,130
 Wuri Donation Foundation

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,190
 To: Ms. Yu Yi Hwa

32
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,640
I heard Ms. Yu Yi Hwa asked you to lend her 200 million won urgently.

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,180
I've never done that.

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,400
Did you tell her that?

35
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,820
You didn't ask me to lend it to you.

36
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,640
I said I'll give it to you.

37
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,320
You said Ms. Yu asked you to bring that money to her house.

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,800
You don't know her phone number and lost the address she wrote down for you.

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,420
And you asked me for her address just a moment ago.

40
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,070
- And it wasn't 200 million but 20 million. 
 - It doesn't matter.

41
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,120
She's here now.

42
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,110
I did it because she's pretty.

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,410
You're the prettiest.

44
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,750
Take this money! It's a reward.

45
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,980
What's with all the fuss while you're on vacation?

46
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,140
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,740
Is it that nice?

48
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,760
It looks like a house from a car commercial.

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,010
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,720
I opened your drawer without asking you.

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,000
I couldn't find the company's seal.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,980
I thought it was used at your desk last.

53
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,670
But I couldn't open the drawer because I couldn't reach you.

54
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,180
We don't have the drawer key, either.

55
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,970
I'm sorry. I wasn't careful because I was on vacation.

56
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,100
The key for the drawer is inside the desk calendar.

57
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,470
Ms. Oh Suk Ja has done this before.

58
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:40,370
She insisted on giving her house deed to her VIP teller, who was here before Assistant Manager Jang.

59
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,300
I thought she had dementia at first.

60
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,440
Even if she didn't manage a brothel

61
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,740
she has a colorful history.

62
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,360
How pretty.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,610
That's a designer watch, right?

64
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,450
It must be nice having a husband.

65
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,620
Enjoy the rest of your vacation!

66
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,740
♫  The dark gray cloud  ♫

67
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,510
 Pedestrian Signal

68
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,600
♫  is calling me  ♫

69
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:49,320
♫  The spreading darkness  ♫

70
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,800
♫  approached me  ♫

71
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,770
♫  I entered the darkness  ♫

72
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:22,310
♫  And walked endlessly  ♫

73
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,990
♫  I entered the rain  ♫

74
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,620
♫  and I kept walking  ♫

75
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,620
I ...

76
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,170
want you to touch me.

77
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,510
 I've been waiting ...

78
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,890
 for someone to touch me

79
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,660
 as if I'm something precious and beautiful.

80
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,570
 I've wanted someone to touch me like this.

81
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,240
 I've been waiting all this time. All this time.

82
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,080
I've been waiting ... from the beginning.

83
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,380
From the beginning?

84
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,570
I wanted to see you from the beginning.

85
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,480
Have a look at me!

86
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,590
Lean on me!

87
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:44,290
Things that look mundane during the day look impressive at night.

88
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,680
Because nights ... tell lies.

89
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,230
So what if it's a lie?

90
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,050
I'm so happy I'm going crazy.

91
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,740
I'd like to increase my credit card's limit.

92
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,420
It's daytime again.

93
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,820
It seems the lie is over.

94
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,700
Would you like an iced Americano or a regular Americano?

95
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,330
- I'll have both. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

96
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:22,740
♫  As though I am trapped in a blocked tunne  ♫

97
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,860
♫  a suffocating feeling of frustration  ♫

98
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:38,320
♫  I walk endlessly in a hamster's wheel  ♫

99
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:46,230
♫  Without kowing even what it is without wanting to know what it is  ♫

100
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:53,660
♫  The sound of the wind blowing through a gap near the window &nbsp;♫

101
00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:01,410
♫  Everyone else seems well except for me  ♫

102
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:09,130
♫  Will the sky be blue out there?  ♫

103
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:16,910
♫  Will if be full of light out there?  ♫

104
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:23,740
♫  I want to live for myself at least once  ♫

105
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:31,310
♫  I want to be happy at least once  ♫

106
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,250
One more time.

107
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,550
I'm sure she'll come out.

108
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,870
She has to.

109
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,510
She has to be home this late.

110
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,660
Right.

111
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,150
She has to be there.

112
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,360
It's Yi Hwa!

113
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,560
Yi Hwa!

114
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,200
Gosh, my Yi Hwa!

115
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,540
You were home.

116
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,450
How pretty!

117
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,950
You're doing great.

118
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,140
Is Ga Eul drunk?

119
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,040
She's crazy.

120
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,410
Seong Si Hun's mistress is her superior now.

121
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,800
She's not a mistress. She's just his fitness partner.

122
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,250
"Tomayto tomahto." It's the same.

123
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,480
A "mistress" sounds serious. She's not. It's not serious.

124
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,400
- It's not like that, you see? 
 - All right, all right.

125
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,290
Let's just say they once scrubbed each other's back at a bathhouse.

126
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,390
For some reason, it sounds believable.

127
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,110
Yes, they force their naked bodies to strangers at a bathhouse

128
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,950
and tell them to touch it.

129
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,140
Do you want to drink more?

130
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,310
Sounds good.

131
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,050
Here. Let this soak in for a while.

132
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,770
So, you felt guilty you let Gi Hyeon go on a business trip after a fight,

133
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,780
and you've been suffering alone while ignoring our calls?

134
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,430
I didn't notice my phone died.

135
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,020
That's not even a fight. We once had to replace our TV that I had brought as dowry.

136
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,220
Can you give us some details, please?

137
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,730
I took a fork and a knife from someone's baby's birthday party.

138
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,630
And he threw it on the TV. It was when Je In was almost due.

139
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,110
I took them because they said I could.

140
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,290
That's when I trained him properly.

141
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,160
For what?

142
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,870
Sit. Stand. Paw. Wait. Eat.

143
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,450
- Gosh, you're so funny. 
 - Dirty ...

144
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,490
My Je Guk kneeled down in front of me at the postnatal  center every day.

145
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,980
You're not normal, either.

146
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,740
Hey, no one's normal if they're a parent.

147
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,380
And are you normal if you're single? You do everything.

148
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,620
It's normal for humans not to be normal.

149
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,660
Being abnormal is kind of like dirty underwear.

150
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Underwear? You mean like panties?

151
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,550
Only I know how smelly and dirty my underwear is.

152
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,840
No matter how dirty it is, it's mine.

153
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,530
You hide it with your clean clothes.

154
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:25,400
The fancier you dress, the more people believe that you're clean.

155
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,400
You're right.

156
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,530
My goodness. We almost missed the timing for eating crab.

157
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,400
It should taste the best now.

158
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,560
Looks good. Let's eat! Ouch!

159
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,500
- Hey! 
 - Gosh!

160
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,330
- What a waste! 
 - My gosh!

161
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,220
Here, here, here.

162
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay.

163
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,190
The nice meal makes me feel good.

164
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,080
Here we go.

165
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,600
Let's drink a lot!

166
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,420
 Ga Eul, where are you going?

167
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,020
 I'll take a picture of that, real quick.

168
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,230
 You did a good job.

169
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,060
 Oh, no!

170
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,870
 Sir, sir! Just one second.

171
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,310
 Hey!

172
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,130
 Gosh, you drive me crazy.

173
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,360
 Do you know how scared I was?

174
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,330
 You can't even swim.

175
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,900
 Why did you do that?

176
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,510
 I can't save you, but I can drown with you.

177
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,390
Seong Si Hun exercises every day?

178
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,880
That makes no sense.

179
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,000
It's that bitch.

180
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,290
Right? It's that bitch, right?

181
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,870
He and Se Ju still do it five times a week. He doesn't rest.

182
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,300
- Did he crack the code in adultery or something?
- Sit down!

183
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,850
Gosh, it's so frustrating!

184
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,390
I live alone for that reason.

185
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,040
I don't want her to have a stepmom and a stepdad as well.

186
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,000
Those jerks. Shit ...

187
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,230
Even if the husband's cheating, it's better to let him

188
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,470
make money until he retires.

189
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,810
Hey!

190
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,320
I'm saying from an economic point of view, minus mental health and ethics.

191
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,310
How am I supposed to look at Se Ju in the face?

192
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,540
What if Seong Si Hun gets caught and Tae Mi gets hurt?

193
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,830
Let's hope it ends before she finds out.

194
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,680
Hey, why are you wearing that?

195
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,390
I feel jealous whenever I see it.

196
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,940
Why would you be jealous? Yours is a one-carat, too.

197
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,650
But Yi Hwa's is a designer brand.

198
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,870
You can't even buy their 0.30 ct earrings with the money I'd get from selling mine.

199
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,320
That red dress is a designer brand too, isn't it?

200
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,330
You bought it, instead of renting it like me, right?

201
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,830
Do you want it?

202
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,050
Fine then, I'll take it. You can give Ga Eul the dress.

203
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,910
I don't need the dress, either.

204
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,730
I'll take this house.

205
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,310
Nothing beats owning a property.

206
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,840
How about you, Yi Hwa?

207
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,590
What do you want the most in this house?

208
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,400
Ryu Ga Eul, I thought you were fine. Are you drunk?

209
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,500
Don't be silly.

210
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,270
In this house?

211
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,930
I want ... myself.

212
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,720
I want myself the most.

213
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,160
I can't get drunk.

214
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,780
Do you have expensive liquor?

215
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,050
How much did we drink in cost?

216
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,310
Je In is at Mom's. I can drink all night.

217
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,050
Let's get drunk on something else.

218
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,340
Let's get drunk on shopping.

219
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,410
Here we go again. You got divorced because of your shopping addiction.

220
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,410
Hey! Let's say you ran into an oasis while walking in the hot desert.

221
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,500
If you're a human being, it's normal to drink from it immediately.

222
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,300
Shopping is like an oasis to me.

223
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,440
Even if it's a mirage on a sandy hill covered with scorpions,

224
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,510
if it looks like an oasis to me, it's normal to jump in.

225
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,220
Yes.

226
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,070
I did that to survive. To survive.

227
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,930
I wanted to survive.

228
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,730
Yu Yi Hwa, how could you agree with her, too?

229
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,900
How could one be happy by spending money? You're happy only if you save it.

230
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,060
Because they only give it to you if you pay.

231
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,960
Give you what?

232
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,780
Nice things.

233
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,240
You get nice things only by paying.

234
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,420
That's why you're happy when you spend.

235
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,470
There's nothing better than having money.

236
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,920
Let's go shopping!

237
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,380
She's drunk, too.

238
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,580
Sounds good!

239
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,440
- You're drunk, too! 
 - Let's go!

240
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,550
Hey, hey!

241
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,080
Shopping!

242
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,910
Hey! Stop!

243
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,440
This is the most expensive version, right?

244
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,640
How much is 1,300 dollars?

245
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,050
Is it cheap?

246
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,050
It's cheap. Buy it!

247
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,200
Ga Eul.

248
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,160
Hold on.

249
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,410
It's my card.

250
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,510
Cancel. Cancel.

251
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,930
Huh?

252
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,110
- What do we do?
- It's mine, then.

253
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,810
Hey, let's share it!

254
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,450
Oh? Hey, this is on sale!

255
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,340
- Stop buying.
- Let's buy this, too.

256
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,740
Let's buy just one more.

257
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,780
What? What are you doing?

258
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,190
It's all right.

259
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,790
Just leave. You said you have to go to work even during the holiday.

260
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,750
We shopped all night.

261
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,780
I have to go to work now.

262
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,670
You'll still have breakfast, right?

263
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,750
I saw your suitcase. Are you going somewhere?

264
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,830
Where did the mobile in the kitchen go?

265
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,930
You bought it during your honeymoon.

266
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,960
They said they sent it, but it's not here.

267
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,090
What?

268
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,020
A gift card. I bought it on sale.

269
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,360
Sometimes, look up in the sky and walk sideways, too.

270
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,520
That's nice, too.

271
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,970
But only do it sometimes.

272
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,630
Your back would break if you only looked up.

273
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,980
It's only nice once in a while.

274
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,950
What will you make me for breakfast?

275
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,940
It's best to stay where you are, Yi Hwa!

276
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,910
Although you must not like it now.

277
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:16,280
♫  More unfamiliar than reality, a resplendent world  ♫

278
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,290
Ho Yeong. Good work.

279
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,220
Min Jae. Good work.

280
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,290
- See you tomorrow.
- Good work. See you tomorrow.

281
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,710
♫  I want to enter  ♫

282
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,900
♫  The existence which is you  ♫

283
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:44,200
♫  gives me a reason to continue this life  ♫

284
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,030
Well, sir?

285
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,070
You have to pay for the room today if you won't check out tomorrow morning.

286
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,660
I paid in advance on my first day.

287
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,360
We don't allow stays longer than two nights.

288
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,760
You have to check out tomorrow morning.

289
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,180
How much is it per night?

290
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,480
 Blood Sausage Soup

291
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,440
What's this?

292
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,970
A gift of gratitude for Seonbae-nim.

293
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,660
It's all right. Take it back!

294
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,590
Thank you for thinking of me.

295
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,420
But I don't need the money.

296
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,820
Why would you reject it? It's not for you.

297
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,800
Yes, you said you're seeing Father...

298
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,410
I mean, Seonbae-nim soon.

299
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,640
We pooled money to support him.

300
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,460
It's all right, I said. Take it back!

301
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,780
We can't even visit him at the hospital. We're asking you to deliver it for us.

302
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,790
This is for Actor Yun Nam Gil. It's not for you.

303
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,650
Here. Take it! Take it!

304
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,270
- Min Jae.
- Yeah?

305
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,030
Do you want their soup to go?

306
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,690
When are you leaving?

307
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,930
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

308
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,380
It would keep until tomorrow, right?

309
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,300
Keep it refrigerated and take it with you. That hospital lets you cook.

310
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,040
He doesn't have a fridge. He got kicked out of the rooftop unit.

311
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,020
Where are you staying, then? Where have you been staying all this time?

312
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,990
Right. Where have you been staying?

313
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,620
Ring me up, please!

314
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,510
Gosh, he's showing off again. I'll pay.

315
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,690
- Hey, hey, hey! 
 - What?

316
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,050
Stop damaging his self-esteem!

317
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,790
Acting proud when you're in need is bluffing. He needs to know his place to get out of that situation.

318
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,750
Might as well just scream at him. Seriously...

319
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,550
He started making a ridiculous plan.

320
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,980
It was to recruit an army of knights.

321
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,740
He wanted to correct the flawed world.

322
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,090
Instead of being Alonso Quijano,he wanted to become an unbeatable knight.

323
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,070
He became Don Quixote, the man of La Mancha.

324
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,040
I'd like to pay, please.

325
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,670
Thank you.

326
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,070
A lot of people overcome depression thanks to your father.

327
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,900
Oh, I see.

328
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:40,080
But he lost a lot of weight.He needs to eat well to receive the treatment.

329
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,520
Here.

330
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,930
Dad, this is Korean beef. Eat a lot, all right?

331
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,910
It's a gift from your fans.

332
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,950
That's why there's a tiny bit of meat.

333
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,880
I wish they got imported beef so we could enjoy it together.

334
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,090
I eat just fine. I want you to eat it.

335
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,460
You still got it, by the way.

336
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,940
Did you see it?

337
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,500
How come you didn't do films?You were such a successful actor.

338
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,110
You told me not to.

339
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:23,110
You said I'd always play a gangster or rapist.So you told me to just do plays.

340
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,520
Did I?

341
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,730
You must've heard something when you were a kid.You know how I always listen to you.

342
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,330
You know how I always listen to you.

343
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,450
How about noodles?

344
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,940
Noodles? Do you want noodles, too?

345
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,110
You need noodles after eating meat.

346
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:44,990
I guess you still have your appetite.I'll go get them now. Wait here.

347
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,440
Massage his legs.

348
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,380
Dad! Dad!

349
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,140
Sir, are you all right?

350
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,340
Dad, what's wrong? Huh?

351
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,600
He's an alcoholic. You shouldn't have given him alcohol.

352
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,460
Alcohol?

353
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,820
He drank the cooking wine.It can be dangerous because he's been on meds for a long time.

354
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:19,640
Dad, wake up.Wake up, Dad, please!

355
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,120
Dad...

356
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,210
Min Jae.

357
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,990
Huh?

358
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,690
Are you sleeping here?

359
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,290
Yeah.

360
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,060
Let me stay here for the holidays.

361
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,480
I have nowhere to go.

362
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,690
You're all I have.

363
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,760
You know, right?

364
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,870
Yes.

365
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,640
Min Jae.

366
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,550
Yes?

367
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:16,680
Why don't you... pay me rent, then?

368
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,860
How much is it per night?

369
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,620
A bottle of soju.

370
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,600
Let me just have a bottle and die.

371
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,220
Give me just one bottle, Min Jae.

372
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,090

373
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,270
I thought you were coming home tonight.

374
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:32,200
 The vice president came here this morning. So I agreed to accompany him.

375
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,300
 Did you receive what I sent?

376
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,640
 I sent it through Mr. Park because it's expensive.

377
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,050
He gave it to me. Thank you.

378
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,700
When are you coming back?

379
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,680
 I'm not sure, because I have to be attentive to him.

380
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,500
 Also, prepare an outfit that goes with the necklace.

381
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,920
 We have to meet the vice president and his wife as soon as I get back.

382
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,170
Will tonight be a night that doesn't lie?

383
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,900
 Merry Christmas

384
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,100
It's nighttime again. Is it nighttime there, too?

385
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,330
Yes.

386
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,880
It's nighttime here, but it's like daytime.

387
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,110
Where are you?

388
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:45,050
Somewhere no lies are told, even at night.

389
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,440
Do you want to go on a trip with me?

390
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,770
We haven't even had an official meeting yet, Beth.

391
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:07,540
 She became the division head because she slept with the chairman.

392
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,970
 I'm the division head, So Mi Gyeong.

393
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,990
 She's not good at her job. She'll sabotage herself eventually.

394
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,850
 If she can't meet the quota in three months,

395
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,030
 I'll suggest sending her to Belarus at the meeting.

396
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,200
We're still professionals. Let's try not to get emotional.

397
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,600
 I'll reconsider sending her to Belarus next time.

398
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,470
We'll start the meeting in a minute.

399
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,140
Hello, Elizabeth.

400
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,310
Division Head So.

401
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,310
Where's the file?

402
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,160
Let's start the meeting now, then.

403
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,700
We had had an all night meeting at headquarters and now there's one more. Let's talk at home instead.

404
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,170
You live next door to mine, right?

405
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,910
You said you'd buy me a lunner and drinks.

406
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,320
And you made me send Je In to my mom's place.

407
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,740
You told me to come today. I'm hungry. You want me to just leave?

408
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,330
Right.

409
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:35,170
Wait here and salivate until the meeting ends, then. Sorry.

410
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,010
Everyone is exhausted after pulling an all-nighter. It will end soon.

411
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,530
Just wait a moment!

412
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,390
You mean it has to look like a K-beauty product, right?

413
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,610
We bought this European brand for 100 billion won.

414
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:50,290
But it wasn't a huge success in the domestic market in Europe.

415
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,370
Crazy.

416
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:15,300
We should pre-release Idebenon and Alpha Bisaborol's products in a year and...

417
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,200
Dr. Seong Si Hun.

418
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,790
Did you get home safely that night?

419
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,730
It's Dr. Seong Si Hun, who will join us for this project.

420
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,700
Long time no see, Doctor.

421
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,200
Long time no see.

422
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,750
I'm in your care.

423
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,430
I enjoyed the marinated crab.

424
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,820
Crazy...

425
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,510
- delicious, right?
 - Absolutely.

426
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,810
I want you to teach Tae Mi's mom how to cook.

427
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:23,510
In what manner will you be joining us for this project, Doctor?

428
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,620
The HQ is starting a performance testing center in Korea.

429
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,030
Dr. Seong will be the chairman of that center.

430
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:37,030
I hope the project goes well so you make a lot of money.

431
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,900
I shouldn't have divorced him.

432
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,460
Dr. Seong is Team Leader's ex-boyfriend and ex-husband.

433
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,400
My gosh.

434
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,320
Division Head So.

435
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,190
Have you been to Belarus?

436
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,450
Is this Santa's house?

437
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,540
Should we say that?

438
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,850
I thought we'd be gone for two nights.

439
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,920
How long are we staying here?

440
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,670
How long will it take for you to finish the script?

441
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,970
 I'll pay you back little by little.

442
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,300
 It's warm, soft, and smooth.

443
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,590
 Nothing feels sharp anywhere.

444
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:11,050
Hey! Choi Gi Hyeon said you'll get it this time.

445
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,180
So what if my performance has been good?

446
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,900
This is no guarantee of promotion.

447
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,220
What if you don't get promoted?

448
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,550
If I don't, I'll just have to keep at it.

449
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,410
As a forever deputy who works under three of his classmates.

450
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,730
It must be hard being an office worker.

451
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,750
Isn't promotion like the Olympics? It puts you in crisis every four years.

452
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:36,660
If you're well-educated, talented, and have an élite family, you don't get a crisis at all.

453
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,920
You know, like Choi Gi Hyeon.

454
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,960
What's so great about his family?

455
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,410
Didn't you know? His family has generations of artists.

456
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,590
He's a descendant of artists.

457
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:49,080
That's Ms. Yi Hwa's family.

458
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,220
Her father had a large-scale business and failed,

459
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,510
but Choi Gi Hyeon's father was Yi Hwa's family driver.

460
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,320
R-Really?

461
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,670
I know all about their history.

462
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,570
Ga Eul married me when she was an undergrad.

463
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,300
I've known Ms. Yi Hwa for a long time.

464
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,080
How about Choi Gi Hyeon's assets?

465
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,420
His mother is really something.

466
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,190
She started by selling dog meat soup, got seed money from it, invested in real estate and stocks.

467
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,100
invested in real estate and stocks.

468
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,080
Choi Gi Hyeon's family is just nouveau riche.

469
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:26,330
How about Ms. Yi Hwa, then? Is she like his first love?

470
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,530
Why did she marry him?

471
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:34,340
Choi Gi Hyeon's mom paid off Yi Hwa's family's debt when they went bankrupt.

472
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,270
So, she was sacrificed for filial duty? Is that why Choi Gi Hyeon works like crazy?

473
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:42,080
Is that why Choi Gi Hyeon works like crazy?

474
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,010
Does he?

475
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,900
He is. He's a workaholic.

476
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,760
Whenever he outperforms the ones from élite families, he gets extremely excited about it.

477
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,580
He must have an inferiority complex.

478
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:57,540
Come on. Of course, he is. He's full of insecurity.

479
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,050
You're his only friend at work, right?

480
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:05,480
Well, he gets along with the board members. That's enough of networking.

481
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,220
That's enough for networking.

482
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:14,030
Yes. You can compete against members of the élite, but you can't befriend them.

483
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,920
That's why he wants to outperform them. There are cultural differences.

484
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,500
Talking to someone briefly can tell you immediately about their upbringing.

485
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:26,220
Emotional development while growing up isn't something you can just buy later.

486
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:32,330
So I'm his only friend, because I was born poor?

487
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,490
Hey, I wasn't talking about you, man! Let's open a bottle of hard liquor!

488
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:40,020
Let's open a bottle of hard liquor!

489
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,990
A patient gifted me one to thank me.

490
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:47,130
I was born poor, so I like fancy liquor.

491
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:11,970
Welcome. A bottle of champagne is waiting for you.

492
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,100
You'll be charged for room service after today.

493
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,170
What are you thinking about?

494
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,400
Well...

495
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,550
Let's raise our glasses.

496
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:35,680
 SD Savings Bank

497
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,050
Bring the VIP client file to my desk.

498
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,770
Yes.

499
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,170
These are the deposit receipts, and these are the balance receipts.

500
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:49,370
Are we having a crisis? Why did I have to come in so early ...

501
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,140
How much does she have?

502
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,760
Probably more than two billion.

503
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,770
Two billion and 300 million  (≈ $1,750,000) .

504
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,970
Please close Ms. Yu's drawer.

505
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,940
All right.

506
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,380
Oh, right. This won't close.

507
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:16,000
The locksmith said the rail was broken. He said he'll fix it tomorrow.

508
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,560
Tell him he doesn't have to come. I'll order a new one.

509
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,510
Yes.

510
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:54,200
You're pretty. You're the prettiest.

511
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,430
 I did it because she's pretty.

512
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:03,130
 You're the prettiest. Take this money! It's a reward.

513
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,180
 I'm sorry I couldn't eat with you.

514
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,450
 Use this if you need something urgently.

515
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,500
 How far did you try to go?

516
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,390
 Why did you stop here?

517
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,730
How far ... How far will I go?

518
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,990
 I'll put it back.

519
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:36,830
 I can do it.

520
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,670
 Oh Suk Ja - 30 million / Expenses - 20 million

521
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:42,050
 Hotel fee, shopping,

522
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,360
 champagne, food, and card purchases.  
  Hotel Bill: 24 million won

523
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,800
 The total is ...

524
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,510
 Total 50.4 million won (≈ $38,000)

525
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,420
 Installment Savings Account

526
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,780
Please close this account.

527
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,190
It expires soon.

528
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,390
You will lose the interest, is that all right with you?

529
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,100
I need to pay for something immediately.

530
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,980
I'll take it in 50,000 won bills.

531
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,650
 I'd like to know the limit and fees on this card.

532
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,880
 This is the transfer amount.

533
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,520
 It's being processed.

534
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,550
 Please take the cash or check.

535
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,930
 It's being processed.

536
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,000
 How much is it?

537
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,510
 One million and 100,000 won (≈$840).

538
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,440
I was going to leave it in the package dropbox if you weren't home.

539
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,610
It worked out, thanks to you, Eonni.

540
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:19,240
Because you told me to post the video of Seon Yeong.

541
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:25,570
My gosh, it's Misaire tableware.

542
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,270
How pretty!

543
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,570
Did you receive it as a gift?

544
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:35,670
Eonni, I'd like to drink tea with this.

545
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,870
I'll return all this, too.

546
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,680
Gosh, how many days has it been?

547
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,330
 September

548
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,960
I remembered that you requested eggs.

549
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,540
You're so sweet. So sweet.

550
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:08,510
You're the only one who thinks of me.

551
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,650
It's my money, right?

552
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,990
It's my money.

553
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,320
Why are you so surprised?

554
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:38,680
I didn't know you were behind me.

555
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,620
I don't have dementia.

556
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,100
I put it in there yesterday. You don't have to take it out.

557
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,880
I'm aware of that money.

558
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,150
I told you my daughters would take it, if I left it in the room.

559
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:02,130
 Oh Suk Ja - 30 million

560
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,740
 I'll return all of it, without missing a 1,000-won bill.

561
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,050
 I only borrowed it momentarily.

562
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,570
 Park Byeong Sik - usage fee

563
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,900
 Park Byeong Sik - usage fee 
 Usage fee?

564
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,330
 It's not usage fee.

565
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,770
 I'm not borrowing this money.

566
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,630
 You should've had that money.

567
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,000
Is it going well?

568
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:53,820
I might have to stay here for a hundred years.

569
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,890
Would you be able to finish it in a year?

570
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,980
I'm sorry. This place is expensive, isn't it?

571
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:12,430
Does this place help you write?

572
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:16,000
Yes, it's perfectly perfect.

573
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,760
That's great!

574
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,480
 This money is to protect you.

575
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,750
Where's Ms. Yi Hwa?

576
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,680
She said she'll use her reward vacation later. She'll just use her yearly and monthly vacation,

577
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,500
and come to work starting tomorrow.

578
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,730
That's why Eonni Min Su called me in early and rushed.

579
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,800
She wanted to go through things before she came back.

580
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,970
Go through things?

581
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:47,830
They don't just put her on vacation to reward her.

582
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,660
She probably went through the deputy's paperwork, too.

583
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,170
Were they put on vacation to be audited?

584
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,180
Whenever one's sales go up

585
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:59,590
or they suddenly spend money, something always goes wrong.

586
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,940
Deputy Chu got a new car.

587
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,250
It doesn't have to be a car.

588
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:10,000
You get audited even if you wear fake designer clothes.

589
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,640
You said they audit you if you look strapped for money because you might steal.

590
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,270
It means you should live moderately.

591
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,760
Be careful during work dinners, too.

592
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,410
Do they study your drinking habits, too?

593
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:25,350
How many tutors your kids have, how often you travel abroad,

594
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,480
and what you eat when you eat out.

595
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,250
People talk about stuff like that when they're drunk.

596
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:33,280
They check on you for things like that, too.

597
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,580
The more money you're responsible for, the more you are watched.

598
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,400
How come I didn't know any of this?

599
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,890
Because no one earned as much as her in such a short period of time.

600
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:51,160
I'm leaving early today. You know Section Head Kim is thorough with closing, right?

601
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,900
What was Ms. Yi Hwa like when you worked with her?

602
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:04,810
If you're talking about the Ms. Yu Yi Hwa I worked with, all that you said makes sense.

603
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,840
Do you find her strange because she's too perfect?

604
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,450
She had a long break between jobs.

605
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,920
But she's a good worker. So, I was curious.

606
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,610
She was perfect. She was kind, too.

607
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:18,100
Her nickname was HR's Angel Knife.

608
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,600
Angel Knife?

609
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:22,630
It suits her.

610
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,010
That's a cool nickname.

611
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,300
I guess she was very good at her job.

612
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,240
She was perfect. She was so cool.

613
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:41,830
Did you see someone you know?

614
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,230
A lot of people have designer watches, right?

615
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,550
Do you want one, too?

616
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,290
The buffet must be open. Let's go up!

617
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:53,270
I like tasty food more than designer stuff.

618
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:54,830
Buffet?

619
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,510
I have a meal ticket.

620
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:59,420
This hotel is affiliated with our company.

621
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,700
You scared me.

622
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,370
I thought you suggested meeting at a hotel to make me splurge.

623
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,660
Let's go! Their food is apparently really good.

624
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,410
I got you the same cabinet as mine. Do you like it?

625
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,080
Yes.

626
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,250
By the way, Assistant Manager Na.

627
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,670
Can I get a key made for the cabinet?

628
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,810
A key?

629
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:55,310
It's inside your calendar.

630
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:58,540
You said you keep it in here.

631
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,300
- I'm sorry. 
 - You're always sorry.

632
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,020
You're not wearing that watch today.

633
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,150
Do you have a younger brother?

634
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,320
I have two.

635
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:25,520
I'm an only child.

636
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,560
I have two younger cousins, but they live abroad.

637
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,190
Abroad?

638
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,500
Do they stay at a hotel when they come to Korea, then?

639
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,560
Yes, they stay at a hotel when they come.

640
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:40,990
I'll be working away from the office.

641
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:42,790
Yes, sure.

642
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:56,550
I didn't even call you. What brings you here?

643
01:00:56,550 --> 01:01:01,140
You said you'll sign up for an investment portfolio and a CD*. 
 (certificate of deposit, a type of savings account)

644
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,080
And it took you this long?

645
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,350
Why?

646
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:08,330
Did the bank tell you to increase sales?

647
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,990
80 million today.

648
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:27,750
How much do you want tomorrow?

649
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,510
How much do you want?

650
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,380
Mr. Park Byeong Sik.

651
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:55,970
Fifty million won for a CD.

652
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:01,120
I'll deposit 80 million to the CD.

653
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,320
 50 million won

654
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,710
Would you like some bread?

655
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:32,070
You haven't given me the key to the deposit receipt cabinet.

656
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:35,640
Oh, right. What's wrong with me? I must be getting old.

657
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,600
I'm sorry.

658
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,080
Yi Hwa, there's your key.

659
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,630
Yes.

660
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,360
Is this mine?

661
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,730
It is.

662
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:21,890
 It's sweet. Custard?

663
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,550
 She has the same key as me?

664
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,900
Are you nervous?

665
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,560
Pardon?

666
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,580
It's all right.

667
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,490
The right side of my desk is a blind spot.

668
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:46,900
You won't get filmed eating jokbal.

669
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,540
 Blind spot.

670

- Assistant Manager Kim.

673
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,130
Calm down the customers!

01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,040
- Section Head Kim. 
 - Yes.

675
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,150
Get the vault cash and the bank seal.

676
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:23,010
It's all right, don't worry.

677
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,050
- Yes. Assistant Manager Kim. 
 - Yes?

678
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,160
- Get some Yakult for them.
- Pardon?

679
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,660
- Yakult.* 
 - Yes, yes.

01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,610
Don't worry!

681
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,350
Don't worry, it's nothing! 
  Certificate of Deposit

682
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:36,310
Everything will be restored soon.

683
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,560
Have a seat. It'll be restored soon.

684
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,110
Don't worry! Yes.

685
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,190
Have a seat! It'll be restored soon.

686
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:44,970

 Pale Moon 
 Preview

688
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:54,050
 This can't be forged with just a color copier.

689
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,970
 Is it a sample?

690
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,700
 There are apparently two types of money in this world.

691
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,840
 The money you had and the money you couldn't have.

692
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:08,730
 I'm doing what I want to do with my money.

693
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,680
 Why do you treat me like a thief?

694
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,520
 7 million won for room service?

695
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:15,970
 Are you sure you didn't steal it?

696
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,880
 Yi Hwa.
