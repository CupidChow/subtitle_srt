1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,850
 Kim Seo Hyung

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,540
 Yoo Sun / Seo Young Hee

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,900
 Lee Shi Woo / Gong Jung Hwan

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,490
 Lee Chun Hee / Yoon Hee Seok

5
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,330
 Pale Moon

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:41,070
 The characters, places, agencies, incidents, organizations, and occupations in this drama have no connection to real life.

7
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,640

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,490
This will be a popular business look next season.

9
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,600
The last two of them in the country are in our store.

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,170
It's not a common navy.

11
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,610
Yes, that's correct.

12
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:07,480
This is next year's Pantone trending color called Navy Peony.

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,340
I'll take one.

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,830
I'll get it ready for you.

15
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,670
Is it a present to celebrate or a present to show gratitude?

16
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,130
What's the difference?

17
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,040
It's either a goodbye present to end the time spent together

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,010
 or a present to celebrate the time you'll spend together.

19
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,760
The message on the card will be different.

20
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,020
I'll take another one.

21
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,000
Of course, ma'am.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,600
Why isn't she answering? 
  Episode 7

23
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,650
- I'm sorry.
 - It's all right.

24
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,740
- Please go ahead.
 - You can go first.

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,460
Is the man in the Porpora navy shirt also a VIP?

26
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,770
I don't think I've seen him before.

27
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,000
Isn't he the branch manager's client?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,870
Looks like he didn't know the manager went golfing, and he's leaving now.

29
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,100
Why do you ask?

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,010
Just because.

31
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,070
Assistant Manager Na suggested we get sundaeguk*. 
  (blood sausage soup)

32
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,110
Let's ask her to get suyuk*. 
  (boiled meat)

33
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,580
It's all right. I'm having trouble digesting.

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,930
- Enjoy your meal! 
 - Yes, yes.

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,700
 I'm sorry. Please use the next counter.

36
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,830
Should I get you porridge on the way back?

37
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,570
I'll get one delivered.

38
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,800
Why? Aren't you hungry?

39
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,670
Let's go to the barber shop and eat afterward!

40
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,860
Barber shop?

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,140
Today's meeting is important.

42
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,340
It's important to do your job well,

43
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,550
but you have to make the other person want to work with you, too.

44
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,930
It already looks nice.

45
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,890
So just give it a trim and tidy it up.

46
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,400
Do you do manicures, too, by chance?

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,440
I'm sorry, but you have to go to a spa for that.

48
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,130
Aigoo, I didn't know you were so close to the vice president.

49
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,010
You mean his wife doesn't even know he's back in Korea?

50
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,050
She doesn't.

51
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,150
Did you win or lose?

52
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,750
Come on. Don't embarrass me!

53
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,730
That's too difficult of a question.

54
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:31,360
Manager Choi, if the vice president wins the battle with his brother,

55
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,090
you'll become my boss, right?

56
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,360
Wow, I should try to impress you.

57
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,960
Do men get manicures, too?

58
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,770
Men have fingernails, too.

59
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,440
We have to wait for the appointment. Let's eat first!

60
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,380
Well...

61
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,560
It's so awkward.

62
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,300
I'm sorry, but could we order later?

63
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,360
- Of course. 
 - Thank you!

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,000
Gosh, he doesn't know how to read the room.

65
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,390
Excuse me.

66
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,120
Gosh, what does he want to eat, anyway?

67
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,270
Hey, Honey!

68
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,890
I was at the spa.

69
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,130
Huh? Already?

70
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,430
Director!

71
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,800
- What would you like to eat?
- All right.

72
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,400
Manager Choi, my wife is at a Korean restaurant here right now.

73
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,020
I'll take you two to the restaurant, then.

74
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,630
- Let's go! 
 - Yes.

75
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,400
Right.

76
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,120
What's she doing here?

77
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,950
Eonni!

78
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,570
It's the vice president's wife. The vice president's wife.

79
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,550
Let's go. Let's go right now. Hurry!

80
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,610
What's going on? How can we run into each other like this?

81
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,910
Director. Director!

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,390
 Welcome.

83
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,640
 Welcome.

84
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,460
Please put it in there.

85
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,600
 Welcome.

86
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,710
This is really the last time. I can't do it anymore.

87
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,680
Go! This is the women's changing room.

88
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,640
Won't you pay me for the job?

89
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,510
It costs 100,000 won just to get the equipment.

90
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,710
You should pay for the pizza, too.

91
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,600
You know you're paying for the rent this week, right?

92
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,840
Are you here for a meal?

93
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,390
Don't you pity me eating alone?

94
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,850
My husband isn't coming back anytime soon, and the kids are in the US.

95
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,690
I didn't feel like cooking for myself, either.

96
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,550
I was really craving their lunch,

97
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,960
but no matter how much I thought about it, there was no one I wanted to come with.

98
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,590
Why didn't I think of you?

99
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,890
I came here alone, too.

100
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,630
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,770
My husband always takes Manager Choi on business trips.

102
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,540
You're sleeping alone, too, right?

103
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,900
It's just for his job.

104
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,890
But I guess people like us have similar appetites.

105
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,440
How did we end up meeting here?

106
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,730
 I'll make sure the meeting goes well.

107
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,140
 Don't worry!

108
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,410
Which savings bank do you work at?

109
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,110
I'm thinking of finding a new bank for the gallery.

110
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,760
It's nice to have a trustworthy finance person.

111
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,000
The paintings cost a fortune.

112
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,900
And the buyers and sellers don't want paper trails.

113
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,750
I guess a lot of them purchase in cash.

114
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,000
They might not want people to know they have famous paintings from a certain gallery.

115
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,810
See? I knew I wanted to come here for a reason.

116
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,000
It's easy to talk to you, Eonni, since you grew up on this side.

117
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,220
I was just a kid.

118
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,260
How could I understand the kind of culture you're in?

119
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,310
I've been a housewife since I married, but I started working again only recently.

120
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,450
Right. You were like this when you were a kid, too.

121
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,670
Whenever the adults asked about something, you said you didn't know.

122
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,140
You just didn't want to bother, right? You knew everything.

123
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,030
Am I bothering you right now, too?

124
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:08,250
There's one thing I remember from that time.

125
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,270
 I'm not sure if you remember.

126
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,150
- I want you to work for our gallery. 
 - No.

127
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,200
It's not something a junior employee at a savings bank can do.

128
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,490
- Hey! 
 - Gosh, you scared me.

129
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,940
I wanted to do it with you but not fall asleep with you. Why are you sleeping here?

130
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,520
Well, I was drunk. That's why I fell asleep.

131
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,700
Take all of your stuff and disappear in 10 seconds!

132
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,130
You're leaving empty-handed if you take longer than that.

133
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,710
One.

134
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,730
- Seriously...
- Two.

135
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,420
Three. Seven. Ten.

136
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,200
Did you have a comfortable night, Vice President?

137
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,700
- She's at this hotel? 
 - Yes.

138
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,610
With a man?

139
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,000
I guess she made a lunch plan with my wife.

140
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, you mean Artist Yu's granddaughter?

141
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,900
I see.

142
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,470
I'll call a doctor and get some sleep today.

143
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,670
Cancel the dinner plan!

144
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,130
Please call the director of Feather Dentistry in Cheongdam!

145
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,000
You mean a dentist's office?

146
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,900
Is your hearing declining already?

147
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,550
Oh, yes.

148
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,300
He's arriving in an hour.

149
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,800
Yes. Get going now!

150
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,540
I'll do nothing but sleep today.

151
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,320
Sure.

152
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,400
Did you know this, by the way?

153
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,390
Artist Yu...

154
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,850
and my grandfather

155
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,770
agreed to become in-laws a long time ago.

156
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,470
If that family didn't go bankrupt,

157
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,740
your wife would've been my sister-in-law.

158
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,910
And before you go, if you don't mind,

159
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,090
ask them to redo the room service!

160
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,860
Why? Is there something wrong with the food?

161
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,770
Yes.

162
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,360
I don't like how the strawberries are all in different sizes.

163
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,790
Please make sure they're all the same size.

164
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,110
Yes, sir!

165
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,790
It's not easy to satisfy the vice president. I'm sorry, Director.

166
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,780
Long time no see, Manager Choi.

167
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,530
- Yes.  
 - Have a seat, Manager Choi. 
 - Sure.

168
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,960
Thank you.

169
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,910
So, that's what the EC Center is like.

170
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,260
What about her coming to work at the EC Center instead?

171
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,730
Ms. Yu would be more than qualified.

172
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,860
She started working there only recently,

173
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,930
but she made two billion more than what the branch made in the latest quarter.

174
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Yes. Two...

175
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,530
Two billion?

176
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,040
That's what I heard.

177
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,030
She said everyone is expected to make that much.

178
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,190
But she has to want it herself.

179
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,430
- Because she'll have to bring her clients there. 
 - Of course.

180
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,620
He apparently can't go on business trips,

181
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,120
- leaving his beautiful wife behind. 
 - N-Not at all.

182
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,370
Get Ms. Yu Yi Hwa a job there, so she doesn't have to deal with too many people!

183
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,560
You got her a job when she no longer had a career.

184
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,300
It'd be nice if she joined the EC Center.

185
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,980
Because she will only deal with one client in a designated room.

186
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,630
She won't face unexpected situations often, as she does now.

187
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,600
It really sounds like a special place.

188
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,470
My gosh, hello.

189
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,430
Hello.

190
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,980
This is my husband.

191
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,800
- Nice to meet you.
 - Honey, he's the CEO of Samguk Private Equity.

192
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,240
He's also the son of the president of Samguk University.

193
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,320
I see. Nice to meet you.

194
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,700
Did we go to the same school, then?

195
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
Is that so?

196
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,010
 I'm sorry.

197
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,500
This is my subordinate.

198
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,960
I see.

199
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,210
Don't worry about Ms. Yu Yi Hwa!

200
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,510
Have a seat!

201
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,900
You're early.

202
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,010
I said I'm going to the hospital. I need to hurry back.

203
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,920
How much is it?

204
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,650
You just need to pay the remaining 500,000 won.

205
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What's with all this?

206
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,000
The bank will exchange them for new bills.

207
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,350
She receives a lot of tips for her job.

208
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,300
That's the exact amount.

209
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,400
I think it would go really well this time.

210
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,400
I wish I had a proper dress shirt.

211
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,100
What's that?

212
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,600
Well, that's something else.

213
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,130
Doesn't this suit me perfectly?

214
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,360
Do you have this one?

215
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,170
That one is sold out. It won't get restocked.

216
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,810
All right.

217
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,310
Just find me one!

218
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,100
- Hello.
 - Welcome, ma'am.

219
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,900
I called you about exchanging this last time.

220
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,950
Of course.

221
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,220
 Mutilated bills?

222
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,160
Look!

223
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,370
Not bad, right?

224
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,910
You don't like it?

225
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,880
 Lee Ru Ri?

226
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,040
 She took the mutilated currency from the bank?

227
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,370
It's been confirmed.

228
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,900
Oh, all right.

229
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,000
I heard the cufflinks I ordered have arrived.

230
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,160
Yes. I'll bring them out right away.

231
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,650
How about this?

232
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,060
Hello.

233
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,870
Here are the cufflinks.

234
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,990
Thank you.

235
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,600
Take care.

236
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,950
Let's go in!

237
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,320
What are you doing?

238
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,850
You can take this with you.

239
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,320
It's because I'm grateful.

240
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,310
I wanted to pet you as a reward.

241
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,450
Forget it if you don't want it.

242
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,910
You told them you were going to the hospital. You're running late.

243
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,270
Thank you!

244
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,460
Ma'am!

245
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,300
You gave me an extra one.

246
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,410
Oops.

247
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,190
She's the one who came with her boyfriend.

248
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,700
They had a peculiar vibe together. I guess they really are a couple.

249
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,700
- She bought both of the Porpora's Navy Peony shirts. 
 - Daebak!

250
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,550
- She got cufflinks today. 
 - Really?

251
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,090
- Maybe he works at a host bar. 
 - No.

252
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,340
- Porpora? Host bar? 
 - You can tell she's a rich married woman.

253
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,720
The Porpora shirts. Did the woman who was just here buy them?

254
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,360
 SD Savings Bank

255
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,170
We receive at least 10 phone calls a day asking for Ms. Yu.

256
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,420
She's such a star.

257
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,410
Did she go to the townhouse for work, then?

258
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,540
But what kind of vacation ends on a Friday?

259
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,580
You take Saturday and Sunday off, too.

260
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,970
Did she come to work or is she going to the townhouse starting next week?

261
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,290
You don't want to hear about Ms. Yu?

262
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,620
You used to be like "Eonni, Eonni" to her.

263
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,500
When did I? That never happened.

264
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,770
What's with those bruises?

265
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,300
- I fell down the stairs. 
 - What stairs?

266
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,340
- You don't have stairs at home. 
 - There are.

267
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,370
I live in a fancy two-story house.

268
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,720
 SD Savings Bank

269
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:34,100
 SD VIP Lounge

270
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,610
Bravo, bravo!

271
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,400
Even the air feels different in here.

272
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,300
Didn't you say we're having a meal with the director and his wife?

273
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,790
Surprise!

274
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,890
Come here!

275
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,020
Yes.

276
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,230
Have a seat here!

277
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,100
Go ahead.

278
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,540
How does that seat...

279
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,460
 Elysium Chair

280
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,410
make you feel?

281
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,000
Gosh, seriously.

282
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,030
I managed to get you that position. Why don't you want it?

283
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,600
Are you really sick or something?

284
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,160
I, Choi Gi Hyeon, decided to have two families. You don't like it?

285
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,110
Why?

286
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,330
What's the difference between working at the branch and the EC Center?

287
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,310
- I get bonuses based on the sales there, too. 
 - You get power.

288
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,600
The EC Center gives you power!

289
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,290
It's on another level, compared to a neighborhood savings bank.

290
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,400
You don't remember me telling you to quit, right?

291
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,200
That's why you're doing this, right? I can understand that.

292
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,400
I told you to quit immediately, but I'm letting you have this.

293
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,190
You should definitely, definitely be thankful, but you're acting this way.

294
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,590
This is an illness.

295
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,980
What a disaster!

296
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,600
I took a cold medicine because I was feeling feverish.

297
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,740
I think that was bad for me.

298
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,400
Feverish?

299
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,350
This is really a disaster.

300
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,430
I'm taking the vice president horseback-riding tomorrow.

301
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,170
You should have dinner alone tonight.

302
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,050
Don't wait for me to come back from playing tennis and eat alone!

303
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,010
It's no big deal for you to take a break for a day or two,

304
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:55,110
but if I catch a cold, the board members' health would be at risk.

305
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,950
Hey!

306
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,800
Well...

307
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,740
Oh, hello.

308
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,340
We'll get going...

309
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,800
They had a fight. They definitely did.

310
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,910
Do you want to try this on, Tae Mi?

311
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,150
It's so pretty.

312
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,270
You're like Audrey Hepburn! It suits you...

313
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,570
You don't like stuff like this, huh?

314
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,810
If so ... Do you prefer pins like this?

315
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,000
This is pretty, too, right?

316
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,650
There you were. Size 46, right?

317
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,390
Pardon?

318
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,030
I'm sorry.

319
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,630
There was someone who looked similar to you.

320
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,760
I'm sorry.

321
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,440
Similar...

322
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,760
Size 46?

323
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,700
Here's the size 46 for you.

324
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,600
Thank you!

325
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,240
Tae Mi!

326
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,260
Do you want to try something like this?

327
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,290
- This one?
- Yes.

328
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,760
- I'm a middle school student. 
 - You should wear stuff like this if you're in middle school.

329
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,930
I think it'd suit you well.

330
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,870
Come out after you put it on!

331
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,320
Take your time, all right?

332
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,370
It's a gift.

333
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,800
Huh? My initials are engraved on it.

334
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,150
You're cheating on your wife, but you're that nervous in front of your ex?

335
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,070
And even in front of your partner?

336
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,380
Your heart is small.

337
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,100
Big body, small heart.

338
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,560
Tae Mi's in the women's changing room.

339
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,840
Wait for her and take her with you! I'll tell her I called you.

340
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,390
All right.

341
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,680
Should we get some fresh air for a second?

342
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,500
Sounds good.

343
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,700
Let's stop walking!

344
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,730
I'm asking you because I'm so curious.

345
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,880
Someone like you can get any man.

346
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,160
Why see a married man?

347
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,010
Because it's clean.

348
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,930
If I discard them, their wives pick them up and recycle them.

349
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,630
Korea is so good at recycling.

350
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,760
It's a very ecological country.

351
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,960
- What? 
 - Everyone cheats here.

352
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,000
In the US, it usually happens on TV.

353
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,710
If you get caught cheating there,

354
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,370
you lose your entire assets, lose your job,

355
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,070
and you might become homeless.

356
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,940
But here, you just get criticized a few times,

357
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,450
but stay together until the day you die.

358
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,900
What are you, anyway?

359
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Anthropologist?

360
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,680
Anthropology.

361
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,020
It was my major.

362
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,510
I should try to use it since I studied it.

363
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,440
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,840
Seriously...

365
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,170
Did you two have a fight?

366
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,980
You try to control her too much.

367
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,840
There's no hierarchy in marriage.

368
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,670
Deputy Manager Je, how long will it take to get to the hospital?

369
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,410
I can't be late for the tennis game in the evening.

370
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,760
I think it'd take about 30 minutes, "Manager"!

371
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,610
Try to talk it out.

372
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:02,330
You try to control people too much.

373
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,730
Try to think about being controlled against your will.

374
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,930
I'm not controlling.

375
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,210
I'm managing and protecting, Deputy Manager.

376
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:18,150
- But you still keep your relationship fair— 
 - Nothing is fair in relationships.

377
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,730
How could any relationship be fair?

378
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,350
I heard Feather Dentistry in Cheongdam does it.

379
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,160
I went to medical school.

380
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,460
Well, Hyeong. You should know better.

381
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,170
Just do anything!

382
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,750
I'll call a doctor and get some sleep today.

383
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,860
Deputy Manager Je!

384
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,700
Just anything...

385
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,340
Anything.

386
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,430
Wow, how nice!

387
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,580
Where are we going, by the way?

388
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,930
Just tell me!

389
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,200
You'll know when you get there.

390
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,840
Wow, it's nice!

391
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,660
Where are we, by the way?

392
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,230
It's my boyfriend's house. I'll introduce him to you.

393
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,150
"Yun's writing room"?

394
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,100
I just picked them out since I didn't know what situation you'd be in.

395
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,270
Let's see...

396
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,520
It suits you well.

397
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,570
Do you want to try these sunglasses on?

398
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,050
They look good on you.

399
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:31,540
 Director Yun Min Jae

400
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,950
You're the director of my life.

401
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,560
It will go well.

402
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,510
I'll make sure that happens.

403
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,570
You said you have to go to the studio.

404
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,120
 Je In's House

405
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,550
Geez, I'm dying here...

406
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,500
Here.

407
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,420
Well, this is a bit...

408
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,930
I added butter to the leftover sauce from jangjorim* I made for Mother and Father.
 (Soy braised beef)

409
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,410
Only you get to have it because you're the head of our household.

410
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,650
Wow, there's some meat in here.

411
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,180
How dare you get sick without my permission? I feel sad.

412
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,110
You're mine.

413
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,480
Get my permission before you get sick.

414
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,210
Tomorrow's Sunday. Rest up.

415
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,060
Did Mr. Gi Hyeon send you home because you have a cold?

416
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,040
How nice of him!

417
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,100
Not exactly. There were other reasons.

418
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,910
Other reasons?

419
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,790
The vice president summoned all the board members at the tennis club to Yangpyeong.

420
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,260
I'm sure no one's going home today.

421
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,230
They're going horseback riding tomorrow or something.

422
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,390
The vice president apparently looks up to Jumong*. 
  (founder of Goguryeo Kingdom in the 1st century B.C.)

423
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,950
Why suddenly Jumong?

424
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,530
You got to save money instead.

425
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:39,320
If you went there, at least you would've had to get drinks for the bosses.

426
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,650
Gosh, Yi Hwa will be home alone today, then.

427
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,300
Pick up Je In later, Guk.

428
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,520
Eat quickly.

429
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,610
There's a place we need to go now.

430
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,350
 Guil Department Store

431
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,840
 Yeonggwang yellow croaker. The first 100 sets are on sale.

432
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:26,620
 We'll start the premium yellow croaker sale sooner than planned.

433
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,590
 The premium yellow croaker sale starts now.

434
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,220
 Yeonggwang yellow croaker. The first 100 sets are on sale.

435
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,420
Thank you!

436
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,520
I'm sorry.

437
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,040
There are two sets left.

438
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,140
We'll get one each.

439
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,600
How would you like them wrapped?

440
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,870
Here you go.

441
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,340
Yes, I'll get them for you.

442
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,950
- Guys! 
 - Hello.

443
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,730
You shouldn't have gotten those!

444
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,100
Gosh, seriously!

445
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,640
A round of applause!

446
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,420
Seriously.

447
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,760
You're the best, Ga Deun.

448
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,020
What's all this? Hold on.

449
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,160
Let's eat a little later. Let's eat after a quick meeting.

450
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,080
- What do you think? Just wait ten minutes.
 - Let us eat now.

451
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,110
Please. Let's eat in a bit, all right?

452
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,000
Let's get the meeting started. Let's go.

453
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,960
Let's get it started.

454
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,400
I think the messy hair will be good.

455
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
- Are those the costumes?
- Yes.

456
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,390
It was better when you did it.

457
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,140
Thank you for the makeup and snacks.

458
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,670
Sure.

459
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,540
Was it your girlfriend?

460
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,160
I noticed you're wearing designer shoes.

461
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,170
Didn't you say you're working late tonight?

462
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,320
You must be busy. Get going!

463
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,050
What does she do? She loaned you this much money without collateral?

464
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,060
I heard you moved out of Dong Il's.

465
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,720
Do you sleep here?

466
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,400
Where's your sleeping bag?

467
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,610
She didn't just give it to me. She has collateral. I'll pay her back.

468
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,030
Collateral? You? What is it?

469
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,110
My life.

470
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,980
Is she a bit crazy?

471
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,590
Watch what you say, Im Ga Deun!

472
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,620
She's like Christmas to me.

473
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,800
I'm sorry. I apologize.

474
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,300
Because Christmas is holy and precious.

475
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,870
What does she do?

476
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,010
Does she have a lot of money?

477
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,780
You're so interested in my woman.

478
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,110
It's none of your business.

479
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,530
She sounds a bit ominous.

480
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,010
She's like white cloth you grabbed out of clear water.

481
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:20,400
My goodness, did you really meet someone like that?

482
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,930
Thank you for donating products, but how long will you be here?

483
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,240
I just got here.

484
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,800
I'll tell you something you'd be even more thankful for.

485
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,680
Come to see our department head!

486
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,500
She's thinking of producing the film, since Yun So is making a special appearance in it.

487
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,260
 Study 810

488
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,400
Hey, Je In!

489
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,550
Hey, this is the dress my mom threw away, right?

490
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,380
- What are you talking about?
- Je In!

491
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,250
There's a hole there, right?

492
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,620
It melted when I had dalgona once. 
 (Korean candy made with melted sugar and baking soda)

493
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,100
Mom, it smells like our laundry detergent.

494
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,340
Je In!

495
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,550
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

496
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,970
Hey, that's my dress!

497
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,540
Stop lying! My mom bought it for me.

498
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,530
- Right, Dad?
- Yes, let's go.

499
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,550
Hey, what are you doing?

500
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,950
See? It's mine. You beggar!

501
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,780
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

502
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,850
- Excuse me—
 - Apologize to her later, all right?

503
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,540
I said we're supposed to share with people in need!

504
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,690
Gosh, seriously.

505
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,530
Yes. All right.

506
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,150
Ga Eul is working late tonight.

507
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,370
I see.

508
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,990
Do you want to sleep here?

509
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:20,330
- Should I?
- I'll get you a new bed sheet in the master bedroom.

510
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,050
Sure.

511
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,840
Eonni Yi Hwa has really nice stuff at home.

512
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,160
Misaire tableware.

513
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,490
She even had the receipt for it.

514
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:40,340
People like it even more if you also upload a picture of the receipt.

515
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,150
 Post pictures of designer brands?

516
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,970
 Does that get you any money?

517
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,850
 18k gold.

518
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:13,190
 Healing on the inside, luxury on the outside.

519
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,240
Seon Yeong, do you want to change?

520
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,320
Seong Yeong!

521
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,110
 Used designer clothing

522
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,980
 Kim Seon Yeong

523
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,390
Yes, what is it?

524
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,000
What? You broke what?

525
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,560
This is the same one we gave the department head as a welcome gift.

526
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,600
Yes.

527
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,010
It's still in her office, right?

528
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,980
Yes. They stopped producing that design, so she displayed it in her office.

529
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,150
She has the box and everything.

530
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,940
Let me steal it!

531
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,140
I paid most of it.

532
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,110
Shouldn't you ask her directly?

533
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,740
I need to replace it before the owner finds out.

534
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,970
You give it, take it back.

535
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,630
Take it and give it back.

536
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,680
Is that how it is? I'll sell it to you.

537
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,330
If you pay twice as much.

538
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:46,020
You said she went home.

539
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,550
By the way, why do you have to replace it behind the owner's back?

540
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,310
Assistant Manager Kim.

541
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,580
Get cash from this and pay her.

542
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,970
You remember my passcode, right?

543
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,410
Yes.

544
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,760
Je In!

545
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,340
Dad isn't sleeping yet.

546
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,210
I'm not sleeping. I'm making money, Dad.

547
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,740
Huh?

548
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,420
Je In!

549
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,180
What are you doing, Je In?

550
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,580
Je In, what's wrong? Are you afraid of electricity?

551
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,540
You should be afraid of it.

552
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,390
It costs money, too.

553
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,420
Saving means earning.

554
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,830
My baby.

555
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,780
Aigoo, seriously.

556
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,250
There you go.

557
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:31,940
Mom and I make money like this when you're not home.

558
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,390
Aren't I sweet, Dad?

559
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,980
You're so sweet.

560
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:42,430
Saving as much as possible and caring for grandmas and grandpas

561
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:48,290
so they live a long time without getting sick is Mom's life goal, she says.

562
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,700
I see.

563
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:59,360
To get the best hospital and best caretaker for grandmas and grandpas,

564
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,700
the young ones like us need to suffer.

565
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,810
Since Mom and Dad don't have siblings,

566
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:07,930
we have to save even more diligently, right?

567
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,910
My daughter.

568
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,610
Gosh, Guk.

569
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,860
Just rest.

570
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,840
It's all right.

571
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,080
It's the weekend. Just rest.

572
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,750
No.

573
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,420
You should rest.

574
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,490
Do you want it?

575
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,500
If you do, then I want it, too.

576
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,120
What's with you today?

577
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,450
Seon Yeong! I love you!

578
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:43,260
You can use me a thousand or ten thousand times.

579
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,860
You're the only woman in my empire.

580
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,650
Are you crazy?

581
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,900
What's with you!

582
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,400
Hello.

583
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,450
Welcome.

584
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,460
The herb you planted smells so nice.

585
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,340
I wanted to treat you to refreshments to thank you.

586
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,960
Mom, are you having a guest?

587
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,980
Oh, yes.

588
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,870
You said you never got to meet her, right?

589
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:42,200
She's the one from the bank.

590
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,080
I'm so thankful for her.

591
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,550
Hello.

592
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,580
Hello.

593
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,100
Thank you so much for helping Mother.

594
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,720
I'd like to get you some tea. Would you like it?

595
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,280
I like to fix broken things.

596
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,710
I've done it since I was a kid.

597
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,040
You fixed these yourself.

598
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:30,240
I prefer the ones I fixed myself rather than new ones.

599
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,670
I feel more connected to them.

600
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:37,200
But I can't seem to fix my mother.

601
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,360
She's been very upset since the surgery.

602
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,340
But thanks to you, she got a lot better these days.

603
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,970
I'll just accept your gratitude only.

604
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,830
Nuna said they're just coffee cups.

605
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,270
Did that make you feel uncomfortable?

606
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,960
I apologize if you felt that way.

607
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,970
Why do you like Kintsugi? 
 (the general concept of highlighting imperfections and mends as something to celebrate or focus on)

608
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,700
So you know Kintsugi.

609
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,390
My grandfather was an artist. So I'm familiar with some artworks.

610
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,870
Reviving is more exciting than creating.

611
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:40,330
A broken bowl that couldn't even hold water gets reborn as a nice object by my hands.

612
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,460
That's appealing to me.

613
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:48,350
The broken bowls could contain light through the cracks.

614
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,370
What a pity!

615
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:54,870
Bowls without a flaw can't contain light.

616
00:51:54,870 --> 00:52:00,180
The broken ones can be perfect as they are, too.

617
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,490
I want you to... exchange this with a different one.

618
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,360
Why? You don't like tomatoes?

619
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,230
We have apples. Should I peel you one?

620
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,830
No, I like tomatoes,

621
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,080
but I don't like how they're all different sizes.

622
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,640
Make sure they all have the same shape!

623
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:30,420
I don't study because I have a great goal.

624
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,250
I do it so I can provide the best in-person service to the clients.

625
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:39,700
If you work there without ambitions and goals just to kill time,

626
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,220
you can leave when I leave.

627
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,930
I want you to come back to your true self.

628
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,710
I put the house on the market for rent.

629
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,640
I'll rent an apartment.

630
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,090
What did you say just now?

631
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,200
You said you put the house on the market for rent.

632
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,020
I can get a studio apartment for myself.

633
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:17,970
Pack all the things in a month and ship them to Japan!

634
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:21,490
The house deposit will come through the living expense account.

635
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,900
I want you to send it to my account!

636
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,830
That installment savings plan that's expiring this month.

637
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:32,760
The five-year plan you signed up for using the money I gave you and your parents for pocket money.

638
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,320
That plan! It's time to redeposit it, right?

639
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:44,500
Don't redeposit it and transfer all of it to my checking account!

640
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,960
I need it to rent a house and a car in Japan.

641
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:51,060
- That money—
- I made all that money.

642
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,780
And I gave it to you!

643
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,680
I'm the one who gave you that money! Me!

644
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,160
It's mine!

645
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:03,900
It's mine, I said.

646
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,540
 100 million won? Right now?

647
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,940
 Rental car, suite room, 100 million for security deposit,

648
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,190
 and 60 million won for the down-payment for the apartment.

649
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,520
 If you exclude the rest,

650
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,040
 I have 20 million won left.

651
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,590
100 million?

652
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,940
How do I get that immediately?

653
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,910
 The owner refuses to give you any deposit in advance.

654
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:55,340
 I told them they could charge twice for the monthly rent, but still said no.

655
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:06,990
 Eonni, you're having an affair, aren't you?

656
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,680
 It's this man, right?

657
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,040
 The one in the Porpora shirt.

658
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,070
 Lee Ru Ri

659
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:22,780
 Lee Ru Ri

660
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:27,040
 Come to this address this evening!

661
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,020
 Otherwise, I'll send this photo to people at work and your husband.

662
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,080
 You went into the hotel holding hands.

663
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:48,580
He's asleep.

664
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,830
Don't be shocked, Eonni!

665
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,920
Come on in!

666
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,890
What do you want me to do?

667
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,880
It's not hard.

668
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,260
Ru Ri!

669
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,630
Stab me with this!

670
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,930
Stab me anywhere!

671
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,950
He just needs to go to prison.

672
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,910
I'll say he did it.

673
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,720
You'll hurt your hand.

674
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,730
Put the knife down!

675
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,630
Stab me!

676
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:47,770
If you don't do it now, your life will be over, too.

677
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,950
Stab me, I said. Please!

678
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:05,090
Please.

679
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,970
Please.

680
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,920

681
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,420
 Pale Moon 
 Preview

682
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:12,080
 Is the vice president's wife doing money laundering?

683
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,470
 I thought your type was married men.

684
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:18,270
 Team Leader Ryu fears things getting messy the most.

685
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:21,440
 I bought it with the prize money I got. What do you think?

686
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,140
 Cheers. Did you find a rich married lady or something?

687
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,080
 You manage Ms. Oh Suk Ja's assets, right?

688
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,190
 Bring me money. Bring me money, I said.

689
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,290
 Give me my 50 million.
