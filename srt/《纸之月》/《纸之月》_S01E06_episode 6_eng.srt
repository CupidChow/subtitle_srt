00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,690
 Kim Seo Hyung

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,500
 Yoo Sun / Seo Young Hee

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,710
 Lee Shi Woo / Gong Jung Hwan

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,480
 Lee Chun Hee / Yoon Hee Seok

00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,730

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,100
 Pale Moon

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,080
 The characters, places, agencies, incidents, organizations, and occupations in this drama have no connection to real life.

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,450
What is this?

9
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,440
This.

10
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,450
What's this?

11
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,800
 The fake receipt stamp!

12
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,400
I must've left my cell phone.

13
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,080
What are you doing?

14
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,320
Ms. Yi Hwa, are you all right?

15
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,050
What are you making such a big deal about?

16
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,120
Assistant Manager Na, I think there's been a misunderstanding of some sort.

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,170
Hey, go home if you're f***ing drunk.

18
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,300
Why are you throwing a shitshow in my house?

19
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,890
You... I mean, your hand...

20
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,910
What were you trying to say?

21
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,360
You, Assistant Manager Na!

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,890
If you appear in front of me ever again, you're dead!

23
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,470
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,420
I must've been mistaken in my drunkenness. I'm very sorry.

25
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,230
If you're sorry,

26
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,760
there's a delicious restaurant that makes beef bone soup with Korean beef.

27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Do you want to continue drinking there?

28
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,850
Sure.

29
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,480
Let's go!

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,790
- Yes. 
 - Let's go!

31
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,950
Yes.

32
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,850
Be careful.

33
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,770
Let's go.

34
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,700
Are you all right?

35
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,230
Sir, are you all right?

36
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,790
 Saehyeon University Hospital

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,510
I heard a person could die if you inject air into the tubing.

38
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,100
I remember seeing it in a movie.

39
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,940
I'm just saying.

40
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,400
I'm sorry. They said the guardian needs to be here.

41
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,400
Must I stand guard over him?

42
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,960
You little scumbag!

43
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,540
- Chairman!
 - Chairman.

44
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,870
That son of a bitch!

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,230
 Ward 'A'

46
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,320
All right!

47
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,870
It's mine!

48
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,100
- Look at this! 
 - Geez, you're too much!

49
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,010
 Gosh, what a swindler!

50
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,180
You contacted me regarding Ms. Oh Suk Ja, right?

51
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,740
How did you know my contact number?

52
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,500
I asked your mother.

54
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000
I see.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,940
- Well, then. 
 - Excuse me.

56
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,320
You're leaving without seeing her?

57
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,970
 All right!

58
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,300
 - Aigoo!
- What a swindler...

59
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,230
I've done what I need to do.

60
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,980
I leave Korea tomorrow. There will be no one to contact even if she passes away now.

61
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,310
My siblings also left a long time ago.

62
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,470
- Then she doesn't have any family to care for her? 
 -  This grandma has some tricks up her sleeve!

63
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,840
 What do you mean? When did I ever?

64
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,340
- Did you see me?
 - Gosh! Hey!

65
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,090
 Grandma, I told you I didn't! What the heck?

66
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,260
I did well to cut ties with her.

67
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,680
There were times when I regretted it.

68
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,950
You're not asking why her children cut ties with her.

69
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,300
You must know that she sold women and alcohol to get a building in Gangnam.

70
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,130
How much did she pay you?

71
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,860
Or did she promise you her fortune once she dies?

72
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,310
It's not like that. She's my client.

73
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,790
Today, I just ended up...

74
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,240
Your mother doesn't have a clear mind.

75
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,260
Aigoo, let me take one.

76
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,530
- Gosh, that's a bomb.
 - That's right!

77
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,980
Let's take this one!

78
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,900
"Mother"?

79
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,500
Money is nice.

80
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,060
However ... People can tolerate fishy and sweat-stained money,

81
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,420
but there's money they absolutely can't tolerate.

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,200
Money that smells like pee.

83
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,590
At age 20, my oldest brother said that,

84
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,040
holding my hand and my younger brother's

85
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
as we left that woman's house.

86
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,730
 Ward 'A'

87
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,980
Eat the hospital food.

88
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,230
The food is made especially for your body's needs, so it's healthier.

89
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,260
It's expensive.

90
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,810
Buy me a triangle kimbap! One that's not spicy.

91
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,210
I want to get discharged!

92
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,910
There's nothing wrong with me.

93
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,320
I can just stick on a pain-relief patch.

94
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,350
I don't know how the hospital smelled my money.

95
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,960
They won't discharge me because they want to empty my pockets.

96
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,380
You're not in pain right now because you got an injection.

97
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,300
They said your bones are fine, but you sprained some muscles.

98
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,320
If you listen to the doctors here, I'll visit you more often.

99
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,750
And today?

100
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,700
Will you sleep by my side today?

101
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,550
I'll leave once you fall asleep.

102
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,840
Gosh, my daughter.

103
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,790
So pretty!

104
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,180
If I hadn't given birth to you girls, I would've been regretful.

105
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,630
 International Healthcare Center

106
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,790
You waited all this time?

107
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,880
What will the night lie about tonight?

108
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,170
I see you were...

109
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,070
waiting for a lie, not me.

110
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,940
I came out to meet you.

111
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,050
How did you know I would stay at the hospital?

112
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,600
That grandma's alone.

113
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,720
And you're a warm person.

114
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Apparently, starlight comes from tens of billions of light-years away.

115
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:16,070
So the real star, which was tens of billions of light years old, disappeared long ago.

116
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,560
Only the light remains, which is why it shines like that.

117
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,060
Not everything is alive just because it shines.

118
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,830
That was out of the blue.

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,960
Out of the blue?

120
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,170
You came after work?

121
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,790
So, the ones shining right now are all dead and fake?

122
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,700
Even if they're fake, they shine. They just have to shine.

123
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,020
Aren't you tired? Have you been staying at your friend's house all this time?

124
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,870
Thank you.

125
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,560
When I worked just to survive, I wanted to die.

126
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,350
But now that I'm working to pay back your money,

127
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,820
the only thought I have is, "Let's live life to the fullest."

128
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,510
I sleep in Dong Il's room.

129
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,840
Which allows me to focus on my movie.

130
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,480
When I slept alone,

131
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,710
I thought, "Let's quickly get through this sickening day."

132
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:47,320
And when I woke up alone, having to live another day felt like a punishment.

133
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,580
But I feel really good these days.

134
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,620
That's right, you look good.

135
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,610
I feel good thanks to a good person.

136
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,560
So, I really like that person.

137
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,250
Seon Yeong, I'm busy right now. I'm hanging up.

138
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,940
 Ms. Ga Eul, it's me.

139
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,290
Did something happen to Seon Yeong?

140
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,780
I'm looking for something, but Seon Yeong left her phone at home.

141
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,130
Aren't you with her?

142
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,570
I think I know where she is.

143
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,850
I told her I bought new clothes yesterday.

144
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,120
I'll take the photo like this.

145
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,670
Who could it be?

146
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,470
Ta-da! It's pretty, right?

147
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,310
I don't look like a mom, right?

148
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,360
I don't know how much more understanding I have to be.

149
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,540
What's wrong?

150
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,460
You dress our daughter in discarded clothes and you borrow someone else's clothes.

151
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,950
I feel sorry for you.

152
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,990
You're still going on about that?

153
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,610
Children grow quickly.

154
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,060
How can we buy new clothes every time?

155
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,680
Je In won't even remember when she's older.

156
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,050
I can buy her nice clothes in the future.

157
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,010
That blasted "in the future."

158
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,670
Don't you have any pride?

159
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,760
Use the money we have. I earn enough!

160
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,630
Is a deputy manager's corporate salary not enough for you?

161
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,270
How am I to put up with you, who saves money on food

162
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,160
to pay for the rent, insisting we move into a place we can't afford?

163
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,100
Did we move here for my sake?

164
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,660
We moved here for Je In's school and your commute to work!

165
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,450
If you stop being stubborn,

166
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,950
we can move to a larger house with the money we spend on this one!

167
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,160
You can buy a house, but you can't buy culture.

168
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,070
The neighborhood atmosphere is embedded only when you live in that neighborhood.

169
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,950
It's not something you can imitate.

170
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,830
A dragon's tail is still a dragon.

171
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,580
Where the dragon goes, its tail will follow.

172
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,840
Why do you want to live as a snake's head?

173
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,210
Stop being unreasonable!

174
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,670
I'm telling you to live according to your level and looks!

175
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,120
Don't act like some beggar!

176
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,050
I have to act like a beggar!

177
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,500
You said to live according to my level and looks.

178
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,750
I'm the poorest in this neighborhood!

179
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,440
If the money I make isn't enough, then you should go out and make some, too!

180
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,960
Then what about you?

181
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,320
Why do you stick to your corporate job when your juniors are surpassing you?

182
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,740
Why don't you work at a small company or business?

183
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,550
It's because you want to be the dragon's tail, too, at the least!

184
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,070
You're really making me out to be petty.

185
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,130

186
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,890
- I messed up.
- You messed up?

187
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,010
You still rank on top when you mess up!

188
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,970
That's true.

189
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,530
Whoa, daebak!

190
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,930
Is she a celebrity?

191
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,700
She's so cool.

192
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,330
That woman over there?

193
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,330
- She has incredible charisma.
- Right?

194
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,960
You think so?

195
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,520
Tae Mi!

196
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,440
Wait, you know her?

197
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
She's my aunt.

198
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,700
- What?
- Really?

199
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,940
Your biological aunt?

200
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,420
- Yeah.
- Daebak!

201
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,430
Hey, she's prettier than your mom.

202
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,340
Hey, my mom looks way younger!

203
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,240
Sorry, forgive me!

204
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,680
 Hello!

205
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Hi!

206
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,480
Auntie, please buy us something delicious.

207
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,510
- Treat us!
- Please treat us!

208
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,280
What do you want to eat?

209
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,330
- What do you want to eat?
- Chicken? Tteokbokki? Pizza?

210
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,770
- They all sound good.
- Exactly.

211
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,890
- Tae Mi.
- Mom!

212
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,340
- Oh, hello!
- Hello!

213
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,460
You're here?

214
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,970
I'll give you girls a ride. You have tutoring, right?

215
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,610
Why do moms talk about our personal lives?

216
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,610
- Auntie said she'll buy us something delicious.
- That's right.

217
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,060
- Auntie did?
- Yes.

218
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,800
That's me.

219
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,840
Sorry. I would've joined you if it weren't for your tutoring. Enjoy!

220
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,870
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

221
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,120
Eonni, I'm going to drop the kids off first.

222
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,530
I'll call you later.

223
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,280
Sure, let's talk later!

224
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,030
Tae Mi, ask your aunt to buy you a birthday gift.

225
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,260
Our family can blow out the candles at home later.

226
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,030
Is that really all right, Mom?

227
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,260
Of course. Have fun with your aunt!

228
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,110
You can skip your lesson today.

229
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,060
I'll call your teacher.

230
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:31,360
Thanks for ... sharing your daughter with me today.

231
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,830
It's not like she'll become your daughter for sharing her with you.

232
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,440
The pizza will get cold.

233
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,840
You put on your seatbelts, right?

234
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,040
 Yes!

235
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,050
See you tomorrow!

236
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,850
Where should we go?

237
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,460
Should we just go on a drive?

238
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,750
Do you want to eat something delicious?

239
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,910
How do raw beef and Pyeongyang cold noodles sound?

240
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,980
I only ate those when I was pregnant with you.

241
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,800
I get indigestion when I eat cold noodles.

242
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,400
You enjoyed it when you were a baby.

243
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,160
Don't misunderstand my friendliness today.

244
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,090
It was kind of like a staring contest with the girls.

245
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,590
A staring contest? What for?

246
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,300
Well, it's like saying you know someone famous, like a celeb.

247
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,790
My friend's cousin is a WEN News announcer.

248
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,370
But I'm not a celebrity, though.

249
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,630
If I'm close to someone cool, it makes me look cool, too.

250
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,680
it makes me look cool, too. So I just acted like I knew you.

251
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,560
Don't come to meet me without my mom's permission just because of what happened today.

252
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,340
So I'm cool, huh?

253
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,760
What's so cool about me?

254
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,700
You're luxurious from head to toe.

255
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,590
Am I?

256
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,580
I'm luxurious?

257
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,840
Then should we go shopping?

258
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,410
Should we get some fresh air on the way?

259
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,710
It's embarrassing.

260
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,420
Refreshing, right?

261
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,930
Raise your hands!

262
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,660
How's this one?

263
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,900
Look!

264
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,750
How is it?

265
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,660
Look!

266
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,530
Does it scream, "college student"?

267
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,430
I have something similar to this.

268
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,530
How about a chic couple look?

269
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,760
Not your style?

270
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,500
Do you want something more girly?

271
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,590
A one-piece.

272
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,410
You like this, don't you?

273
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,760
It's pretty.

274
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,080
It looks good on you.

275
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,510
Do you like it?

276
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,960
Do you want to try this one, too?

277
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,140
Put it on my tab.

278
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,650
Team Leader Ryu, we currently have a card promotion for 7% off purchases over one million won.

279
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,770
Yeah, my card is over the limit.

280
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,830
You can put it on my tab with my credit, right?

281
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,620
Yes.

282
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,800
That looks pretty, too.

283
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,440
You look good in anything.

284
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,550
Look around some more.

285
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,800
Can I try these shoes on?

286
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,690
Don't ask and just buy everything you want.

287
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,030
Put everything we chose on the tab.

288
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,720
You've improved!

289
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,810
I'm so tired.

290
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,250
How much does a place like this cost?

291
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,550
Do you earn 100 million won per month?

292
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,770
I earn the average Gangnam doctor's pay.

293
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,730
You're going to the sauna tonight, right? Take me with you!

294
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,290
Why are you trying to stick with me all day?

295
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,360
Did you two fight?

296
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,620
My body's just a little tired. I want to sweat it out.

297
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,130
Department Head So, you're here?

298
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,110
Hello, Dr. Seong Si Hun.

299
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,870
You must've finished a match.

300
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,580
Oh, we just finished.

301
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,520
Let's play another round, Hyeong!

302
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,740
Would you like to play with me?

303
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,250
Then, should the three of us play a game?

304
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,110
I'd love for the three of us to play.

305
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,790
I guess I'll get a proper workout today.

306
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,370
I'll be waiting in the lobby.

307
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,540
- In Cheongdam...
- Yes.

308
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,890
Vice President!

309
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,530
We're in trouble.

310
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,960
General Manager Choi, we've been caught.

311
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,240
It's all right if it's Deputy Manager Je.

312
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,900
I'll take care of the situation.

313
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,460
- All right.
 - All right then, take care.

314
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,400
Hey. Hey!

315
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,750
The tennis court here? You?

316
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,970
Hyeong Si Hun.

317
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,450
Oh, right. I was about to say ...

318
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,620
Wait, but that hyeong can't afford a membership, either.

319
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,300
Isn't he in debt after opening his practice?

320
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,740
He must've paid it off.

321
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,560
His clinic is famous.

322
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:40,090
By the way, I heard you told Ms. Yi Hwa you're returning next week.

323
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,820
And you submitted a vacation notice at work.

324
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,490
I've been escorting the vice president around.

325
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,690
You didn't mention my vacation notice, did you?

326
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,070
The vice president's wife doesn't know we're in Korea, either.

327
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,030
When did you return to Korea?

328
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,620
Yesterday. We returned yesterday.

329
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,430
What exactly are you doing with the vice president?

330
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,220
It's business, Deputy Manager Je.

331
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,960
The VIPs don't hold back their compliments for this room

332
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,550
for its classic interior and practical use of space.

333
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,500
Please take a look around.

334
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,620
The fact that events like this affect sales is quite...

335
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,810
It's not even twenty people.

336
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:28,920
Well, each one of them has one million followers.

337
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,500
What's the psychology behind wanting to buy whatever famous and rich people buy?

338
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,410
It's skincare, so they should buy what's right for their own skin.

339
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,900
Anyway, isn't this over our budget?

340
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,910
Department Head So said not to worry about the budget and that she'll take responsibility.

341
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,390
So she wants us to proceed on another level, different from other companies' events.

342
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,930
How many days in advance do you want to make the reservation?

343
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,470
Hold on.

344
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,130
Which jewelry brand are we collaborating with?

345
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,700
Climt and Palace.

346
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,090
But we still haven't held a meeting with them yet, so—

347
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,590
Their marketing team probably needs time for the jewelry-setting

348
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,780
and they also have tight security measures.

349
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,230
We'll need extensive time.

350
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,710
We'll make the reservation starting today.

351
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,060
Today?

352
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,550
I'll check the schedule for you.

353
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,840
Rather than a reservation for an event "on another level",

354
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,780
it seems you're throwing a punch at Department Head So.

355
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,350
The event is still one week away.

356
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,380
We need to show her what "another level" really means.

357
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,130
- Let's go eat! 
 - Sure.

358
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,980
Excuse me! I ordered a diamond cake.

359
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,060
All right.

360
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,640
Cake? Is it Ms. Yi Hwa's birthday?

361
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,180
No, it's the vice president's wedding anniversary.

362
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,840
Wow, how much does one meal here cost?

363
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,080
I ordered a proposal cake.

364
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,930
For Yu Yi Hwa.

365
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,510
Ms. Yu Yi Hwa.

366
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,570
Did you make this order with the suite room guest service coupon?

367
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,340
- Yes, that's right.
- All right.

368
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,540
Please prepare Ms. Yu Yi Hwa's cake.

369
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,160
Please wait a moment.

370
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,200
Thank you.

371
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,720
Hey, hey! Ms. Yi Hwa's not the only one with the name Yu Yi Hwa.

372
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,500
- Excuse me, Yu Yi Hwa—
 - Mr. Gi Hyeon!

373
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,270
I'm right.

374
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,900
- Mr. Je Guk, you're here, too?
- Hello!

375
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,010
Oh, Ms. Ga Eul!

376
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,250
You know me, right? Ga Deun's seonbae.

377
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,590
He's Ga Deun's workplace seonbae, too.

378
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,820
This is Ga Deun's friend.

379
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,560
Nice to meet you.

380
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,240
Im Ga Deun isn't here with you?

381
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,800
I'm meeting everyone I know here.

382
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,890
The cake you ordered for Ms. Yu Yi Hwa is ready.

383
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,020
That's mine.

384
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,640
That Yi Hwa really was Ms. Yi Hwa.

385
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,680
The proposal cake ordered with a suite room guest service coupon

386
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,900
was your cake?

387
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,970
Yi Hwa said she ordered our cake under her name.

388
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,010
I told Im Ga Deun to pick it up, but I guess she asked her friend.

389
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,870
Thank you! We'll take it.

390
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,340
Seon Yeong never mentioned anything.

391
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,390
Are you getting married, Ga Eul?

392
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,730
I guess you caught us.

393
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,810
Please keep this a secret!

394
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,680
Since she's my superior at work.

395
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,350
Who's the suite room guest that my wife booked the room under her name?

396
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,070
Hey, who do you think?

397
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,180
You two look very good together.

398
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,620
Could you keep this a secret for now?

399
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,190
If Tae Mi finds out ... She's going through puberty.

400
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,540
Seon Yeong doesn't know yet, either.

401
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,450
Gosh, don't worry about that.

402
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,610
My sincerest congratulations.

403
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,700
How embarrassing.

404
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,800
The vice president is residing in the presidential suite room.

405
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,360
Which one are you staying in?

406
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,240
Oh, we're staying in the Deluxe suite room.

407
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,810
- Oh, right. Excuse me.
- Yes.

408
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:44,150
Please deliver an Armand de Brignac to our Deluxe suite room while we dine.

409
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,390
All right.

410
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,160
Oh, congratulations.

411
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,150
I'm Choi Gi Hyeon.

412
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,100
I'll confirm.

413
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,500
 Welcome.

414
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,930
Ms. Yu Yi Hwa didn't come to work?

415
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,980
Oh, she's using the vacation reward she couldn't use last time.

416
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,690
- She didn't say anything else?
  - Welcome.

417
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,200
The vacation reward is for a long period.

418
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,720
It's not even a holiday. Who'll take over the VIP in-person service?

419
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,670
Deputy Manager Chu told Ru Ri to take over for now.

420
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,210
Ms. Ru Ri was going to be trained before Ms. Yu Yi Hwa came.

421
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,990
She used to accompany Assistant Manager Jang, too.

422
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,120
Yes, so she did.

423
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,020
You're pretty behind on your utility bills.

424
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,330
I would've had to pay a fine if I missed the bank hours again today.

425
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,520
Overseas wire service is possible, right?

426
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,240
Savings banks don't do foreign exchange transactions.

427
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,080
- Are you going on a vacation?
- Yes.

428
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,620
- I guess I'll need to visit another bank.
 - Welcome.

429
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,990
Is it a long-term vacation?

430
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,240
Six months of training.

431
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,540
 Welcome.

432
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,530
You must be excited.

433
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,000
- Will you be using a check?
- I'll use cash.

434
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,030
 Welcome.

435
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,800
 (She pretended to enter  the amount of cash he gave to buy a bank check but then she deleted it.)

436
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,850
 Welcome.

437
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,640
Have a nice vacation!

438
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,750
I wish you good health.

439
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,320
Thank you.

440
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,360
Take care.

441
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,500
Place your bets!

442
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,960
I'll only bet this much this time on the banker.

443
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,370
Banker. What a play.

444
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,690
Let's see.

445
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,080
Let's see, let's see.

446
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,620
Geez, his face doesn't look good...

447
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,650
I got it.

448
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,870
Banker...

449
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,670
- You saw that, right?
- Nice!

450
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,230
Is this rigged?

451
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,210
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

452
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,780
- He's meant to be.
- He's on a roll.

453
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,370
He won three rounds in a row.

454
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,450
- Do you know how to play?
- Not at all.

455
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,090
Share your winnings.

456
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,430

457
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,990
So suspicious...

458
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,690
Shall we take a break?

459
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,930
We've been playing for a while.

460
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,400
Let's take a rest.

461
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,520
- We can play later.
- I'm so unlucky this time.

462
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,010
You can go home and rest tonight.

463
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,530
Hey, don't drink too much.

464
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,340
We're here.

465
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,400
You're here.

466
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,760
It's been so long.

467
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,890
You're home?

468
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:13,190
You said you'd tell me your return date next week.

469
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,630
You should've woken me up.

470
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,350
Did you sleep well?

471
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,930
I would've slept in your study if you woke me up.

472
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,900
- You like the bedding in the bedroom.
- It's fine.

473
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,620
I got a good rest in the study.

474
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,930
A familiar place to sleep is better than an unfamiliar bed.

475
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,540
That's a relief.

476
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,500
Your trip got so long. I was afraid your size might've changed.

477
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,070
My body hasn't changed in size since I was 20 years old.

478
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,010
You don't need to worry about that.

479
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,540
The necktie looks good, too. Good job.

480
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,660
How much do I need to give you?

481
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,920
I'm gifting it to you.

482
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,020
Gift?

483
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,490
What money did you buy all of this with?

484
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,980
I got a bonus.

485
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,080
A bonus?

486
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,010
The cufflinks you wanted were shipped from their HQ in Italy,

487
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,200
so they will arrive today.

488
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,990
Is there anything else you need?

489
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,760
You got the pearl necklace from Assistant Manager Park, right?

490
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,130
- Thank you.
- They're hanadama, which really suit you.,

491
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,850
Try them on.

492
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:39,370
With the dress you wore when we took a photo with the Vice President couple.

493
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,470
Are we going somewhere?

494
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,620
Just wear them and come out!

495
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,410
There's a lot of dust on the stairs.

496
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,730
The robot vacuum must not be able to climb the stairs.

497
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:34,040
- You bought one?
- I bought it from your company's employee mall.

498
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,470
Good job.

499
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:41,510
I wondered where you were spending the money you earned from your part-time job.

500
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,650
Take the grey suit in my suitcase to the cleaners today.

501
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,410
We won't need to go to the cleaners.

502
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,500
It's hard to make it to the cleaners on time since I work.

503
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,930

504
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,380
Why is this so expensive?

505
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,610
How much of a bonus did she get?

506
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
Quit your job now!

507
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,850
You'll have to quit once I expatriate, anyway.

508
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,710
Just think of it as an early resignation.

509
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,230
I can't do that.

510
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,980
You're not even doing this for money. What's gotten into you?

511
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,830
I can't quit because I'm not doing this for money.

512
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,050
I have more responsibilities now.

513
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,400
"Responsibilities"?

514
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,040
Are you required to pay a penalty if you resign?

515
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,720
How much is it?

516
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,570
Do you know how much money goes to waste when a man expatriates alone?

517
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,210
A housekeeper, outside meals, and laundering costs.

518
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,530
If you were a proper housewife,

519
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,100
you would follow me to avoid wasting that money.

520
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,860
Your most important responsibility is me, Choi Gi Hyeon!

521
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:32,560
How much more money will you spend if I don't go with you?

522
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,520
You—

523
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,450
 200 million won

524
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,010
This is 200 million won.

525
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,700
Everything will work out.

526
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,490
To be honest,

527
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:40,160
I met Ga Deun's work supervisor, Ms. Ga Eul.

528
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,430
Ga Eul is aware.

529
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,860
Thank you.

530
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:27,660
Don't worry about Ga Deun finding out about us.

531
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,450
I'll succeed no matter what.

532
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,170
I'll buy dinner tonight.

533
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,520
I'm a regular, so I'm close to the boss.

534
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,880
I want to introduce you to him.

535
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,940
Did I make the wrong choice? You don't need to, if you feel overwhelmed.

536
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,900
There's something I also want to introduce you to.

537
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,650
Are you serious?

538
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,760
I rented this car because I thought you might need one while filming.

539
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Take this!

540
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,600
Oh, no. Next time.

541
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,230
I really want to buy you a drink tonight.

542
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,240
She makes brochures, too?

543
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,410
This ajumma is desperately struggling to survive at work.

544
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,520
"AICPA"? 
 (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants)

545
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,240
Just how much is she getting paid?

546
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,880
Does she... make more than I do?

547
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,590
Let's go in! I'm hungry.

548
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,030
How many times do I need to tell you?

549
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,990
I've been telling you—

550
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,330
Oh? It's Yun Min Jae!

551
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:46,280
 Director Yun! Director Yun! Director Yun-

552
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,290
Hello.

553
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,750
There's nowhere to park here.

554
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,320
Did you invite her?

555
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,610
What the? What are you doing here?

556
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,670
Whoa, Ga Deun's here!

557
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,630
Hey, Min Jae! Come on!

558
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,120
Wait, does this mean Ga Deun's treating us?

559
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,130
Quiet!

560
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,920
Anyway, I wasn't interested, but congratulations to Yun Min Jae's debut as director.

561
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,000
Today, I came to treat my gracious team leader.

562
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,240
You know I'm a salarywoman, right? I'm desperate for brownie points.

563
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,460
Everyone, greet my team leader!

564
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,550
 Hello!

565
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,900
My hubae said she'd treat me, but it looks like my wallet will be bleeding heavily.

566
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,700
Nice to meet you.

567
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,230
It's my treat today.

568
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,950
You're so pretty!

569
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,540
Im Ga Deun's connections! Sit down.

570
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,390
Hey, sit down!

571
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,170
Here. Where's the star?

572
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,420
I'm going to keep an eye on you. On everyone.

573
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,620
There's a hole. Oh, my. Oh, my... You'll eat it all?

574
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,800
- Try it.
- No, no! That looks disgusting.

575
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,680
What is it?

576
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:14,440
What does that childish man mean to you?

577
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,750
This isn't like you. Why?

578
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,360
You had a nice, ordinary life.

579
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,130
Is this considered ordinary, too?

580
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:34,180
There are a lot... of foolish and brief relationships.

581
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:40,530
Doesn't the current vibe just ask for Ga Deun's piano playing?

582
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,280
Nunim! Check it!

583
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,360
Okay!

584
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,580
I'll play along.

585
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,510
Im Ga Deun's piano and beer are a perfect combo!

586
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,810
This is Yun Min Jae's!

587
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:11,400
All right, we have a special singer today.

588
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,970
Yun Min Jae!

589
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,880
- Sit.
 - Oppa, sing for us!

590
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,010
I want to hear you sing, Oppa!

591
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,990
Sing! Come on, come on!

592
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:47,170
♫  Perfect days without any flaws  ♫

593
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:53,870
♫  You were there  ♫

594
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:57,710
What a nice age! 
 ♫  Both during the first snow ♫

595
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,140
♫  and when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom  ♫

596
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,710
♫  you will be with me.  ♫

597
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:09,110
♫  It can be perfect  ♫

598
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:16,210
♫  When the cold wind blows, I'll embrace you warmly  ♫

599
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,590
♫  As cold as the wind is  ♫

600
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,990
Here. Wake up and take another good look at him!

601
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,720
He's not a big deal, either.

602
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,010
♫  I will be your shade  ♫

603
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:39,580
♫  So that you can rest, I will fill your season  ♫

604
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:57,780
♫  At a sudden glance a rising sky  ♫

605
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:04,650
♫  A cloud drifting far away, is like you  ♫

606
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,880
♫  I will fill your season  ♫

607
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,540
All men are the same.

608
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,690
Sorry, I might be doing you wrong.

609
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,590
But I think this is the right thing to do.

610
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,900
Mr. Gi Hyeon is here, so I'll hand you over and disappear.

611
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,650
I'm leaving.

612
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:57,020
Do you want to go on a drive? It's been a while.

613
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,020
We've gone on a drive before?

614
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,460
Wow, the road has a nice atmosphere.

615
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,610
Should I turn on the music?

616
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,240
♫  When the cold wind blows  ♫

617
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,850
What a nice song. Who sang this?

618
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:24,900
♫  As cold as the wind is  ♫

619
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:31,620
♫  When the sun is scorching, I'll be your shade  ♫

620
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,050
♫  So you can rest  ♫

621
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:41,050
♫  I will fill your seasons  ♫

622
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,060
This doesn't make sense.

623
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,670
I'm crazy.

624
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,350
 Seong Si Hun

625
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,400
 What?

626
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,340
Are you free? You're busy, right?

627
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,410
Come to QK Hotel if you've got something to say.

628
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,400
Hotel?

629
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,890
 Ga Eul

630
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,350
Hey, Tae Mi's mom.

631
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,980
Hey, Ryu Ga Eul! You...

632
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,900
Does this make sense?

633
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,900
I mean, I met with Ga Eul to discuss Tae Mi studying abroad.

634
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,190
We shared a few drinks while trying to convince Ga Eul, who was against it, and she got drunk.

635
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,900
Drunk? Seonbae Ga Eul?

636
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,610
Whiskey? Beer? How much did you drink?

637
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:03,810
A bottle of whiskey.

638
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,210
Seonbae Ga Eul got drunk on one bottle of whiskey?

639
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:09,300
Yeah, she got too drunk, so I booked a room for her.

640
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,280
And I slept on the sofa—

641
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,530
You went to the bathroom in the middle of the night

642
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,580
and saw this, so you took it?

643
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,240
Who's the bitch?

644
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,760
I said, it's Ga Eul!

645
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,610
Wait.

646
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:27,250
Are you badmouthing Ga Eul? What do you mean bitch?

647
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,690
You're nitpicking because you don't like me meeting Ga Eul regarding Tae Mi, huh?

648
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,140
Is having slept once with Ga Eul something to be this angry about?

649
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,900
Ga Eul and I are Tae Mi's parents.

650
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,400
When was that?

651
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,100
Indeed.

652
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,510
When could it have been?

653
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,070
When you two slept together.

654
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,640
When we slept together?

655
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,250
Did you sleep with me?

656
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,690
Did you touch me?

657
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:35,300
He said you got too drunk, so he put you to bed and slept on the sofa.

658
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,030
What bullshit.

659
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,120
Do you want to live like that when you have a daughter?

660
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,990
Hey, you're her mother.

661
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:52,350
You don't know how many times I heard that someone who resembles you

662
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:55,580
and Tae Mi's dad met at a hotel.

663
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,480
I figured it was you.

664
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,980
The hair found on his clothes was your hair.

665
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,600
And the perfume was also your signature perfume.

666
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,040
Honey, did you see it with your own eyes?

667
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,610
You should.

668
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,730
You'll get hurt if you blindly trust a man's words—

669
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,620
Hey! Hey, Ryu Ga Eul.

670
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,770
I trust you, Seonbaenim.

671
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:55,450
I've observed your divorce process and started dating him after all was over.

672
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:58,920
When people called me an adulteress who stole her supervisor's husband,

673
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,940
you're the one who shielded me.

674
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,830
How could I not trust you?

675
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,780
You went through a lot.

676
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:17,520
But... this is different.

677
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:25,700
I think he's meeting a woman who resembles you.

678
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,180
The woman who was spotted in the hotel with him...

679
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,540
Was that really you?

680
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,740
I'm sorry.

681
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,120
I'm sorry, Tae Mi's mom.

682
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:09,470
When I wanted to get drunk, there was no one I could really let myself loose with.

683
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:11,860
So I called Tae Mi's dad.

684
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,090
I won't call him now.

685
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,180
I won't do that. I'm sorry, Tae Mi's mom.

686
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:25,340
The ex-wife who sleeps around with her ex-husband.

687
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:36,860
It sounds as dirty as being called an adulteress who stole her supervisor's husband.

688
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,340
Please clean up your act!

689
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,760
All right.

690
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,960
I'm sorry.

691
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,600
I'm really sorry, Tae Mi's mom.

692
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:27,480
Stars have a lot of overlapping appearances, so they lose novelty.

693
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,000
On the other hand, using celebrities across society as models

694
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,270
has the effect of stimulating consumers' intellectual needs.

695
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:40,610
"I don't just follow trends. I support the spirit." Something like that.

696
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:42,290
Sorry?

697
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:49,890
I heard you're against Department Head So's suggestion of using celebs instead of stars as the new models.

698
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,370
The purpose of marketing is sales, but the marketability is—

699
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,810
Marketability is something we create.

700
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,870
We just need someone who's hot and hip.

701
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:02,840
A non-celebrity who's strangely charming and sexy.

702
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,820
That's all we need.

703
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,390
It's a short-term model, anyway.

704
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:09,450
We're the professionals, so we can do the pumping.

705
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:13,800
Did you call me to the middle of the street just to tell me this?

706
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,270
Your legs must be broken.

707
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,970
Do you want a piggyback ride?

708
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,960
I was abusing my authority.

709
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,420
I'm sorry, Assistant Manager Geum.

710
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,030
I wondered if you were asking me out on a date.

711
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,440
I'm going to do that, too.

712
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,080
Let's have a drink. Harmless, Assistant Manager Geum.

713
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,340
You're telling me to be harmless, right?

714
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,240
Or you can be dangerous.

715
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,580
I can just call the police, in this law-governed country.

716
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,740
Let's sleep.

717
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,340
Sleep with me tonight, Seok Jin.

718
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,030
I don't want to.

719
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,330
I see.

720
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,750
I don't want to simply sleep with you, Ryu Ga Eul.

721
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:36,120
You really booked this room?

722
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:47,010
I wanted to bring you here that day, but you're my superior.

723
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:51,630
Do I need to call the police now?

724
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,030
Not 119?*
(Number for fire department and ambulance in Korea)

725
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,400
You might die tonight.

726
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:11,950
You might want to live with me starting today.

727
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,530
Really?

728
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,350
 Certificate of Deposit

729
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,450
 Certificate of Deposit

730
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:06,240
 Certificate of Deposit

731
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,940
 There's a potential investor.

732
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,640
 They want to hold a meeting.

733
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,830
 Wish me luck!

734
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:13,780
I'm sorry.

735
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,540
For what?

736
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,740
Didn't I do something wrong?

737
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,000
Then why can't you sleep?

738
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,200
I'm done sleeping.

739
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,610
I'll go wash up.

740
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,830
Aren't you sick of me?

741
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:37,320
I think you'll get a good sleep if we do it now.

742
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:42,330
Should I go to work a bit late then?

743
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:53,080
I'm sorry you have to live with me when your dream is to become royalty.

744
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,480
That's not true.

745
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:01,140
I only put them up because the only pictures of women who look old and fancy are royalty.

746
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,840
Real life is about growing old and living fancy.

747
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:10,600
How many years of youth do we have when the average life expectancy is 100 years?

748
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:18,360
When you get old, you'll get presbyopia, arthritis, and indigestion.

749
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,310
Would you be happy wearing heels and wearing jewelry?

750
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:25,700
Isn't it better to do what you want now?

751
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,950
If you live doing everything you want now,

752
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,740
you'll regret it later when you really want to do something.

753
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,970
What is it you really want to do later?

754
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,280
I don't know.

755
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,090
I don't know, but whatever it may be, anything is possible if you have money.

756
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,730
I don't know everything, but I'm certain about one thing.

757
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:50,580
However I live, you're the only man for me, Je Guk.

758
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,200
Let's bring out more pillows! Your back hurts.

759
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,880
Deal!

760
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:03,800
One or two?

761
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,480
Both.

762
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,100
One and two!

763
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,130
Here I go.

764
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:12,930
Me, too.

765
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,940
I can't last long.

766
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,140
What's important is that we did it.

767
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,040
Honey!

768
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:41,070
Yu Yi Hwa!

769
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,510
Are you on the second floor?

770
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,120
 AF Vice President

771
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:03,310
Yes, Vice President!

772
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:06,000
Yes. Oh, yes.

773
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,730
I'll be at the hotel without delay.

774
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:26,580
Are the clothes comfortable?

775
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,840
Yesterday...

776
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,370
It'll work out.

777
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,470
You're not nervous, are you?

778
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:42,950
Do you remember the rental car's number?

779
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:45,820
I left it with the hotel valet.

780
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,600
I thought you'd definitely need it today.

781
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,550
It suits you.

782
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,660
Lean on me!

783
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,550
 Yi Hwa's bank?

784
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:01,660
 Yi Hwa's in charge of the VIP in-person service, so she's usually not at the bank.

785
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,510
Geez, why are there so many young men?

786
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,830
Where is she?

787
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,190
Three—

788
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,330
Are you talking about 3 billion won?

789
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,050
Yes.

790
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,240
Is Ms. Yu Yi Hwa working offsite?

791
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,310
Why isn't she picking up?

792
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:32,380
Take care.

793
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,910
Geez, this woman.

794
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:39,290
I'm sorry.

795
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:41,370
It's all right.

796
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,460
Please go ahead.

797
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,340
It's all right. You can go first.

798
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:19,990

799
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:30,670
♫  As though I am trapped in a blocked tunnel  ♫

800
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:38,600
♫  Without even knowing what it is or wanting to know what it is  ♫

801
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:46,060
♫  I can hear the sound of the wind in between the windows  ♫

802
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:53,870
♫  Everyone else seems well except for me  ♫

803
01:06:53,870 --> 01:07:01,770
♫  Beyond the frame of reason  ♫

804
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:08,190
♫  Take off the bridle and fly away  ♫

805
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:15,920
♫  I'd like to live for myself at least once  ♫

806
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:22,290
♫  I want to genuinely laugh  ♫

807
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:30,360
 Pale Moon 
 Preview

808
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,470
 - It's perfect for me, right?
- This is really the last time.

809
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:34,030
 Damaged bills?

810
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:35,540
 By the way, did you know?

811
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:39,730
 If Artist Yu's family didn't end up like that, she would have become my sister-in-law.

812
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:40,960
 A present.

813
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,360
 Why have an affair?

814
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,940
 18K gold.

815
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,150
 Let me steal this.

816
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:49,580
 Power.

817
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,600
 E.C. Center is power!

818
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,460
 All that money is what I earned and gave you!

819
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,280
 100 million? 100 million this instant?

01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,970
♫  Get out  ♫
