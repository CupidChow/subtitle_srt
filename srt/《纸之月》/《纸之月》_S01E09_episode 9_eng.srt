 The characters, places, agencies, incidents, organizations, and occupations in this drama have no connection to real life.

 Print

12
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,040
Who'd believe this?

13
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,500
How would anyone believe this ridiculous

14
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,330
deposit interest?  
  (Savings account interest in Korea at the time was less than 1% per annum)

15
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,440
Excuse me!

16
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,330
The house is quite neat, like its owner.

17
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,660
The front door was open.

18
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,990
We live in this neighborhood.

19
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,430
They've seen you around a couple of times.

20
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,130
The front door must've been tired and forgot to close itself.

21
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,360
I leave the door open half the week, too.

22
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,990
Sometimes, the neighborhood dogs come in to play.

23
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,230
You must be preparing for a party.

24
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,030
We were having a potluck party when we thought of you.

25
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,110
We came to invite you.

26
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:25,680
I need it for something, so I was checking to see if it worked well.

27
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,000
By the way, you didn't go to work today?

28
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,200
You're home at this time.

29
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,670
I left something important behind.

30
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,990
I came to get it during my lunchtime.

31
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,900
Then you must have time to eat lunch at our house.

32
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,930
Yes, let's have lunch together.

33
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,030
Yes, please join us.

34
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,720
 Compound interest time deposit account. 5.2%

35
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,530
I must get back to work.

36
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,810
I'm so sorry.

37
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,210
I'll visit you on my next rounds.

38
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,200
 SD Savings Bank

39
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,500
 2 weeks later

40
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,920
Come on! Can't I apply for that compound interest deposit?

41
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,290
I won't tell the other members.

42
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,920
I haven't told anyone all this time.

43
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,460
 If I buy a few billion subordinated bonds (bonds not supported by collateral), I'll also become an EC client.

44
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,380
 If this product can't be sold to individual clients...

45
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,620
what if I form a corporation?

46
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,310
Then I'll qualify.

47
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,100
If you insist... can you really keep it a secret from the others?

48
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,550
Of course! I swear it.

49
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,470
I heard you didn't go to the hospital.

50
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,540
That hospital made it possible for my grandchildren to be born.

51
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,590
If it weren't for them, I wouldn't be a grandma.

52
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,720
 Menstrual cycle, injection, gynecologist, hospital

53
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,400
This is our first time meeting after I transferred to EC Center.

54
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
You're right.

55
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,410
I used to see you more often than my daughter, but it's so hard now.

56
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:02,640
I'd like to entrust... all my financial management to you.

57
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,500
I'm convincing everyone I know to switch to this bank these days.

58
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,380
I heard that branch almost got into an accident.

59
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,080
Didn't you know?

60
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,770
 SD Savings Bank

61
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,960
Ms. Lee Ru Ri.

62
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,330
 What about Ms. Yu Yi Hwa?

63
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,200
 She said she was having lunch with her husband.

64
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,460
You can start with this seat.

65
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,420
You can all have a seat.

66
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:13,450
But please don't move from your seat and phone calls and emails are prohibited.

67
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:20,120
I'd also appreciate it if you could place your hands on your desks so we can see them.

68
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,710
Where is Ru Ri? Where did she go?

69
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,940
She said she was going to the restroom.

70
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,100
She still hasn't returned?

71
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,950
Excuse me!

72
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,170
Are you an employee in there?

73
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm from the HQ's audit team. You're an employee, right?

74
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,560
Oh, my! What are you doing here?

75
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,370
Is there an employee inside?

76
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,810
Ru Ri, sorry! I took a while, didn't I?

77
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,030
I was out of it because the audit team suddenly stormed in.

78
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,910
Ru Ri! It's you, right?

79
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,280
Did you think the man outside was a pervert?

80
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,640
That scared you, huh?

81
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,420
Yeah, Eonni!

82
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,170
I almost fainted.

83
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,160
Is that man still out there?

84
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,530
This is humiliating.

85
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,790
Come out, Ru Ri!

86
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,670
He left.

87
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,710
I was... aware of everything.

88
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,190
- Why are you wet?
- Don't touch me!

89
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,230
I'm dirty.

90
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,830
 The branch manager was

91
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,000
 audited for his involvement in the New Town Development Rebate in Sodan-dong.

92
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,510
 He put a high appraisal on land in Sodan-dong so he could give out loans and make money off of it.

93
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,600
I heard he lent out loans for the same property.

94
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,200
See? It was true.

95
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,090
I have connections in this field.

96
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,420
I know everything, even when it's not been on the news.

97
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,220
We'll start rolling. Cue!

98
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,320
Everyone, can you see?

99
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,300
I heard our guest would be a director, but an actor came instead.

100
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,240
 Last week, Actress Yun So came out.

101
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,890
 I heard you returned to Korea today.

102
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,100
 Are you coming straight from the airport?

103
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,790
 Yes, that's correct.

104
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,580
 Ms. Yun So wouldn't stop praising your looks,

105
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,040
saying they're as good as your movie.

106
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,000
 Thank you.

107
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,570
 Congratulations. You won the Special Mention Award for the "Leopard of the Future"

108
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,030
 at the Locarno Film Festival.

109
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,970
 Gosh, thank you.

110
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,030
 I was fortunate.

111
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,170
There were many remarkable films, but thankfully...

112
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,850
 It must've felt different since the film festival was overseas and not in Korea.

113
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,920
Hey, Seon Yeong.

114
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,140
On your way?

115
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,280
Stuck in traffic? Bringing your pajamas?

116
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,960
 Yes to number one. Yes to number two.

117
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,910
Number three, I forgot, but can't I just go?

118
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,810
Hey, it's been forever since I decided to treat you. Will you be like this?

119
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,900
Especially as someone who knows T.P.O.?

120
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,550
I have a new set in your size. Just come.

121
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,800
Come quickly.

122
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,030
Didn't you say you were advertising our company's product?

123
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,030
I'm a popular influencer.

124
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,660
I have a clear outlook on the world.

125
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,070
Organic pajamas for an organic basic line.

126
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,240
You don't know how much my followers praise me for this mindset.

127
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,970
I know it's all a scheme to advertise both company's products with one shot, one kill.

128
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,910
This is great!

129
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,690
I said let's just order pollock stew or braised spicy angler.

130
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,030
Later!

131
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,130
I'll order it after we take photos when Yi Hwa gets here.

132
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,780
The photos will smell!

133
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,570
Take it easy, Kang Seon Yeong.

134
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,930
You always go overboard.

135
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,200
Hey, this is actually comfortable.

136
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,750
Don't I look like the owner of a Jeju villa?

137
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,710
Hey! I came because you said you were promoting our products.

138
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,400
How dare you throw out our company's product?

139
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,040
I'll upload a one-month review. Let me just throw out one month's worth.

140
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,080
You've been uploading fake reviews all this time?

141
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,060
Several bags of products can't match up to a single session of Seong Si Hun's laser treatment.

142
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,570
Why are you bringing him up?

143
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,100
I don't know why those people live like that.

144
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,620
I hope our new product becomes a big hit, so that bitch can return to HQ.

145
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,220
I hope you become the department head

146
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,550
and I really hope that lively* woman becomes successful.
 (She says the word "penis" that sounds like "lively")

147
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,860
Kang Seon Yeong, your choice of words made me laugh.

148
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,980
Says the person who choked me, asking me if I'm on So Mi Gyeong's side.

149
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,650
You know that both you and that woman hit the jackpot thanks to me, right?

150
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,530
Our Seon Yeong developed Princess Syndrome after making a little money.

151
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,980
By the way, did Yi Hwa not return that all this time?

152
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,300
She hasn't said anything.

153
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,400
- The Misaire we broke!
- Yeah.

154
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,720
What if she still hasn't opened it? I totally forgot about that.

155
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,210
Should we have replaced it with a new one?

156
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,280
Of all times, your card had to be suspended!

157
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,060
You're the one who broke it.

158
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,250
It's fine if she's not aware of it.

159
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,250
Let's confess if she ever asks.

160
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,570
Gosh, whatever.

161
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,100
- It's Tae Mi.
- It's Tae Mi?

162
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,650
 Of course.

163
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,470
Whose daughter could she be if not mine?

164
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,490
I'm the spitting image of her.

165
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,130
 Isn't my daughter Tae Mi tall like a model?

166
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,820
 Are you the mother of a student from the same school?

167
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
 You're right.

168
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,460
- Tae Mi, looking at you like this...
-  She's the top in her school.

169
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,040
 Today, I'm going to be shooting with

170
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,880
 - my daughter Tae Mi. 
- You really look like your mom.

171
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,140
Which mom?

172
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,010
The real one.

173
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,200
Her real mom.

174
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,290
 Ta-da!

175
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,230
 It's my go-to designer bag, Haul.

176
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,440
Did Tae Mi lose a lot of weight?

177
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,540
- Is it because she's getting taller?
 - You carry it like this.

178
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,380
You're right.

179
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,020
 White. You can use them together like this as a couple.

180
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,330
Seong Si Hun let her buy all those designer bags?

181
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,150
How strange.

182
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,440
Her channel has over 200,000 followers.

183
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,710
She probably bought them with her own money.

184
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,180
Making a channel earns you an extra zero at the end rather than just doing social media.

185
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,130
I'll make a channel someday, too.

186
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,810
Se Ju said she'd introduce me to her company.

187
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,410
- Want to watch more?
- Yeah.

188
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,810
The world is changing so fast.

189
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,540
You can make money doing all sorts of things.

190
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,560
 Which one do you think is the prettiest?

191
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,470

192
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,880
There's always someone who can't stand other people's success.

193
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,110
Seon Yeong, can you tell her to block this comment?

194
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,880
Why? Is there a hate comment?

195
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,480
Come here. Contact her right now!

196
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480

197
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,680
WaddaMom,

198
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,010
what conception dream did I have to give birth to a top student in her school?

199
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,720
 I was watching a group of white cranes fly up

200
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,230
 from a forest filled with wonderful trees.

201
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,110
And the biggest and most radiant crane flew straight into my arms.

202
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,340
That's why Tae Mi's name in Chinese characters

203
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,880
 means "to grow" and "crane."

204
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,400
Our Tae Mi's name is pretty, too, right?

205
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,090
She even remembered my conception dream.

206
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,220
Gu Se Ju.

207
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,580
I'm thankful.

208
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,690
But the "Mi" doesn't mean "crane," Gu Se Ju.

209
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,940
You're right.

210
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,340
"To grow" and "be widely known," right?

211
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,370
Yeah.

212
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,150
"To grow" and "be widely known."

213
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,640
 That day

214
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,470
Director!

215
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,490
We're on our way to drink with Ms. Yun So. You should join us.

216
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,910
Did you bring your car?

217
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,920
We're going to Ms. Yun So's house in the car she sent us.

218
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,880
Let's go. What's there to think about?

219
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,300
A Hallyu star invited you to her house.

220
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,220
Should I?

221
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,350
- You look good.
- Whoa!

222
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,820
That's organic, too. It's modal silk. Natural fibers.

223
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,850
Did I say anything?

224
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,550
You're pretty, too.

225
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,890
Should we switch, Ga Eul?

226
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,640
No, forget it.

227
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,070
Hey, this is fine, too.

228
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,060
It's similar to what I wore at a hotel in Dubai.

229
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,570
Here.

230
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,700
Oh, thank you.

231
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,890
Hey, why do I get sleep socks?

232
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,790
I won't take photos with this kind of treatment!

233
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,970
Aigoo! Take a look.

234
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,380
They're abuzz with compliments like, "Your skin is sexy," and

235
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,400
"Where did you get your tanning done?"

236
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,650
They're asking what you use to manage your hair. 
  That day

237
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,330
I am quite sexy.

238
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,330
They love my skin.

239
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,590
 That day

240
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,350
That's a fact.

241
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,990
What?

242
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,800
So pretty.

243
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,020
What are you thinking so hard about?

244
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,400
You look so depressed after transferring branches.

245
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,780
Did you break up?

246
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,500
You broke up with Gi Hyeon?

247
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,690
What a psychic. She's not! I'm talking about myself.

248
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,480
Were you seeing someone?

249
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,470
Who? A divorcee? A bachelor?

250
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,130
People who are alive are all in the process of breaking up.

251
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,700
Breaking up isn't such a big deal.

252
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,570
Humans do die eventually, but...

253
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,590
Isn't it natural?

254
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,500
The only permanent thing in this world

255
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,640
is the fact that nothing is permanent in this world.

256
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,900
The poet Cheon Sang Byeong once said, this world is a picnic we get to enjoy briefly.

257
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,840
Life is fleeting.

258
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,500
We're having a picnic, so we should enjoy it.

259
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,100
That's the way everything lives and dies.

260
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,570
Oh, is that so, Seon Yeong?

261
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,840
You're quite sentimental today.

262
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,090
Should I call it the cycle of life?

263
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,070
Water evaporates and turns into clouds, rain, and the ocean.

264
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,510
A baby becomes a mom, then a grandma.

265
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,120
Then the grandma... dies.

266
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,620
Geez, let's talk about something else. Why do we have to die?

267
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,800
Thanks, girls.

268
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:39,050
Thanks for slowly flowing through my life instead of quickly passing by it.

269
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
That's so cool.

270
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,900
You're right.

271
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,120
Everything passes and flows by.

272
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,480
Humans die alone in the end.

273
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,930
They don't!

274
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,160
They don't?

275
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,310
When I die, I'm going to die with Guk.

276
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,970
I won't die alone.

277
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,510
We love each other so much.

278
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,980
Geez, what the heck?

279
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,650
You can leave the man you love by himself and die?

280
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,790
Probably.

281
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,750
It's scary that we might die together.

282
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,480
Even if you don't die together, you'll end up meeting after death.

283
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,650
The belief that we'll meet in heaven or the afterlife is the most terrifying to me.

284
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,460
Why? It's so beautiful.

285
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,400
You're a bad child, aren't you?

286
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,990
Are you telling someone who died of anger over a cheating spouse

287
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,660
to meet the cheater in the afterlife?

288
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,010
Is heaven a place where the ex-wife meets the mistress?

289
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,270
All the cheaters will go to hell.

290
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,300
Adulterers don't go to the heaven you're in.

291
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,900
You're serious, right? Adulterers will all just go to hell, right?

292
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,830
Yeah!

293
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,970
But what if they repent before they die and go to heaven instead?

294
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,890
You think they'll be in the right mind to repent when they're busy cheating?

295
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,310
We're all going to hell.

296
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:02,860
Some people might be better suited to hell than boring heaven, no?

297
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,890
'Tis a bunch of bullshit.

298
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,500
- Jokbal!
- Gopchang! 
  (braised pigfoot and grilled beef intestines)

299
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,430
Pizza, chicken, tteokbokki.

300
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,980
Nice! Order everything!

301
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,350
 SD Savings Bank

302
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,710
I've only seen him in an online article.

303
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,570
Go to the homepage and rewatch the visual radio.

304
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,030
In the video, even his voice is stunning.

305
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,060
He comes out as the live panel each week.

306
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,420
I don't know. Tomorrow?

307
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,190
How about you?

308
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,330
Yeah.

309
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,670
Were you very busy?

310
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,130
When have you been here before?

311
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,620
I met many new people thanks to Yun So.

312
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,320
Yun So's like my manager these days.

313
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,730
Everyone asks to meet in places like this, so I've been here.

314
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,130
So, what kind of person did you come here with?

315
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,590
An investor for my next movie.

316
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,060
They said there are no lowly people here.

317
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,120
It's nice. No one recognizes me.

318
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,680
I was worried.

319
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,770
Since you wouldn't pick up, and I can't leave any texts.

320
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,960
I don't know where you live, either.

321
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,150
Why couldn't I reach you?

322
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,550
I thought maybe we shouldn't speak.

323
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,910
What are you saying?

324
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,630
 It's dripping!

325
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,300
Congratulations on getting an investment.

326
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,680
I would've prepared a gift had I known before coming here.

327
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,840
 It's all right.

328
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,420
 I'm doing my favorite thing in the world right now.

329
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
Can you move that mirror?

330
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,990
Excuse me?

331
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,220
Or could you at least pull the blinds down?

332
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,860
Then it'll be too dark.

333
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,530
We use natural lighting during the day.

334
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,200
Can't you just turn on the lights?

335
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,510
Let's move somewhere else if you're uncomfortable.

336
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,290
Isn't the service included in our bill?

337
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,090
I used to have a scar here and I'm currently removing it with laser treatment.

338
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,300
I understand. I'm sorry.

339
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,710
The lighting is nice here.

340
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,860
Is it from Italy?

341
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,780
Europe doesn't use bright lights for indoor lighting like we do here.

342
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,640
You used to like places with lots of people.

343
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,160
I've only been interviewed a couple of times, but a lot of people recognize me.

344
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,490
What's the reason... I couldn't reach you for two months?

345
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,410
I think...

346
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,000
I just wanted to talk in person.

347
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,880
I still slept in your writing office on the weekends.

348
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,070
I didn't know.

349
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:42,530
Then you haven't... been to the writing office since you came back?

350
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,990
I couldn't go since I've been living out of my work studio for my next movie.

351
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,020
I'm sorry.

352
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,880
Did you eat anything after school?

353
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,080
You're not hungry?

354
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,200
You must have a lot of money.

355
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,850
Huh?

356
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,390
They emptied the place so we could shop alone.

357
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,720
It's nothing much. It's just a VIP service.

358
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,880
You're cool.

359
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,360
I'm cool?

360
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
You're cool.

361
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,720
There's something I want.

362
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,440
What is it?

363
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,240
Buy everything you want.

364
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,070
Not this brand.

365
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,870
The Misaire over there.

366
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,060
Already? You know Misaire?

367
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,700
My daughter's all grown up.

368
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,220
I can't?

369
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,750
I told her to wake me up so I could make her breakfast.

370
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,230
 Mom, good luck with your live broadcast.

371
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,390
 It's not new, so it'll seem more like you bought it with your own money.

372
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,120
 Ms. Ryu Ga Eul gave it to me to earn brownie points from me.

373
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,250
Does she know how expensive this is?

374
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,610
She took this from her?

375
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,220
- Assistant Manager Na.
- I knew all along.

376
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,900
About you stealing money.

377
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,830
 You can start with this seat.

378
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,910
Which is why I suggested we audit your seat first,

379
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,070
so I could buy you time to run away.

380
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,620
Audit me first?

381
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:13,340
Because you're the only person who'd come up clean after the audit team's inspection.

382
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,000
What's your reason for suddenly seeking me out and telling me this?

383
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,250
Do you know where Ru Ri is?

384
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,200
Ru Ri knows where you live.

385
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,950
I know it's a long shot, but has she never gone to meet you?

386
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,960
No.

387
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:45,040
But how did you find out what Ru Ri did?

388
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:52,630
I found it strange that she was carrying around her toiletry pouch all month long.

389
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,890
 So I kept an eye on her.

390
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,590
 You!

391
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,230
 What did you just take out from the drawer?

392
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,760
 Hand it over.

393
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,940
 A pouch for feminine products.

394
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,510
 Sorry.

395
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,390
 Oh, my stomach.

396
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:15,030
 I could tell after a lengthy observation.

397
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,080
After each time, she would show up with something new.

398
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,170
I thought it was menstrual syndrome-induced kleptomania at first.

399
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,590
But it seemed she kept stealing mutilated currency.

400
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,100
Don't touch me.

401
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,030
I'm dirty.

402
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,640
What?

403
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,040
It's all right.

404
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,360
I'm the only one who knows.

405
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,560
Talk to me.

406
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,580
I'll help you.

407
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,030
I just want to help you. Since it's still only a small amount—

408
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,160
Small amount?

409
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,860
What do you know?

410
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,180
Isn't it still money?

411
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,390
Ru Ri, we can still make things right.

412
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,770
I'll help you!

413
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,220
One month?

414
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,990
One year?

415
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,030
For how long?

416
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,970
You'll help me?

417
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,150
Who can you help, Eonni, when your own life is pitch dark?

418
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:33,670
Eonni, you said you couldn't even take responsibility for your own life!

419
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,380
How will you help? Tell me specifically. How?

420
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,140
You want to pray and repent or something?

421
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,380
So, Ru Ri resigned?

422
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:57,030
She used her long-term vacation, but she still hasn't come back to work afterward.

423
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,880
I think she'll be fired.

424
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,810
You seem to worry a lot about her.

425
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:14,140
Ru Ri grew up in an orphanage

426
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,810
and joined this company while in high school, like I did.

427
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,750
She lived industriously.

428
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,300
But she's different from me.

429
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,280
She studied hard and majored in fashion through night college classes

430
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,630
but she couldn't change jobs.

431
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,600
Her resumé was never chosen.

432
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:44,100
That field highly considers family background.

433
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,700
And having studied abroad is necessary.

434
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,550
I should go.

435
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,220
Maybe it's the change of season.

436
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,460
I came out of the blue and asked you all sorts of questions.

437
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,430
I'm just so worried...

438
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,820
and anxious.

439
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,590
I can't find her, and there's no one to ask.

440
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,750
It's so frustrating.

441
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,170
I'm sorry. I'll go now.

442
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,530
Assistant Manager Na.

443
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,040
Why do you look the other way

444
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,590
when you know what Ru Ri did?

445
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,590
Why?

446
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,900
Why?

447
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,080
Mutilated currency...

448
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,580
will be burned anyway.

449
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,350
Ru Ri shouldn't...

450
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:05,530
get burned because of that money, either.

451
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:12,480
The mutilated currency will disappear from the world anyway.

452
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,860
Ru Ri is more important.

453
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,790
That money... has a place to go.

454
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,450
Ru Ri doesn't have ...

455
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,980
anywhere to go.

456
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,870
I consider her unlucky.

457
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,010
What branch has so many mutilated currency notes?

458
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,560
If only we didn't do business with the Homeless Center.

459
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:46,270
I also often thought about it while handling bills that

460
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,950
could've been used a few more times.

461
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,670
"I could buy dinner with this one bill."  Thoughts like that.

462
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,960
They say sins committed in the heart are also sins.

463
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,400
I'll go now.

464
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,610
Assistant Manager Na.

465
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,580
Goodbye.

466
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,620
This is why I like you, Ms. Yu Yi Hwa.

467
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,700
Where's the harm in skipping a farewell?

468
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,540
You're incredible.

469
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,350
Buy me something delicious... when you get your bonus.

470
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,060
 Autumn socks. Artificial tears.

471
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,360
 Micro mini bag. Chanel No. 7 perfume.

472
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,660
Get up. Get up, bastard.

473
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,710
Tell me!

474
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,600
Get up.

475
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,460
That little ...

476
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,380
No?

477
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,170
Hey!

478
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,920
Get up, you bastard.

479
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,830
Come here!

480
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,010
Are you all right?

481
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,170
Are you crazy?

482
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,060
Tae Mi's mom.

483
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,500
You should tend to me. I'm Tae Mi's dad!

484
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,800
Your car keys are upstairs, right?

485
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,280
Take my car to the hospital. Go straight to the dentist to take X-rays.

486
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,600
Your teeth might be cracked.

487
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,740
I know from experience.

488
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,520
He hit you?

489
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,600
Is that why you divorced him?

490
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,880
He's my mentee.

491
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,360
What?

492
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,260
Seong Si Hun is my mentee.

493
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,720
I met him in the taekwondo club.

494
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,380
Ryu Ga Eul, did you sleep with him?

495
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,600
Did you sleep with this son of a bitch?

496
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,680
Tae Mi's mom.

497
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,090
How could you sleep with some other bastard?

498
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,330
Hey!

499
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,670
I gave my thirties to you!

500
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,250
I gave my youth to you!

501
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:56,360
The fact that you slept with another man means my youth slept with another man!

502
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,110
Don't yell at her.

503
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,620
Let's go.

504
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:26,510
That bastard ... is married.

505
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,120
He's a complete asshole, Ryu Ga Eul!

506
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,040
You...

507
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,370
You shouldn't be defiled!

508
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,250
 Geum Seok Jin

509
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,320
I have nothing to say.

510
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,640
We lived for three months together after getting married.

511
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,200
Our marriage isn't even registered in Korea.

512
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:54,330
You didn't get a divorce and came to Korea by yourself during your separation?

513
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,620
There was a job she wanted

514
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:02,740
and she could only get hired with me as her husband, since I have a green card.

515
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,690
 She's settled down now.

516
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,520
I sent her divorce papers in January, but...

517
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,870
She wants to get back together, huh?

518
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,590
I—

519
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,800
I don't.

520
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,190
You've known me for the past few years, Ryu Ga Eul!

521
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,450
I only had eyes for you all this time!

522
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,050
Does that not make me an adulterer, then?

523
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,700
 Hey, Geum Seok Jin.

524
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,740
When you want a woman, you have to learn to respect her.

525
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,610
That comes first!

526
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,200
Love?

527
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,170
 Respect is more important than that.

528
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,370
Indulging yourself by saying your feelings for me are sincere ...

529
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,050
My reputation...

530
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,520
my moral chastity...

531
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,180
You've trampled on my standards of life! You got that?

532
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,830
That's right!

533
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,790
It's this young lady.

534
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,970
So, this is where you've been hiding.

535
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,910
It's been a while.

536
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,560
Did you know her before?

537
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,500
He's the Co-executive of my newly founded corporation,

538
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,090
so treat him as you would treat me.

539
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:07,550
Now that I stay at the hospital, I hate coming out. It's so comfortable there!

540
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:12,400
Everything is done for me with the ring of a bell.

541
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,850
It's paradise.

542
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:24,560
Chairman Park told me you expertly took care of his funds with a certificate of deposit.

543
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,960
You may confer with me from now on.

544
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,610
 SD Savings Bank, VIP Lounge

545
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,070
How...

546
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:45,430
How did I end up doing business with Chairman Park, the loan shark?

547
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:52,410
How did you end up ... doing business ...

548
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,620
with Chairman Park's grandson?

549
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,200
I'll hear your answer tomorrow at this time.

550
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,620
 Why? Did he intentionally break it to make this?

551
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,210
 Reviving is more exciting than creating.

552
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,390
 A broken bowl that couldn't even hold water gets reborn as a nice object by me.

553
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,600
 That's appealing to me.

554
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,030
 The clients are on their way in right now.

555
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,610
Clients?

556
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,070
Please terminate this.

557
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:18,700
This instant. The entire amount.

558
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,500
We can just transfer money to her corporation in the form of an investment.

559
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,350
Please close this account and transfer the amount to her corporate account.

560
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,710
You're talking about the entire amount, right?

561
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,970
Yes, the entire one billion.

562
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,390
You really want to transfer the entire one billion?

563
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,480
I don't recommend that.

564
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,020
You know this product also has a high-interest rate.

565
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,510
We thought about this for several months.

566
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,480
We'll transfer it.

567
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,980
How can we ignore it when we're aware of the higher interest rate?

568
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,580
I can't even fall asleep!

569
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,180
You may already be well aware,

570
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:07,780
but the product you all signed up for was a limited-time, VIP special sale product.

571
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,780
And it's an account under Professor Min's name.

572
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:16,170
Your money was deposited under borrowed names, so if you terminate it in full,

573
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,070
the National Tax Service can trace its previous use.

574
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,570
If you write down your individual accounts,

575
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:41,680
we'll terminate small amounts in order and divide them into each account.

576
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,540
Retrieve that amount

577
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,340
and invest it in a corporate bank account.

578
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:58,600
I'd prefer to do this than get caught by the National Tax Service.

579
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,950
What do you think?

580
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:04,460
Yes, if they ask us to reveal the source of the funds,

581
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,710
it'll become a headache with tax investigations and audits and whatnot.

582
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,700
You're right. That would be a headache.

583
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,650
- This sounds better.
 - I agree.

584
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:20,280
 Many people ask what the secret is to look like a young lady even after giving birth.

585
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,910
- My mom looks so pretty.
  - You all know this.

586
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,450
- Tae Mi!
- Hey, let's go.

587
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,090
- What are you buying us?
- What do you want to eat?

588
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,960
I'm hungry!

589
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,670
Where are you going? I want to join, too.

590
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:36,320
Don't you have other shoes?

591
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,850
She always wears these.

592
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,370
They're so comfortable. They don't stink my feet, either.

593
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:45,890
We're going to eat pasta at a hotel, but it's embarrassing.

594
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,430
What?

595
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,150
Why does that matter?

596
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,330
You're so full of it.

597
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,640
Hey!

598
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,060
Compensate me. Four hundred thousand won.

599
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,920
H-How much did you say?

600
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,540
Four hundred thousand won.

601
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,690
My mom bought this for me. Buy me a new one!

602
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:09,170
Unbelievable. "Mom"?

603
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,710
You lying bitch! You live with your stepmom.

604
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,630
Hey!

605
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,950
Oh, Tae Mi!

606
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,330
You have a scratch.

607
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,990
Are you all right?

608
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,990
Oh, no.

609
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:40,260
Tae Mi, did you hit her first?

610
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,950
I'm sorry, ma'am.

611
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,440
Why are you bowing your head?

612
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,400
Why are you apologizing?

613
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,540
- Tae Mi.
- Calling your stepmom "Mom."

614
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,480
What did you say?

615
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,010
What happened?

616
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,590
Tae Mi!

617
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,280
Are you all right?

618
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,890
Is it a crime to call a stepmom "Step-mom"?

619
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,790
An adult was pulling my child's hair.

620
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:26,550
She was pulling my baby's hair out, so of course I'd beat her up!

621
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,880
Should I have praised her and hugged her?

622
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,310
This is self-defense. Self-defense!

623
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,440
Stepmom?

624
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,030
Then what are you?

625
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,260
Are you her biological mom?

626
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,710
You beat someone up to that extent.

627
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,120
What an incredible biological mom you are.

628
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,550
Get your facts straight.

629
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:57,220
Throughout the entire 39 weeks of pregnancy,

630
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,210
she couldn't even swallow water due to morning sickness,

631
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:04,010
and had so many IVs that her blood vessels were shot.

632
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,850
Watching her daughter suffer from a high fever,

633
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:13,440
she cried all night in heartache and got a vocal cord nodule!

634
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,340
She even fainted at work from watching her daughter every night,

635
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,950
who would bleed from her corneas from merely coughing!

636
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,540
But what?

637
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,560
Who are you to be making a fuss?

638
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,350
Me?

639
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,730
I'm Tae Mi's aunt! So what?

640
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:50,050
I know better than anyone in this world what Seong Tae Mi's mom is like!

641
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,480
But what?

642
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,480
Mom.

643
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,760
Mom, stop crying.

644
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,000
What if you get sick? Get up. You'll get sick.

645
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,970
Tae Mi!

646
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,910
I'm sorry.

647
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:18,620
Stop crying. It's all right.

648
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,410
Hey, the dissemination of false information is a crime.

649
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,940
Why don't you end it here and just settle this?

650
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,390
 Stay still, Mom.

651
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:53,230
 You must have a fever.

652
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:56,400
 I'll bring some medicine and a cold towel.

653
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,610
Goodbye. Thank you.

654
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:22,780
Tae Mi, you should apply some ointment, too. All right?

655
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,530
Thanks.

656
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,540
Thank you ...

657
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,740
Tae Mi's mom.

658
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,620
I have something good.

659
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,000
Should we lighten the mood?

660
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,150
Huh?

661
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,690
You repaired this with Kintsugi.

662
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,090
How like you.

663
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,530
As expected of Yu Yi Hwa.

664
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,100
Fixing something that shattered.

665
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,880
What do you mean, shattered?

666
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,380
You didn't know?

667
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,340
Then what's this?

668
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:14,100
W-Well, Seon Yeong made a big deal after she broke this when she visited your house

669
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,380
and discreetly put it back into place.

670
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,240
What?

671
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:28,100
I was going to replace it with a new one, but it was a limited edition.

672
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,970
 I'll just gratefully accept your thought.

673
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,780
 I'll hear your answer tomorrow at this time.

674
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,200
 He probably thought I returned it without even knowing it was broken.

675
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,500
 He gave it back to me after repairing it?

676
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,800
 What does that mean?

677
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:36,040
Would it be possible to stop renting that house?

678
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,410
There's not much left of the deposit?

679
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,580
Fifty million?

680
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,780
 Ten million.

681
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,600
 The monthly lessee is Yun Min Jae, right?

682
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,600
 Actually, the rent wasn't being paid, and he kept taking from the deposit.

683
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,890
 So, the landlord was worried and wanted to terminate the contract.

684
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,330
 How convenient.

685
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:03,390
You're saying he didn't pay the rent all this time?

686
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,080
For how long?

687
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:17,540
Hello?

688
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,220
Yeah.

689
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,410
I'm a bit nervous.

690
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,520
 Merry Christmas

691
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,620
Good, please look at the camera. One, two, three.

692
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,590
Very good. One more time.

693
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,470
One, two, three. Very nice.

694
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,910
One more time. One, two, three.

695
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:13,900
Now, Director Yun can sit and Ms. Yun So can sit on the arm.

696
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,730
Yes, a bit more affectionately.

697
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,900
One, two, three. Okay!

698
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,630
I'm Yeon Ha Ra from Cinema Report, a signature entertainment news.

699
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,230
Today, we'll be interviewing Yun So, who's attempting a new character

700
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:31,980
and Director Yun Min Jae, who created that character. Hello.

701
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,220
Wow, you do pull many all-nighters.

702
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,940
How do you live like this?

703
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,180
You said you wanted to drink this, right?

704
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,020
Whoa, Director Yun!

705
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,730
You have a pretty high batting average these days.

706
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,870
I love it.

707
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,950
You want to come to my house?

708
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:58,890
Let's drink this together.

709
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,160
At your house?

710
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,970
Ga Deun and Dong Il are coming, too.

711
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:05,560
As you said, if I continue to live like this,

712
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,400
my friends will disappear, and so will my private life.

713
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,830
I should meet them when I have the time. There's no day and night for me.

714
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,630
I guess that's true.

715
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,890
It's not like you can drink comfortably outside.

716
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,260
Shall we, then?

717
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,010
You'll get used to it, too.

718
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,010
Hey, come sit down.

719
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,540
Why?

720
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,580
Aren't you going to take off the makeup?

721
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,180
Close your eyes.

722
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,420
 That day

723
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:09,570
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

724
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,560
 That day

725
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,010
What's this?

726
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:23,510
Me, too! Me, too!

727
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,280
Thank you!

728
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,950
- All right!
 - Hey, don't give Dong Il any.

729
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:31,810
- To us!
 - To us!

730
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:34,140
To us?

731
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,640
Me.

732
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,590
- Hey, good choice!
 - This is really good.

733
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,780
- Like this.
 - Hey, do you know how much that costs?

734
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,320
- Cheers!
 - Cheers!

735
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,320
Just like this!

736
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,700
 Merry Christmas 
To us!

737
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:55,120
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

738
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,200
 You can leave a message after ...

 Client Oh Suk Ja

 Client Oh Suk Ja

741
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,700
- You're still awake? 
 - Ms. Yu Yi Hwa

742
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,900
 - Save me!
  - Hello?

743
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,700
- Hello?
  - Please save me!

744
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,940
 I dare you to call the police.

745
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,530
 I'm going to kill these bitches!

746
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,190
Ms. Ru Ri.

747
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,680
Ms. Ru Ri!

748
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,140
-  Please save me. 
 - Can you hear me?

749
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,490
 Bring money!

750
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,980
 Bring whatever money you have!

751
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:40,500
 Please insert your card with the arrow facing forward.

752
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:48,270
 Currently counting the cash. Please wait a moment.

753
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,020
 Please take your cash.

754
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,950
 Thank you for using our service.

755
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:56,770
 It's not enough.

 Preview

760
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:56,130
 Transfer 400 million won before the weekend?

761
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:57,370
 How daring of you.

762
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:59,270
 Here's one billion won for now.

763
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,930
 The truth is uncomfortable yet easy.

764
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,840
 It was just an accident.

765
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:08,100
 There was nothing between us.

766
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:12,860
 Report complaints to civil servants and report bank employees for embezzlement?

767
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,430
 Bring me the 300 million won.

768
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:20,140
 I'm more than fine with everything thus far.
