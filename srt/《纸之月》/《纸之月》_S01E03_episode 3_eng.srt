00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,450
It's your left hand.

10
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,840
We can't.

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,610
We can't. I know.

12
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,080
I already talked to the other company. You don't have to worry, sir.

13
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,210
Yes, I got it.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,280
I'm sorry...

15
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,730
Good luck with the treatment.

 Episode 3  
 I told you to go to the gathering. Why did you come?

19
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,080
I still wanted to see you off. Thank you so much for paying for the dinner.

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,600
Thank you so much for paying for the dinner.

21
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,770
- The man with the brochure is the director, right? 
- Yes.

22
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,940
He's sexy. Is he your boyfriend?

23
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,350
Pardon? No.

24
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,990
Didn't you get to meet your friend?

25
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,660
It would've been nice if you saw the film together.

26
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,940
She has a mysterious aura about her.

27
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,590
You're observant. Hurry up and join the party!

28
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,440
Yes. Get home safely.

29
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,370
I must be crazy. What was I thinking?

30
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,910
Yu Yi Hwa.

31
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,370
 It wasn't the full moon.

32
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,520
Gosh, I'm tired.

33
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,470
 WAS AIRLINES LOUNGES

34
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,330
We're meeting with the subsidiary company at two.

35
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,130
- Should we have some coffee?
 - All right.

36
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,010
Have a seat, sir. Have a seat.

37
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,650
This is from the HQ in Greece...

38
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,150
- What would you like to have? Coffee?
 - Yes, coffee.

39
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,820
He's the eldest son of TK Group, right?

40
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,680
They look cool even though they aren't good-looking.

41
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,830
Have a look at this...

42
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,580
Should we have some coffee?

43
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,020
Coffee ... Should we have some coffee?

44
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,770
How many cups are you having?

45
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,860
Coffee. Coffee.

46
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,430
No, no, no.

47
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,690
Should we have some coffee?

48
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,100
Yes. Manager Choi, should we have some coffee?

49
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,650
That's it.

50
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,600
 Wear something flashy for the gathering.

51
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,860
The vice president's wife apparently likes colorful things. Keep that in mind.

52
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,490
 I'll go to the Vice President's house directly from the airport that day.

53
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,230
The Cheongdam store has your size. I'll go get it right now. Please wait a moment.

54
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,150
I'll go get it right now. Please wait a moment.

55
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,610
Let me guide you. Come this way.

56
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,930
Let me know if you feel uncomfortable.

57
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,700
I'm fine.

58
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,540
It's warm.

59
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,990
It suits you so well.

60
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,570
It must be for a special occasion. You look so beautiful.

61
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,830
It's the vice president.

62
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,190
This is such a nice place.

63
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,540
Oh, Honey.

64
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,020
Did you have a nice trip?

65
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,740
Yes.

66
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,260
Why do you look so thin today?

67
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,780
Did everything go well?

68
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,340
Of course. I was on top of it.

69
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,500
Madam.

70
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,290
Eonni, do you recognize me?

71
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,230
We used to play together as kids.

72
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,280
You don't remember, right?

73
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,470
That's why I brought this, just in case.

74
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,190
Here.

75
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,650
It was at Cheongmyeong Gallery's opening party, right?

76
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,580
Yes, yes, Eonni.

77
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,950
Is that why you wore this dress?

78
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,000
Because you remembered her?

79
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,550
- Well—
 - We met a few more times.

80
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,950
We couldn't stay in touch because I went to middle school in the US.

81
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,510
But you really haven't changed at all.

82
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,260
You were quiet when you were a kid, too.

83
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,190
Let's get together often while I'm in Korea, Eonni.

84
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,470
Promise me, all right?

85
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,590
Let's go in. The food must be ready.

86
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,040
Yes, Madam.

87
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,050
Let's go.

88
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,720
She complained about not having a friend to confide in. She's excited.

89
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,690
Yes, let's hurry inside.

90
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,760
Yes.

91
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,270
It's been decades.

92
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,420
It was my grandfather's favorite piece.

93
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,290
Don't say that you have a part-time job or anything like that.

94
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,610
I ground the ink for him when he worked on this piece.

95
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,790
He gave me 500 won every time to reward me.

96
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,950
You heard me, right? Huh?

97
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,350
Eonni.

98
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,250
Madam.

99
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,470
Why don't you stand in front of the painting like you did that day?

100
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,330
Let's take another one just like this.

101
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,960
Let's take it.

102
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,030
I told her  Department Head Choi is Artist Yu's grandson-in-law and she begged me to let her meet you.

103
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,930
and she begged me to let her meet you.

104
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,050
So I rushed to arrange a gathering.

105
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,230
I see. All right now.

106
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,300
 Playing with dolls.

107
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,500
- You should join us, Department Head Choi.
 - Should I?

108
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,200
- Take a picture of us, Deputy Je.
- Yes.

109
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,460
Looks like you're having fun.

110
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,410
We'll do this often from now on.

111
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,280
Just rely on me.

112
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,520
I'll take one now.

113
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,810
One, two, three.

114
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,040
Looks good.

115
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,000
Seon Yeong.

116
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,720
You came. The meal is ready now.

117
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,680
Yes.

118
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,910
- Did you have a nice trip?
 - Yes.

119
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,040
Should I help you with anything?

120
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,240
Thank you. She came early and helped with a lot of things.

121
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,640
By the way, you two look close.

122
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Yes, we've been friends since we were kids.

123
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,150
- Get home safely.
 - Thank you.

124
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,280
Did you have fun today?

125
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,870
Yes.

126
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,140
Oh, you should take these with you.

127
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,420
Well, these are...

128
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,790
This is all expensive stuff.

129
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,030
I know.

130
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,150
Those people should try good food, too.

131
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,690
We won't finish it and throw it away, anyway.

132
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,410
"Those people"?

133
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,520
I saw the video in the group chat.

134
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,400
You donate food to a food bank, right?

135
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,660
 We can't throw all this away. This would last us several days.

136
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,610
Take it with you. Otherwise, we have to throw it away.

137
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,990
It'd be a waste.

138
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,200
- Thank you.
 - I should thank you.

139
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,630
I invited you as a guest, but you helped prepare food, too.

140
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,760
Take care.

141
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,070
- Get home safely.
 - Thank you.

142
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,170
Did you have to go that far?

143
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:11,090
I know I won't get promoted as an executive but I make enough.

144
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,170
Why are you so thrifty?

145
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,630
If you relaxed a bit, people wouldn't mistake you like today.

146
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,170
Who cares about what others think?

147
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,480
Do they give us money or help us educate our child?

148
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,040
No, you're right. But you take it too far.

149
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,890
We can't spend all the money and eat anything we want.

150
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,410
Je In would be left alone after we die. We should leave her some money.

151
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,480
Why would she be left alone?

152
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,090
- Won't you marry her off?
 - I won't. I never will.

153
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,770
I'd be glad if we died. What if we lived to be 100?

154
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,900
If she marries an only son like I did, she'd be in financial hell.

155
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,860
All right. I'm sorry.

156
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,870
You said you were sick. Do that later.

157
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,980
What if one of us becomes bedridden when we get old?

158
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,980
How much will the hospital bill cost?

159
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,110
I'm sorry. Forgive me, Seon Yeong.

160
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,420
Both of our parents have their own houses.

161
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,310
And we'll end up inheriting both of them.

162
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,310
Will they be healthy without cancer, heart attack, or stroke?

163
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,970
They can't even cook because of joint problems.

164
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,870
Can you afford their hospital bills?

165
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,720
What if they get sick? Will they die right away?

166
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,290
What if they get hospitalized long-term?

167
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,120
What if they're healthy? What if they live to a 100 years old?

168
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,770
Do you know how much we spend on food per month?

169
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,070
Do you know how much we save if we spend less on food?

170
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,570
How much is left after we sell the houses and put them in nursing homes?

171
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,190
How much will there be?

172
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,700
Do you have a house in Gangnam? Do our parents live in Gangnam?

173
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,680
How much will they sell for now? How much will we pay in taxes?

174
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,800
But we're still upper-middle class.

175
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,150
Just look at the statistics, lady!

176
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,190
Should I repeat myself? Do you want to know why I'm so thrifty?

177
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,600
I can repeat it a hundred times.

178
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,030
I'm sorry...

179
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,820
Seon Yeong, I am wrong.

180
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,850
S-Seon Yeong, are you crying?

181
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,790
Yes.I'm so embarrassed.

182
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,460
I'm so embarrassed.

183
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,260
I can't go outside.

184
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,180
Don't cry. I'm sorry, Honey.

185
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,780
Crab.

186
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,090
Yes, yes. Gosh.

187
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,640
You said you were sick. You'll be exhausted if you cry like this, lady. Aigoo.

188
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,630
I must embarrass you. I'm sorry, Honey.

189
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,380
Honey, I have crab meat on me.

190
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,010
Madam.

191
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,000
You did a great job today.

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,770
Did Father really get rid of all of Grandfather's paintings?

193
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,280
They should've kept them, even though they struggled.

194
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,410
If he left a few pieces, they would've come in handy.

195
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,950
It's such a shame.

196
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,110
Honey.

197
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,760
Could you pull down my zipper?

198
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,900
Do you...

199
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,290
know anyone else like her?

200
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,550
Grandfather knew a lot of politicians and businessmen.

201
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,630
You got a nice dress, too. It was a good investment.

202
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,880
The higher the risk, the higher the return.

203
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,930
I'm sure we'll get something in return.

204
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,390
 Ambidextrous?

205
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,700
 Even though I can use my left hand, if I only use my right hand in front of people,

206
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,430
 does that make me right-handed?

207
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,880
 Which hand do you prefer?

208
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,010
 Live as you wish.

209
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,790
 You can't turn back life.

210
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,600
What are you doing? You're acting like an uneducated person.

211
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,530
You can't do this while you're out.

212
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,890
I'll stop.

213
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,430
Yes. It would've been bad if you did this yesterday.

214
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,550
Do you go to the company's family gatherings, too?

215
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,750
Only when I accompany you as your wife.

216
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,070
Then, you must not know about Ms. Seon Yeong's group chat incident.

217
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,300
Incident? Did something happen to her?

218
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,140
 There are environmental issues

219
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,980
 They're vinyl bags used in the kitchen...

220
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,510
 How could you waste all this?

221
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,700
 They're vinyl bags used in the kitchen.

222
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,470
 There are environmental issues, and we should decrease trash.

223
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,110
 How could you throw all this away? It's such a waste!

224
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,400

225
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,910
 I like paper bags.

226
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,130

227
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,700
 Eonni Yi Hwa

228
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,570
I posted it just now, Eonni.

229
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,060
 They're vinyl bags used in the kitchen.

230
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,050
 There are environmental issues, and we should decrease trash.

231
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,340
Thank you, Ms. Se Ju.  Don't tell Seon Yeong that I asked you.

232
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,620
You're worried she'd get embarrassed?

233
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,420
I'm jealous of your friendship.

234
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm her friend, you know.

235
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,950
 SD Savings Bank

236
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,340
- M.E.L.?
 - My ecological life.

237
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,860
She sells ecological food containers through crowdfunding. I got one, too.

238
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,340
You're so rich.

239
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,320
What's crowdfunding, by the way?

240
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,430
It's like selling things on social media.

241
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,950
This woman has 200,000 followers.

242
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,830
200,000?

243
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,010
Is she a celebrity?

244
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,790
The owner of the account has 200,000 followers

245
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,700
and the woman in the video is an élite eco lady.

246
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,350
She suddenly became famous because the owner of this account shared the video.

247
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,200
But I guess she doesn't have her own account.

248
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
Her outfit costs 10 million won.

249
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,060
She's from an élite family, but she collects leftovers in plastic bags.

250
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,600
 SD Savings Bank

251
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,600
 Welcome.

252
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
You only withdraw these days.

253
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,940
I guess you don't have many VIP customers depositing.

254
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,400
It's 1.1 million won.

255
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,050
Give me 100,000 won more in 10,000 won bills.

256
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,420
There's no vault cash.

257
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,340
You've been looking at your phone since this morning. Get it together!

258
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,850
Yes.

259
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,620
Come this way.

260
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,620
 Welcome.

261
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,010
You got it right on the first try.

262
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,850
Hold on.

263
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,850
It's a counterfeit.

264
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,100
Can you tell by just touching it?

265
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,320
I've been doing this forever.

266
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,900
I've been working here since I was in 12th grade.

267
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,140
We store...

268
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,200
counterfeits separately.

269
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,030
Gosh, do I need to get it fixed again?

270
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,130
I think it will open if I force it.

271
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,110
They should've dug the ground instead of wasting time making fake bills.

272
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,060
Please have a look.
  Time Deposit. Up to 3.0% per year.

273
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,310
- Please stop by sometime.
 - Yes.

274
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,270
Hello.

275
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,840
Go away. I smell.

276
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,170
By chance, are you wearing a colostomy bag?

277
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,400
How did you know?

278
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,650
It's always like that, even if you manage it well.

279
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,440
My father was the same.

280
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,700
Your father?

281
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,000
Where do you live? I'll walk you home.

282
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,110
Close your eyes.

283
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,150
You should dry your hair quickly so you don't catch a cold.

284
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,700
Isn't it too hot?

285
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,910
Your daughter will be here soon.

286
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,560
I don't know how to thank you enough.

287
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,720
 Yu Yi Hwa

288
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,130
I couldn't do the laundry because I ran out of detergent.

289
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,150
You're so sweet.

290
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,560
Here. It's the amount you asked for.

291
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,140
Put it in a black plastic bag and put it in the freezer.

292
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,330
Bury it with the groceries you got.

293
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,380
All right.

294
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,100
I did grocery shopping with money in your account, and here's the rest of it.

295
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,980
Do you collect coins separately?

296
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,590
I'll give it to you as a tip. Keep it.

297
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,500
Collect them in here, and when it gets full,

298
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,560
I'll exchange them for bills for you.

299
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,250
The three-year term expired six months ago.

300
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,340
I found it inside the blanket cover.

301
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,200
How much is it?

302
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,650
It's 101 million and 50,000 won.

303
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,060
You kept the interest, too.

304
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,790
- Do you want me to redeposit it? 
 - Take out 30 million won today

305
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,160
and time-deposit the rest.

306
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,040
Today?

307
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,800
Should I take it out as a check?

308
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,220
All of it in cash.

309
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,400
But why do you always wear the same clothes?

310
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,100
You have to look good to make a lot of money.

311
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:20,180
Some women say spending money on clothes is pointless since they'll come off fast,

312
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,160
but I disagree.

313
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,800
My place is on a different level.

314
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,200
Please sign to confirm that you received the money.

315
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,600
This is the new two-year term plan you're signing up for—

316
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,130
Doesn't the five-year one have a better interest rate?

317
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,040
It's not that much more. Rather than signing up for a long-term plan

318
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,810
and forgetting about it again— 
 - No.

319
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,940
Even if it gets me 1,000 won more, I prefer that. I want the five-year one.

320
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,560
Sure.

321
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,300
The girls from other places ended up with nothing,

322
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:06,750
but the ones who worked with me got an apartment with a full-term lease.

323
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,450
I'm sure a lot of them made money off it and bought a house.

324
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,960
 No parking allowed

325
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,610
All sorts of things happen, right?

326
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,430
How come you never complain?

327
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,890
I know it feels uncomfortable to work for VIPs in the uniform.

328
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:57,010
Feel free to wear normal clothes. But wear the name tag, still.

329
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,600
- Yes.
 - How about lunch?

330
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,500
Are you having it with a VIP?

331
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,800
 The accident victims' meeting.

332
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,460
 1-2, Seonmu area, Shin Joongang Station.

333
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,460
♫  I don't care if it's a lie  ♫

334
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,360
♫  everything will disappear  ♫

335
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,640
♫  Even if it's buried in a place where no one is  ♫

336
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:46,500
♫  The words "it's precious", those words  ♫

337
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:55,090
♫  I'll find the lost soul in you  ♫

338
00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:00,940
♫  Oh, I remember  ♫

339
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,240
I hope the next stop is 100 years away.

340
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,460
♫  To that place where the cosmos blooms far away  ♫

341
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,440
Have you been well?

342
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,630
Have you been well?

343
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:18,030
No, the treatment didn't go so well.

344
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,100
The injury was more serious than expected.

345
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:37,660
♫  I will dream  ♫

346
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,330
♫  In our time which stopped  ♫

347
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:53,550
♫  Even if it remains as a tiny dot  ♫

348
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:59,520
♫  The disappearance of traces of me, the memory gone  ♫

349
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,000
Hello.

350
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,110
I'm Deputy Cha, whom you talked to on the phone.

351
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,790
As I said, Ms. Yu isn't here since she's working outside the office.

352
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,200
Why is he looking for her?

353
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,850
I think she caused trouble.

354
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,860
He kept looking for her over the phone.

355
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,860
And he asked for her personal phone number, so I said I was not allowed to tell him.

356
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,000
Now he's here to talk to Deputy Cha.

357
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,250
But he's not our customer.

358
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,210
He's not Ms. Yu's client?

359
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,100
Here.

360
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,900
Najeonchilgi.*
 (Korean lacquerware with mother-of-pearl decoration)

361
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,600
They look valuable.

362
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,540
I just accepted them because they're from a friend's aunt.

363
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,430
- They're made for a couple.
- No.

364
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,440
One is for the right-handed, and the other is for the left-handed.

365
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,520
Because you might want to use both hands.

366
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,230
Let's eat together.

367
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,600
I prefer modern stuff.

368
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,660
Your lunch break is about to end.

369
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,340
Here.

370
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,750
It's tasty.

371
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,350
- Did you prepare this yourself? 
 - Prepare?

372
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,630
It's my dad's recipe.

373
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,290
He just made two soups when I was a kid.

374
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,550
It was miyeokguk* and this.
  (Seaweed soup)

375
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,600
It's like my comfort food.

376
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,300
You said your father is at a nursing home, right?

377
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,170
Thank you.

378
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,330
Pardon?

379
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,360
I love being together like this.

380
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,900
If I were alone, I would've been looking for a job, comparing hourly pay.

381
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,910
Because private loan interests double overnight.

382
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,420
Did you get a private loan?

383
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,930
 So now you're just working on the script instead of working?

384
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
 Yes, I want to focus on it.

385
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,000
Hello.

386
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,500
Hello.

387
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,500
Have a seat here.

388
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,130
Excuse me.

389
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,920
It's all right.

390
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,780
 Here's an announcement. On the busy train...

391
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,800
You didn't get to meet her that day, right?

392
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,580
The team leader stopped by and left.

393
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,300
- I'm sorry.
- No, not at all.

394
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,210
 This stop is Hwadong. Hwadong Station.

395
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,520
 The doors open on the right.

396
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,170
 This stop is Hwadong. Hwadong.

397
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,170
 - Here. 
 - Najeonchilgi.

398
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,860
 I just accepted them because they're from a friend's aunt.

399
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,790
- It's faster to get off at this station. You're going to the office, right? 
 - Yes.

400
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,460
Get off at exit No. 3, turn left, cross the street, and you'll get there.

401
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,120
There was a shortcut. I didn't know.

402
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,280
Thank you.

403
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,060
 The doors are opening.

404
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,020
I'll see you next time, then.

405
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,980
Sure.

406
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,780
 The doors are open.

407
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,790
Thank you.

408
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,350
Gosh, looks so tasty.

409
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,780
It's better to put the light here. It makes the room look bigger.

410
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,600
It feels like something's missing.

411
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,670
Hold on a second.

412
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,080
Okay.

413
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,930
It's so cute.

414
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,080
You're so girly.

415
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,670
- Let's eat quickly. The food is getting cold. 
 - Eonni,

416
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,720
what's your secret?

417
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,550
I put soda in the boiled soy sauce,

418
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,900
and added garlic, ginger—

419
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,280
Yuzu.

420
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,650
Huh?

421
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,900
Cook licorice and yuzu in the soy sauce and...

422
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,730
- What's this?
- It's a black tea.

423
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,510
It's trendy these days because the CEO of AF Department Store posted it on social media.

424
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,340
Is it expensive? How much does this cost?

425
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,330
You always ask how much things are.

426
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,460
I dodged being humiliated, thanks to you, Ms. Se Ju.

427
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,210
How did you know, by the way? It was on the staff group chat.

428
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,540
I heard it from a nurse.

429
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,000
She apparently saw Shi Eun's patients watching the video.

430
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,980
I guess she works at the company.

431
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,930
She recognized your face and told me.

432
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,700
Thanks to your video, I was commissioned to promote something on social media.

433
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,180
I'll treat you to a meal if it works out.

434
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,190
By the way, does Tae Mi's dad still play tennis these days?

435
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,970
He even skips lunch appointments twice a week.

436
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,500
During the day? Twice a week?

437
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,130
How about in the evening, then?

438
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,910
In the evening, he goes almost every day to stop by the sauna, too.

439
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,320
He's a member of the hotel tennis court.

440
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,710
A hotel member.

441
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,730
He must take a shower there every day, then.

442
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,590
Why do you ask, Eonni?

443
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,920
Are you worried he'd cheat on me?

444
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,070
Aren't you worried?

445
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,980
He's devoted to me, almost every night.

446
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,260
He's in his 40s. How could he do more than that?

447
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,570
Gosh, you're making me blush.

448
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,750
And during the day,

449
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,580
he plays tennis, too?

450
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,850
He gets a lot of male patients at the dermatology clinic, too.

451
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:54,470
He doesn't go to the hotel tennis court for no reason. It's for his business.

452
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,730
He started going there because I suggested it.

453
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,790
I see...

454
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:22,740
Assistant Manager, I never got to call you back. I'm sorry.

455
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,440
Ms. Yu Yi Hwa, you almost caused serious trouble.

456
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,800
Do you handle several 100 million won

457
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,900
just like that?

458
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,900
How come every client you meet

459
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,500
deposits 200 or 300 million won with you?

460
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:47,280
Your client's son came by and said you did things that even he finds tough to do.

461
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,300
He wanted me to give you this.

462
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,560
It's pretty hefty.

463
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,900
Wow...

464
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,130
If you raise 200 million more next month,

465
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,930
your incentive will be more than your monthly salary.

466
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,680
Her track record is on a godly level.

467
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,490
She even changes a client's diaper.

468
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,220
She must've looked for opportunities by going to townhouses.

469
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,410
She did.

470
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,540
How come every old lady she meets deposits 200 or 300 million won regularly?

471
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,280
There's something strange about that woman.

472
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,110
I'll give you a vacation as a reward.

473
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:23,400
Rest several days more after the coming holiday.

474
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,330
You can take a trip abroad, too.

475
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,640
Thank you.

476
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,030
She might even get an inheritance from an elderly living alone.

477
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,400
That's a bit too far-reaching.

478
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,800
They say if coincidences keep repeating, it's a scam.

479
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,360
What are you doing? You receive gifts instead of giving them away.

480
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,090
I thought it was Korean beef ribs.

481
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,110
They're VIPs for a reason.

482
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,170
They want you to exchange it if you don't like it.

483
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,020
How much does it cost?

484
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,940
 Total: 1,100,000 won

485
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,080
Welcome.

486
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:23,140
 Customer No. 8, come to the desk No. 3.

487
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,360
Should I make you something with the groceries I got this morning?

488
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,000
You'd create trash.

489
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,820
I just eat like this and throw away the containers.

490
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,160
I don't even do the dishes.

491
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,570
It's all right.

492
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,750
Just wait a moment.

493
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,800
It's the amount I told you this morning, right?

494
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,610
Yes.

495
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,580
It's 30 million won in 50,000 won bills.

496
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,650
You never get it wrong. It's exactly that.

497
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,310
It's a myeongran* stew. 
 *(pollock roe)

498
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,530
I used to eat this a lot when I had a business.

499
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,410
Eat slowly!

500
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,530
Be good to your in-laws.

501
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,710
Just live with your mouth shut!

502
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,750
I'm your mom, but I'm sorry I couldn't get you more for your dowry.

503
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,570
You know how many daughters I have.

504
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,360
You earned that money like a dog.

505
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,750
Bite it and don't let go, like a dog.

506
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,390
Please sign the receipt!

507
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,650
I bought something that's worth 30 million won.

508
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,630
I'll show it to you later.

509
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,600
Women have to be pretty.

510
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,890
You're not supposed to smile like that.

511
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,450
You're supposed to just hint at it like this.

512
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,780
You sell your body, and you don't even know how to smile.

513
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,850
Don't even try to run away!

514
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:21,260
It'd only take me three days to find you, bitch!

515
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:32,110
I had you come over, and I totally forgot.

516
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,280
Please deposit this into my account.

517
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,240
It's pocket money I got from my daughter.

518
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,810
 Because private loan interests double overnight.

519
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,290
 You sell your body, and you don't even know how to smile.

520
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,710
Ms. Yu, I heard you got into a car accident.

521
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,740
I...

522
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,070
actually...

523
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,080
What happened?

524
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,790
Did you get hurt?

525
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,710
It's all right.

526
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,970
It's all right, I said.

527
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,700
 SD Savings Bank

528
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,790
Claim the repair bill when you get it. The bank will pay for it.

529
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,190
Eonni, do you have 5,000 won?

530
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,740
- Is it not balancing out?
- How nice.

531
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,760
- I don't have cash.
- You get a vacation reward.

532
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,420
I checked three times.

533
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,960
You don't have any review requests, right? Right?

534
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,260
Enjoy the long holiday, then.

535
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,440
Yes sir! Have a nice weekend!

536
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,300
Bye.

537
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,580
 No.

538
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:21,080
 Oh Suk Ja

539
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,200
I scared you, didn't I?

540
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,600
Where have you been rolling around that your shirt is all wrinkled?

541
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,480
Your branch must've started working overtime.

542
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,040
Come on in.

543
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,570
Please call the branch.

544
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,130
You met him again, didn't you? That son of a bitch.

545
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,980
- What do you mean—
- You said you know how to contact him.

546
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,470
Go tell him.

547
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:11,500
The interest will go up to 40% starting next month.

548
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,660
You gave your grandson a private loan?

549
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,790
He's still a student.

550
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:28,690
It seems like he borrowed money from the man who used to work for me.

551
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:33,530
He got the loan without collateral, just because he's my grandson.

552
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:36,760
He's now asking me to pay off his debt.

553
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,300
Since I've been making payments, I can raise the interest rate all I want.

554
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,010
Go and tell him.

555
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:48,020
The interest rate is 40%.

556
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:55,130
If he doesn't send the interest money, I'll send a collection agent to his place.

557
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,230
Your grandson has a father who's in a nursing home—

558
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,100
Look at this!

559
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,620
You're close enough to know that?

560
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:08,820
Your grandson... is struggling a lot.

561
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,760
So?

562
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,620
You think I won't get my money back?

563
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,520
I don't give out loans based on the collateral.

564
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,030
I do it because I know I will be repaid.

565
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,750
All of his four limbs are intact.

566
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,700
His eyes are healthy, too.

567
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:36,410
Tons of people would pay money for them.

568
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:56,100
I didn't realize it got so late.

569
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,140
You're eating a burger. Should I make you dinner?

570
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,330
It's all right.

571
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:05,210
The vice president was right. It's not too bad.

572
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,670
He apparently likes artisan burgers.

573
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,820
Honey.

574
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,960
Where's your wedding ring?

575
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:23,100
I took it off because my fingers got puffy.

576
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,910
Did you put our mobile somewhere?

577
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,840
You haven't said anything all this time.

578
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,140
I heard from the vice president's wife.

579
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,600
It's not good to keep objects that sway in the house.

580
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:47,280
I guess you talk to her sometimes.

581
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,440
Good work.

582
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,090
You're doing a great job.

583
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:55,100
-Would you like some juice?
- No, no, it's all right.

584
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,820
You must be tired from working your job.

585
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:10,820
Honey.

586
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,000
The zipper looked too stiff.

587
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:22,450
I noticed at the airport that a lot of people carry purses without zippers.

588
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,500
I'll get you one from my next business trip.

589
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,070
You should start replacing things here and there.

590
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:33,150
You'll be hanging out with different kinds of people now.

591
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,360
Give me the juice.

592
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:04,370
 I don't give loans based on the collateral.

593
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:08,210
 I do it because I know I will be repaid.

594
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:11,300
 All of his four limbs are intact.

595
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,340
 His eyes are healthy, too.

596
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,820
 Tons of people would pay money for them.

597
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:49,390
 Oh Suk Ja - 30 million

598
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,370
Ma'am, would you like to try them out?

599
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,610
I'll have everything from here to here.

600
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:25,360
I'll pay in a lump sum.

601
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,820
All of these?

602
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,450
Yes.

603
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,590
You have to wait two years if you don't get it this week.

604
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:42,170
Would you like to be on the waiting list?

605
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:47,830
I'll just get the wallet today. How much is it?

606
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,760
It will be 1 million and 571,000 won.

607
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,110
- I'll pay in a lump sum.
- Yes, madam.

608
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,900
Do you need more than this to pay off your private loan?

609
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,620
I didn't tell you about my situation to borrow money.

610
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,220
I'll just take 3%.

611
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,570
I was going to use this on that purse earlier.

612
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:35,480
I get a discount if I pay in cash.

613
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:45,220
I was just thinking of shopping, but I think it'd be

614
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,440
better to spend the money this way.

615
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,530
- To a foreign country? 
 - Yes.

616
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,610
They'll announce the expatriate employee after this business trip.

617
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:14,840
If I work overseas for two years, I'd be guaranteed an executive promotion.

618
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,850
Just as I thought, it was high-risk, high-return.

619
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:24,490
The executive director said the vice president recommended me strongly.

620
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:26,800
You should prepare for it, too.

621
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,170
That's just your plan.

622
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:39,220
Even if you get promoted, I want to keep working.

623
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:43,580
I'm getting good results, too.

624
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,950
If you're selected as an expatriate employee officially,

625
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,080
let's discuss it then.

626
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:03,040
Gosh, what are you doing? Why are you doing this at my shop?

627
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,140
Min Jae! Min Jae! Min Jae!

628
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,020
They really are healthy.

629
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,400
Those are pretty corneas.

630
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,480
- It'd cost quite a bit.
- I'll pay him. I'll pay him, I said!

631
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,280
I know. I know.

632
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,810
You wouldn't be human if you didn't pay after all this.

633
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:35,250
Anyway, do you want to borrow the money to compensate for this bar?

634
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,560
Their business got ruined because of you.

635
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,910
The interest rate went up because your payments were late a lot.

636
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,650
The monthly rate will go up to 40% starting today.

637
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,180
 Closed temporarily due to personal reasons

638
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,740
 Did you feel offended?

639
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,940
I don't need that money.

640
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:55,320
You did that on purpose, right?

641
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,770
I appreciate the suggestion.

642
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:04,050
I really appreciate it, but could you ask me some kind of favor?

643
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:08,660
If there's anything I can do for borrowing that money,

644
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,950
feel free to ask me.

645
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,650
I need to ask you a favor. Can we meet?

646
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,460
 There's something I want you to do for me.

647
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,790
 I'll wait in front of the department store.

648
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:36,270
 You can find me, right?

649
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,800
♫  I entered the darkness  ♫

650
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:56,660
♫  And walked endlessly  ♫

651
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:07,810
♫  I entered the rain  ♫

652
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:19,220
♫  and kept walking  ♫

653
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:30,260
♫  Only on Sunday afternoon  ♫

654
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:41,270
♫  it rained beautifully  ♫

655
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:53,040
♫  Only on Sunday afternoon  ♫

656
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,040
♫  A gentile night fell  ♫

657
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,790
It's dripping.

658
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,210
It's all right.

659
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:31,780
I'm doing my favorite thing in the world right now.

660
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,380
What favor did you want to ask me?

661
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:55,540
Please finish a script in a week.

662
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,690
I'll invest in it.

663
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,430
Is it for two people?

664
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,750
Just one person.

665
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,630
Is staying long-term possible?

666
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,460
Yes, Ms. Na.

667
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:05,280
 Where are you right now?

668
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,760
 Come to the bank immediately!

669
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,820
 I got caught.

670
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,990
What's all this?

671
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,420
Hey, you came.

672
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:14,990

673
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:26,570
 Pale Moon 
 Preview

674
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,600
 Whenever one's sales go up suddenly,

675
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,100
 or they suddenly start spending money, something always goes wrong.

676
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,590
 Not just 10 or 20 million, but 100 million?

677
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,300
 Several 100 million?

678
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,910
 How about you, Yi Hwa?

679
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:39,240
 Was it like his teenage first love or something?

680
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,530
 I wanted to see you from the start.

681
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:44,780
 It's best to stay where you are, Yi Hwa.

682
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,420
 How much will it be?

683
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,520
 How much do you want?

684
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:52,240
 This money is for protecting you.
