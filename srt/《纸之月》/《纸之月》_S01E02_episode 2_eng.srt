 Welcome.

 Please, insert your card!

10
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,210
 I'm just changing the location of the money.

11
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,410
 From the disgusting old man who doesn't even know how much he has,

12
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,940
 to his desperate grandson who needs it more.

13
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,910
 Thank you for using our bank!

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,560

 Episode 2

17
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,730
I wanted your seat to be clean upon your return.

18
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,510
Since you're a customer.

19
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,410
Wow!

20
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,130
Whiskey and tilefish?

21
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,430
It's been grilled in butter. You'll see after you taste it.

22
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,070
You can't eat fish if you live alone.

23
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,710
The smell remains for three days if you grill it in the room.

24
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,320
I get so happy when I have an opportunity to eat it while I'm out.

25
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,120
You grill fish in your room?

26
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,450
Yes, in the room.

27
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,100
I used to be left-handed.

28
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,570
Not "used to be."

29
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:10,730
I'm still left-handed, but I guess I just use my right hand. 
 - I see.

30
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,670
Ambidextrous?

31
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:20,340
When I eat with my left hand, people always ask me if I'm left-handed.

32
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,680
Which is why I corrected it.

33
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,320
I normally use my right hand, but there are times

34
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,140
when I inadvertently grab the chopsticks with my left hand.

35
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,960
Then they must ask you if you're ambidextrous.

36
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,420
Every time that happens, I can't answer them right away.

37
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,830
Am I not left-handed since I don't use my left hand?

38
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,050
Even though I can use my left hand,

39
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,900
if I only use my right hand in front of people,

40
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,650
does that make me right-handed?"

41
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,140
Which hand do you prefer?

42
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,700
Live as you wish!

43
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,610
You can't turn back time in your life.

44
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,280
 I have something to give you.

45
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,960
 It's something I must absolutely return to you.

46
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,650
This is my mom.

47
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,540
I heard she majored in piano.

48
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,060
It's my mom's keepsake.

49
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,980
I wanted to show it off as a child, so I'd often bring my friends over.

50
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,710
But once they saw how I lived, they'd keep away from me the next day.

51
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,430
We used to live in the prop room of my father's theater.

52
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,320
It was littered with soju bottles and cigarettes.

53
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,530
If I were in their place, I wouldn't play with me either.

54
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,020
What was my face like in that house?

55
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,750
It was like the devil's, right?

56
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,560
People who visit that house arrive with sad faces

57
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,330
and leave with a face like the devil's.

58
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,940
I'm probably the only person who ever left that house smiling.

59
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,540
 Dad, I'll get last place! Dad, don't abandon me!

60
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,700
I ran to him in excitement because I got first place

61
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,930
- in a math competition.
 -  Dad! Dad!

62
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,530
But Father never complimented me and only drank soju.

63
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,490
Then he took me to that man.

64
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,310
 Bring her back alive!

65
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,040
 - You killed her!
- Calm down! Calm down!

66
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,290
Dad said I'd be able to

67
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,600
attend a better school if I lived there.

68
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,160
But Grandfather, I mean...

69
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,480
that man only taught me how to charge interest

70
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,350
and count money.

71
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,390
 He said he couldn't pay back the money.

72
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,270
 Doesn't that make him a thief?

73
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,900
 That's why I called the police.

74
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,430
 Please help me! I've been abducted!

75
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,530
 Please help me! I've been abducted!

76
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,940
 Police

77
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,860
If I had stayed there,

78
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,140
would I have become a rich loan shark?

79
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,430
It's auto-reverse?

80
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,020
It's auto-reverse.

81
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,890
You had something to give me?

82
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,810
You didn't have to give it back to me.

83
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,110
It's not mine.

84
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,440
I felt that If I kept looking at it, I might end up keeping it.

85
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,270
Looks like a storm's coming.

86
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,040
Go on before it starts coming down!

♫  The small raindrops  ♫

89
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,000
 What's the most powerful motivation for someone when making a choice?

90
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:25,590
♫  The feeding pigeons flew away  ♫

♫  A pretty rain came  ♫

93
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,660
Gosh, what the hell!

94
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,800
Did I scare you?

95
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,590
Do you want water?

96
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,090
Why are you up already?

97
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,410
What are you doing there?

98
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,250
I thought you might be tired, so I wanted to make soup for breakfast.

99
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,170
You didn't sleep, did you?

100
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,200
I told you not to wait up.

101
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,410
Go lie down! You must be tired.

102
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,890
Yes, I am a bit tired.

103
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,060
I thought you're going to sleep. Where are you going?

104
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,390
Your bedding is nicer.

105
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,200
I want to get a good sleep today.

106
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,380
 Bandages

107
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,210
 Put on a new one when it falls off.

108
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,330
Hyeong! Did you put this on me?

109
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,380
Hey, who else would take care of you?

110
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,640
Well, that woman suddenly came back

111
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,480
and left that here.

112
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,490
She gives you medicine and gives you bread.

113
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:55,540
She begged me to disinfect the wound first so it wouldn't get infected.

114

 SD Savings Bank

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,030
 Welcome.

116
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,450
 Welcome.

117
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,910
Did you think you wouldn't get caught?

118
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,710
Hand it over!

119
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,370
Let's not waste our time here.

120
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,560
Give me the bag!

121
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,510
It's not like these are your heavenly maiden clothes*.
(Referring to the Korean folktale "The Fairy and the Woodcutter.")

122
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,270
I should hide this so I can share a meal with you.

123
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,480
Eat before you leave!

124
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,760
Don't you get hungry while you make your rounds?

125
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,950
You didn't have lunch yet.

126
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,980
It's 2 p.m. Are you now eating lunch?

127
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,780
It's hard to match your schedule.

128
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,390
- Eat before you go! 
 - Sure.

129
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:15,200
The audit team is going around the branch,but she's the only one who's not coming to work.

130
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,670
No way! She's not the type to embezzle money. She probably took a vacation.

131
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,780
- That eonni? Really? 
 - Yes.

132
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,100
Geez, be quiet! That's enough.

133
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,400
She might not be embezzling, but the branch manager's rebate...

134
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,370
They said that's for certain.

135
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,260
Apparently, that's their relationship.

136
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,760
Why isn't Ms. Yu Yi Hwa coming? She just went to wash her hands.

137
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,120
You invited her? Gosh.I thought you were just eating two servings.

138
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,380
Is it a problem?

139
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,330
You immature brats. What's wrong with you?

140
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,520
It's not like she came because of connections or anything. She just took a career break.

141
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,340
I thought she was under the HQ director's line.

142
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,620
I heard her husband is a general manager at AF.

143
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,520
Did you see her address? It's a single-family house in Jungwon-gu.

144
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,260
Who knows if she's paying rent or mortgage? When did you see her address?

145
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,980
When she filled out an application for a credit card.

146
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,650
She never had a single credit card, at her age.

147
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,750
She gives me a bad feeling.

148
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,500
Is your leg better?

149
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,490
You were late because you went to buy this? You should've just come.

150
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,330
I was going to charge you for the food, but the juice looks more expensive.

151
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,480
I'll do it.

152
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,050
 SD Savings Bank

153
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,500
Yes, Assistant Manager Na.

154
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,420
Where are you? A VIP called for you.

155
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm still near the bank.

156
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,430
Mr. Park Byeong Sik from the townhouse community

157
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,490
 is asking you to make sure to bring "that" from last time.

158
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,800
All right. I'll call his house and—

159
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,580
 No, no.

160
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,640
Just a second.

161
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,740
Hello?

162
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,160
Yes, Assistant Manager Na.

163
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,360
I moved elsewhere in case the other customers heard me.

164
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,820
Ms Yu Yi Hwa, aside from the branch's phone number,

165
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,950
 don't give him your personal number!

166
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,100
 If he gets mad, tell him it's bank policy and have him call me.

167
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,460
I understand, Assistant Manager.

168
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,430
 By the way, what does he want you to bring him?

169
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,460
 Did he ask you to grocery shop?

170
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm on a one-way street, so I think it'll be faster to leave the car at a café and walk over.

171
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,630
Do you need anything?

172
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,790
 Welcome.

173
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,840
 SD Savings Bank

174
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,370
Excuse me! Over here!

175
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,910
Wait!

176
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,500
It's dangerous! It's dangerous. Stay there.

177
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,180
It's dangerous. Don't come.

178
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,520
Sorry?

179
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,460
Please appear in a 30-second video.

180
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,860
I'll pay you 5 million won.

181
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,140
It'll be exactly 30 seconds.

182
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,390
This is the appearance fee.

183
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,740
- What is this?
- Five million in cash.You know how much is in there.

184
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,080
I don't understand what you're saying.I simply left the cake I received as a gift.

185
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,600
I simply left you the cake I received as a gift.

186
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,970
Please move aside! I'm working.

187
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,480
You really didn't know about this money?

188
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,950
Why are you doing this to me?

189
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,940
Because I'm curious why you're doing this to me.

190
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,030
Because you're the one I was looking for.

191
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,140
I'm working. I have to return.

192
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,310
Then I'll come back tomorrow.

193
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,610
♫  I don't care if it's a lie  ♫

194
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,440
♫  Everything will disappear  ♫

195
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,250
I simply returned the cake I received from your grandfather to his grandson.

196
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,630
Was that money really inside?

197
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,900
Are you taunting me right now?

198
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:13,370
♫  I will find my lost soul in you  ♫

199
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:20,220
♫  Oh, I remember  ♫

200
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,220
♫  To that place where the cosmos bloom far away  ♫

201
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,110
Ms. Yi Hwa!

202
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,180
The light's changing. Run!

203
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,390
Thank you for the coffee.

204
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,890
Thank you.

205
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,280
Ms. Yi Hwa, you know how to live. Thanks for the coffee.

206
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

207
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,700
Everyone's so kind. You're all so friendly.

208
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,650
Oh, really? That's a relief to hear.

209
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,570
You're doing very well.

210
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,610
What's your relationship?

211
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,960
Why do you two look so friendly?

212
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,240
Eonni Min Su. Oh, I mean Assistant Manager Na.

213
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,860
Did you know her before?

214
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,590
- No.
 - I see...

215
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,240
She was gushing so much about a cup of coffee.

216
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,880
It's the first time I see her like that, thanks to you.

217
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,680
Those are expensive.

218
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,890
Why do you leave them here?

219
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,560
Oh, this.

220
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,810
I forgot to take it home.

221
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,300
I'm jealous. Those are luxury cosmetics.

222
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,250
When I get my pay, I have to worry about loan interest and monthly rent.

223
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,550
Come on.

224
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,990
 You said you were going to deliver snacks.

225
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,020
I'm going to change my passcode.

226
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,540
I knew it the moment you planned to move in next door.

227
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,000
Come on!

228
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,240
Is my house your closet? Is it a showroom?

229
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,950
My in-laws asked me to make marinated raw crabs. I'm going to make some.

230
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,030
Marinated crabs? Which kind? Marinated in soy sauce?

231
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,400
Female crabs full of eggs.

232
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,330
 It probably won't be that delicious.

233
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,400
Hey, that's not fair!

234
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,840
 Seon Yeong.

235
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,330
There's a bag inside the closet. Brand new line.

236
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,390
You can take anything, except the Charlotte earrings. 
  Auréole Korea

237
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,660
I haven't even worn them yet.

238
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,910
Ga Eul, what do you call lunch/dinner in English?

239
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,320
In English? What you eat between lunch and dinner?

240
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,870
Oh, like "lunner"?

241
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,000
"Dinch."

242
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,190
"Dinch"?

243
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,570
Oh, lunch and dinner!

244
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,710
Some people say "lunner."

245
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,680
Why are you asking about that?

246
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,370
It's just a meal!

247
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,430
I needed a word to sound edgy.

248
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,410
I need to look extravagant today.

249
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,770
It really suits you.

250
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,770
Thank you.

251
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,030
 Tomahawk Steak 10.0

252
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,340
Should I have a light juice for lunner today?

253
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,060
Before we start dinch,

254
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,780
why don't we greet the Deputy Manager Je* first?
  (Addressing each other by husband's title)

255
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,180
Sure, before we start dinch.

256
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,560
Why are you giving me your husbands' business cards?

257
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,990
We usually do.

258
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,170
Gosh, we don't do that in executive get-togethers.

259
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,580
There aren't many executives,

260
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,680
so there's no need to match the family to the employee.

261
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,420
I heard you have something to say.

262
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,800
I arranged to meet here so you could talk comfortably.

263
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,610
I was afraid a meeting between the two of us

264
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,430
might be mistaken as an HR solicitation.

265
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,320
Oh, your uncle is the director?

266
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,270
I heard he summoned Je In's dad to make me apologize to you.

267
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,410
Apparently, I had belittled you.

268
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,000
Come on! You don't know how to intimidate a person.

269
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,030
- Deputy Manager Je, aren't you being extremely rude?
 - Oh, my!

270
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,020
Why am I Deputy Manager Je?

271
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,560
Je Guk is the one who joined the company.

272
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm Kang Seon Yeong!

273
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,110
Why don't you apologize right now so you don't regret it later, Kang Seon Yeong?

274
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,910
Why? Are you going to tell the director again?

275
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,130
If you have your director,

276
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,470
I have the family group chat of the Senior Managing Director, Managing Director, and President.

277
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,540
Is your ear all right?

278
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,230
My ear?

279
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,620
I do have a headache.

280
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,050
 Seung Dermatology

281
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,640
Is Director Seong here? Director Seong...

282
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,580
Eonni!

283
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,310
It's urgent!

284
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,030
It'll subside in no time with medication.

285
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:44,080
Don't wear accessories that aren't made of gold!

286
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,670
She said it was platinum.

287
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,750
She said she bought it in installments.

288
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,340
Was Ga Eul conned?

289
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,930
The medication will make you sleepy, so no driving.

290
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,910
You're putting us in a tight spot.

291
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,970
Our policy is to discard everything.

292
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,770
How can you discard all this?

293
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,670
This is several days' worth of food.

294
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,610
If you keep taking those out...

295
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,430
They're vinyl bags used in the kitchen. They're clean.

296
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,560
 Don't worry! No one's looking.

297
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,410
It's just us here.

298
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,850
But still.

299
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,100
If you take the leftover food outside and something goes wrong—

300
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,380
I'll write an agreement.

301
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,250
I won't file a lawsuit, even if I get food poisoning.

302
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,880
 It's such a waste!

303
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,400
 There are environmental issues

304
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,920
 and we should decrease trash.

305
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,540
 AF: Is she taking leftovers?

306
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,810
 Can I take a paper bag?

307
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,150
 My hands are full.

308
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,300
Assistant Manager Kim's wife recorded that and uploaded it to the family group chat.

309
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,190
and uploaded it to the family group chat.

310
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,400
Geez, they're so childish. 
   AF Group

311
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,320
Come to my office instead of listening to the whispering in the office.

312
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,160
No, thank you.

313
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:38,850
This is why you should've chosen a docile and submissive woman like I did.

314
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,550
Gosh, look at you.

315
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,050
I can just take my car.

316
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,600
He said not to drive while on medication.

317
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,560
Your eyes are swollen, too.

318
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,560
To use this as an excuse to drive a nice car, I asked for his keys.

319
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,720
Tae Mi's dad won't let me even touch this car.

320
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,280
We'll bring your car over later.

321
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,900
All right.

322
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,110
I'll have to sit in the back seat.

323
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,050
Tae Mi's dad must also play tennis.

324
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,840
Should I input my address in the navigation, or can you manage?

325
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,400
Didn't I put it in my bag?

326
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,250
Seonbae-nim Ga Eul must've been in the car.

327
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,680
You should return it to her. You're her neighbor, right?

328
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,100
I moved next door.

329
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,660
Please tell Seonbae Ga Eul she doesn't need to sit in the back

330
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,470
when she meets my husband regarding Tae Mi.

331
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,320
She doesn't need to go that far.

332
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,400
Didn't she say this was a single earring?

333
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,990
 Park Byeong Sik

334
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,360
Shall I take a look?

335
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,520
To see if you really didn't open it and if my money remains untouched.

336
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,780
This is a borrowed-name account.

337
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,970
Even if you say you didn't look, you're aware now.

338
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,130
So we're accomplices.

339
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,650
I leave it in your care.

340
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,530
 Geuring Townhouse

341
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:06,420
Since things turned out this way, let's be straightforward.

342
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,450
How much do you want as your cut? How about—

343
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,220
I never checked the content.

344
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,430
I'll also forget what I just saw and heard.

345
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,570
You're good at acting.

346
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,410
If you never opened the bag,

347
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,760
you should've been shocked when I said it was a borrowed-name account.

348
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,030
You're a bank employee.

349
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,590
VIP clients usually have such accounts.

350
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,180
Drive!

351
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,100
Let us, accomplices, go for a drive.

352
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,140
If you have no further business, I'll take my leave.

353
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,410
I heard there's a nice spot in Yangjae.

354
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:05,360
I'm thinking about taking out a loan from your bank and buying some land.

355
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,830
On the way, we can stop by the hotel to use the sauna and—

356
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,610
Oh, how was the roll cake?

357
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,340
Should I contact your grandson to escort you there?

358
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,710
You know that scumbag's phone number? Did you meet him separately?

359
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,020
He came to the bank for a loan review.

360
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,500
I returned the cake you gave me to your grandson that day.

361
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,960
Gave it to whom?

362
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,420
Did you tell him I gave it to you?

363
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,300
- Why did you bring—
 - I'm going to return it to that man.

364
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,780
You said he gave it to you.

365
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,190
Don't return it to him!

366
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,030
I told him I never opened the cake and gave it to you at the bank.

367
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,270
If someone finds out I received money from a client—

368
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,870
Yes.

369
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,870
- "Yes"?
- I won't ask questions.

370
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,400
You don't have to explain.

371
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,700
Hey! Don't take that out!

372
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,820
Don't open that!

373
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,060
This scumbag is trying to frame me again.

374
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,230
What will you show me this time?

375
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,870
Don't yell.

376
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,900
- You son of a bitch—
 - Open it.

377
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,750
Sorry?

378
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,830
Wasn't there a cake inside?

379
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,570
Can I take a look right now?

380
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,340
Hey, get lost!

381
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,290
Get lost, bastard! Get lost!

382
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,360
Get lost, you bastard!

383
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,560
I'll pray ...

384
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,870
we never meet again.

385
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,500
Looking at me ...

386
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,960
will remind you of today's events.

387
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,540
You'll be anxious as you were earlier.

388
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,700
But if we still end up meeting ...

389
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,850
I'll continue to go to see you.

390
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,710
You should've told me that you wanted to eat out.

391
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,020
What do you know?

392
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,680
I wanted to celebrate my first paycheck.

393
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,660
Paycheck?

394
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,660
Has it been a month already?

395
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,370
Good job.

396
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,740
Do you like it?

397
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,760
Yeah.

398
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,380
I needed a shoddy one to wear casually while playing tennis.

399
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,640
Good job. Thank you.

400
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,410
It's a couple's item?

401
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,450
You put a lot of thought into it.

402
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,820
You can wear it while doing housework.

403
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,540
Good job choosing something mediocre.

404
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,060
What are you waiting for? Your hand.

405
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,430
Was there anything left after buying these?

406
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,890
Do you want some pocket money?

407
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,870
The food is good, right?

408
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,970
If you say this is good, I feel like I've been starving you.

409
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:47,260
Haven't I bought you a formal French dinner?

410
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,540
Authentic French cuisine that's different from this stuff.

411
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Is this food fake, then?

412
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,710
It seems like a French version of convenience food.

413
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,220
I wonder if they pack lunches, too.

414
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,770
I was thinking about buying some for the researchers.

415
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,870
Go home first.

416
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:22,190
I hate my shoes getting wet.

417
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,960
Take a premium taxi home.

418
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,610
Over here!

419
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,790
- Hey!
 - Whoa!

420
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,390
It's going to stop soon.

421
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,520
It's just a shower.

422
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,720
Hey!

423
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,050
Where did you get the money to buy this?

424
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,240
The money appeared overnight in my room.

425
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,580
4K, 30 fps?

426
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,330
Hey, be careful!

427
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,150
We're already here.

428
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,410
Where? I don't see you.

429
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,090
She's here?

430
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,560
- Where is she?
 - Where?

431
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,380
Say hi to my team leader.

432
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,600
The general manager of the marketing division, to be more precise.

433
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,720
Nice to meet you.

434
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,690
She said she was meeting friends, so I'm just dropping her off.

435
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,270
- Hello.
 - Hello.

436
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,590
Hello!

437
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,010
They're my alumni.

438
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,950
Im Ga Deun.

439
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,780
Team Leader Ryu! Is this cash?

440
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,720
Why not?

441
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,250
Sorry for treating you as my personal assistant and making you drive day and night.

442
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,610
It's fine.

443
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,100
Have a good time!

444
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,760
Thank you.

445
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,220
- Take care!
  - Goodbye!

446
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,560
Daebak!

447
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,220
What the? Yun Min Jae came, too?

448
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,350
Im Ga Deun, do you hate me that much?

449
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,560
Let's go eat meat!

450
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,540
This neighborhood is expensive.

451
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,120
- Expensive, my foot.
 - Whoa.

452
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,480
- Are you all right? 
  - That hurts.

453
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,140
Aigoo, did you sprain it?

454
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,500
- Yun Min Jae, carry me! 
 - What?

455
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,400
- Aigoo!
 - Those girls are looking at you.

456
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,170
They'll be so jealous of me getting on your back.

457
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,320
I'm an attention whore.

458
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,100
Right, an attention whore who'll buy us hanwu*.
  (Premium Korean beef)

459
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,070
Hey, put me down.

460
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,400
Not hanwu.

461
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,610
- What the heck?
 - Hey, excuse me. Move.

462
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,030
What are you doing?

463
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,870
Seonbae-nim.

464
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,400
Get on!

465
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,130
Forget it. You'll hurt your back.

466
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,220
Hey, this was taken back there, right?

467
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,350
Hey—

468
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,540
- Hey!
 - What the heck?

469
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,070
The rain stopped.

470
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,800
Sir, I'm sorry, but please drop me off here.

471
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,610
This is crazy.

472
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,150
I'm sorry.

473
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:56,500
There's a Vice President's gathering as soon as I return to Korea, so take special care.

474
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,370
Do your nails, too.

475
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:02,420
It'll be troubling if you take it lightly like the tennis luncheon gathering.

476
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,040
Those gatherings are awkward for me.

477
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,600
We need to stand out during this gathering.

478
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,740
Don't wear something mediocre and buy something proper.

479
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,700
Or ask Ms. Ga Eul to order for you.

480
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,840
 2016 Inguk University Graduation Project Screening

481
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,390
I kept my promise.

482
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,290
I prayed we never meet again.

483
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,850
But we ended up meeting.

484
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,890
God must not exist in this world.

485
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,290
Are you going to call this a coincidence?

486
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,990
No.

487
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,650
 How childish.

488
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,360
Are you going to call it fate?

489
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,810
That's what children would call it.

490
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,510
It's an accident.

491
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,230
Isn't it?

492
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,400
 2016 Inguk University Graduation Project Screening

493
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,440
Please come and see what I filmed.

494
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,510
Why?

495
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:01,050
Because we're the victims of the same accident.

496
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,120
Ga Eul.

497
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,900
I'm depressed.

498
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,540
I got to come here, thanks to you, Team Leader Ryu. Thank you.

499
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,460
What have you been doing all your life?

500
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,090
Exactly.

501
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,240
Ga Eul.

502
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,350
Hey, Yi Hwa!

503
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,500
My hubaenim, Im Ga Deun.

504
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,630
Hello.

505
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,710
Hello. I'm Yu Yi Hwa.

506
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,650
She said she's never been to a designer shop. It's all right with you, isn't it?

507
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,300
- This is a new line, right?
- Yes.

508
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,830
It's pretty.

509
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,660
How much do you need to buy for them to give you these?

510
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,780
I'm not sure. I'm too scared to find out.

511
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,340
That's what I was thinking.

512
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,020
I'm going to take this call.

513
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,780
Sure.

514
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,890
Give me everything I picked out in the beginning.

515
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,360
Why are you rushing?

516
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,980
I shouldn't let Ga Deun see me paying.

517
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,900
It makes me look small.

518
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,720
You can't look, either.

519
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,410
Twelve months for the boots with this.

520
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,510
And six months for the skirt with this.

521
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,720
Pay off the rest with this.

522
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,760
All right.

523
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,280
What a brilliant glow, right? It's this brand's signature red.

524
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,150
It's this brand's signature red.

525
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,510
Am I seeing it right?

526
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:36,320
The price includes the champagne we drank and their attitudes.

527
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,640
Attitude?

528
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,560
Unbelievable prices come as a set with unbelievable kindness.

529
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,790
What if kindness comes first?

530
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:51,430
It's the same.You'll have to pay the price eventually.

531
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:54,250
How nasty.

532
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,850
It's nasty?

533
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,250
You have to feel indebted for kindness.

534
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,900
But it feels nice.

535
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,740
What's nice about nastiness?

536
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,780
Even if it's fake, it's still kindness.

537
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:15,860
Even if it's fake kindness that's premised on payment,

538
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,610
receiving kindness still makes you happy.

539
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,990
Am I happy?

540
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,970
Team Leader Ryu...

541
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,570
Yeah?

542
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,900
I'm sorry, but there's a problem.

543
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,980
- Go ahead.
 - Sorry?

544
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,850
Aren't you going to ask what's wrong?

545
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,550
Will you stay, if I ask?

546
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,450
Someone asked me for an urgent favor.

547
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:42,540
I'll see you tomorrow then!

548
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,810
You promised me a ticket.

549
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,850
Oh, right! I forgot.

550
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,500
My alumni prepared this. It's until Sunday.

551
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,890
Here you go.

552
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,690
This looks fun.

553
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:57,490
You two can go together.

554
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,290
I'm sorry, Team Leader Ryu.

555
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,970
I'll make sure to clear my schedule next time.
  2016 Inguk University Graduation Project Screening

556
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,000
You said you're busy. Aren't you leaving?

557
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,030
I'll get going.

558
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,730
You're here?

559
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,450
Honey, why are you here?

560
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,930
We flew back because of an aircraft problem.

561
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,720
I'm leaving on tomorrow morning's flight.

562
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:44,140
By the way, where did you go?

563
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,190
I went out to eat with Ga Eul.

564
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,070
Eat? How much?

565
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,420
I'll get a Keir Royal as an aperitif.What do you have for a mise en bouche?

566
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,210
We have sea urchins and oysters.

567
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,320
If you don't like seafood, we can make modifications.

568
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,720
No, it's all right. Thank you.

569
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,010
I made a reservation for today and forgot to cancel it.

570
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:11,060
I remembered after I got a confirmation call at the airport.

571
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,590
This is escargot in a truffle foie gras sauce.

572
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,200
These are snails, right?

573
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,900
Oh, yes. Escargots. Try it.

574
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,630
What are you doing? You're embarrassing me.

575
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,500
What are you doing? How crude!

576
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,290
Why would you pick that up?

577
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,400
Oh, I'm sorry. Her wrists are unwell.

578
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,830
What are you doing? Sit down.

579
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:34,530
Sit down—

580
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,050
It's a gift.

581
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,270
Why are you giving me a watch?

582
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:04,670
It hasn't been long since we got matching watches.

583
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:08,050
You're at an age where you shouldn't look shabby.

584
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,800
And the Vice President's gathering is coming up, too.

585
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,740
Am I shabby?

586
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:22,090
The older you are, the more you should wear nicer things to be treated with respect.

587
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,280
Is that so?

588
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,320
I'll buy you a Hanadama* pearl from my business trip to Japan. 
 (a superior grade, the finest cultured pearls within each harvest)

589
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:36,600
Pearls look great on older women.

590
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,870
What's wrong, Honey?

591
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,880
Asthma?

592
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,490
Allergies?

593
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,480
Allergies.

594
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,540
Allergies? I see.

595
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:20,340
E-Excuse me! Check, please.

596
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:30,390

597
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:38,200
♫  The black and white world  ♫

598
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:52,230
♫  A situation where there's nowhere to hide  ♫

599
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,520
Nice to meet you.

600
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,210
I'm the division head, So Mi Gyeong.

601
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,010
Hello.

602
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,080
I'm sorry for calling you out on the weekend.

603
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,460
I'll be on a long business trip as soon as I start,

604
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,060
so I wanted to meet you before I leave.

605
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,120
General Manager Ryu Ga Eul?

606
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,650
But they address you as Team Leader right?

607
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,900
Hello, Head Manager So.

608
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,660
Welcome.

609
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,740
Division head.

610
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,030
Division Head So.

611
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,030
Welcome.

612
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,940
 Lobby

613
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:18,380
Do you go home and say to Tae Mi, "Daddy's here"?

614
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,940
What?

615
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,600
Yes, I do say, "Daddy's here" sometimes.

616
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,380
After your banging PT session,

617
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:32,000
do you go home and dare touch my daughter?

618
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,130
What's wrong with you?

619
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,500
What's her identity?

620
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,360
Is she also married? A divorcée?

621
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,350
She's already division head at that age!

622
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:43,540
Your company's the one who recruited her?

623
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,710
- What do I do?
 - She's my direct superior!

624
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:49,600
Gosh, I was looking forward to some money this time.

625
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,380
- Hey, don't be too hard on her.
 - She's my superior! My superior!

626
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,990
Then be good and listen to her.

627
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,280
You crazy bastard!

628
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,900
Go on.

629
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:11,810
I ... I don't know where my heart lies.

630
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,310
I think about you when Gu Se Ju is in my arms

631
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:18,780
and I think about Gu Se Ju when So Mi Gyeong is in my arms.

632
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:22,300
And when you are this close to me, I can't think about anything else!

633
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,230
Hey, just hit me! Hit me!

634
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,500
Hit me! Hit me like in the old times!

635
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,610
You pervert!

636
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,860
Are you into that now?

637
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,900
You're done hitting me?

638
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,740
You're old now, Ryu Ga Eul. You're like a cotton swab.

639
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,700
I used to black out after one hit from you.

640
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,500
Do you take supplements? Do you still wake up from cramps these days?

641
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,510
Oh, my head. I'm going crazy.

642
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,540
I had a child with this fool.

643
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:55,480
Get out!

644
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,360
There's nothing more to listen to. Get out right now!

645
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,900
What I know for sure about my heart

646
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,400
- is that I'm not over you—
 - Get lost!

647
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,200
- What I said just now was sincere—
- Not a chance!

648
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:36,380
Why call me about something like that?

649
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,990
There's nothing to be thankful for.

650
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:42,070
What did Sister-in-law say?

651
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:46,420
I'm glad she likes it.

652
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,270
It's a stroller and crib used by European royalty.

653
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,440
Oh, on a yacht?

654
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,730
I'd love to!

655
00:58:56,830 --> 00:59:03,500
Yeah. Then check your schedule and let me know.

656
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,310
Right.

657
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:10,920
All right then. Take care. Give my regards to the Vice President.

658
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,800
Give me a glass of barley tea. Warm.

659
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,750
You got rid of the baby furniture without asking me?

660
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:37,020
What's there to ask? The baby issue was clearly dealt with.

661
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,250
I never said I would throw away the baby furniture.

662
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,390
I didn't throw it away. It costs nearly the same as a used car.

663
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:47,760
I don't like to waste money.

664
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,840
Assistant Manager Park gave me a ride from the airport.

665
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,330
He said they were having their first child, so I told him to take it.

666
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:57,820
Don't think of it as a waste. It came in handy.

667
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,110
It came in handy?

668
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:05,450
Yes, didn't I tell you? Assistant Manager Park is the cousin of the Vice President's wife.

669
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:12,860
I guess that's what it meant to you.

670
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,430
We decided to accompany the Vice President on a yacht ride next month.

671
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:20,250
You don't have yacht shoes, right?

672
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,850
Don't forget and have a pair ready.

673
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:25,850
Oh, and my barley tea.

674
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,360
I hope the flight...

675
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:43,600
doesn't return this time.

676
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,880
They didn't come yesterday, either.  Who do you keep leaving a seat for?

677
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,730
Who is it? Who?

678
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,210
A victim of an accident.

679
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,950
 2016 Inguk University Graduation Project Screening

680
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,910
 2016 Inguk University Graduation Project Screening

681
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,280
Don't expect too much.

682
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:34,490
♫  Only on Sunday afternoon  ♫

683
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:45,560
♫  I open my eyes and look at the sky

684
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:58,260
♫  The dark gray cloud   ♫

685
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:08,300
♫  is calling me  ♫

686
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:34,910
 Thank you for coming to see the light I created.

687
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:17,210
Already? I thought I could put up ten more.

688
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:36,960
 Inguk University Shuttle Bus

689
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:52,260
It's your left hand.

690
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,310
We can't.

691
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,100
We can't.

692
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,450
I know.

693
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:08,970

694
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,790
♫  I don't care if it's a lie, everything will disappear.  ♫

695
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:17,690
♫  It all disappears  ♫

696
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:23,020
♫  Even if it's buried where there is no one  ♫

697
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,260
♫  Those words, "It's precious"  ♫

698
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,280
 Pale Moon

699
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,550
♫  I'll find the lost soul in you  ♫

700
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,590
 Oh, Honey!

701
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,880
 You were really great today.

702
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,220
 That was intentional, wasn't it?

703
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,560
 Why are you doing this?

704
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,900
 Hey, Min Jae! Min Jae-

705
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,040
 I'll pay it back.

706
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,570
 I said, I'll pay it back!

707
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:46,240
 I don't understand. Why does she live like that when she's rich?

708
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,960
 You're supposed to make money through dirty and petty means.

709
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,710
 Ms. Yu Yi Hwa, you almost caused serious trouble.

710
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:56,430
 I have a favor to ask you. Can we meet?
