 The characters, places, agencies, incidents, organizations, and occupations in this drama have no connection to real life.

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,100
Aigoo, ma'am. This is Deputy Manager Chu.

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,800
A high-interest special product came out. Let's work on it for one week.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,740
I'm only notifying our regular customers, so come visit our branch.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,420
Yes, of course. We'll give you a complimentary gift just for visiting.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,870
How would you like the coffee mix?

13
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,470
Oh, you quit coffee?

14
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,110
Then what about sunflower...

 SD Ethics Lecture

Welcome.

17
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,430
 Welcome.

 Welcome.

20
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,300
 Welcome.

21
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,310
It's not cleaning time yet.

22
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,050
Did the cleaning time change along with the cleaning lady?

23
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,010
Did it?

24
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,340
 Welcome.

25
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,550
 Welcome.

26
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,020
- Assistant Manager Kim! 
 - Yes!

27
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,430
Calm the customers!

28
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,250
- Section Chief Kim! 
 - Yes.

29
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,620
Get the vault cash and the bank seal!

30
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,020
It's all right, don't worry.

31
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,220
- Assistant Manager Kim! 
 - Yes?

32
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,300
- Get some Yakult for them! 
 - Pardon?

33
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,800
- Yakult!* Hurry! 
 - Yes, yes. 
 *(probiotic beverage)

34
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,490
Don't worry!

35
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,470
Dear customers, don't worry, it's nothing! 
  Certificate of Deposit

36
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,100
Everything will be restored soon.

37
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,690
Please have a seat. It'll be recovered soon.

38
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,130
Don't worry!

39
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,250
Everything's all right!

40
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,520
Everything will be restored in no time!

41
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,930
Everything will be restored in no time.

42
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,870
Please have a seat. It'll be restored soon.

43
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,830
Please stay seated!

44
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,580
The lights came back on. There's no need to worry.

45
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,740
I thought it was a bank robbery, so I was trying to hide it.

46
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,910
There's an alarm malfunction from time to time.

47
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,110
The power outage scared you on top of it, didn't it?

48
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,990
The building is old, so it must've short-circuited again.

49
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,390
Last summer, the entire building's power went out when we turned on the air conditioner.

50
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,340
By the way, you have incredible reflexes!

51
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,960
Who would think to steal something from here?

52
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,320
Did you press the "copy" button because of shock?

53
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,860
Assistant Manager Na, please reschedule the customers for consultation.

54
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,290
Leave only one counter open

55
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,060
and direct the customers to the ATM for deposits and withdrawals.

56
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,550
Yes sir.

57
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,240
Ms. Yi Hwa, you, too.

58
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,260
Oh, you can leave early today.

59
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,430
I just need to clean the restroom.

60
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,630
I'll clean it.

61
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,400
Yi Hwa!

62
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,880
Over here.

63
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,430
What happened?

64
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,810
 Take a number

65
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,240
Yi Hwa!

66
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,100
Are you all right?

67
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes ...

68
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,880
Are you all right?

69
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,080
Yes, I'm all right.

70
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,480
You scared me.

71
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,850
I forgot about this.

72
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,160
 Wuri Donation Foundation

73
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,440
 To: Ms. Yu Yi Hwa

74
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,520
Should I buy a pair of heels?

75
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,790
Today, I came for about 100 million won ...

76
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,550
Never mind. I'll come back next time.

77
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,710
You want to open a savings account?

78
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,520
We have some good special products.

79
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,840
The bank looks busy, so I'll come next time.

80
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,610
Why did you collapse earlier? Are you anemic?

81
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,540
It must've been due to shock. Get in!

82
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,590
Take care!

83
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,170
Gosh, I'm still hungry, in this commotion. Do you have plans?

84
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,710
- Yes.
- A date?

85
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,780
What are you eating? Where are you going?

86
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,720
Can we come, too?

87
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,580
Wait, wait!

88
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,970
Let's do an inspection first, according to the manual.

89
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,060
Don't leave the premises.

90
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,610
Assistant Manager Kim will take care of the male employees.

91
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,190
We'll begin the inspection.

92
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,210
Ms. Yi Hwa, this is your first time, right?

93
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,430
It's because of the alarm incident.

94
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,950
According to our policy, your belongings must be checked after the situation settles.

95
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,460
Should we start with Ms. Yi Hwa?

96
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,390
Since you'll be leaving first to work offsite.

97
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,950
Let me see your bag. This is just a formality.

98
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,630
Why do you carry around an exfoliating towel?

99
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,920
A client asked me for a favor.

100
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,880
Whoa, my grandma used to love these.

101
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,690
Anyway, you're working so hard for these VIP clients.

102
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,650
It's nothing. They're all elderly.

103
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,130
Exactly. They're the elderly,

104
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,410
so I wonder why they childishly make a bank employee run errands.

105
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,680
Aren't these the company's?

106
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,220
Taking company supplies is also embezzlement.

107
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,360
Carrying it home in my stomach or drinking it at home is the same thing.

108
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,370
Yi Ru Ri, your bag!

109
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,330
Two million won?  (~$1406 USD)

110
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,730
Did you buy this, or was it a gift? Which is it?

111
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,020
It's not mine.

112
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,400
Thank you. I thought I had lost it.

113
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,250
I'm the one who dropped this.

114
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,300
- It's yours?
 - Yes.

115
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,590
I picked it up when you dropped it this morning.

116
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,390
I forgot about it in the frenzy.

117
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,460
Thank you.

118
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,730
I'm aware of your living situation, but the certificate value was quite high.

119
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,470
You're usually frugal, you know?

120
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,090
I'm good now, right?

121
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,950
Yes.

122
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,710
Sure.

123
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,080
Oh, I didn't check Ms. Yi Hwa's locker.

124
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,730
You're not upset because I looked through your locker earlier, are you?

125
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,250
It's all right.

126
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,990
Your locker was neat, like its owner.

127
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,740
Do you clean it every day?

128
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,790
You!

129
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,580
What did you just take out from the drawer?

130
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,820
Hand it over.

131
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,400
A pouch for feminine products.

132
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,020
Sorry.

133
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,750
S-Sorry.

134
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,380
 Certificate of Deposit

135
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,840
Draw his attention to this.

136
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,180
Explain that CDs aren't very helpful in increasing assets.

137
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,610
Do you know how much he'll put away in a CD from now on?

138
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,170
I don't know, and it's not my place to ask.

139
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,730
If it's Mr. Park Byeong Sik, he'll open up one of those accounts.

140
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,820
Is this a sample?

141
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,900
Did Yi Hwa drop this?

142
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,180
 Certificate of Deposit

143
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,600
 I can't forge it with just a color-printed copy.

144
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,090
Yes, yes.

145
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:42,710
Aigoo, I can do it myself. I'm so grateful every time.

146
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,620
- Thank you.
- No problem.

147
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,700
Please take good care of me.

148
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,680
Yes.

149
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,360
Hey, listen!

150
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,600
Do the police frequent the bank?

151
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,930
Do they come every day?

152
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,620
There's no set time...

153
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,150
but they do patrol two or more times a day.

154
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,740
I'm sorry. Please wait a few more days for the CD you entrusted to me.

155
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,880
Oh, you didn't steal it?

156
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,870
- Sorry?
- Someone must've stolen something for the alarm to have gone off.

157
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,340
I heard mine is being delayed because the bank's

158
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,460
electric system is under review after that emergency alarm went off.

159
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,600
It was a malfunction during the building's wiring renovation.

160
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,350
Hey, give it to her!

161
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,380
Then withdraw all that as soon as the wiring is fixed and bring it to me as a CD.

162
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,010
The PIN is written on the front of the bankbook.

163
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,900
 It's that bankbook.

164
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,980
 If he looks at the transaction details, the 5 million withdrawn that day will show.

165
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,580
What should I do with the bankbook?

166
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,290
The bankbook?

167
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,810
Discard it right away!

168
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,610
Why would I save the bankbook when I'm trying to launder money from a borrowed account?

169
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,730
Get rid of it!

170
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,020
Did you commit a crime or something?

171
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:10,220
- Sorry?
- Why are you standing there? Leave!

172
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,020
If you want to transfer all this money to a CD account

173
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,400
you'll need more pre-stamped deposit slips.

174
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,570
Then bring them to me. I'll stamp everything at once.

175
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:31,200
You're always bothering me with such trivial matters.

176
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,030
This French restaurant gives us alcohol every time a new dish is served.

177
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,220
I thought I could only see this in movies.

178
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,340
Anyone can come here.

179
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,330
As long as you have money.

180
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,130
They say there are two types of money in the world.

181
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,780
Money you had and money you can't have.

182
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,270
"Money you had and money you can't have."

183
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,010
Then what about the money you can have?

184
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,650
That's probably money you can't have.

185
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,280
They're quite friendly here.

186
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,880
 Money I could've had but couldn't.

187
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,700
 I'm just using that.

188
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,700

189
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,800
Here.

190
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,820
Thanks.

191
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,850
Thank goodness I didn't throw it out.

192
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,380
A sample? Will you get in trouble if you lose it? You can just make another copy.

193
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,790
Even if it's a sample, we can't recklessly make copies.

194
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,640
I must've dropped it while opening the car for you.

195
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,820
I guess that could happen. Someone could make counterfeits with colored copies.

196
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,400
You had come to make a certificate of deposit, right?

197
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,700
Yes.

198
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,380
To get a loan. With the rental apartment as my collateral.

199
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,370
I figured that would be better than selling it.

200
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,540
Why do you need a loan?

201
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,900
I lost my head for a moment, and the money I had to pay—

202
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,800
It just happened!

203
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,900
Your credit card debt?

204
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,270
I also need it for living expenses. And for maintaining my dignity.

205
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,670
How do you end up spending that much money?

206
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,140
I might have hellish standards when it comes to men,

207
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,900
but I have godly standards when choosing products.

208
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,650
You only buy designer stuff.

209
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,410
Designer items are supposed to last years.

210
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,250
Years, my foot.

211
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,310
They're just expensive trend items.

212
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,580
They're resigner items, not designer items.

213
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,540
I can't use them after one season.

214
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,070
Thousands of new items come out every season.

215
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,280
It's time to say "bye" once everyone starts wearing them.

216
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,590
- Ga Eul.
 - What?

217
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,420
Are you going to tell me to buy gold with that money, too?

218
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,530
You know I divorced Seong Si Hun over being able to spend my own money, right?

219
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,210
"I could've bought my niece a car and my sister a house."

220
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:40,060
He said his family could live comfortably with the money I spend on shopping.

221
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,710
I'm spending my money any way I want to,but he treated me like a thief who stole his assets.

222
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,480
but he treated me like a thief who stole his assets.

223
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,140
I didn't know. That was the start for you, huh?

224
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,870
That was the start for you, huh?

225
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,480
You didn't know?

226
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,000
And you?

227
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,020
When did your love start to cool down?

228
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,240
Spending money on something

229
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,930
more important to me than money itself isn't a bad thing, right?

230
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,880
Of course.

231
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,640
All right.

232
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,340
All right, then.

233
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,690
All right, then. I'll do that.

234
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,890
Drink this!

235
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,080
Very nice. One, two...

236
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,300
A slight smile!

237
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Okay, nice. One, two...

238
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,080
Good. One, two...

239
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,730
It's a red lip concept.

240
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,680
We dressed her in a classy black dress to focus the attention on her lips.

241
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,800
And we tied her hair to the side so the lips could stand out.

242
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,630
What do you think?

243
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,430
It's nice.

244
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,700
Assistant  Geum went through a lot to book this studio at the last minute.

245
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,480
Ms. Yun So said this was the only time she was available.

246
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,130
I think Assistant Manager Geum has a crush on you.

247
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,630
He pretends not to, but he's aware of your every move.

248
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,270
I'm aware.

249
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,650
But I don't have the time for him right now.

250
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,980
I know you're aware.

251
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,430
When do you think you'll have the time?

252
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,330
Never.

253
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,200
Wow...

254
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,530
Department Head So is here.

255
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,390
You made it.

256
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,340
You told me it's a single earring.

257
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,140
Did you lose the other one?

258
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,110
You found this in Seong Si Hun's car?

259
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,560
Yes, Se Ju found it in his back seat.

260
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,460
She said you don't need to keep a distance from Tae Mi's dad.

261
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,550
That she understands that much.

262
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,870
Do you sit in the back when you get in his car?

263
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,090
- Team Leader Ryu.
 - Yeah?

264
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,230
- I'm going to make a call.
 - Sure.

265
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,410
You're here?

266
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,750
You found your way.

267
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,990
Your car was right outside, so I found it in no time.

268
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,390
I would've walked in circles otherwise.

269
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,630
You two must meet often.

270
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,090
You even recognize her car on the street.

271
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,010
We met regarding the testing center and ate a couple of times.

272
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,890
We have the same appetite.

273
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,090
Oh, appetite?

274
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,800
The type of appetite where you breathe rapidly and sweat after you eat?

275
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,170
I was told I needed to take a profile picture for the center's homepage.

276
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,240
I'll leave you two to talk.

277
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,210
Give it back!

278
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,340
It's a one-of-a-kind custom-made Charlotte Haute Couture.

279
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,680
What did you do in Seong Si Hun's car for this to be found in his backseat?

280
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,200
Do you avoid each other? To the point of sitting front and back?

281
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,190
Or did you overlap in the back?

282
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,390
What did you two do in his car that you found that in his backseat?

283
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,300
No way...

284
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,940
Did you two overlap in the back?

285
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,490
Take it. Although I don't know whose it is.

286
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,530
There's only one pair in Asia.

287
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,890
I also fell for that line and bought it.

288
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,050
That there's only one pair in Korea.

289
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,570
Which must mean one of them is fake.

290
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,440
 SD Code of Ethics

291
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,370
I'm leaving first.

292
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,390
- Go to bed early tonight, Eonni.
 - I will.

293
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,570
Good work.

294
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,390
You changed your wallet?

295
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,740
You quite like designer brands. Your watch is expensive, too.

296
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,340
I thought people who make donations don't splurge.

297
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,600
I saw it when I went to your house.

298
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,630
You make donations to multiple organizations.

299
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm sure you walk a lot while making in-person rounds.

300
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,450
Aren't those heels uncomfortable?

301
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,870
You usually insert Vibram soles once they get stretched out.

302
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,590
You must like this brand. You know they don't have soles.

303
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,510
Why? I'm not allowed to wear one million won shoes, paying 12-month installments?

304
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,070
It just seems like you have the same taste as I do.

305
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,790
I think so, as well.

306
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:45,010
Your house is exactly the type of house I wanted to live in all my life.

307
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,730
Do we really have the same taste?

308
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,360
 Please keep order!

309
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,930

The escalators are under maintenance.

310
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,060
 Please use the stairs.

311
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,350
Ajumma! Ajumma! Move aside!

312
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,110
Coming through!

313
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,380
Ajumma, move aside!

314
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,570
Coming through! Move aside!

315
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,420
 I feel like I'll get a cut at the slightest brush.

316
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,720
 It's all gentle and smooth here.

317
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,320
 I feel like I won't get a single cut even if I roll around on a blade.

318
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,920
Thank you.

319
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:02,770
 People decide who they'll be kind to based on who will spend money on whom.

320
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,540
 I thought everyone was like me and had fallen for your beauty.

321
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,410
 It's not for such a romantic reason.

322
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,240
They look at you because you're holding the bill.

323
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,890
The larger the amount, the larger their love will grow.

324
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,240
No, you're right. Everyone must've stared at you because you're handsome.

325
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,870
Not because you paid.

326
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,820
Is that lie the truth?

327
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,000
Is it true?

328
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,170
Your feet are hot even though you showered.

329
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,460
Did you walk here after work?

330
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,300
Yes.

331
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:40,740
You don't take your car because of the dashcam, right?

332
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,390
If I'm discovered, will you ...

333
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,680
be in danger?

334
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,680
It won't just finish with...

335
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,970
a divorce, will it?

336
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,610
To be honest...

337
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,450
I didn't tell you this ...

338
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,300
because I was afraid you might get hurt if I did.

339
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,480
Tell me!

340
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,600
There's no page 15.

341
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,840
And look at this.

342
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,120
"Namo Amitābhāyapple"?* That's a typo, isn't it?
(A Buddhist chant)

343
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,030
You're right.

344
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,660
It's not that outstanding.

345
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,870
If you leave the prop money to the printing shops, they can make almost anything.

346
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,500
It'll only be shown through a video, so it doesn't have to be exactly the same.

347
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,740
Which is why I leave it to my seonbae-nim, who owns a print shop.

348
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,180
So that's what bank employees are curious about.

349
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,620
You think we would make counterfeit money?

350
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,400
Hold on!

351
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,220
Have one before you go!

352
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,000
Say ah!

353
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,530
- I'm off.
 - See you later.

354
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,460
Welcome back.

355
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,760
You're late!

356
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,360
It's past 8 a.m. Wake up!

357
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,230
Oh, no...

358
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,420
I hope you're not preparing to leave.

359
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:02,100
I hope you're coming to me and not trying to leave me.

360
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,900
You can take your time.

361
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:11,750
You can take it very slowly, but be sure to come.

362
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,530
 SD Savings Bank

363
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,870
 Welcome.

364
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,880
Is that so?

365
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,070
Mr. Park Byeong Sik isn't interested in derivatives?

366
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,000
Yes, he just wants to have more CD accounts.

367
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,740
Is he laundering money?

368
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,150
The VIP clients might scold you for being late.

369
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,650
You said you'd go straight home today from the townhouse development, right?

370
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,400
Even if only one of them signs up, it's half success.

371
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,690
Fighting!

372
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,870
Sure.

373
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:18,710
Assistant Manager Na, I bought this.

374
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,250
We don't need to buy snacks for the babies, right?

375
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,450
We promised to give them vitamin jellies instead of savings interest.

376
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,250
Oh, right.

377
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,460
We can just buy them on the way.

378
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,830
One of our clients, an English kindergarten, holds a children's bank event once a year.

379
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,590
Looking out for potential customers, you could say.

380
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,740
Oh, I see.

381
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,330
This feels like a check.

382
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,810
Where did you buy this?

383
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,480
TQ Bookstore's art supply corner.

384
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,260
Does it?

385
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,680
Don't you know my fingers have eyes?

386
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,070
 Hold on.

387
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,150
 It's a counterfeit.

388
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,410
 Can you tell by just touching it?

389
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,960
 I've been doing this forever.

390
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,720
 I've been working here since I was in 12th grade.

391
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,710
Feel it!

392
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,710
It feels the same as a certificate of deposit, right?

393
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,950
I'm not sure.

394
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,370
You just said it felt like a check.

395
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,520
Checks and CDs are made from the same paper.

396
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,310
I guess there's a subtle difference in thickness.

397
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,180
Where should we leave these?

398
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,190
Come this way.

399
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,420
 Certificate of Deposit

400
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,430
 Certificate of Deposit

401
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,290
 Certificate of Deposit

402
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,120
 Certificate of Deposit

403
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,880
 Certificate of Deposit

404
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,700
 Documents Requiring Approval

405
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,260
 Certificate of Deposit

406
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,180
 Certificate of Deposit

407
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,730
 Welcome.

408
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,730
He has set up his own money laundry.

409
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,770
Hello.

410
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,630
Oh, yes.

411
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,000
 Certificate of Deposit

412
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,910
It will be used in an extreme close-up shot, so it needs to be precise.

413
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,610
Making this won't be a problem, but a bank stamp is like a federal stamp.

414
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,810
I'm not sure if I'll find the right paper.

415
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,600
It should be as similar as possible, right?

416
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,110
That would be great. Will it take long?

417
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,830
Hello.

418
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,830
Oh, right on time!

419
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,440
- Here.
- I thought it would take long. It's a relief.

420
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,550
Aigoo, it's still incomplete.

421
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,730
 Movie prop

422
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,390
 Movie prop

423
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,740
There's a protocol for movie props, too.

424
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,510
Or we could get in big trouble.

425
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,310
 Certificate of Deposit

426
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,010
I don't have anything to pack except this.

427
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:04,180
You'll get to use a travel suitcase like this one day.

428
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,750
This will probably be our first and last time, right?

429
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,150
I never imagined a dream like this could ever happen in my life.

430
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:21,370
Why do you think this is a dream better than reality?

431
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,170
It's comfortable, easygoing, and clean.

432
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:27,420
How can something this good be my reality?

433
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,310
Haven't you thought this could be the reality

434
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:37,010
and the world we need to return to is a miserable dream

435
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,880
that's worse than reality?

436
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,900
I wish that were true.

437
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,590
That this is reality and that's a dream.

438
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,790
My razor.

439
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,800
Hold on.

440
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,560
 Investment in film production

441
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,460
 Seven million won?

442
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,420
 He used 7 million won on room service?

443
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,720
Six bottles of champagne with caviar...

444
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,870
Your room service fee is quite high.

445
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:44,740
You ordered morning, lunch, and dinner every day.

446
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,890
Excuse me.

447
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,570
It was the same menu, but why is the price different?

448
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:54,840
The cost differs according to what time room service was ordered.

449
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,120
Will it be a single payment?

450
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,350
If I make this additional payment, the room charge

451
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:09,420
is covered by what I paid the other day, right?

452
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,070
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

453
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,660
 Ego of Inquiline

454
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,850
Good work.

455
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,770
Thank you.

456
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,830
I thought all hotel services were free.

457
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,800
 360,000 won?

458
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:55,290
It's 3,000 won per sheet?

459
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,950
Isn't there a discount for suite room guests?

460
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,360
 Three thousand won per sheet...

461
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,340
 Does 3,000 won make you that angry?

462
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,440
Come on!

463
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,260
It's a fun read to finish in one sitting, but it's difficult.

464
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,800
And Yun Gi's lines are written expressions.

465
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,860
- He's that type of character—
- It'll be hard

466
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,540
to even be a runner-up with this.

467
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,780
The prize money these days is about 5 million won, right?

468
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,910
We'll buy this for 5 million.

469
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,580
Considering your efforts.

470
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,450
Or you can edit more and submit it to the contest.

471
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,500
 - Did you read it? 
 - But content is all about timing.

472
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,680
 Just leave it to us for now,

473
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,590
- Do you know him?
- and write a new scenario.

474
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,700
No.

475
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,790
- Let's go.
- Yes.

476
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,750
I'll take care of you.

477
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,380
- Hello.
 - Welcome.

478
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,210
- I'm here.
 - Min Jae's here.

479
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,830
Yun So said she saw you at the film studio.

480
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,380
She did?

481
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,760
Did you sell your scenario?

482
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,480
How do you know Yun So's number? You weren't that close.

483
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,810
She's our company's exclusive model.

484
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,070
And I was closer to her than you were.

485
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,530
What did they say?

486
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,850
They said it's moving but not touching.

487
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,240
It's tear-jerking, but it doesn't resonate.

488
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,340
Aigoo! No soju today?

489
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,500
Forget about it. You still got a conversation in.

490
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,320
At least you got to talk in complete sentences.

491
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,810
Yeah, many people speak with descriptions and adjectives

492
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,320
when providing comments, and it makes no sense.

493
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,740
Why do you keep dragging out your graduation?

494
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,850
You're not Yun Min Jae.

495
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,730
Does the president's son not have tuition?

496
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,840
I'll graduate when I find something I want to do.

497
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,590
When you turn 40, you should—

498
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,090
- Marry you?
 - Cut ties with me.

499
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,010
- Why?
 - How could I stand the sight of you being homeless?

500
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,110
Min Jae's food is here.

501
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,820
- Enjoy your meal.
- Here ...

502
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,630
It smells fishy. That's enough.

503
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,940
I'm grabbing a drink.

504
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,740
Isn't that a designer brand?

505
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,410
 Sundaeguk*
(Korean blood sausage soup)

506
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,790
Thanks for the meal.

507
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:19,100
- How are you getting home?
- By walking.

508
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,740
It's dark.

509
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,550
Hey!

510
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,910
Let's go.

511
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,550
Go where?

512
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,520
- My house.
- Gosh.

513
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,330
Your parents don't like me.

514
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,150
That's not true!

515
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,300
And they're both sleeping, so they won't know if it's you or me.

516
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,670
How could I do that?

517
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,030
Hey! It's all right.

518
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,260
I'll take responsibility.

519
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:53,580
You stay at my house for a while, all right?

520
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,910
Let's bring your shoes in, though.

521
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,960
Take your shoes inside so Mom isn't surprised.

522
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,720
What a tear-jerking friendship.

523
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:13,540
Mom shouldn't be surprised. We shouldn't surprise my mom.

524
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,950
Who's this?

525
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,240
 Hey, Yun Min Jae. This is Yun So.

526
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,510
Hey, Yun So. It's been a while.

527
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,320
I heard you're shooting a movie.

528
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,220
Do you need my help?

529
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,760
Thanks for offering.

530
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,270
But well...

531
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:53,220
I can make time for exactly three months starting next month.

532
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,100
If you can make it work, I'll appear in your movie.

533
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,600
Really?

534
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,580
I'm hanging up if you can't believe me.

535
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,000
You're being serious?

536
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,630
 Yes.

537
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,440
That's how much I like your scenario.

538
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:11,960
It's the best scenario I've read in the past seven years.

539
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,690
Can you make three months work?

540
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,260
If you can, I'll do it no matter what.

541
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,590
Three months?

542
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:27,570
Hey, Han Dong Il! Yun So said she'll appear with no pay!

543
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,200
Three months. Three months...

544
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,130
Three months...

545
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,840
 Put on a new one when it falls off.

546
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,650
Monthly rent? Why?

547
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,650
 A client asked about renting a house for their child.

548
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:08,250
A client's child?

549
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,790
Why would you worry about that?

550
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,020
You're running all sorts of errands.

551
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,670
Anyhow, where the heck did she go? I was going to ask for a meal.

552
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,180
There are many foreigners, so the monthly rent is sometimes higher than the deposit.

553
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,690
And if the deposit is high, the monthly rent is low.

554
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,200
How much do you collect?

555
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,890
The kitchenware, too?

556
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,820
Then all you have to do is move in?

557
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,590
Yeah, it's usually like that.

558
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,530
 Je In's House

559
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,140
Where in the world do you think Seon Yeong went?

560
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,390
Yi Hwa, did you eat dinner yet?

561
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,800
Should we continue talking at your house?

562
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,560
My Eco-Life.

563
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,830
M.E.L. I'll give you the tray when it arrives, too.

564
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,480
You're going to run an online shopping mall on the side?

565
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,430
Why so tenacious? You're a doctor's wife.

566
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,480
It's not a side job.

567
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,330
I'm just advertising it through social media and getting paid for it.

568
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,960
Is it like 1,000 won per click or something?

569
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,580
I received 5 million won for M.E.L.

570
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,950
The vegan detergent that just came in is paying 6 million.

571
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,110
H-How much?

572
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,800
Six million.

573
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,050
Seon Yeong, let's go home.

574
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,070
Je In is asleep.

575
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,170
 The door is opening.

576
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,120
 The door is closing.

577
00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:00,050
You can't. It's all ripped.

578
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,450
Right

579
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,250
There...

580
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,150
Wait, Seon Yeong.

581
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,430
I drank, remember?

582
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,800
- Hold on.
- Did you leave something?

583
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,410
Je In fell asleep... early today.

584
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,400
Hold on!

585
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,330
She's so sexy.

586
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,360
This is a designer brand.

587
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,000
Mom, the ice cream! It's going to close soon.

588
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,950
All right.

589
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,790
What a waste when it's so clean.

590
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,570
I wish I could donate it.

591
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:37,940
It's about time you stop now.

592
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:43,060
Am I not good enough? Should I have my only daughter wear used clothes?

593
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,360
What she's wearing now was also handed down from Tae Mi.

594
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,930
Are hand-me-downs and used clothes from the streets the same?

595
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:03,650
Look. Brand new, right?

596
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,760
You're really doing this?

597
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,660
Do you even have content?

598
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,470
Yeah! She said it was 5 million per advertisement. She doesn't even pay tax.

599
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,960
I'm going to do social media, too.

600
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,960
How about side dishes? "5,000 won recipes" and "10,000 won recipes."

601
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,580
I'll post my side dishes every day.

602
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,460
Didn't you see Ms. Se Ju's photos?

603
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,620
They're all your dishes.

604
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,530
This one. Isn't this Choi Gi Hyeon's backyard?

605
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,370
The day we had lamb mutton.

606
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:45,060
You're right. They're all my dishes.

607
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,030
And she gets all the money for them?

608
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:04,130
- Thank you.
- Sure, take care.

609
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,430
That day...

610
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:20,160
That moment in that house... I prayed desperately.

611
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,830
"I hope this man would die.

612
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:29,040
Or rather...  this man must die."

613
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,100
You're going to produce your own movie?

614
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,960
Then you went back to that house for money?

615
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,820
Yun So said she'll appear with no pay.

616
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,750
My other friends said they'd help, too.

617
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,340
I think this is the opportunity of my lifetime.

618
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,310
But I had no time or place to go.

619
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,040
How much do you need?

620
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,380
How much?

621
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,800
So you won't have to return to that house.

622
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,350
Two hundred million... No...

623
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:36,010
No... I think I can make it work with even one hundred million.

624
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:14,900
Assistant Manager Na.

625
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,510
You're here?

626
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:19,530
You visit this house the last, huh?

627
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,490
Why are you so surprised?

628
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,720
We need to fill our branch's quota.

629
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,510
I'm here to guide you on the derivatives.

630
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:33,980
- Sir.
- Yes.

631
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,360
How much is the total for your CDs?

632
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,660
I'd like to show you the product earnings.

633
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,270
The CDs?

634
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:44,900
It's in the living room.

635
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,650
 I must find it. The forgery will be exposed.

636
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,690
- Please have another shot.
- Sure, sure.

637
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,210
I like this.

638
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,300
This is how a wench ought to act.

639
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,240
What's the use of a pretty face?

640
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,690
She should go with the flow.

641
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:25,610
- Please have another shot.
- Sure.

642
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,380
You're very healthy and strong for your age.

643
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:39,900
I'm going to use the restroom.

644
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,530
Have you taken a look?

645
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:20,570
Hey, I have... no interest in that.

646
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:23,540
Do you want another drink?

647
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,230
No, thank you. We'll get going then.

648
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:31,630
You can give us a call if you change your mind.

649
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,610
I drank, but it's like I didn't drink.

650
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,090
Such a nasty feeling.

651
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,750
Well, I'm still working.

652
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,490
Let's go!

653
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:52,300
Where are you going?

654
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:56,360
Aren't you going to handle my bank affairs?

655
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,640
What did you come for?

656
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:08,110
Forget it. Just leave.

657
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,970

658
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,280
What is this?

659
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,500
This. What's this?

660
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,080
I must've left my cell phone.

661
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,570
What's that?

662
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:09,970

663
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:21,590
 Pale Moon 
 Preview

664
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,260
 Are you talking about 3 billion won?

665
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,050
 Ms. Yu Yi Hwa didn't come to work?

666
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:28,410
 People can tolerate fishy and sweat-stained money,

667
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:31,040
 but there's money they absolutely can't tolerate.

668
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,100
 Wake up and take another good look at him.

669
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,620
 He's not a big deal, either.

670
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,830
 You're not even doing this for money.

671
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,940
 What's gotten into you?

672
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,750
 I ordered a proposal cake.

673
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,950
 For Yu Yi Hwa.
