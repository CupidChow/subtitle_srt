 Final Episode

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,150
 Lend me 10,000 won more.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,100
 You're strangely warm.

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,250
 If I just had money...

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,640
 How much do you need?

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,840
 Let's try our best.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,380
 Did you think you wouldn't get caught?

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,300
 - It's my money, right? Keep this money. 
 - Money that smells like pee.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,680
 I only borrowed it for a moment. This isn't bad.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,920
 Don't even try to run away.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,540
 So what if it's a lie?

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,530
 - What's your relationship? 
 - How much do you want?

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,340
 - I'm protecting you.
 - And you're a warm person.

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,340
 Because they only give it to you if you pay.

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,860
 There's nothing better than having money.

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,750
 It will be burned anyway.

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,400
 I made all that money. And I gave it to you!

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,640
 We're all going to hell.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,800
So, this bitch put me away in the mental hospital?

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,780
If you cut off her finger to get revenge, do you get money?

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,950
Why would you slaughter a goose that lays golden eggs?

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,700
We can extort at least 500 million won from her.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,860
I know where she lives, her workplace, and her husband.

31
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,520
Let's get as much out of her as possible and leave the country.

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,200
This woman is a private banker.

33
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,120
Private banker...

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
What if she reports us?

35
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,500
I'm telling you, I know all her weaknesses!

36
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,970
I'll take care of it.

37
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,300
Just give me two weeks!

38
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,100
Just don't be here when she wakes up.

39
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,370
So hurry up and run away.

40
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,760
Don't forget that I have this.

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,120
I'll wrap up things in Busan, so prepare the money!

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,560
And if you or the money or both are gone ... Then,

43
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,090
I'll burn it all up!

44
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,400
Mom...

45
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm hungry...

46
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm hungry...

47
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,680
It hurts...

48
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,600
I guess you're fine.

49
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
It was that man, right?

50
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,030
That mom is probably hungry.

51
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,330
She trembled all day without eating anything.

52
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,390
What are you planning to do?

53
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,160
Ms. Ru Ri, you're in so much danger right now.

54
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,960
Eonni, you should stay out of the country for a while.

55
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,220
Or confess to your husband and ask him to save you.

56
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,750
Ms. Ru Ri...

57
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,310
Why do you keep saying, "Ms. Ru Ri, Ms. Ru Ri"?

58
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,880
Are you going to starve that mom to death?

59
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,990
If you don't think this is it, you can back out.

60
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,870
That woman...

61
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,280
You're starting to feel this isn't it, right?

62
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,500
That's why you're so stressed out, right?

63
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,460
If the look in your eyes could kill...

64
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,970
It's uncomfortable, right?

65
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,390
That's because it's the truth.

66
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,900
The truth is always uncomfortable.

67
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,680
But...

68
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,440
it's better than falling over after forcing yourself to keep going with it.

69
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,030
Back out!

70
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,300
I liked her like crazy.

71
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,490
I liked her enough to drive me mad.

72
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,200
It was unbelievably good, but...

73
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,520
no... it is good.

74
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,400
it is good.

75
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,170
In interviews and shows, people keep saying things when they see you.

76
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,980
But be honest!

77
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,470
You don't like that someone might ask a question about her, right?

78
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,200
The truth is uncomfortable, yet simple.

79
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,580
That person you're grateful to

80
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,040
is nothing but a secret you want to hide, or a question you can't answer.

81
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,800
or a question you can't answer.   Nothing less or more.

82
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,400
Am I that bad of a bastard?

83
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,590
Hey, you idiot! Don't try to act so cool!

84
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,370
You're not special at all.

85
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,930
What's this? It's already over?

86
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,420
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wake up, wake up!

87
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,560
- Gosh, come on.
- You guys are so messed up.

88
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,230
We're just getting started. Come here.

89
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,330
That sounds great.

90
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,950
Give me a second.

91
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
 Ms. Jeong

92
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,500
Hello.

93
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,800
I promised to make a deposit for each member in order every month.

94
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,930
- Let me. Let me talk.  
  - Over the course of three months, as we discussed—

95
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,230
Ms. Yu Yi Hwa,   this is Professor Min.

96
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,640
Hello.

97
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,320
Did you have breakfast yet?

98
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,130
I guess everyone's together.

99
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,510
I've gotten all of our members' approval.

100
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,260
That's why we got together this morning.

101
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,920
I need a large sum of money right away.

102
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,300
 The account is under my name anyway,

103
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,650
so withdrawing money from my account

104
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,620
should be fine with the National Tax Service, right?

105
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,260
Yes, sure.

106
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,670
- How much were you thinking? 
 - There's a house I've looked into.

107
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:42,810
If I want to buy that house, I'll need 400 million won right away.

108
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,300
I'll transfer 400 million won by this weekend.

109
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,030
Really? Still?

110
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,730
The recapitalization was 30 billion won, right? ( New money came into the company through debt or new investment)

111
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,350
I put it in a special account for now.

112
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,470
 30 billion won...

113
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,700
You stored it in a special account for 200 days?

114
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,800
You would earn so much interest if you put it in a savings account.

115
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,890
 Special deposit...

116
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,970
 Special Account

117
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,430
 SD Savings Bank: Do you wish to withdraw the designated sum from the special account?

118
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,830
 Confirm

119
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,490
Hello.

120
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,980
 Certificate of Deposit

121
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,800
I look forward to working with you in the future as well.

122
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,780
What brings you here today?

123
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,820
I noticed that you've done something quite "exciting."

124
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,450
 Movie prop

125
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
You're quite bold.

126
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,110
Chairman Park Byeong Sik doesn't know.

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,500
Is there something you want?

128
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,020
For you to do a good job.

129
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,800
 Park Byeong Sik

130
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,870
The passcode is today's date,

131
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,160
and these are the business license, corporate registration copy, corporate seal certificate,

132
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,520
and the power of attorney.

133
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,360
Come in.

134
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,860
It's 1 billion won for now.

135
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,370
It also contains account numbers for accounts in Panama, Laos, and Thailand.

136
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,880
Please deposit the money split into these accounts.

137
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,930
I'll come every week for the time being.

138
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,240
Every week at the same time with the same amount.

139
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,060
You're a paper company, I see.

140
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,580
Yes.

141
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,300
I'm happy to make things easier for you than when you were working alone.

142
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,370
The profit will be greater than when you were playing

143
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,480
with Chairman Park Byeong Sik's money, right?

144
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,010
Even if I refused, you wouldn't be able to tell the police.

145
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,390
If you want to keep playing with Chairman Park Byeong Sik's money, go ahead.

146
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,520
All I need is a company under Park Byeong Sik's name, anyway.

147
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,970
However, regarding the money we bring,

148
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,590
it won't be good if you play with that.

149
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,650
It's their money.

150
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,560
I hope the pay isn't disappointing.

151
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,690
 SD Savings Bank, VIP Lounge

152
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,340
So... you want me to pay a rental fee for your grandfather's painting

153
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,790
hanging in my living room, Eonni?

154
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,560
Now?

155
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,200
Look, Eonni!

156
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,350
Even if what you're saying is right, how is that yours, Eonni?

157
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,830
When your father went bankrupt, I believe he gave up on all of the inheritance.

158
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,550
The painting hanging in your house

159
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:21,310
was something my grandfather passed onto me in advance when I was young,

160
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,700
so it's my possession regardless of my father's bankruptcy.

161
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,370
I mean, what I'm saying is...

162
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,440
if you suddenly insist after not caring about it all this time,

163
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,250
will that become yours, Eonni?

164
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,130
Do you even have a contract?

165
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,090
It's a contract about ownership of the painting

166
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,380
and a legal document about lending it to the Cheongmyeong Museum of Art.

167
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,540
And your grandfather ... personally kept the painting without paying anything.

168
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Madam.

169
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,960
Vice President, I'll be going then.

170
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,700
- Yeah, great work.
- Thank you.

171
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,350
Are you going to keep using Choi Gi Hyeon?

172
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,690
Well, yes.

173
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,060
I like fools.

174
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,630
You can see right through them.

175
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,850
Is their relationship good?

176
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,100
Are they not getting divorced?

177
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,310
Why do you suddenly ask that?

178
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,070
She says to pay her a rental fee...

179
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,260
for the amount she didn't receive for the past 30 years.

180
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,820
It is cheaper than the current rate, but ...

181
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,580
You're upset, I see.

182
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,080
After calculating the amount and paying her,

183
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,360
I'll need to teach her a lesson...

184
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,800
in a big way.

185
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,160
About how she should ... live from now on.

186
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,210
 Director Yun Min Jae

187
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,380
 Director Yun Min Jae

188
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,590
 I'm in the writing room. Will you stop by for a moment?

189
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,660
 We need to move out of the writing room tomorrow morning.

190
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,030
 Please give me one hour of your time. I have something I need to tell you.

191
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,350
 - Daebak! 
 - It's so pretty!

192
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,320
 Wow, it's so pretty!

193
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,960
 How is it so pretty?

194
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,520
 Seriously. It's so nice.

195
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,030
 So nice...

196
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,610
What are you two talking about?

197
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,470
Min Jae, I saw you came out on Vogue.

198
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,730
I heard you're a fixed cast for a movie program. Give us some autographs before you go!

199
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,760
I'll do it all for you.

200
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,900
- I'll see you later.
- All right, see you later.

201
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,370
Min Jae, that's mine, right?

202
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,940
Let's go over there and drink.

203
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,000
Give me one second.

204
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,700
- Hurry back.
 - Yes.

205
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,840
I thought it would be a quiet place since you asked me to come here.

206
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,120
 Awesome!

207
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,090
Next week, I have a big contract coming up.

208
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:18,370
Did you start a new project with the money from the writing room?

209
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,560
This isn't all of it, but I'll pay you back monthly.

210
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,570
I really did get the investment.

211
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,170
I was going to use that money to pay off the rent, but things turned out like this.

212
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,370
but things turned out like this.

213
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,140
What about school?

214
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,530
You were going back to school to complete the semester.

215
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,020
- What about graduation?
 - For us, projects...

216
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,560
Projects are more important than a diploma.

217
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,740
Nice!

218
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,000
I want to move out of there.

219
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,290
It's nice when I'm with you.

220
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,730
It's really nice, but sometimes ...

221
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,920
I feel like I've become Moonstruck Pierrot.

222
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:46,320
More than the ten good moments, the one moment when I feel pathetic ... that is so...

223
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,170
really...

224
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,700
Allow me ...

225
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,270
to leave you.

226
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,680
It's an early morning flight.

227
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,830
You would feel better if I stayed a bit longer at home,

228
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,130
but I also have a business to tend to before I go.

229
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:08,080
It's more fitting for someone in my position to leave from the office.

230
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,780
It's something that fits your position.

231
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,560
You see.

232
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,590
The position makes the person.

233
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,380
You've become much wiser.

234
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,990
You will never change and continue to be like this.

235
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,240
Yes, that's right.

236
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,150
Please send it to that account.

237
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,790
This is ridiculous, Eonni!

238
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,800
 Contract for Artwork Rental

239
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,260
 Send 2.16 billion won to Yu Yi Hwa?

240
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,300
 Sent 2.16 billion won to Yu Yi Hwa.

241
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,500
Is there a way to provoke a bank employee?

242
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,760
Make a complaint about a civil servants and report bank employees for embezzlement?

243
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,270
I'm not sure.

244
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,680
Director, it's been a while.

245
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,440
Have you been well?

246
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,160
Well, the thing is...

247
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,050
I've heard a strange rumor about your EC Center.

248
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,640
Should I send it to the Laos account like last time?

249
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,410
Send it to Curaçao!

250
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,070
You're a woman of virtue.

251
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,070
You don't ask me where the money comes from.

252
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,790
Money is just money.

253
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,860
Give you time?

254
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,560
Someone who asks for time books a KTX ticket?

255
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,290
Stupid bitch!

256
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,240
After living with me all that time,

257
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,330
you didn't know there was a spying app on your phone?

258
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,560
Hold still!

259
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,030
Smile!

260
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,330
 Bring me 300 million won!

261
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,390
 You'd better make it quick.

262
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,200
 Bring your house deed if you have to.

263
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,560
 I don't have time.

264
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,030
 Passport

265
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,930
Where is Ms. Yu Yi Hwa?

266
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,370
Where do I need to go?

267
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,580
 Crazy bitch!

268
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,410
 Open my mailbox tomorrow morning!

269
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,760
 What is this money?

270
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,190
 It's 50 million won. I'll send you more later.

271
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,960
 Leave now, Ms. Ru Ri.

272
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,090
 I should have just left with that money.

273
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,590
 Yes, it's 600 million won.

274
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,460
 She must come to Gyeongju Bank personally to withdraw it.

275
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,670
Gyeongju?

276
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,700
We should go.

277
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,100
I have so much money buried there.

278
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,740
Right, Mom?

279
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,090
We should get that money.

280
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,120
I'm here.

281
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,140
Where are you?

282
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,000
Money!

283
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,090
It's money! Money, money, money!

284
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,060
Money!

285
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,770
Run! Now's your chance!

286
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,060
 In the middle of Jeongwon-gu, there was a shower of gold.

287
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,450
 Today, a woman in the airway at Guil Intersection in Jungwon-gu

288
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,690
 smashed the glass wall with the fire emergency hammers stationed inside,

289
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,000
 and sprinkled 50,000 won bills—

290
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,600
You will move today.

291
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,880
I smelled pee.

292
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,390
But that money...

293
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:46,560
started making my child smell like butter.

294
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,950
Even if my pocket stunk like something rotten,

295
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:57,580
my child's body... smelled like a rich person.

296
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,240
Everything's all right.

297
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,500
We have to go to Gyeongju.

298
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,950
We were going to withdraw 600 million won and go on a fun trip.

299
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,750
You've done so very well. This much!

300
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,750
You did so well!

301
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,300
Did I...

302
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,390
do really well?

303
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,180
Sure!

304
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,080
You're such a good girl.

305
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,890
You've wanted to wear this before.

306
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,880
You said 1 million won wasn't enough to get it and begged me to buy it for you.

307
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,010
Try wearing it.

308
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,540
Are you going out, Chairman?

309
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,850
Hey.

310
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,380
You sure you're not breaking this instead of fixing it?

311
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,160
There was a leak, so I'm just going to change the hose.

312
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,900
How do I trust a damn beggar's words?

313
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,600
Hey, Chairman.

314
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,930
I repaired your boiler and replaced your sink last time.

315
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:59,480
You still haven't paid me for that, so if you could please pay me today—

316
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,310
Bastard, have you lost your mind?

317
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,660
Are you saying I'm not paying you money?

318
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,940
This is not even worth a single meal! You bastard.

319
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,230
For me, that would pay for my meals for more than a month.

320
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,920
Pay for your meals, my foot.

321
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,670
Don't hit my head!

322
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,690
Hey, you bastard! I'll just compensate you for it.

323
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,700
Wait a second! Did you pick a fight with me to get money out of me?

324
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,600
Is that it? How much should I give you? How much? How much do you want?

325
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,940
- How much?
- Damn it!

326
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,120
What the hell...

327
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,200
Don't pull it out!

328
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,080
Don't... don't pull it out!

329
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,270
I pulled out the knife.

330
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,610
He won't die.

331
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,400
I pulled out the knife!

332
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,750
Call an ambulance!

333
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,190
Are you all right?

334
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,370
What are you doing? Call an ambulance!

335
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,630
This is 112*, right?
 (Number for the police)

336
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,450
The police, right?

337
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,100
We're at Geuring Townhouse.

338
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,960
Please send the police right away.

339
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,040
The police. Hurry, hurry!

340
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,000
 AF Group

341
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,020
Hey, you.

342
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,380
Don't you miss Ms. Yi Hwa?

343
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,580
You always stay outside and don't go home.

344
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,040
Don't you think of her when you eat something tasty overseas?

345
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,090
Don't you worry about her when there's a thunderstorm?

346
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,110
No, I'm not worried.

347
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,300
She's my woman, even if the world turns upside down. So, why?

348
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,090
Yes.

349
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,670
How did you...

350
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,470
What is this?

351
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,380
You just had to... see me?

352
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,520
Is this the first time we've been apart for six months?

353
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,020
I have something to tell you.

354
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,330
Oh, all right.

355
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,910
Thank you for taking care of me and my parents.

356
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,030
I really mean it.

357
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,100
I've lived with you with those feelings of gratitide, Choi Gi Hyeon.

358
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,320
Should we ... get our wedding bands redone?

359
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,970
When I leave tomorrow, I'll be a general manager,

360
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,340
but when I come back, I'll be a president.

361
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,850
So you should prepare yourself, too.

362
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,470
Up to now ...

363
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,060
you've done more than enough for me.

364
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,680
He got lucky. What about the culprit's description or fingerprint?

365
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,860
Well, the glass was all broken.

366
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,840
What about the emergency hammer? You still haven't found it?

367
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,980
Not yet.

368
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,300
If she was wearing gloves,

369
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,820
- you wouldn't find a fingerprint anyway—
- Come on...

370
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,030
It's possible that the culprit ran away with it.

371
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,400
Hyeongnim!

372
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,220
It was here.

373
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,120
Get the fingerprints!

374
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:29,010
 Welcome to Incheon International Airport.

375
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,850
Hey, lazy bum, do some work!

376
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,810
All right.

377
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,880
 Merry Christmas

378
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,090
 Reject call

379
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,000
Hey, what should I do with this? Do I throw it away?

380
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,990
 Put on a new one when it falls off.

381
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,900
 That day

382
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,060
 Accept call

383
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,560
What is it?

384
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,870
If anyone asks you about me, just tell them you don't know anything.

385
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,400
just tell them you don't know anything.

386
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,800
 Say you don't know anything.

387
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,800
What are you talking about?

388
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,870
Just say you met me a few times because I was nice to you.

389
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,410
That you really don't know anything.

390
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,450
Where are you right now?

391
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,700
It was just an accident. An accident.

392
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,760
Apart from that, nothing happened between us.

393
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,560
So you don't know anything, Min Jae.

394
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,600
What are you talking about right now?

395
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,610
Why are you doing this?

396
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,420
I'll hang up now.

397
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,900
You'll be fine.

398
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,980
 Are you going to call this a coincidence?

399
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,610
 No.

400
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,660
 It's an accident.

401
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,160
Yun Min Jae!

402
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,090
Hey, where are you going?

403
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,430
 I must be crazy.

404
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,860
 No Entry - Police Line - Under Investigation

405
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,390
She looks familiar.

406
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,230
The results for the fingerprints on the emergency hammer came out.

407
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,890
It's an employee at SD Savings Bank.

408
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,330
Yu Yi Hwa.

409
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,490
I thought she seemed strangely intense.

410
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,110
They caught somebody earlier.

411
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,250
Supposedly, there was a drug offender.

412
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,100
- A drug offender?
- Yeah. I guess he got caught while running away.

413
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,660
Why are you outside? It's chilly.

414
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,950
Cheers!

415
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,890
Cheers!

416
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,550
"Let's move."

417
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,620
You're going to say that, right?

418
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,550
You'll tell me to quit my job, too, right?

419
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,340
You'll tell me to live according to our standards, right?

420
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,960
And you'll say no, right?

421
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,250
At our house, there was a persimmon tree,

422
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,180
but one day, a branch struck by lightning caught on fire.

423
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,310
We put it out quickly.

424
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,360
And thought everything was fine,

425
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,470
but it started withering the next day, and it died.

426
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:25,460
Why? You said you put out the fire quickly.

427
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:30,020
The roots were rotting away, but nobody knew.

428
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,950
We only put out the fire that was visible.

429
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,430
Why didn't you know?

430
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,680
Since we thought all was well as long as

431
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,520
there were many branches, and the leaves didn't fall.

432
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,360
Seon Yeong.

433
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:53,410
I wonder if we started rotting away from somewhere out there.

434
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,020
What do you mean, why?

435
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:20,680
If I had a Misaire bag, I would get so many likes and subscribers.

436
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,900
You tried to buy it under my credit for that reason?

437
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,630
A Misaire? Are you a fraudster?

438
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,420
I want my mom to be happy, even if it means committing fraud!

439
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,040
You can buy me this if you don't want to make me a fraud.

440
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,400
What if my mom says she'll leave the house because she's not happy like you?

441
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,720
 - Mommy...
- I'm not happy for a single moment

442
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,400
 in this house, where I can't do or buy what I want!

443
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,440
 All right, t-then leave!

444
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,800
 If you leave, leave by yourself!

445
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,050
 And you. You are the guilty spouse!

446
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:06,680
 Mommy, don't go ...

447
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,510
You remembered that?

448
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,530
You were so young back then ...

449
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:29,600
I can't live without Mom!

450
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,090
So, buy me the Misaire!

451
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,770
I'm so sorry...

452
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,120
So, buy me Misaire!

453
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,830
It was my fault...

454
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,500
So, buy me Misaire!

455
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,040
I'm so sorry ...

456
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,800
 Suvarnabhumi Airport

457
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:45,110
If I throw all this away, how much money will it be to buy it all again?

458
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,250
Luxury brand, my foot.

459
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:52,570
The trend doesn't last more than a season, though they cost millions of won!

460
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:59,680
I should live the rest of my life in the normal fashion with perhaps high-end jewelry?

461
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,210
Jewelry is an actual asset.

462
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,400
Should I switch over to that?

463
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,730
Gosh, wake up, Ryu Ga Eul.

464
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,630
Gosh, Ryu Ga Eul.

465
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,000
Grandma!

466
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,700
- It's turning well.
- She looks just like you.

467
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,480
Does she? She does look very much like me, right?

468
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,120
It's going around so well. So pretty.

469
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,910
It turns so well, Je In.

470
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,770
The neighborhood is pretty, Seon Yeong.

471
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,700
The air is nice since it's the countryside.

472
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:44,370
Guk, this is not the countryside, but a new city!

473
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:47,500
Right, a new city.

474
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:52,560
What's the evidence that Yi Hwa was the culprit?

475
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,390
We found Ms. Yu Yi Hwa's fingerprint on the emergency hammer.

476
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,830
Where do you think Yi Hwa is right now?

477
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:13,160
There's no way she's the culprit?

478
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,790
There's no reason for my Yi Hwa to do that.

479
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,760
If she's the culprit, Yi Hwa probably intentionally took the blame.

480
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,340
Intentionally took the blame?

481
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,430
Do you know how strange and warm Yi Hwa is?

482
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,540
She would even take the blame for murder and more.

483
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,650
Money will be transferred monthly from the trust.

484
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,050
We've confirmed the security deposit of 300 million won.

485
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,100
When should we come to pick up the resident?

486
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,890
Please prepare to pick her up this week.

487
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:09,990
She was very friendly and good at her job.

488
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:14,020
Well, she did grow some of my assets for me.

489
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,020
Was your money ever missing?

490
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,720
Money?

491
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,970
My money?

492
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,640
You think I would be here if that was the case?

493
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,710
Well, it's been a long time since I've entrusted all of my assets to the trust.

494
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,150
You should've just taken everything with you...

495
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,410
You should've taken me with you, too.

496
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,460
Why! Why!

497
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,840
Just why!

498
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,800
Why...

499
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,970
Why...

500
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,760
Why...

501
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,900
W-What were you lacking...

502
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,510
Honey...

503
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,310
Honey...

504
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,120
Honey...

505
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,790
Pardon?

506
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:47,090
I was embarrassed, so I never showed it,

507
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,830
but we only pretended to be a married couple.

508
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:55,020
People around you say that you two had a very good relationship.

509
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,190
Take a look at my entry to Korea records!

510
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:03,330
I was on overseas business trips for more than half the year.

511
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:06,800
We don't even have children,

512
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,100
so I was thinking of filing for divorce once my term overseas ended.

513
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:15,360
If that wasn't the case, do you think I would have come back after completing all six months?

514
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,300
I would've come back right away when things happened.

515
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,870
It looks like you cried.

516
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,980
It's allergies.

517
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:43,570
By chance, do you know where she may have used the money she embezzled?

518
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:50,580
I saw in her credit card records that she bought a lot of men's clothes.

519
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,890
I guess she had a man.

520
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,130
I told you.

521
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:08,580
Yu Yi Hwa and I only pretended to be a married couple. We weren't actually one.

522
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:14,190
How many times must I tell you?

523
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,950
Which station do you belong to?

524
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,700
Gosh, this will take some time.

525
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,720
I think this will have to go through the National Tax Service and financial institutions.

526
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,130
The CEO of Samguk Holdings says the 500 million won she spread has nothing to do with him,

527
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:34,090
and the Gangnam noblesse women say they didn't entrust money to her at all.

528
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:36,100
They say there's no problem.

529
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,480
But Professor Min filed a complaint.

530
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,250
I know.

531
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,700
I heard Professor Min was the fund manager of the Gangnam noblesse group.

532
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,210
Was she victimized all by herself?

533
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,290
Or their money was questionable in nature.

534
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:55,710
Supposedly, that noblesse group was full of political and business leaders.

535
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,350
What about the loan shark, Park Byeong Sik?

536
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:03,530
I heard Yu Yi Hwa raised her work performance evaluation with Park Byeong Sik's money.

537
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,120
There's no way that loan shark got his money stolen

538
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,510
and is pretending not to know, right?

539
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,340
He says he doesn't know.

540
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,760
 I put a bit more in than what's written in your diary.

541
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,450
 You don't like change.

542
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:46,200
 Money spent on in-laws

543
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,600
This is a nice pair.

544
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,600
Baht! Only baht!

545
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,600
She must be crazy.

546
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Look. She gave me her whole wallet.

547
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,420
1,300 baht.

548
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:48,640
Dirty. No. Dirty.

549
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,560
Next!

550
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,780
You know, the woman who ran away with hundreds of millions of won?

551
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,430
How do you carry around hundreds of millions of won?

552
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:12,630
Right. But where do you think she's hiding right now?

553
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:15,670
She may not be...

554
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,440
hiding.

555
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,590
Hey, 100,000 won!

556
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,370
Shall I change the money for you?

557
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,090
Pardon me.

558
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,700
I saw you earlier at the money exchange stand.

559
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,380
You didn't get to change 100,000 won.

560
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,400
50,000 won is 1,300 baht,

561
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,380
but I'll give you 1,500 baht for it.

562
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:43,390
I have exactly 3,000 baht right now, but I'm going back to South Korea tomorrow.

563
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:45,860
It's bothersome to get it exchanged, anyway.

564
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,220
So mean.

565
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,300
I mean, that money exchanger.

566
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,900
Dirty money is still money.

567
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,950
How could he callously deny you just because the money was slightly torn?

568
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,510
He should've just done it for you. Right?

569
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,660
Hey! Just leave her alone and mind your business.

570
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,880
Should we just take the reward money in Chiang Rai?

571
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,980
Reward money?

572
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,420
Chiang Rai is the golden triangle of national borders.

573
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,920
We'll go through Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand on land.

574
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,370
Wanted criminals for crossing borders are a dime a dozen.

575
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,530
If we can catch just one, jackpot!

576
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,400
Jackpot, my foot.

577
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,340
But...

578
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,600
we've met somewhere before, right?

579
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,000
All right. I'll pretend not to have seen you.

580
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,800
There are many people like that here.

581
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,580
 So, is she with you right now?

582
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,300
She's in her room.

583
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,950
She's bringing the money to exchange.

584
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:04,330
Sleep by yourself tonight.

585
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,870
If things go well, I might cancel my flight,

586
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,900
and stay a week longer.

587
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,920
Are you all right?

588
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,440
Stop!

589
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,650
I said stop!

590
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,460
No!

591
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,640
No!

592
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,510
No!

593
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,460
No. No!

594
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,070
No!

595
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:33,580
No, no!

596
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,350
Who the hell are you?

597
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:41,190
Just enjoy your tour vacation and go home!

598
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:43,400
You don't understand, but you know what this is, right?

599
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,130
You don't understand, but you know what this is, right?

600
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,600
You could die!

601
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,960
Don't look!

602
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,370
Don't look!

603
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:52,450
No, don't look!

604
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,600
Leave the kid and get lost!

605
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,600
Freeze! Hands up!

606
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,670
Police!

607
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:35,030
This is that woman, right?

608
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,640
This is that woman, right?

609
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,040
It is that woman.

610
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,690
Send out the Wanted announcement to all stations and find her.

611
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,970
She could be connected to the drug cartel.

612
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,110
Got it, sir.

613
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:46,040
 Interpol Wanted | Yu Yi Hwa

614
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:54,000
Hey, Choi Gi Hyeon left this behind, too.

615
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,240
I can't believe it.

616
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,780
You can't believe it?

617
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,190
To think Choi Gi Hyeon is a president.

618
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,100
I heard he became part of the Chairman's line.

619
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,600
He's quite unpredictable.

620
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,320
W-What? That's what's so unbelievable to you?

621
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,760
Hyeong, seriously.

622
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,580
You're so messed up.

623
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,890
Aigoo, seriously.

624
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:43,840
Hello? W-Where are you right now?

625
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,860
Why are you so shocked?

626
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,260
Hey, how could you leave by yourself after screwing someone over like this—

627
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,740
Whom did I screw over?

628
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,230
Think about it carefully.

629
01:03:56,230 --> 01:04:01,610
I did suggest it to you, but you had the right to refuse.

630
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,110
Why did you screw yourself over by not refusing?

631
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,370
I think I'll go back and be serious about writing a dissertation.

632
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,090
I told you.

633
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:16,670
My major is anthropology.

634
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,990
Hey, by chance...

635
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:23,790
you won't mention my actual name on that dissertation, right?

636
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,870
Not sure.

637
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:38,040
Should we ... attach a ribbon to the front door so Yi Hwa comes back?

638
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,270
What color did Yi Hwa like again?

639
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:44,280
What color did she like again?

640
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,750
How about we just eat the food that Yi Hwa likes together once a week

641
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:53,250
and pray that Yi Hwa will be all right?

642
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:56,270
What did Yi Hwa like?

643
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,840
What did Yi Hwa like?

644
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:11,470
- We... 
 - ...really didn't know Yi Hwa well.

645
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,690
We don't.

646
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:16,100
We didn't know anything about her.

647
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:20,310
Since she always said she was fine ...

648
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,440
since that's Yi Hwa ...

649
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,750
What's real?

650
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:30,870
The Yi Hwa that we know ... or the Yi Hwa that the world knows?

651
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:34,780
That I love her.

652
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:40,460
That I love Yu Yi Hwa.

653
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:43,690
That is real.

654
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:48,250
Yes, you're right.

655
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,630
That is real.

656
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:56,360
I love Yu Yi Hwa, too.

657
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:49,800
 I'll flow on.

658
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:10,350
Mom, Mom!

659
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:12,660
Mom!

660
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,120
- Nok! 
- Mom!

661
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,740
Nok!

662
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:17,480
Nok!

663
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,370
Nok!

664
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,850
My son!

665
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,740
Nok...

666
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,480
Where were you, my son!

667
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,700
Do you know how much I missed you?

668
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,860
 Guesthouse

669
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,750
Do you want to be a soccer player?

670
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,520
Yes, yes. Football.

671
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,580
I see.

672
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,630
Mom.

673
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:51,940
I'm hungry.

674
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,710
Hungry again? You just ate.

675
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,210
I'll make you food. Go wash your hands.

676
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:59,100
How often do I have to wash?

677
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,760
- Yi Hwa.
- Yeah?

678
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,080
- Upstairs.
- Upstairs?

679
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,270
Guest coming soon.

680
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,840
Clean the room, please.

681
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,990
Yes, ma'am.

682
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:34,070
This is your room.

683
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,750
Oh, no...

684
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,380
Are you all right?

685
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,930
It's okay.

686
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,760
It's okay.

687
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,910
It's okay.

688
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,440
It's okay.

689
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:36,500
I just want to die.

690
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,240
They're going to kill me anyway.

691
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,100
I rather kill myself.

692
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,820
You're running away?

693
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,970
It's okay.

694
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:04,350
It's all right.

695
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:28,990
You don't have to stop here.

696
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,820
You can also...

697
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,610
keep on...

698
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:48,290
flowing.

699
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:06,460
Mom! Look over there! The sun is setting.

700
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:10,580
The sunset is so beautiful!

701
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,810
The moon is rising.
