1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,847
1 HOUR AFTER THE ZOMBIE OUTBREAK
AT THE TEMPORARY QUARANTINE FACILITY

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,182
It's safer on the second floor.

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,100
I'm scared.

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,644
I don't feel good about this.

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,612
Be careful.

6
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,281
Close the door.

7
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,992
- Close it.
- Close the door.

8
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:34,909
Close the door.

9
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,911
Close the door.

10
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,956
EMERGENCY! THE BAG IS CAUGHT IN THE DOOR

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,209
What's wrong?

12
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,674
Oh, no!

13
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,342
Hurry!

14
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,677
No way!

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,473
No!

16
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,476
Go!

17
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,689
Unbelievable.

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,695
It's behind you.

19
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,282
QUEST: DEFEAT THE ZOMBIES
AND ESCAPE THE ENDLESS LOOP OF DEATH

20
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,659
Be careful! Go!

21
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,660
The cabinet!

22
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,578
What is it?

23
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,871
What's this cabinet for?

24
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,998
I don't know. Behind you!

25
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,501
STORAGE CABINETS
ARE PLACED THROUGHOUT HALL

26
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,753
EACH IS LARGE ENOUGH TO FIT A PERSON

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,088
Careful! Behind you!

28
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,049
Keep running.

29
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:31,966
Don't stop.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,009
Watch your step.

31
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,135
This is endless.

32
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:40,099
A LOOPED SPACE WITH
THE START AND END CONNECTED

33
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,938
THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE
EXCEPT IN THE CABINETS

34
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,315
There's another one here.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,525
They are coming.

36
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,860
THE ENTRANCE IS BLOCKED BY THE ZOMBIES

37
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,028
Watch out!

38
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:53,822
What?

39
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,866
THE CABINET IS LOCKED

40
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,954
We need to get in.

41
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,458
QUEST OBJECTIVES: FIND THE KEYS,
HIDE IN THE CABINETS, ESCAPE THE FLOOR

42
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,668
We need to find the keys?

43
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,585
The key box.

44
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,711
Look for the key.

45
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,296
MUST FIND THE CABINET KEYS

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,339
Find the key.

47
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,799
The key!

48
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,052
Where's the key?

49
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,428
Thank you!

50
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,139
Do you see it on the zombies?

51
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,269
- The key box!
- Is this it?

52
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,312
It's here.

53
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,064
FIND THE KEYS

54
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,774
Open them one by one.

55
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,900
One by one.

56
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,818
Did you find it?

57
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,695
- I'm looking around.
- Unlock it.

58
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,821
Try unlocking it.

59
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,158
- It's unlocked.
- Is it?

60
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,160
I'll leave it ajar here.

61
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,536
- He unlocked it.
- Get in.

62
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,662
Get in.

63
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,164
- Is it unlocked?
- Yes!

64
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,707
I have the keys.

65
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,875
Wait, close it.

66
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,134
NICE! HIDING IS EFFECTIVE

67
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,344
TAEYEON, get in there.

68
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,763
You'll find the keys there.

69
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,307
Where?

70
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,558
Get in now!

71
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,517
Over here.

72
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,111
I'm scared.

73
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,573
THE ZOMBIES CAN'T OPEN THE CABINETS

74
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,243
- Let's go.
- Okay!

75
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,369
Turn it.

76
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,704
- Okay.
- To the left.

77
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,788
Okay!

78
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,832
FIERCE ORDERS FROM THE FORMER SERGEANT!

79
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,090
How many cabinets?

80
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,550
How many?

81
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,053
One, two, three, four, five!

82
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,221
- Five?
- I see five.

83
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,430
There are six of us.

84
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,348
Run.

85
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,061
THE ENTRANCE IS BLOCKED,
AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH CABINETS

86
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,564
IF YOU DON'T HIDE, YOU'RE IN DANGER!

87
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,774
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

88
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,490
We need one more to open.

89
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,118
THE LAST CABINET ISN'T OPENING EASILY

90
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,007
Let's just catch them.

91
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,425
Let's catch them.

92
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,428
TAEYEON TAKES A NEW APPROACH!

93
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,557
Let's lock that zombie in.

94
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,934
- Lock it in here.
- What?

95
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,020
Leave the two open.

96
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,147
Leave them open right now.

97
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,274
They're open.

98
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,321
More zombies incoming.

99
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,698
Hurry this way.

100
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,616
MORE ZOMBIES APPEAR OVER TIME

101
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,788
We have to put the zombies in the cabinet.

102
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,581
Let's lock them in here.

103
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,751
THEY'RE CHOOSING TO FIGHT INSTEAD

104
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,463
We've got to get him in.

105
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,591
Teamwork.

106
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,264
THEY CHOOSE TO DITCH THEIR TEAMMATE

107
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,817
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, ANDRE RUSH

108
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,206
HE TAKES ON BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY

109
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,342
Chef!

110
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,302
Run!

111
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,386
Andre, run!

112
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,309
FIGHTING 3 ZOMBIES
IS DIFFICULT EVEN FOR HIM

113
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,563
We need to lure them away.

114
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,481
Why don't we…

115
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,565
Leave it open.

116
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,775
Okay, got it.

117
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,110
Got it.

118
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,863
IT'S NOT EASY TO LOCK THE ZOMBIES AWAY

119
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,866
Hold the door open.

120
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,826
Open it.

121
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,538
HE'S NOT FALLING FOR IT AGAIN

122
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,540
- Block them.
- Good idea.

123
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,667
Wait.

124
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,044
Wait, turn it this way.

125
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,255
Let go of it and turn it.

126
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,299
Let's turn it around.

127
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,844
Turn it around.

128
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,262
Turn it now.

129
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,059
Hey.

130
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,353
Sae-ho, just go.

131
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,354
Leave it and go.

132
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,522
Let go of it.

133
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,981
Hey! There's more?

134
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,192
Let's just leave it. Let go!

135
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,027
- More!
- Open it.

136
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,612
Behind you! Block them.

137
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,405
Block them and push this one in.

138
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,740
Push it in.

139
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,242
- Okay.
- Hold on to it.

140
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,326
Okay.

141
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,702
Okay.

142
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,912
Block them.

143
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,207
- Are you blocking?
- Yes.

144
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,166
- It worked.
- Okay.

145
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,918
Push.

146
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,002
Push!

147
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,547
- There are 3 of them.
- No.

148
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,549
THE BLOCKAGE IS CAUSING ZOMBIES TO PILE UP

149
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,800
Where's Chef?

150
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,717
Chef!

151
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,470
Where's Chef?

152
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,388
Chef!

153
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,396
Let's go.

154
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,065
THE ROK-US ALLIANCE STILL STANDS!
WE GO TOGETHER!

155
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,109
Let's go.

156
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,319
Push.

157
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,237
Push it in.

158
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,531
- More!
- Okay, great.

159
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,449
Stay still.

160
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,284
Hey!

161
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,285
What is it?

162
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,244
It's not locked.

163
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,787
Go.

164
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,038
Run!

165
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:36,956
Oh, my gosh.

166
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,251
BREAKING NEWS! ALLIANCE TERMINATED

167
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:42,920
Shoot.

168
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,257
This is ridiculous.

169
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,842
It's open?

170
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,760
- Darn, it is.
- Let's try again.

171
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,512
THE FREED ZOMBIE LOOKS A BIT SMUG

172
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,933
Let's add one more to that.

173
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,271
Can I take a break?

174
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,190
- My knees hurt.
- Hide.

175
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,483
Okay.

176
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,902
EXHAUSTED FROM THE BATTLE,
THEY TAKE A BREAK

177
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,403
I need to catch my breath.

178
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,113
Andre, please take a rest.

179
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,701
THE SMUG ZOMBIE NEARS THE CABINET

180
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,518
THE ZOMBIE IS VERY ANGRY

181
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,569
THE ZOMBIE IS BEYOND ANGRY

182
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,906
How do we lure him away?

183
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,581
They're a team. Tear them apart.

184
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,499
How do we do that?

185
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,459
I will use this. I have a stocking.

186
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,421
Somebody can hide in here,
go behind, open this door?

187
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,632
Right? Have her go up this way.

188
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,842
THE FORMER SERGEANT ADJUSTS THE STRATEGY

189
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,719
This person come out with stocking.

190
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,637
- Push him.
- What?

191
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,930
AN INTERPRETER IS NEEDED

192
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,014
Somebody get in here.

193
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,559
We've got to trap 'em.
Let's get the double… The one door.

194
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,851
Yeah, she'll be here…

195
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,062
No, she runs this way.

196
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,522
THE ALLIANCE FALLS APART AGAIN

197
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,232
Let's run one more lap first.

198
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,900
One more time.

199
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,818
One more lap.

200
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,528
Baby, one more time.

201
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,487
This won't work.

202
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,747
MORE ZOMBIES INCOMING

203
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,332
What?

204
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,668
What's going on?

205
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,718
CODE KUNST IS STUCK

206
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,357
That door is open.

207
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,288
It's that door.

208
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,956
BE QUICK! ZOMBIES WILL KEEP MULTIPLYING

209
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,124
Why are there more?

210
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,417
We need to lock them up.

211
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:27,877
Get it over with.

212
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,847
This way!

213
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,267
How are we supposed to lock them in?

214
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,602
Push them in.

215
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,562
Hold on to it here.

216
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,191
Shoot.

217
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,609
Go in.

218
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,777
Shoot.

219
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,153
Go in.

220
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,446
Run!

221
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,991
Grab her and take her down.

222
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,456
THE HANDMADE ARM GUARD PROVED INVALUABLE

223
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,129
- This way.
- In here.

224
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,422
This way!

225
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,591
Okay, I'm grabbing onto it.

226
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,888
NOW, ONLY THREE ZOMBIES REMAIN!

227
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,223
It's empty.

228
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,391
Block them first.

229
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,020
Block them.

230
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,858
Grab it.

231
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,110
- Here.
- Use this.

232
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,987
Chef!

233
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,531
Hug him from behind.

234
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,741
Chef, hug him.

235
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,451
Hug!

236
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,537
- Andre.
- Catch him.

237
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,997
Hug, please!

238
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,916
Get out now.

239
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:49,959
Grab it.

240
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,627
- Open.
- Hold on!

241
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,045
- Wait?
- Where are the keys?

242
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,296
I'll just hold onto it.

243
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,423
Let go.

244
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,092
Let's go. Hurry!

245
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,260
- Behind you.
- Okay.

246
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,553
Hurry!

247
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,477
No, quickly!

248
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,866
Let's go.

249
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,288
Okay.

250
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,205
Look.

251
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,294
Okay!

252
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,962
It worked.

253
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,046
- Great job.
- Gosh.

254
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,214
Damn zombies!

255
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,341
I hate damn zombies!

256
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,468
Andre!

257
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,886
- We did it.
- I hate zombies!

258
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:42,845
You did great.

259
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,223
DESPITE THE UPS AND DOWNS,
THE ALLIANCE REMAINED STRONG

260
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,393
It was worth making this gear.

261
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,562
One, two, three, we got this!

262
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,190
QUEST COMPLETE
EVERYONE SURVIVED

263
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,483
- Should I climb up?
- Yes.

264
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,318
MEANWHILE, ON THE NET OUTSIDE THE FACILITY

265
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,737
No zombies here.

266
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,114
There are no zombies here.

267
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,669
No, not this way!

268
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,762
Be careful, Si-young!

269
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,721
Watch out!

270
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,141
Be careful, Si-young!

271
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,100
Watch out!

272
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,069
THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL

273
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,573
Hold on.

274
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,408
Head to your left!

275
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,326
My left?

276
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,537
THE SECOND FLOOR HAS ZOMBIES EVERYWHERE

277
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,455
We have to stay in the middle.

278
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,790
But there are more above.

279
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,291
Above?

280
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,209
Dex!

281
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,211
Should I go to the middle?

282
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,505
THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW IS THEIR ONLY HOPE

283
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,048
I'll climb up another floor.

284
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,551
There are more above you.

285
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,595
DESPITE THE SHOCK, SHE TAKES THE LEAD!

286
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,769
There are more.

287
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,687
Geez.

288
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,605
Okay.

289
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,357
Careful!

290
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,235
It's clear here.

291
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,237
Here too, Si-young!

292
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,364
Gosh.

293
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,040
She managed to break it!

294
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,166
- Hey, Dex.
- Yes.

295
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,626
Will it break if I hit it?

296
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,919
Softly? Will I get hurt?

297
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,170
No…

298
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,589
- Use your foot.
- My foot?

299
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,007
Are you sure?

300
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,133
- Kick!
- Kick it?

301
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,050
Kick it!

302
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,761
TSK-TSK! YOU NEED TO ACT YOUR AGE AT 31

303
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,806
Shoot, I did it!

304
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,724
He did it!

305
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,142
SUCCESSFULLY FOUND THE ESCAPE ROUTES

306
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,351
- We're heading in.
- Okay.

307
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,104
Follow her lead.

308
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,447
Let's help Tsuki first. Hold her.

309
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,656
Okay, hold on.

310
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,375
QUEST COMPLETE

311
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,501
DinDin!

312
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,419
Let's bounce.

313
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,337
Smoke grenades!

314
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,380
This is it! Fire in the hole!

315
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,218
Hey! Careful!

316
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,681
Second!

317
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,227
Smoke grenades!

318
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,481
- Smoke grenades!
- This is the third one.

319
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,441
Let's go, stay close.

320
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,443
Who was that?

321
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,821
Let's go!

322
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,365
Come on! Run!

323
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,075
Run!

324
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,534
Watch out! Behind you!

325
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,286
They are coming!

326
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,955
Be careful.

327
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,873
Let's go.

328
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,626
ZOMBIEVERSE
NEW BLOOD

329
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,922
THE NEXT DAY

330
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,344
A BURGER JOINT BY THE BEACH

331
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,057
AFTER ESCAPING THE QUARANTINE FACILITY,
THEY ARRIVE AT SI-YOUNG AND DEX'S LODGING

332
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,812
Hey, Patricia.

333
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,274
How did we make it alive?

334
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,317
Tell me about it.

335
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,658
JOINED

336
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,829
I'm so drowsy and hungry.

337
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,748
I'm exhausted.

338
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,383
They seem to get along like siblings.

339
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,760
Patricia hasn't been this happy in ages.

340
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,435
- Ready? Let's go, this way.
- Yes.

341
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,895
She must have more energy than us.

342
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,981
She wouldn't have survived with us.

343
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,983
Good thing she stayed.

344
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,277
That's why we told her to wait here.

345
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,654
That was just yesterday.

346
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,116
Are they trustworthy?

347
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,037
Well, they're experienced with zombies.

348
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:24,710
I'm a bit wary since we don't know them.

349
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,753
Understandable.

350
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,087
I'm wary of them.

351
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:31,967
Who's that guy?

352
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,178
Chungju Man…

353
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,262
A civil servant.

354
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,056
Level 6 civil servant.

355
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,269
We aren't sure
how they will benefit us yet.

356
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,021
We need a few days.

357
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,565
So you weren't originally with them?

358
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,734
Yes, we met them in Jeju.

359
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,987
I haven't seen you two around.

360
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,238
How did you get here?

361
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:59,328
Patricia, Dex, and I got lucky. We got in
an amphibious vehicle and came here.

362
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,245
ESCAPING WOLMIDO

363
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:05,334
We got to this burger joint
and have been staying here since.

364
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,877
- After the quarantine?
- Yes.

365
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,296
It was peaceful until yesterday

366
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:13,884
when we saw a suspicious truck
and chased it down.

367
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,053
Then came the zombies out of nowhere.

368
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,514
It's your first time with zombies, right?

369
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,681
- Yes.
- It's my first time.

370
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,266
- Me too.
- That was my first.

371
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,643
How did you get here?

372
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,560
Everyone here?

373
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,105
I was here for a music video production…

374
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,815
- Music video?
- What?

375
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,316
That's news.

376
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,485
I didn't bring it up because…

377
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,278
- You're hiding a lot.
- I was shy.

378
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,531
The last music video with Chang-hee was…

379
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,615
Where's Chang-hee?

380
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,370
He's gone.

381
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,205
THE STORY IS STILL A TEARJERKER

382
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,208
No, there was this sudden crisis and…

383
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,337
What's so funny?

384
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,880
CRYING FROM EMBARRASSMENT

385
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,798
I'm sure…

386
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,133
He's crying.

387
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,427
I'm sure you all know this,
but his fiancée also…

388
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,595
Yes.

389
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,517
I've always been curious,
does your fiancée even exist?

390
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,643
What?

391
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,646
That's rude of you to ask.

392
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,815
Well, I've never met her before.

393
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,568
This is why I wear
these sunglasses, to hide my tears.

394
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,069
The glasses are too clear.

395
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,362
We can see through them.

396
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,868
Anyways, this should be our base camp
since we have food here.

397
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:25,956
We still need to prepare an escape plan,
just in case there's a zombie attack.

398
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,000
How do we get out of here?

399
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,419
Realistically, it's either
by boat or a plane.

400
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,837
That's all.

401
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,589
Do you know how to fly a plane?

402
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,427
He's not a jack-of-all-trades.

403
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,720
HE'S BEEN MISTAKEN

404
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,305
You fell for him yesterday.

405
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,392
Please don't grab me.
Wait. Excuse me, Dex!

406
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,560
- Hold on.
- Wait.

407
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,229
AMID THE CHAOS, THEY FOUND A PRECIOUS BOND

408
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,899
If you don't mind me asking,
how old are you?

409
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,026
- I'm 30 years old.
- You're 30?

410
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,152
Me too.

411
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,945
You guys are the same age.

412
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,322
Nice to meet you, friend.

413
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,199
- Nice…
- Can we be…

414
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,366
Can we be friends?

415
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,451
Of course.

416
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,911
It's the start of our friendship.

417
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,455
WE ROOT FOR THEIR NEWFOUND FRIENDSHIP!

418
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,498
He's sharpening his knife.

419
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,084
ANDRE IS ABOUT TO SHOW HIS SKILLS!

420
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,044
Thank you.

421
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,547
Look at his blazing eyes.

422
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,924
- Oh, okay.
- Let's do this.

423
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,262
Smells delicious!

424
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,680
- Smells good.
- Wow, patty.

425
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,391
I love patties, wow!

426
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,935
I'm hungry.

427
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,438
Patricia, can you ask him
how much longer it'll take?

428
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,523
She can't speak English.

429
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,527
How many long…

430
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,820
WHY IS SHE CLAPPING?

431
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,280
How long will it take?

432
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,824
Tell them to count to 100 in English.

433
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,910
Oh, one hundred.

434
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,453
One hundred minutes?

435
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,330
COMMUNICATION FAILURES CONTINUE

436
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,165
Chef, how long will it take?

437
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,669
Count to 100 in English. It'll be done.

438
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,755
Count to 100 English, it's down.

439
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,757
THIS ISN'T PRO-WRESTLING

440
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,259
- Done.
- Done!

441
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,135
Count?

442
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,387
Yes.

443
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,721
Let's go!

444
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,014
Okay, just give it to me.

445
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,975
- That's teamwork, right?
- Yeah, teamwork.

446
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,518
What does that mean?

447
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,602
Yeah, teamwork.

448
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,770
What does it mean?

449
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,688
Teamwork.

450
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,772
What is teamwork?

451
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,315
Teamwork, we are a team.

452
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,650
Teamwork…

453
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,443
- Thank…
- Thank you.

454
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,362
JUST BETTER TO END IT HERE

455
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,321
Thank you.

456
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,741
- Little salt?
- Salt.

457
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,451
Okay, ready to feed them?

458
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,369
Finished.

459
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,954
Time to eat!

460
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,664
Oh, please!

461
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,958
- Time to eat.
- Please, Andre!

462
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,668
- Please!
- We're so hungry.

463
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,462
So hungry, let's go.

464
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,799
Thank you! Brother, thank you!

465
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,718
There are two flavors.

466
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,386
Yes, that's great.

467
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,263
It's delicious.

468
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,894
Every meal could be our last meal.

469
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,272
It's so damn good.

470
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,065
HE CAN'T HELP BUT RAVE

471
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,069
THE CHEF'S ROLE IS CRUCIAL
IN A SURVIVAL SITUATION!

472
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,487
Thank you, sir.

473
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,947
Thank you.

474
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,490
You're my treasure.

475
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,326
Thank you.

476
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,618
I love your burger.

477
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,536
Thank you.

478
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,164
This is what the American presidents had.

479
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,374
- Really?
- Yes, he cooked for them.

480
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,836
Chef, whose favorite is this?
Donald Trump or Biden?

481
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,046
Obama's favorite?

482
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,342
Sensitive topic?

483
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,384
HE'S TAKEN ABACK!

484
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,136
Oh, sorry!

485
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,763
It's a touchy subject.

486
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,598
Thank you.

487
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,102
I love it here.

488
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,813
Can we stay here
until the rescue team arrives?

489
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,273
I agree. I'm so happy here.

490
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,484
Let's just stay here.

491
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,820
Officer, is there a bunker nearby?

492
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,906
A bunker for national emergencies?

493
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,449
There should be one.

494
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,661
There is an evacuation facility
at the provincial office.

495
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,746
Provincial office?

496
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,372
Is everyone allowed in?

497
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,290
Not everyone.

498
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,959
But they let most citizens in.

499
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,045
I've done Ulchi Freedom Shield exercises.

500
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,713
They all operate the same way.

501
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,549
The provincial office
is the safest during a crisis.

502
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,803
If there's a crisis,
do we run to the provincial office?

503
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,804
- Yes.
- Always?

504
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,764
Yes. All the forces will unite.

505
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,681
Really?

506
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,850
All the forces will unite there.

507
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,060
I wasn't aware.

508
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,104
If the office collapses, we're doomed.

509
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,522
- We're doomed?
- Yes.

510
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,066
We need to make sure
if it's safe there first.

511
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,192
Yes, you're right.

512
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,401
But how?

513
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,946
Communication is key in times like these.

514
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,364
How about that radio?

515
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,158
CAN THIS OLD RADIO HELP?

516
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,577
They broadcast
emergency alerts on the radio, right?

517
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,954
- It might help us.
- True.

518
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,290
THEY ALSO FOUND A RADIO
AT THE QUARANTINE FACILITY YESTERDAY

519
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,792
Should we turn on the radio?

520
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,090
IT JUST ENDED WITH A SING-ALONG

521
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,759
We need the right frequency.

522
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,639
All broadcasts are currently suspended.

523
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,934
We apologize for any inconvenience
caused to our listeners.

524
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,770
All broadcasts are currently suspended…

525
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,480
That's it?

526
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,440
Try changing it.

527
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,282
Is it in Chinese?

528
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,908
IT'S DEFINITELY ENGLISH

529
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,410
Isn't he speaking English?

530
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,745
English?

531
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,207
Do we have to head to the States?

532
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,876
Should I write this down?

533
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:42,647
Seoul was hit the hardest,
then Jeju Island after that.

534
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,899
What?

535
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,068
The quarantine facility took a big hit.

536
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,946
DUE TO THE INCREASE OF EVACUEES,
JEJU HAS TAKEN A MASSIVE HIT

537
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,449
Jeju? Second most infected.

538
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,783
Second most infected…

539
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,952
We fled to a place
that's even more dangerous.

540
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,550
Okay.

541
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:15,305
Some NGO has sent out helicopters
to rescue people but…

542
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,556
We have to evacuate.

543
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,603
RESCUE HELICOPTERS ARE BEING SENT OUT
BY THE GLOBAL URGENT RELIEF ALLIANCE

544
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,521
But did the radio mention

545
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,190
where we get on the helicopter?

546
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,943
We need to find out
where we get on the helicopter.

547
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,739
Wait, what's our location?

548
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,657
JEJU PROVINCE MAP

549
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,620
Wait, hold on.

550
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,663
Wait…

551
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,917
THEY'RE ANNOUNCING
THE COORDINATES OF THE RESCUE POINT!

552
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,795
Bring it here.

553
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,839
Write it down.

554
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,466
Does anyone have a pen?

555
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,552
We need to listen for Jeju Island.

556
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,806
I'll give you a tip,
just write down anything you hear.

557
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,559
Don't write that down.

558
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,483
DON'T MISTAKEN JEBU-DO FOR JEJU!

559
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,783
NOW'S THE TIME FOR JEJU ISLAND!

560
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:20,996
I got it!

561
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,622
Thirty-three degrees!

562
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,623
Twenty-seven north.

563
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,126
- One hundred twenty-six degrees.
- And thirty-two.

564
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,877
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two minutes!

565
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:28,962
- Six seconds.
- Sixty east.

566
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,338
THEY GOT THE COORDINATES!

567
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,673
- Is it 126 and 32?
- Yes.

568
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,757
It's here!

569
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,842
It's six.

570
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,094
It'll take about 32 minutes.

571
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,388
Oh, it's the coordinates…

572
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,639
HE'S FALLING BEHIND

573
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,225
If you go straight like this,
it's Odeung-dong.

574
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,435
It's Odeung-dong.

575
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,186
There's a rampart here.

576
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,939
Wouldn't we get there quicker on that?

577
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,899
I saw them nearby.

578
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,984
Go!

579
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,070
Let's go!

580
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,155
Here we go!

581
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,075
1 HOUR LATER
HEADING TO THE RESCUE COORDINATES

582
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,506
Are you okay?

583
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,883
No, are you okay?

584
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,224
You're too close.

585
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,852
WATCH OUT FOR FRONT AND BACK VIBRATIONS

586
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,354
Can you back off a little?

587
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,064
I'm too close.

588
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,523
- What?
- I'm too close.

589
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,694
I've been meaning to ask,
did you stuff peas in your pants?

590
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,612
What?

591
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,826
Zombie!

592
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,039
- Shoot.
- There are more!

593
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,957
It's a solider zombie.

594
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,459
ZOMBIES IN ARMY UNIFORMS

595
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,460
Go!

596
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,836
Go!

597
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,671
Sit properly.

598
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,382
Move.

599
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,549
Shoot!

600
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,051
More zombies!

601
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,719
Darn!

602
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,181
Shoot!

603
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,266
- Wow, gosh.
- Patricia, we've got to go.

604
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,561
Dang!

605
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,777
Are we on track?

606
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,195
It's this way, right?

607
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,613
It must be somewhere here.

608
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,787
I hear the helicopter!

609
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,288
Helicopter!

610
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,665
I see it!

611
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,834
Where is it going?

612
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,710
- Hey!
- Over here!

613
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,711
Here!

614
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:35,964
We're here!

615
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:36,881
Chase it!

616
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,882
Here!

617
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,384
Go after it!

618
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,471
It's an actual helicopter.

619
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,639
We're here.

620
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,765
- Over here!
- Here!

621
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,392
- We made it!
- Here!

622
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,601
- Over here!
- We did it!

623
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,644
Here!

624
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,187
- We made it alive.
- Here!

625
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,814
Here!

626
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,108
It's landing!

627
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,776
It's coming down!

628
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,987
- Here!
- We are safe now!

629
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,364
- We did it.
- Yes, we did.

630
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,615
- Here!
- We're alive!

631
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,533
We're here.

632
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,743
- Here!
- The helipad.

633
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,661
- Over there.
- Here.

634
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,080
Do you have smoke grenades?

635
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,123
Smoke grenades?

636
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,340
- Is it landing?
- Here!

637
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,930
- We did it.
- It's coming.

638
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,869
Let's go. Go!

639
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,078
We did it.

640
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,080
Let's head there first.

641
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,124
- Come on!
- Let's go.

642
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,376
We did it!

643
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,796
Go!

644
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,299
- Please save us.
- Hold on!

645
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,842
- No!
- What? Why?

646
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,761
Why?

647
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,849
The fuel tank is empty.

648
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,601
It's empty.

649
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,561
We don't have fuel.

650
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,064
No fuel.

651
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,358
- No more fuel.
- Empty tank.

652
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,317
No fuel.

653
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,577
Come this way!

654
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,000
They need to fill the tank.

655
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,547
There's no fuel in the tank
so takeoff isn't possible.

656
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,798
No fuel?

657
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,761
There should be a fuel depot there.

658
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,304
- Beyond that building.
- Okay.

659
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,932
Please bring the fuel over here.

660
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,809
There's none here.

661
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,477
We need to bring the fuel here.

662
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,062
We can get on it, right?

663
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,146
Yes, you can.

664
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,606
Now, hurry along!

665
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,691
- Hurry.
- Run.

666
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,942
Run!

667
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,487
I see the fuel depot!

668
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,990
QUEST: FILL THE FUEL TANK AND ESCAPE

669
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:11,035
THE FUEL DEPOT IS LOCATED
ON TOP OF THE HILL

670
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,956
500 L OF FUEL NEEDED

671
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,086
THEY NEED TO FILL THE TANK
USING 20 L CONTAINERS TO TAKEOFF

672
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,717
The tree is in our way.

673
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,595
WATCH OUT FOR OBSTRUCTIONS

674
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,221
Zombies might appear again.

675
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,021
HEADING TOWARDS THE FUEL DEPOT

676
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:42,567
We need to pump it out
into the containers.

677
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,484
Let's use this.

678
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,402
Pump it out.

679
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,320
Do you know how?

680
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,613
It's going to smell bad.

681
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,157
Oh, it's working.

682
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,116
It's working.

683
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,659
- Use both hands.
- Okay.

684
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,661
Faster!

685
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,580
What if we roll the barrel there?

686
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,706
We can't do that.

687
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,957
The tree is in the way.

688
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,917
You're right.

689
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,752
Wait, another container.

690
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,670
- Bring it!
- Come on now.

691
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,882
WHAT A WASTE OF THE COUNTRY'S TAX MONEY

692
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,051
Hold on, this is heavy.

693
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,844
It's full.

694
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,387
I'll take this first.

695
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,391
We need 500 liters worth of fuel.

696
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,228
Is this okay?

697
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,606
Yes, leave them here and bring more.

698
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,191
25 CONTAINERS TO FILL UP THE TANK

699
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,692
Let's go!

700
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,947
THE CIVIL SERVANT IS STEPPING IN

701
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,073
What's he doing?

702
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,283
He's moving it. Let's help him.

703
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:33,952
Clear the way!

704
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,664
Here we go. Hop it over!

705
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,208
We'll pull it, easy. Pull it.

706
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,210
Pull it, push it.

707
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,795
No!

708
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,088
- Push it.
- We need your power.

709
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,005
It's okay.

710
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:46,923
Let's go!

711
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,716
THE CHEERLEADER IS THE STRONGEST

712
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,842
Let's go!

713
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,761
Please hurry!

714
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,138
We need to fill up to 500 L!

715
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,223
Here we go.

716
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,599
Pick up high!

717
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,767
There you go.

718
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,769
Perfect.

719
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,563
THE CHEERLEADER SEEMS LIKE
THE MOST EXHAUSTED ONE

720
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,606
Thirty more to go.

721
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,317
I was told that we need 500 L.

722
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,235
Let's go!

723
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,738
NOW, THEY CAN DELIVER IT WITH THE ATV

724
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,699
So this is how it feels

725
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,784
to be on an ATV with a man.

726
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,286
You're getting too close.

727
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,871
Don't misunderstand.

728
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,420
I'll just carry them.

729
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,504
I can do it.

730
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,134
Why does it need so much fuel?

731
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:36,222
WITH THE OBSTACLES GONE,
EVERYTHING'S MOVING SMOOTHLY!

732
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,477
It's all over me.

733
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,522
We need to check the gauge.

734
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,441
This is taking quite a while.

735
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,483
You push the tab.

736
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,568
I got it.

737
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,652
I got mine.

738
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,530
It's filling up.

739
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,573
We're close.

740
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,867
- Get moving.
- Hurry.

741
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,909
Let's hurry up!

742
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,286
- Run.
- Go.

743
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,417
10 MINUTES EARLIER

744
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,585
Did you see its size?

745
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,502
Yes.

746
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,587
Hey, let's go.

747
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,633
It's a small helicopter.

748
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,135
We are not going to fit.

749
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,428
There are 12 of us.

750
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,679
Really?

751
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,600
It can only fit nine or ten people.

752
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,185
THE HELICOPTER IS TOO SMALL

753
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,269
Leave it here.

754
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,146
It's unsettling.

755
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,940
What do we do?

756
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,567
What's up?

757
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,819
We can't all fit.

758
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,947
Not all of us.

759
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,199
We are too heavy…

760
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:40,244
Just by looking at the size of that,
it's clear this many people won't fit.

761
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,746
Hold on.

762
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,170
NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR 12 PEOPLE

763
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,089
Can it fit the 12 of us?

764
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,466
- Is it possible?
- We might exceed the limit.

765
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,759
- Really?
- Yes.

766
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,804
EVEN IF THEY SQUEEZE IN,
THEY WILL EXCEED THE WEIGHT LIMIT

767
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,388
I'm worried about the limit.

768
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,225
Consider the worst-case scenario.

769
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,521
We might have to part ways here.

770
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:15,154
But they're working so hard.
It feels wrong to talk behind their backs.

771
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,489
- Yes.
- Start.

772
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,698
Grab it.

773
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,534
Slowly.

774
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,787
What a chaos.

775
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:28,417
But it's clear that your experience
is helping the team overall.

776
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,837
We'll make it out together.

777
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,171
Of course.

778
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,589
Should I just call you Si-young?

779
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,925
- Sure.
- I was born in 1982.

780
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,260
- Me too!
- What?

781
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,678
- I was born in 1982.
- Not 1981?

782
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,887
Year of the Dog.

783
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,055
That's right!

784
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:41,973
We're the same age.

785
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,267
A START OF ANOTHER FRIENDSHIP

786
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,269
We're friends. We are the same age.

787
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,272
How old are you? What year were you born?

788
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,481
I'm 22.

789
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,692
- What?
- I'm 22.

790
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,651
What?

791
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,361
- You're 22?
- Yeah.

792
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,654
That's crazy.

793
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,947
DIFFICULT AMERICAN HUMOR

794
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,407
Which year were you born?

795
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,992
- No.
- You're 22?

796
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:01,909
Yeah.

797
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,578
- You're 22 years old?
- Yeah.

798
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,247
ANDRE, BORN IN 1974
AND JOINED THE ARMY IN 1993

799
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,373
What?

800
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,708
I could pass as his aunt.

801
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,543
What, why?

802
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,670
- Okay.
- Okay.

803
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,673
- You're 22?
- Oh, no, I'm 32.

804
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,467
HIS AMERICAN HUMOR IS CONFUSING THEM

805
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,761
You're ten years younger than me?

806
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,388
- I'm 43.
- Okay.

807
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,266
Andre is born in the year of 1993.

808
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,350
What?

809
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,771
Andre? Born in 1993?

810
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,773
- You're a baby.
- Yeah.

811
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,067
A baby!

812
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,946
72% OF FUEL LEFT FOR TAKEOFF

813
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,281
Hey, captain!

814
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,159
Does the helicopter
require this much fuel?

815
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,744
- Hold on.
- Yes.

816
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:45,828
Here…

817
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,997
How many of us can fit in this?

818
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,457
I'll explain later.

819
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,250
Just give me a rough number.

820
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,961
I need to know as
I'm the leader of the pack.

821
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,880
- If lighter people board…
- Got it.

822
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,341
- Lock it.
- Yes.

823
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,800
Okay, I'll carry it.

824
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,177
Now, one, two, three!

825
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,386
Captain…

826
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,096
We will check the gauge

827
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,140
after we have everyone on board.

828
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,058
Also…

829
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,228
Please know that I have a wife and kids.

830
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,187
- Do you?
- What?

831
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,565
SO DESPERATE THAT HE MADE UP
A VIRTUAL FAMILY

832
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,775
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

833
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,698
We're almost there.

834
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,121
Defconn's been talking
to the captain for a while.

835
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,748
Something's fishy.

836
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,968
How much do you weigh?

837
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,219
- I'm 45 kg.
- Oh, 45 kg?

838
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,887
- Yes?
- And you?

839
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,972
- I'm 53 kg.
- Hey.

840
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,723
Don't worry, I won't ask you.

841
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,641
Why not?

842
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,352
I'm checking people who are lighter.
You're 45 kg?

843
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,104
I'm 52 kg.

844
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,188
I'm 57 kg.

845
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,440
And yourself?

846
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,942
Well, I did lose weight.

847
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,068
Ninety?

848
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,403
I'm 73 kg.

849
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,988
That's nonsense!

850
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,074
You're risking our lives by lying.

851
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:08,035
That's around my weight.
It doesn't make sense.

852
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,578
It's the truth…

853
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,830
How heavy are you?

854
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,747
He said 73 kg.

855
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,665
I'm 72 kg.

856
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,166
I'm wearing a lot of layers.

857
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,462
I'm 140 kg.

858
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,339
OH MY! THE HEAVIEST OF THEM ALL

859
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,341
Now, listen up.

860
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,468
Andre weighs 140 kg.

861
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,513
That's four times TAEYEON's weight.

862
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,682
- Four times.
- Don't say that.

863
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,600
We could fit four of her.

864
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,311
What's happening?

865
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,688
HE URGENTLY NEEDS TO LEARN KOREAN

866
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,939
One hundred forty.

867
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,399
One hundred forty?

868
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,984
Patricia, listen up.

869
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,153
Andre…

870
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,784
- What is it?
- He's going to survive no matter what.

871
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,119
THROWS ANDRE UNDER THE BUS

872
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,746
So we should leave him behind?

873
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,164
Be quiet!

874
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,623
- Hey!
- Yes.

875
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,167
- Hey!
- Yes.

876
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,002
Thank you.

877
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,712
HE NEEDS TO RELEARN KOREAN

878
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,797
Why are you guys looking at me?

879
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:06,510
Because your muscle is my type. Okay?

880
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,262
Thank you.

881
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,431
- That was random.
- But…

882
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,102
What's going on there?

883
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,729
Talking about their weights.

884
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,523
But Defconn is lying that he weighs 70 kg.

885
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,361
Can't we just use TAEYEON as our standard?

886
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,321
Keep it simple, that's complicated.

887
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,615
How about using Patricia as our standard?

888
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,532
What?

889
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,825
I don't know her weight.

890
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,661
From what I see,
Patricia is similar to Andre.

891
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,163
What are you talking about?

892
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,206
It's true.

893
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,624
But we must remember,

894
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,168
the world needs comedians
to keep humor alive.

895
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,878
The world needs humor.

896
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,297
In that case, we have Sae-ho…

897
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,633
This should be enough.

898
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,638
I feel anxious being away
from the group like this.

899
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,307
Come on, it's a life-or-death decision.

900
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,809
We'll all die at this rate.

901
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,060
You should stay then.

902
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,603
Wait.

903
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,814
Hold on, listen.

904
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,316
I know what you're saying.

905
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,735
I know what you're talking about.

906
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,570
Not me, he said…

907
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,573
I know you said
I'm too heavy for the helicopter.

908
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,700
HE FINALLY UNDERSTANDS KOREAN

909
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,078
No, you're very light!

910
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,371
Come with me.

911
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,748
- No, that's not it.
- Okay, go with you.

912
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,959
No, no.

913
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,212
You know, I fly helicopters.

914
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,047
- I know helicopters.
- You do?

915
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,466
You can fly helicopters?

916
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,927
No, I fly in the helicopter.

917
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,262
I'm from the military.

918
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,432
Let's get rid of the pilots.

919
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,351
A NEW APPROACH

920
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,644
- Can you fly one?
- Wait.

921
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,603
He can fly one.

922
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,982
We have a pilot.

923
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,652
No, he doesn't know how to fly
a helicopter. We need a pilot.

924
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,322
Okay, we've got to take a vote.

925
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,699
- A boat?
- Yeah.

926
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,200
- Boat?
- Where's the boat?

927
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,119
Andre knows where the boat is.

928
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,329
No, he wants us to vote!

929
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,873
INTERPRETER NEEDED!

930
00:40:58,956 --> 00:40:59,957
We're going to vote.

931
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,710
If people think I'm too heavy,
just say yes.

932
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,714
Let's be honest.

933
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,549
You know, honestly?

934
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,302
The heaviest should stay.

935
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,553
Lighter people can board.

936
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,305
Let's sort this.

937
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,433
We don't have time for this, keep moving.

938
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,728
If we balance the weight right,
we can fit more people, right?

939
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,730
We can leave everything behind.

940
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,398
Please keep moving!

941
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,275
- Bring fuel!
- Let's empty our bags.

942
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,776
Bring more fuel!

943
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,320
We have more here.

944
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,488
Bring the empty ones.

945
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,114
Please hurry!

946
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,407
Load it.

947
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,746
48% OF FUEL LEFT FOR TAKEOFF

948
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,748
We can't have everyone on board.

949
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,832
I'm worried.

950
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,001
We should assess the situation.

951
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,671
I think we should use
this fuel to make a deal with them.

952
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,298
PLOTS ARE BEING HATCHED

953
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,675
If you want the fuel, guarantee us seats.

954
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,595
How much fuel does it need?

955
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,181
This is bad though. We can't all fit.

956
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,850
Come here.

957
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,143
Are you going to stay?

958
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,312
I don't want to part ways with you.

959
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,981
The three of us need to get on.

960
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,483
- Of course.
- Got it.

961
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,110
What if everyone's
already on the helicopter?

962
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,196
Then we don't give them the fuel.

963
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,073
So this is what Defconn meant.

964
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,494
What did he say?

965
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,828
Get over there.

966
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,497
Strange plots are going around.

967
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,791
Why are you so skeptical?

968
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,126
That no one can be trusted.

969
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,504
But what's he doing?

970
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,672
He's not helping out.

971
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,382
He's talking to the captain.

972
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,175
- He's playing politics.
- Exactly.

973
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:36,011
You're on my side, right?

974
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,807
Think about it rationally. It makes sense
for the heavier ones to stay.

975
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,892
But if we go by weight, I'm in trouble.

976
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,144
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT

977
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,021
What do you think of Sae-ho?

978
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,189
Well, Sae-ho is…

979
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,024
He's trying to impress Andre.

980
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,150
To survive?

981
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,194
YOU'RE A TARGET ONCE OUT OF SIGHT

982
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,947
Is there a way to lose weight
in half an hour?

983
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,200
22% OF FUEL LEFT FOR TAKEOFF

984
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,702
Please hurry!

985
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,208
It feels like we're in an action movie.

986
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,127
We can all go.

987
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,964
We saw a few zombies
in the forest just now.

988
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,717
I'm worried
that the sound of the helicopter

989
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,051
will attract the zombies.

990
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,303
We have to speed up.

991
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,597
Start the engine.

992
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,598
There's no time!

993
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,517
- Let's bring them all.
- Wait.

994
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,810
We have to go!

995
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:25,978
Should we take these?

996
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,271
Should I?

997
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,982
Go!

998
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,197
We've got to go faster.

999
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,243
We need about three to four more.

1000
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,494
Now, hurry!

1001
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,415
It's empty now.

1002
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,546
Wait, hold on…

1003
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,887
TANK FULL

1004
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,139
Number two engine start.

1005
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,188
What?

1006
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,944
It's moving.

1007
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,155
What?

1008
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,907
- What?
- It's moving.

1009
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,534
This should be the last container.

1010
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,535
Yes, bring it.

1011
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,870
I'll do it alone.

1012
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:25,996
Are you sure?

1013
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,914
I'll be fine.

1014
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,915
Stay alive.

1015
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,875
Alive?

1016
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,418
I'm just looking out for you.

1017
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,380
We're almost done.

1018
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,339
Is it enough?

1019
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,882
Hold on.

1020
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,136
Should we get on?

1021
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,146
- Everyone, get on.
- We can, right?

1022
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,607
- Can we board now?
- Call them.

1023
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,567
- We're done.
- Do we go back?

1024
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,277
Call them back.

1025
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,987
Wait, do we have to?

1026
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,115
- Do we?
- Stay here.

1027
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,953
Are you all going?

1028
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,079
- Wait.
- Bring them.

1029
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,080
Stay here.

1030
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,248
Do we need to?

1031
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,290
Hurry up!

1032
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,208
What?

1033
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,292
- Tsuki!
- Hurry up!

1034
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,253
Over here, quickly!

1035
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,587
Quickly!

1036
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,172
- Run quickly!
- Hurry!

1037
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,634
It's moving!

1038
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,844
What?

1039
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,263
- Bro!
- Okay, let's go.

1040
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,015
Hurry!

1041
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,559
- It's moving!
- Let's go!

1042
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,936
- Come quickly!
- Quick!

1043
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,104
Let's just leave it.

1044
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,273
Let's go!

1045
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:35,816
What?

1046
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,115
Code Kunst! Hey!

1047
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,116
Stay alive.

1048
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,827
What was that about?

1049
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,953
Ladies, get on first.

1050
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:48,912
Get on!

1051
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,622
- Just in case.
- Get on first.

1052
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,126
Get in! Hurry!

1053
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,131
The helicopter?

1054
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,591
What?

1055
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,508
Leave it!

1056
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,303
Oh, no!

1057
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,431
Step on this.

1058
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,599
Quick!

1059
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,061
- Get on.
- Get in now!

1060
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:14,897
Get in!

1061
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,649
Hurry up!

1062
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,650
Tsuki!

1063
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,069
Hurry!

1064
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:23,780
Get in.

1065
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,914
Be quick!

1066
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,832
Run!

1067
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,879
Defconn!

1068
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,090
Shoot!

1069
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,719
No!

1070
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,179
First engine, clear.

1071
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,725
Is the engine on?

1072
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,145
Wait!

1073
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,064
No!

1074
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,859
Let's go!

1075
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,404
He's going to survive no matter what.

1076
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,697
I know what you're saying.

1077
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,282
You said I'm too heavy.

1078
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,701
Oh, no. Come with me.

1079
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,788
Consider the worst-case scenario.

1080
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,498
We might have to part ways here.

1081
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,960
LATECOMERS MIGHT MISS THE RIDE

1082
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,211
No!

1083
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,257
Can we all get on?

1084
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,258
Just get on first!

1085
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,304
This way.

1086
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,598
How did you get in there?

1087
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,729
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SPACE LEFT

1088
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,109
There's no space.

1089
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,487
Run quickly!

1090
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,699
No! It's over!

1091
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,992
I'm sorry!

1092
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,493
Just go.

1093
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,079
10 PEOPLE ON BOARD
EXCEPT SAE-HO AND DEFCONN

1094
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,998
I don't want to part ways with you.

1095
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,250
Of course.

1096
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,461
Just go.

1097
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,297
- Let's go.
- What?

1098
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,548
- Hey.
- Bro!

1099
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,174
- Save yourself.
- Let's go.

1100
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,968
Bro!

1101
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,845
Sae-ho, just get on.

1102
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,682
Let's go.

1103
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,436
Get on first.

1104
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,813
- Bro!
- Get on.

1105
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,649
You can't get on!

1106
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,818
- Defconn, no!
- Get out!

1107
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,446
We don't have room!

1108
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,572
Sae-ho…

1109
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,282
Get off.

1110
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,366
You get off!

1111
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,534
Defconn, no!

1112
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,452
Let's go.

1113
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,165
You'll fall.

1114
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,292
Come on, right here.

1115
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,211
Code Kunst, are you okay?

1116
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,755
Hey, right here.

1117
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:50,385
Wait.

1118
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,928
Are you okay?

1119
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,015
Sae-ho, get off if it hurts too much.

1120
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,642
No, I'm fine.

1121
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,101
What's wrong?

1122
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,353
My pinky finger…

1123
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,687
Hey!

1124
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,605
Is it me?

1125
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,815
I almost lost my finger.

1126
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,275
Well, if that's the case,

1127
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,319
- isn't it better if you get off?
- I'm fine.

1128
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,864
EVERYONE IS ON BOARD

1129
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,866
We did it!

1130
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,409
It worked out!

1131
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,577
We made it!

1132
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,663
We made it alive!

1133
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,331
We did it!

1134
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,752
- Check.
- Check.

1135
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,045
- Okay.
- We made it.

1136
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,922
- We lived!
- Good job, guys.

1137
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,591
Great job!

1138
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,593
It worked out!

1139
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,595
Good job!

1140
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,641
Let's go!

1141
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,684
We're going home.

1142
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,479
It's moving.

1143
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,689
It's in the air!

1144
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,902
It's flying!

1145
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:03,959
We're off the ground.

1146
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,296
Here we go!

1147
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,633
Why?

1148
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,718
It can't take off?

1149
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,219
What's with the beeping?

1150
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,012
Is it not going to take off?

1151
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,556
Captain, why aren't we going?

1152
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,310
Weight limit exceeded.

1153
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,815
- Why?
- It's going back.

1154
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,066
- Why?
- What's going on?

1155
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,693
- What?
- Why?

1156
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,903
- Why?
- We're going back down?

1157
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,071
Why?

1158
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,118
- Hey!
- Why?

1159
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,872
- What is it?
- Why?

1160
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,081
Turn off the engine.

1161
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,417
Where are you going?

1162
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,668
He got off.

1163
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,295
- Why did he get off?
- Why?

1164
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,381
- Why?
- Everyone, please get off.

1165
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,008
- Everyone, get off!
- Why?

1166
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,926
What's happening?

1167
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,679
It can't bear our weight.

1168
00:50:59,139 --> 00:50:59,973
Do we get off?

1169
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,057
Yes.

1170
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,562
Please get off.

1171
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,230
Everyone, get off now.

1172
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,690
What's the issue?

1173
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,580
- Why aren't we going?
- Listen up.

1174
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,623
What's the matter?

1175
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,292
We exceeded the weight limit.

1176
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,128
There's a weight limit.

1177
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,714
We can't bring everyone with us.

1178
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,591
MAXIMUM WEIGHT LIMIT 2,720 KG

1179
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,634
−HELICOPTER 1,500 KG

1180
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,676
−FUEL 400 KG

1181
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,303
−TWO PILOTS 160 KG

1182
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,972
THERE IS ONLY ROOM FOR 660 KG

1183
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,016
Is another helicopter on its way?

1184
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,601
Yes. Please decide quickly.

1185
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,687
RESCUE IS ONGOING,
ANOTHER HELICOPTER WILL COME

1186
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:53,026
QUEST: MEET THE WEIGHT LIMIT
AND ESCAPE JEJU ISLAND

1187
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,445
How much do we weigh altogether?

1188
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:56,947
How heavy are you?

1189
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,074
I'm 75 or 76.

1190
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,369
Dex is 76 and I'm 52.

1191
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,663
She weighs 53.

1192
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,289
- And 72, 76…
- Are you adding it up?

1193
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,290
I have my phone.

1194
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,458
- His has power.
- Yes.

1195
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,543
Use your phone.

1196
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,752
I'll calculate it.

1197
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:11,878
Here, 53, 52.

1198
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,004
- He's 76.
- Add 76…

1199
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,589
I'm 72.

1200
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,549
I'm 45.

1201
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,675
- Officer?
- I'm 69 kg.

1202
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:17,759
I'm 140 kg.

1203
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,053
We've reached 507 kg.

1204
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:24,057
THEY STILL NEED TO ADD FIVE MORE PEOPLE

1205
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,517
Just finish calculating.

1206
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,893
- I'm 71.
- He's 71.

1207
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:27,853
- DinDin?
- I'm 57.

1208
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,770
- Patricia?
- Me?

1209
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:29,855
CONFIDENTIAL

1210
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,273
Is there room for 91kg?

1211
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,941
- Adding 91.
- I'm 70.

1212
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,609
- Seventy?
- Don't lie.

1213
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,569
I'm not lying.

1214
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,945
That can't be right.

1215
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,823
I'm telling you the truth…

1216
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,991
NO ONE BELIEVES HIM

1217
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,158
Geez.

1218
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,579
We've reached 869 kg in total.

1219
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,788
We are 209 kg over.

1220
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,248
Really?

1221
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,000
No point lying about your weight.

1222
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,751
Yes, it's dangerous.

1223
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,964
EVEN AFTER DITCHING THE LOAD,
THEY'RE STILL ABOUT 200 KG OVER

1224
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,966
That means we need to leave three behind.

1225
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,134
Three?

1226
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:03,138
But it's better to carry
as many people as we can.

1227
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,682
It's right to take
the maximum number of people.

1228
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,808
That's right.

1229
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,767
I agree.

1230
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,396
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PEOPLE MEANS…

1231
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,525
If Andre decides to stay behind,

1232
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,193
we just need one more person.

1233
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,945
Andre can take that role.

1234
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,780
There's no need for three to stay.

1235
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,533
If Andre stays, only one stays behind.

1236
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,745
Is there any chance
that you could take the next one?

1237
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:30,749
I'm going in the helicopter.

1238
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,293
- Why?
- I'm from the military.

1239
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,210
I do combat.

1240
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:40,050
Iraq, Afghanistan,
strategic, fight, strong, big…

1241
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,968
THE TEAM WOULD BENEFIT FROM HIM

1242
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,845
He's proving that he's useful.

1243
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,180
I can save everybody.

1244
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,514
That's why I'm going.

1245
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,434
This is inevitable. The will to live.

1246
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,394
Okay, let's respect his decision.

1247
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,980
We don't need to overthink this.

1248
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,608
It's difficult now
but another helicopter's coming.

1249
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,194
So arguing over this is pointless.

1250
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:02,030
- It might be quicker to go and come back.
- I agree.

1251
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:05,283
DinDin, if we say it's around 70 kg…

1252
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,536
So this combination
could be a possibility.

1253
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,413
And these two.

1254
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,290
- What?
- Out of nowhere?

1255
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,419
That's right. Sae-ho too.

1256
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,254
Hey, Sae-ho!

1257
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,131
GET YOUR EMOTIONS UNDER CONTROL!

1258
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,675
Why are you crying?

1259
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,635
Add 72.

1260
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,803
I'm 72 kg.

1261
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,765
How heavy is Defconn?

1262
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,892
Add 140 to 91.

1263
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,937
You're talking
as if you're at the butcher.

1264
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,480
Refrain yourself.

1265
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,440
We might as well end up as meat.

1266
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,317
That's one way of putting it.

1267
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,276
THAT WAS HARSH!

1268
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,654
We aren't going anywhere
if we continue this.

1269
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,573
If Andre gets on,
three of us are left behind.

1270
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,325
If you have family, get on board.

1271
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,743
Hands up if you're single.

1272
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,412
- I just want a rough idea.
- Hey!

1273
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,830
What if you have a pet?

1274
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,289
Okay, how about this?

1275
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,668
If you have pets or family,
stand over here.

1276
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,086
I have a pet dog.

1277
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,004
One pet dog.

1278
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,922
- I have a pet dog.
- I have a cat.

1279
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,591
Involving pets doesn't seem right.

1280
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,718
Pets are 0.5 points.

1281
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,803
- What if I have two?
- Then one point.

1282
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,972
I have a pet brother!

1283
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,348
Hold on!

1284
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,558
Figurines don't count.

1285
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,727
- They don't count.
- They're my companions.

1286
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,937
Once a civil servant, always one.

1287
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,731
I have not one but two kids.

1288
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,149
They have their mom.

1289
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,026
LOSS FOR WORDS BECAUSE IT'S TRUE

1290
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,861
Do you need those sunglasses?

1291
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,363
I might if I have to stay.

1292
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,033
How about a round
of rock, paper, scissors?

1293
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,285
Let's exclude the women.

1294
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,286
- First…
- Okay!

1295
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,662
Let's do it.

1296
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,622
- Let's give it a go.
- I agree.

1297
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,707
It's fair this way.

1298
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,751
Rock, scissors, paper!

1299
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:41,755
Rock, scissors, paper!

1300
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,132
Rock, scissors, paper!

1301
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,550
This won't work.

1302
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,968
- Split into six.
- Split up.

1303
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,387
If you're late you lose,
rock, scissors, paper!

1304
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,015
But I wasn't late.

1305
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,142
Can I smash the rock with scissors?

1306
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,061
Nonsense! Hurry up.

1307
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,228
Why not?

1308
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,315
No, that would hurt the rock.

1309
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,110
EVERYONE IS SLOWLY LOSING THEIR SANITY

1310
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,698
Rock, scissors, paper!

1311
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,498
Listen!

1312
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,043
You go in.

1313
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,212
I am going to stay here.

1314
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,589
You're staying here?

1315
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,633
- You're staying?
- Yes, I'm staying.

1316
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,634
Why?

1317
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,636
I'm going to stay. I'm the strongest.

1318
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,596
I can handle all of these zombies.

1319
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,807
Trust me on that part, okay?

1320
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,480
It's no problem.

1321
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:46,694
THANKS TO THE SERGEANT,
ONE MORE COULD BOARD

1322
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,695
I'm very strong.

1323
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,406
I can handle this.

1324
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,450
- One more has to stay.
- You can't be alone.

1325
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,618
One more has to stay.

1326
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:57,163
DESPITE ANDRE'S DECISION,
TAKEOFF IS STILL NOT POSSIBLE

1327
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,082
I need one person.

1328
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,167
I need one person to come with me.

1329
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:02,836
Make your decision.

1330
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,087
We're taking off.

1331
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,047
We don't have time!

1332
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,049
Let's get on and see if it takes off.

1333
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,634
- We don't have time.
- Let's go.

1334
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,302
- Why?
- Go, brother.

1335
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,471
I'm okay.

1336
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,597
Okay?

1337
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:15,932
I'm so sad.

1338
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,100
- Why, bro?
- No, don't be.

1339
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,017
This is easy.

1340
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,060
You're our captain.

1341
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,979
Now, you're the captain.

1342
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,856
I'll be back.

1343
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,649
- You'll be back?
- I'll be back.

1344
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,234
- Please. You'll be back.
- Yeah.

1345
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,152
Okay.

1346
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,446
- Defconn, get on.
- In the middle.

1347
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:36,786
IT'S TIME FOR ANDRE TO CHOOSE A COMPANION

1348
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,832
Hug, please!

1349
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,383
- Amazing!
- Thank you, Andre.

1350
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,342
I'm okay.

1351
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,886
Andre.

1352
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,096
Thank you.

1353
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,139
I love Chef.

1354
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,688
Wait…

1355
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,071
- No way…
- Patricia.

1356
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,114
Patricia?

1357
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,324
What?

1358
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,492
- What?
- Let's go.

1359
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,618
You're with me.

1360
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,120
- Why?
- You're with me.

1361
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,079
- Me?
- Yes.

1362
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,583
Really?

1363
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,336
Don't worry.

1364
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,713
He chose to protect one person.

1365
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,633
I've got you. Let's go.

1366
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,259
- Really?
- Trust me.

1367
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,429
- What's your name?
- My name is Patricia.

1368
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,764
- Patricia?
- Yes.

1369
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,766
- Can you help?
- Yes. I'll help you.

1370
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:40,683
- Okay.
- Yes.

1371
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,312
They look like an uncle and his nephew
cooking together.

1372
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,649
What the…

1373
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,984
Teamwork.

1374
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,195
Shoot.

1375
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,031
- That's teamwork, right?
- Yeah, teamwork.

1376
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,157
Thank you.

1377
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,411
Are you okay?

1378
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,871
No, are you okay?

1379
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,581
I'm not okay.

1380
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,376
Okay.

1381
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,670
- Guys!
- Oh, Patricia!

1382
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,463
Patricia!

1383
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,673
You'll be fine.

1384
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,508
- We'll come back for you.
- Oh, no.

1385
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,260
Andre!

1386
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,803
Start the engine.

1387
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:25,728
Okay.

1388
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,855
You know what, Patricia?

1389
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,483
- What?
- I'm hungry.

1390
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,447
It's going to be okay.

1391
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,783
Okay, left is clear.

1392
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,451
- Clear.
- We're ready.

1393
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,953
Come on, take off.

1394
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,956
Just take off already.

1395
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:47,917
Let's go!

1396
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,136
It's taking off!

1397
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,305
Take off.

1398
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,479
This is unreal!

1399
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,606
We're off!

1400
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,774
Finally!

1401
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:41,971
I'll be back.

1402
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,474
This is making me sad.

1403
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:47,769
If Andre is by her side, she'll be fine.

1404
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,480
We survived, thanks to Andre.

1405
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,733
Patricia!

1406
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,588
Oh, no.

1407
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:06,973
I hate zombies.

1408
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:09,684
Come on.

1409
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,672
