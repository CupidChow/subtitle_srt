1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,012
You cowards!

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,222
If you want to talk, come in!

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,851
THEY'VE FIGURED OUT
WHERE HONG-CHUL IS HIDING

4
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,032
Room 201.

5
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,624
Defconn.

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,418
His room is empty.

7
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,335
It's empty?

8
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,879
But I found Hong-chul's hat.

9
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,589
- His hat?
- Really?

10
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,340
Hey, Ro Hong-chul!

11
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,645
I see his hat.

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,189
Isn't this the right room?

13
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,943
He's definitely on the second floor.

14
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,279
Oh, Defconn.

15
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,031
UNFORTUNATELY, HONG-CHUL HEARD DEFCONN

16
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,657
Now, Hee-kwan.

17
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,910
Bunch of cowards.

18
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,162
Just in case.

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,915
Which way should we go? This way?

20
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,754
Is he moving around?

21
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,088
What should we do?

22
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,215
COMES BACK WITH A STICK

23
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,633
What is that?

24
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,343
Let's put this over its head.

25
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,304
Let's work together like this.

26
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,932
We'd be able to block off the zombies.

27
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,351
Just face the zombies
and fight them instead.

28
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,187
UNABLE TO HOLD BACK,
SI-YOUNG DECLARES ALL-OUT WAR

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,146
Oh, my gosh.

30
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,773
Well, I…

31
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:52,445
I haven't seen a zombie up close yet.

32
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,155
Hey!

33
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,156
Come out!

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,158
Come out here, you bastard!

35
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:58,993
Si-young, look.

36
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:00,870
Oh, my gosh.

37
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,084
HER TENTH TIME SAYING, "OH MY GOSH"

38
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,089
Come out!

39
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,676
I'm not scared at all, come out!

40
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,803
- Come out!
- Come!

41
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,222
MEANWHILE, DINDIN APPROACHES ANOTHER ROOM

42
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,310
Oh, what the heck!

43
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,187
Shoot!

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,856
Shit!

45
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,983
Oh, my!

46
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,276
Come out!

47
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,237
Hurry and get here! Shoot!

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,447
ANOTHER LOSER JOINS THE ROOFTOP

49
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,949
- Shoot!
- Come out!

50
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,326
I see a zombie here.

51
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,411
Come out!

52
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,165
Come here!

53
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,834
CAREFUL! THE MOTEL OWNER'S
LINE OF SIGHT IS LOW

54
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,751
Come out!

55
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,546
Hey.

56
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,841
Get up here, get up.

57
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,426
Let's put this on.

58
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,761
Come out!

59
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,056
Go up!

60
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,438
Hurry! Get up here!

61
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,564
It's coming!

62
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,357
- It's coming!
- Shoot! It's here!

63
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,860
Hurry!

64
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,654
It's coming! Close the door!

65
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,617
Wow, it's fast!

66
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,035
It's crazy fast!

67
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,077
Si-young!

68
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,245
Why is it so fast?

69
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,246
Where's Si-young?

70
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,789
She ran into a room.

71
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,250
- Really?
- No, Si-young!

72
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,253
I'm on the first floor.

73
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,048
Stay a little further ahead.

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,717
Your food is on the way.

75
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,346
SMALL MOUSE DINDIN DOESN'T GIVE UP

76
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,646
Just give up and go away already.

77
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,981
Just go away.

78
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,484
First, let's look around the first floor.

79
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,444
Check each floor in order, right?

80
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,908
We checked room 103 earlier.

81
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,995
It's coming, get out.

82
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,414
It's coming. Get out, Tsuki!

83
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,583
It reacts to things on the floor.

84
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,751
Things on the floor?

85
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,101
It's Hong-chul!

86
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,936
- On the right.
- It's Hong-chul.

87
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,396
- Geez.
- You bastard!

88
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,313
Shoot.

89
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,439
You…

90
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,732
Darn! It's Yoo Hee-kwan!

91
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,236
FINALLY MEETS THE ONE
HE'S BEEN WAITING FOR, DINDIN

92
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,656
- Hee-kwan!
- Don't come…

93
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,659
Come out here first! Let's fight!

94
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,703
Si-young, let's close the door.

95
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,704
Hee-kwan!

96
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:52,041
Hee-kwan! Say hello!

97
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,420
- Hee-kwan, open your mouth wide.
- Bite me!

98
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,629
DinDin's on the left.

99
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,172
- Let's go up.
- He killed you.

100
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:02,343
Hee-kwan, he's the one
who killed you, remember?

101
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,637
Bite him!

102
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:10,059
Get closer!

103
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,730
Go up!

104
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,857
Let's go up!

105
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,485
Hey!

106
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:25,199
HE JUST HAD THE WORST BEATING
OF HIS LIFE AS A ZOMBIE

107
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,826
Go up!

108
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,827
Si-young, jump over!

109
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,287
- You bastard!
- He ran out!

110
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,804
How do we catch him?

111
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,432
- DinDin, catch him!
- No, hurry and catch him!

112
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,860
Hey!

113
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,203
Hey, you jerk.

114
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,871
I'm going to kill you.

115
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,042
Come on, this is fun. It's fun.

116
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:20,254
Hey, what are you doing? You…

117
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,173
- They caught him!
- Did they?

118
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,925
- Hey, Ro Hong-chul!
- Ro Hong-chul!

119
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,303
Geez, Hee-kwan.

120
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,223
Let's eat, Hee-kwan.

121
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,517
Hee-kwan?

122
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,937
- Hee-kwan is coming?
- Hee-kwan?

123
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,776
PUNISHMENT IS APPROACHING
FOR THE LOSERS ON THE ROOFTOP

124
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,373
What's coming?

125
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,461
This is crazy.

126
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,048
This is crazy.

127
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:04,966
It's Hee-kwan!

128
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,051
What's happening?

129
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,012
- That's crazy.
- It's Hee-kwan.

130
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,516
Defconn, watch out.

131
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,561
- Si-young, no.
- Seriously.

132
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,313
This was part of my plan.
Get a move on. Step on it.

133
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:25,403
PUNISHMENT STARTED ON THIS SIDE TOO

134
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,587
Stay still.

135
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,606
EXPOSED BY THE SUDDEN LIGHTS

136
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,652
WHOEVER DOES NOT ENDURE
AND LIFTS THEIR FEET WILL BE CAUGHT!

137
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,823
THE FIRST PERSON TO LIFT BOTH FEET
WILL FACE A BLOODY PUNISHMENT

138
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,662
ROOFTOP BLOODSHED:
KEEP YOUR FEET PLANTED AND FREEZE

139
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,383
THE MOTEL OWNER CRAWLS ON FLOOR,
LOOKING FOR ANY MOVEMENTS

140
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,804
IF YOU CHOOSE TO RUN,
HEE-KWAN WON'T LET IT SLIDE

141
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,949
HE LET OUT A HEAVY BREATH

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,337
NO REACTION TO SOUND

143
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,341
GRITTING THEIR TEETH
AND KEEPING THEIR FEET PLANTED

144
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,273
BURDENED BY THE OBJECTS
THAT THEY GRABBED IN A HURRY

145
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,656
POSTURE MIGHT WEAKEN AS TIME PASSES

146
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,208
REGRETS PICKING THEM UP

147
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,922
5 MINUTES HAVE PASSED

148
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,427
THE NEXT THREAT IS APPROACHING

149
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,119
CHICKENS LAND AT TAEYEON'S FEET

150
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,260
HELD ON WITHOUT A SINGLE "OH MY GOSH"

151
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,438
10 MINUTES HAVE PASSED

152
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:01,911
TWO PEOPLE MOVED THEIR FEET
AS THE LIGHTS SUDDENLY BURST

153
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,623
DEFCONN

154
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,875
AND TSUKI

155
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,215
WHOEVER LIFTS THEIR FEET FIRST
WILL BE SACRIFICED

156
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,092
We're here!

157
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,574
We had no choice.

158
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,785
- What?
- We've got to go.

159
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,955
- Get in.
- This is killing me.

160
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,456
I feel like I'm going to die.

161
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,457
Where's Tsuki?

162
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,375
How about Tsuki?

163
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,503
- Tsuki?
- Tsuki…

164
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,356
Hey!

165
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,402
I can't take this anymore! Seriously!

166
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,321
Tsuki!

167
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,866
Shoot! Tsuki!

168
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,327
- Hey!
- Hey! Hee-kwan!

169
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,622
Well, I just…

170
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,582
Die!

171
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,418
Hee-kwan!

172
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,586
No, Hee-kwan!

173
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,254
- Tsuki!
- No!

174
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,090
- No!
- Let's go!

175
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,842
Tsuki!

176
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,650
THE NEXT DAY

177
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,111
Those who escort the individuals
with the rare antibodies

178
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,156
to the medical center in Seoul
will be rewarded up to 5 billion won.

179
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,451
A safe accommodation
will also be arranged.

180
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,785
TRANSPORTING HONG-CHUL TO SEOUL

181
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,509
SURVIVED

182
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,843
It's finished.

183
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,433
Everyone looks exhausted.

184
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,018
Hong-chul, be quiet.

185
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,896
I'm pissed because Tsuki isn't here.

186
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,442
She used to sit
next to me whenever I drove.

187
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,619
Tsuki…

188
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,747
Oh, I made it.

189
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,250
Hey, take the main road.

190
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,793
This path is way too rough.

191
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,753
The main road is safer.

192
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,217
Just shut your mouth.

193
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,052
Hey, are you having fun?

194
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,346
- So many died because of you, you know.
- Stop smiling.

195
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,098
I'm just smiley, you know that.

196
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,100
Do you know how many died?

197
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,352
Looking back,
we should've just taken him down

198
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,062
when Defconn suggested it.

199
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,647
I told you so.

200
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,607
- You brought Hee-kwan, right?
- Yes.

201
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,402
Tsuki died because of Hee-kwan?

202
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,904
She got bitten by Hee-kwan in the end.

203
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,322
I had no idea.

204
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,490
I didn't mean to.

205
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,450
I had no idea what was going on.

206
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,368
You caused it.

207
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,413
If another zombie bit her,
it wouldn't be this upsetting.

208
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,874
How could you make a friend bite a friend?

209
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,667
Hee-kwan was crying as he bit her.

210
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,253
He was choking up
in tears before he bit her.

211
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,381
No, Tsuki and Tae-hun…

212
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,258
- The officer?
- Tae-hun?

213
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,175
It's Seon-tae!

214
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,886
It's Seon-tae, not Tae-hun!

215
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,679
Did you call him Tae-hun?

216
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,473
She's never considered him
as her team member.

217
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,893
Seon-tae meant so much to us!

218
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,352
Coming from you?

219
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,981
RUBBED SALT IN A DEAD MAN'S WOUND

220
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,192
So Eun-bi survived but Seon-tae died.

221
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,986
I'm sorry about that.

222
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,571
You don't have to apologize.

223
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,282
Eun-bi, you're all alone now, right?

224
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,910
I'm alone since my manager got bitten.

225
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,330
On the bright side,
I don't have any more gigs.

226
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,625
THE GIGS WEREN'T VOLUNTARY AFTER ALL

227
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,959
Were you that exhausted?

228
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,544
You did work hard, seriously.

229
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,963
RAN OFF WITHOUT
GETTING PAID BUT STILL HAPPY

230
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,049
We would've been better off
without this guy.

231
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,301
We lost so many lives.

232
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,345
We don't have more to spare.

233
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,056
We'll take him and whether
they cut him up or what not,

234
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,516
we'll make sure the vaccine is developed.

235
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,061
We'll bring justice
to those who died unfairly.

236
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,437
That way, I can die in peace.

237
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,191
With the vaccine, Tsuki and the others
could turn back to normal, right?

238
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,443
- We can save them.
- Of course, we can.

239
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,821
DinDin, how much longer
until we get to Seoul?

240
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,323
About three to four hours.

241
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,449
Three to four hours?

242
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,951
Let's tie him up here.

243
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,745
- We need to make it to the medical center.
- Yeah, we do.

244
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,872
But…

245
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,082
I shouldn't be saying this.

246
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,668
I had a few of these,
so I need to use the restroom.

247
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,835
- What?
- The restroom.

248
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,464
After all that has happened?

249
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,924
We have one here.

250
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,342
Zombies need restrooms too?

251
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,927
I've held it for so long.

252
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,928
Try opening it.

253
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,180
There's a rest stop nearby.

254
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,975
- A rest stop?
- Let's stop there.

255
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,395
But I'm against stopping at the rest stop.
How do we trust him?

256
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,689
But if we make a stop there,

257
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,857
we can look for something to eat too.

258
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,401
We don't have any food.

259
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,861
I agree that we should look for food.

260
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,780
But I feel uneasy about the restroom.

261
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,659
- It's the men's restroom, so you stay.
- I'll go. I need to use the restroom too.

262
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,744
- I'll go with you.
- Someone grab his left hand.

263
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,204
And another grab his right.

264
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,372
Tie your hands to his.

265
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,666
You want us to be on both sides? Okay.

266
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,251
You expect me to go like this?

267
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,545
- I need to touch this.
- Others will do it.

268
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,671
Can you take it out?

269
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm okay with that, but are you?

270
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,258
- You okay with it?
- Okay with what?

271
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,676
- You okay with it?
- Yes.

272
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,971
Tie your hands with his, then from afar…

273
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,139
You can do this.

274
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,850
- Just hold it up a bit with this.
- We can just use this.

275
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,268
After he's done,

276
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,061
just help him put his pants back.

277
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,939
No need to take care of him so well.

278
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,524
Can you get me some warm clothes?

279
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,650
- Clothes?
- I'm cold.

280
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,653
- Zombies have body heat.
- Why would a zombie need clothes?

281
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,905
Stay still before we strip you naked.

282
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,824
- You don't need clothes.
- Hong-chul, stop it.

283
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,783
Look at the season.

284
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,536
Instead of this flashy top,
how about a plain one?

285
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,662
Do we have any tops?

286
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,205
Try looking over there.

287
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,499
We're here.

288
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,464
MONGIL REST STOP

289
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,506
We've arrived.

290
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,300
You're a good driver.

291
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,265
A QUIET REST STOP
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SEOUL

292
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,604
It's a rest stop.

293
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,355
- It's a rest stop.
- The right one.

294
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,609
They have puffed rice snacks!

295
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,528
LUCKILY, IT'S FILLED
WITH SUPPLIES INSTEAD OF ZOMBIES

296
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,907
If you guys are tied to me,
your hands might touch it.

297
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,160
Sae-ho, at the restroom,
don't do what he asks for.

298
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,953
- They're all traps.
- Okay, got it.

299
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,372
- Don't even shake it off for him.
- Okay.

300
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,501
I get the situation,
but why are you so sensitive about it?

301
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,752
Even this?

302
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,629
But where's the restroom?

303
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,755
Over there.

304
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,964
This is too much…

305
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,591
We don't have a choice.

306
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,634
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

307
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,219
NO WAY TO AVOID UNPLEASANT CONTACT

308
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,220
Let's just go first.

309
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,471
Hey, I don't care.

310
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,181
You know me, I go all the way.

311
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,183
I'm not going to be considerate.

312
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,769
HELP THE ONE WITH RARE ANTIBODIES
GO NUMBER ONE

313
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,770
I regret this now.

314
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,647
You guys agreed to this.

315
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,440
I don't care. I'm not…

316
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,068
I'm not embarrassed anyways.

317
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,029
You're not going to untie this? Seriously?

318
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,155
Are you sure?

319
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,490
I'm doing it.

320
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,828
- You touched it!
- Oh, wait!

321
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,412
They're too close.

322
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,872
- Wait…
- My hand!

323
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,707
We'll pull down the pants for you.

324
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,293
Wait, hold on. Get ready first.

325
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,546
Wait, how do I lower this?

326
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,673
NO JOKE, HE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO DO IT

327
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,133
You can't do it like this.

328
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,636
Hold on, my hand
is touching your pee. Wait!

329
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,638
Hey, hold on. Geez.

330
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:04,268
I don't care.

331
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,185
Come on!

332
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,272
Oh, what's happening?

333
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,066
HE MUST'VE TAKEN A PEEK

334
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,193
What is this?

335
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,111
What's that?

336
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,242
What's that?

337
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,827
5 MINUTES AGO
WHILE HONG-CHUL CHANGED

338
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,744
This looks so real.

339
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,997
You can't even tell by looking at it.

340
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,584
They're going to be shocked
when I pull this out.

341
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,170
SECRETLY EQUIPPED WITH A SPECIAL WATER GUN

342
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,921
LOOKS LIKE AN ELEPHANT'S TRUNK

343
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,923
Don't do that, geez!

344
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,137
COMPLETELY FOOLED BY
HOW REALISTIC IT LOOKS

345
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,848
He's actually doing it.

346
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,391
You're not going to untie this?

347
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,392
Seriously?

348
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:49,646
TRIES TO LURE THEM BUT THEY MUST ENDURE

349
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,023
Should I do it?

350
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,316
Should I do it or not?

351
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,568
Hold on, please.

352
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,403
FIRE IN THE HOLE!

353
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,113
I don't care.

354
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,784
Oh, what's that?

355
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,662
- It's your idea.
- My hand's wet.

356
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,414
BARLEY TEA IS SQUIRTED OUT

357
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,542
Hey!

358
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,544
Don't come near me!

359
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,671
What's happening?

360
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,798
Mom!

361
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,758
What is it?

362
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,677
What's this?

363
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,971
Why would you pee…

364
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,141
Why are you blocking me?

365
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,518
DON'T CUT OFF THE ELEPHANT'S TRUNK

366
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,437
What is that? Geez.

367
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,899
Are you not going to untie this?

368
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,236
Hey, what's this?
What kind of show is this?

369
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,030
A SHOW? SEEMS LIKE HE'S REALLY OUT OF IT

370
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,115
What's going on?

371
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,619
My hand is really damp right now.

372
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,079
I shouldn't have come.

373
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,455
GOOD JOB! MAINTAINED RESTRAINT

374
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,539
That startled me.

375
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,170
- Why are you hitting that spot?
- I need to shake it.

376
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,298
- Stop. What's wrong with you?
- I need to shake it off.

377
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,841
It's the size of my fist!

378
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,842
Hey.

379
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,136
Wow, he's more impressive than I thought.

380
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,055
- Right?
- That's enough.

381
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,432
RAN OUT OF BARLEY TEA NOW

382
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,559
Where was he aiming? It's on my pants.

383
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,978
He sprayed all over me.

384
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,938
QUEST OBJECTIVE:
HELP HONG-CHUL GO NUMBER ONE

385
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,398
Hey, guys…

386
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,818
- I can't hold it in.
- What?

387
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,569
I think I need to go number two.

388
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,696
What?

389
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,572
EMERGENCY! THERE'S ONE BIG SHOT LEFT

390
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,032
- No, no.
- I need to go.

391
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,284
No… Let's get out.

392
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,619
No, I'm being serious. I need to go.

393
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,121
We have no choice.

394
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,789
A COINCIDENCE, ONE STALL LEFT

395
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,457
- Get out.
- Can you untie this?

396
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,959
- No.
- You can just watch me.

397
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,752
No, let's just get out of here.

398
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,129
- I really need to go.
- Nonsense.

399
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,588
- Just once.
- No…

400
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,007
- How do we get in?
- A big one.

401
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,845
I can't hold it in any longer.

402
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,139
You saw it happening just now. Seriously.

403
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,391
Just untie this for a second.

404
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,562
THEY'LL FACE MAJOR CRITICISM
IF THEY UNTIE HIM

405
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,231
Okay, fine. Let's go in.

406
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,483
UNTYING HIM IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE

407
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,194
Go the other way. Sung-jae, go this way.

408
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,696
Do we have to do this?

409
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,990
QUEST OBJECTIVES:
HELP HONG-CHUL GO NUMBER TWO

410
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,952
SAE-HO AND SUNG-JAE MIGHT NEED THAT

411
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,080
Si-young, what are you…

412
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,248
- Belt.
- Belt?

413
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
We can hit them with a belt.

414
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,710
There's a lot to collect.

415
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,379
UNAWARE OF THE RESTROOM SITUATION,
THEY'RE BUSY SCAVENGING

416
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,465
Hey!

417
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,425
Hey!

418
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,761
Tsuki, are you doing okay?

419
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,096
NO USE ASKING THE CACTUS

420
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,723
Come here.

421
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,807
Put in some coins.

422
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,559
I'm really good at this.

423
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,144
What's Hong-chul up to?

424
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,021
They should've been done by now.

425
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,231
Do I need to pull it down in front of you?

426
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,149
Wait.

427
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,525
Lift this up.

428
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,448
Oh? I hear something.

429
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,991
I think the zombie is wiping.

430
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:49,910
Can you check?

431
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:50,827
This is dangerous.

432
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll be fine but that startled me.

433
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,127
You scared me. I'll be okay though.

434
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,548
LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL BE HERE
UNTILL THEY FIND A WAY

435
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,342
Hold on, I have an idea.

436
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,510
I'll help.

437
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,844
Just do what you have to do.

438
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,888
- Do it when it's gone.
- Did it go out?

439
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,599
Wait, I touched something.

440
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,643
- Hey.
- No, why…

441
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,853
Why are you bringing my hand to it?

442
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,897
Then untie this!

443
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,899
I really want to cry.

444
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:21,900
Pass the toilet paper.

445
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,485
The toilet paper is here.

446
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,195
It's not. We don't have any.

447
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,321
Oh, there's none.

448
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,198
It must be in the next stall.

449
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,908
- Darn it.
- Get me some toilet paper.

450
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,785
This isn't enough.

451
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:36,206
QUEST OBJECTIVES: FIND SOMETHING
HONG-CHUL CAN WIPE WITH

452
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,542
I need a lot.

453
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,756
- Are you checking the other stall?
- Give me that.

454
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,886
You scared me! Why?

455
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,556
What's wrong? That frightened me.

456
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,515
It went back in!

457
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,350
- Here.
- My stomach hurts.

458
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,309
Can you see it?

459
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,855
It's having a bathroom break.

460
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,316
THE ZOMBIE SUFFERING FROM
CONSTIPATION IS HOLDING THE TOILET PAPER

461
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,488
- There's the toilet paper.
- Is it there?

462
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,406
It's here.

463
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,491
The zombie is holding it. I'll get it.

464
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,576
- How?
- This man…

465
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,078
I'll shake it for you. You should get up.

466
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,623
- You see it?
- It's holding it.

467
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,251
- In its hand.
- Yes.

468
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,961
The hat looks nice too.

469
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,050
SECURED A HAT
AND TWO PIECES OF TOILET PAPER

470
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,635
We have the toilet paper.

471
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,804
- Isn't this enough?
- How's that enough?

472
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,765
I need a lot. I wipe until I bleed.

473
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,809
ANAL FISTULA DON'T HAPPEN FOR NO REASON

474
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,440
SOMETHING'S ON THE STICK?

475
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,152
Hey! This zombie has poop on its hand!

476
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,695
Oh, no! There's poop on it!

477
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,654
Oh, shit!

478
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,489
What's that?

479
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,366
It's poop! Hey!

480
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,787
Hey…

481
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,081
- What should we do?
- Hold on.

482
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,416
Should we go out or not?

483
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,252
Smelling it makes me want to poop more.

484
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,004
What is this?

485
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,884
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING,
IT WAS ACTUALLY CHOCOLATE

486
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,678
Hold on, this guy. I got his pants.

487
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,180
Hold on, give me a second.

488
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,726
Hey!

489
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,894
Hey! The stick!

490
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,354
The stick broke.

491
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,940
Hey, it's getting on me.

492
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,942
Can you get the angle? Should I do it?

493
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,235
- I got it.
- Did you?

494
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,945
Hold on, this…

495
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,989
Oh, that scared me!

496
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,491
I got poop on my hand!

497
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,159
Shoot!

498
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,620
- That's gross!
- It's on my hand!

499
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,998
- You okay with it?
- Okay with what?

500
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,000
SLOWLY REGRETTING HIS PREVIOUS COMMENT

501
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,630
Oh, what should I do?

502
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,384
CHOCOLATE PARTY FOR A CHOCOLATE LOVER

503
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,011
You're so inconsiderate!

504
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,139
Seriously! Even if you're a zombie,
how could you smear that on us?

505
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,850
Hey, I'm ready.

506
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,394
Go ahead.

507
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,353
Hold on.

508
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,069
Why did you come all dressed up?

509
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,655
Do you need those sunglasses?

510
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,198
I might if I have to stay.

511
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,201
Hong-chul, this is a gift from my heart.
It's from Chrome Hearts.

512
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,703
Sae-ho wears a lot of their stuff.

513
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,621
FAVORITE SUNGLASSES SURVIVED MANY CRISES

514
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,498
IT WILL SOON BE COVERED IN CHOCOLATE!

515
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,677
SACRIFICED HIS FACE
TO SAVE THE DESIGNER ITEM

516
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,470
Hey, it's out. Press the flush.

517
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,472
It's out?

518
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,557
Water.

519
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,058
That's poop.

520
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,018
There's poop.

521
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,603
What?

522
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,816
LUCKY! THE TOILET PAPER
HAS BEEN TOSSED OVER

523
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,526
- It worked!
- Finally.

524
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,236
- It worked.
- Good job.

525
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,905
There's poop on the toilet paper.

526
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:56,823
What do I do?

527
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,366
It's all over my clothes.

528
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,827
Sae-ho, your face.

529
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,370
Too much poop on my clothes.

530
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,413
I need to change.

531
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,540
- Are you done?
- One more time.

532
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,583
One more time.

533
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,793
So gross!

534
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,254
What? Wasn't that Hong-chul?

535
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:15,300
Seon-tae, a civil servant
who worked nonstop,

536
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,259
saved Eun-bi.

537
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,219
We'll take her with us until the end.

538
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,220
A MEMORIAL SERVICE

539
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,221
I'll make sure…

540
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,016
to keep that promise.

541
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,142
I'm sorry.

542
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,436
What did Tsuki like?

543
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,354
Tsuki. Sake.

544
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,023
Since Tsuki liked sake,
let's give her some sikhye.

545
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,192
DON'T TRY TO SOOTHE HER WITH SWEETS

546
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,526
I miss you, Tsuki.

547
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,071
Our beloved Tsuki and…

548
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,409
Kim Seon-tae.

549
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,165
- Hey.
- This is worse than not doing it at all.

550
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,336
Oh, Seon-tae!

551
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,088
THE MEMORIAL HAS A GREAT EFFECT

552
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,839
We're sorry, Seon-tae!

553
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,091
He's angry!

554
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,259
Oh, Seon-tae!

555
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,055
What's taking Hong-chul so long?

556
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,515
What are they doing?

557
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,642
That was enough time for number two.

558
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,852
CORRECT! TRYING TO ESCAPE AFTER NUMBER TWO

559
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,978
Don't come so close.

560
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,273
It's okay, friend.

561
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,608
He's okay.

562
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,527
Go get washed. Wipe off everything.

563
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,405
- Hey! What's up with my face?
- Clean your face.

564
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,615
Close the door.

565
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,784
- Something's weird.
- Sung-jae!

566
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,786
- Yes, Si-young?
- What's up?

567
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,913
Hey, don't come in!

568
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,582
Don't come near me!

569
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,501
- Did you get bitten?
- No.

570
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,752
I have poop on me.

571
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,212
Stop lying!

572
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,381
- I'm serious. Stay away.
- What?

573
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,632
Stay away from me.

574
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,925
What happened?

575
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,137
ABOVE ALL, CHANGING OUTFITS IS URGENT

576
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,847
- How's this?
- Isn't it too short?

577
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,015
But crop tops are popular these days.

578
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,019
Wait, aren't you the singer Jinsung?

579
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,271
Aren't you Jinsung?

580
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,440
Was it just an…

581
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,275
I've somewhat cleaned up the smell.

582
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,901
QUICKLY AGREED ON CHANEL STYLE

583
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,986
You look good.

584
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,487
All right, let's go now.

585
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,241
Sung-jae, I feel like we've gotten closer.

586
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,993
Definitely way too close.

587
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,745
QUEST COMPLETE

588
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,007
We're almost here.

589
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,010
We're approaching Seoul!

590
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,304
What?

591
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,055
What's happening?

592
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,891
- Why?
- Why?

593
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,142
It's blocked.

594
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,268
The entrance?

595
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,936
We can't get in.

596
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,023
- I told you it was going to be blocked.
- We can't go in?

597
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,737
Drive as far as you can.

598
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,950
Let's get off.

599
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,244
- Hey.
- We can't get in.

600
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,704
This is a serious problem.

601
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,539
What happened?

602
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,209
This is a total mess.

603
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:06,012
FINALLY SEEING THE SEOUL LOCKDOWN
WITH THEIR OWN EYES

604
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,472
Wow, what's that?

605
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,098
Everything's burning up there.

606
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,142
I don't think we can get in.

607
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,685
It's total devastation.

608
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:22,028
With this level of chaos,
does it even make sense to go in?

609
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,448
- How about just a few people go?
- I agree…

610
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,950
No, that's not enough.

611
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,409
If he agrees, we shouldn't.

612
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,661
No. We all go in.

613
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,870
Give me your hand.

614
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,417
Let's go.

615
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,507
I'm telling you, this is pointless.

616
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,842
Is this right?

617
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:44,968
It's wrong.

618
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,304
It's chaotic, everything's on fire.

619
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,473
I don't feel good about this.

620
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,183
Something smells weird.

621
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,434
There's smoke too.

622
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,353
Should we walk a little slower?

623
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,106
Don't run off.
I'll chase you to hell if I have to.

624
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,733
- You can't run.
- You're standing in hell.

625
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,443
Something is written up there.

626
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,946
It says, "total lockdown."

627
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,329
Wait, everything's collapsed.

628
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,956
It's blocked.

629
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,883
We can't get through this.

630
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,260
I think we can get in that way.

631
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,386
What?

632
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,138
The emergency subway passage.

633
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,264
SUBWAY PASSAGE FOUND

634
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,684
I'll get up first
and help each one of you.

635
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,478
Wow, that's quick.

636
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,438
Grab this.

637
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,106
I have no intention of going.

638
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,441
- Get up quickly.
- Hold on.

639
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,776
Hurry and get up.

640
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,944
Why are you pinching?

641
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,904
Okay, I will.

642
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,071
You better come.

643
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,407
Dex, climb up.

644
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,034
Through this way?

645
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,452
It's a restricted area.

646
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,120
RESTRICTED AREA

647
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,082
- This way?
- A shelter for emergencies.

648
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,417
Let's just go first.

649
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,252
Well, I…

650
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,253
Go.

651
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,255
Get in.

652
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,098
Can we go through this?

653
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,560
Well, I see footsteps.

654
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,437
It seems like there's a way.

655
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,274
Hey, this is my first time
seeing a subway passage.

656
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,528
What's wrong with you?

657
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,200
Hey, be quiet!

658
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,089
What is this?

659
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,384
Hey.

660
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,094
Do you see anything?

661
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,512
Why is it so bright here?

662
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,526
It looks like they live here.

663
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,528
Why are there so many people?

664
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,071
There's a lot of people.

665
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,410
EVACUEES APPEAR TO BE
GATHERING IN THE STATION AREA

666
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,122
People are…

667
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,206
Tied down here.

668
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,083
Really? They don't seem well.

669
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,918
- Hello.
- What's…

670
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,503
What's this place for?

671
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,505
This is our temporary shelter.

672
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,048
- A temporary shelter?
- Yes.

673
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,091
A temporary shelter?

674
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,467
We had some issues,

675
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,761
so we were turned away.

676
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,804
- Turned away?
- Yes.

677
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:38,057
They must be the ones
who were refused entry into the shelter.

678
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,101
Isn't that person bitten?

679
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,227
She's slightly red.

680
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,813
Wait, hold on.

681
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,064
Isn't she bitten?

682
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,941
It's a zombie! She's bitten.

683
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,028
Is this before the change?

684
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,654
- I think so.
- Look around here.

685
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,992
There's a kid in the middle.

686
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,496
THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE INFECTED
BUT HAVEN'T TURNED INTO ZOMBIES YET

687
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,373
Infected people are scattered here.

688
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,129
- Oh, gosh!
- That man has severe symptoms.

689
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,673
THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE
ALREADY TURNING INTO ZOMBIES

690
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,925
Did we come in the wrong place?

691
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,929
TEMPORARY SHELTER IN THE STATION
FOR THOSE WHO WERE REFUSED ENTRY

692
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,432
- Wait, this place…
- What's going on?

693
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,975
There are zombies and people.

694
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,312
This place looks really dangerous to me.

695
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,355
It is. How did we end up here?

696
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,233
Honey! It's okay!

697
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,276
Are you okay?

698
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,737
What's wrong?

699
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,327
Go inside.

700
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,330
These damn zombies
are getting on my nerves!

701
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:46,042
It's acting like that
because it's turning into a zombie.

702
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,335
No, hold on. Move.

703
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,920
Excuse me!

704
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,297
Why do you only think about yourself?

705
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,218
There are people who couldn't
get into the shelter gathered here.

706
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:59,889
I mean, even if they're family,
don't you care about the safety of others?

707
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,809
We need to get rid
of all these damn zombies.

708
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,768
Calm down.

709
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,561
What if it were your family?

710
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,647
- Calm down.
- Are our lives worth nothing?

711
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,982
- Is that okay for us?
- Calm down.

712
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,653
Why are you talking like that?

713
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,404
Would you be okay with this?

714
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,405
We might die!

715
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,157
You're not dead yet. Calm down.

716
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,994
There are zombies and people
together in the shelter right now!

717
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:26,207
All the zombies are gathered here,
and it's just us people over there.

718
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,378
Oh, no.

719
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,590
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T ABANDON
THEIR INFECTED LOVED ONES

720
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,634
Hey! Be quiet!

721
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,760
Hey!

722
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,180
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE
DISTURBED BY THEIR PRESENCE

723
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,058
I get it but calling them
"damn zombie" isn't necessary.

724
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,185
They're still family.

725
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,104
Family? They're zombies.

726
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,690
They're not people anymore.

727
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,984
There's someone with the antibodies.

728
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,193
- Antibodies?
- Yes.

729
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,611
- We're waiting.
- Antibodies?

730
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,698
Are you talking about that
1 in 2.5 million guy?

731
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,701
They're looking for someone
with the antibodies.

732
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,955
THE NEWS ABOUT THE 5 BILLION WON
INDIVIDUAL HAS ALREADY SPREAD

733
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,123
Come here.

734
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,334
They might see what I'm holding.

735
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,460
Then let's untie it.

736
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,629
No, we can't do that.

737
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,842
Dex, you can't see it, right?

738
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:18,926
I can't.

739
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,637
It's not visible this way. It's okay.

740
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:26,893
I heard that just finding out where
they are is already worth 50 million won.

741
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,312
Then if we find and bring them…

742
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,648
- Be quiet, okay?
- Five billion? It's a lottery!

743
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,902
Hong-chul, you might get killed
by these people.

744
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,612
Let's go. Over there.

745
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,280
They'll tear you limb from limb.

746
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,823
Everyone will try to get you.

747
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,951
They could sell your arm
for 100 million, a leg for 300…

748
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,998
NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO
REVEAL HONG-CHUL'S TRUE IDENTITY

749
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,251
Defconn, over there. The judo…

750
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,212
- Judo?
- The twins.

751
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,423
FAMILIAR FACES AMONGST THE INFECTED ONES

752
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,553
Are you okay?

753
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,598
- The Cho twins!
- Wow, it's DinDin!

754
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,099
Cho Jun-ho and Jun-hyun.

755
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,227
Hello.

756
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,564
BOTH WERE ON THE NATIONAL TEAM,
AND JUN-HO IS A BRONZE MEDALIST

757
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,982
DinDin, you're here.

758
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,902
You guys ended up here too.

759
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,237
UNABLE TO HIDE HIS SADNESS

760
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,948
On the way, we got in a fight
with a zombie.

761
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,576
How did a judo player get bitten?
Just throw it to the ground.

762
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,204
We did.
This bastard took it a step further.

763
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,372
He was choking it,

764
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,291
but he got bitten
when his arm went into its mouth.

765
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,334
Keep still.

766
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,836
The arm locked into the mouth,
not the neck.

767
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,505
You'll get bitten too.

768
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,589
Why would I?

769
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,966
Well, your brother did.

770
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,636
Hey, DinDin.
I'm a London Olympics bronze medalist.

771
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,804
And he isn't.

772
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,389
That's why he's bitten.

773
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,433
RECEIVED A ZOMBIE VIRUS INSTEAD OF A MEDAL

774
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,979
He's going to turn into
a very strong zombie.

775
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,647
That'll be dangerous.

776
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,025
Jun-hyun, we share the same last name.

777
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,194
He's coming to his senses.

778
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,654
REACTS TO A FAMILY MEMBER

779
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,740
Jun-ho and I are from the same clan.

780
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,659
Changnyeong Cho. He's more senior than us.

781
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,035
Greet me properly.

782
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,954
Say hello, Jun-hyun.

783
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,582
HE'S INFECTED
BUT IS STILL A RESPECTFUL ZOMBIE

784
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,044
Have some of this.

785
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,423
EUN-BI BEING THOUGHTFUL,
SHARES HER PRECIOUS FOOD

786
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,884
Oh, dear…

787
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,887
Did you bring her here
after she got bitten?

788
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,348
I couldn't just leave her,
so I brought her here.

789
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,687
The kid…

790
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,647
Do you have anything to eat?

791
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,566
- Goodness.
- Thank you.

792
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,320
Here, have this to eat.

793
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,113
Thank you for sharing.

794
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:48,117
Eun-bi, you're beautiful inside and out.

795
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,368
QUESTIONING HIS STATE

796
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,786
Oh, no…

797
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,498
MUST FIND A WAY OUT OF THE SHELTER
THEY ENTERED UNEXPECTEDLY

798
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,541
Let's go that way.

799
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,210
Si-young, let's get out.

800
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,628
We will, but…

801
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,588
Let's just ask.

802
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,758
Hello.

803
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,468
How old is she?

804
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,636
- Ten years old.
- Ten?

805
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,139
Where's her mom?

806
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,227
I can't see Mom anymore?

807
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,730
SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED

808
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,607
The atmosphere in here is a bit…

809
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,816
It's not great.

810
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,111
Don't get too close
to the zombie families over there.

811
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,989
They go wild several times a day.

812
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,868
Then do you know the way out of here?

813
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,828
We've been meaning to look for it.

814
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,040
All we hear is something
that sounds like the subway.

815
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,375
- Yes.
- I heard it too.

816
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,293
I heard the sound of the subway too.

817
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,338
Hold on.

818
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,257
Why?

819
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,635
The subway is still running.

820
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,844
I hear the noises.

821
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,888
The subways are running now?

822
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,890
Didn't you just hear a subway?

823
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,517
Looks like they're running.

824
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,685
The subway runs here, right?

825
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,647
Not sure what the sound is,
but I hear it five to six times a day.

826
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,148
OBTAINED INTEL

827
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,818
I'm just guessing.
I haven't actually seen it.

828
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,319
We'll ask around.

829
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,655
Yes, I think the subway is running.

830
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,700
A SUBWAY STATION AMIDST THE DISASTER

831
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:15,246
A SUBWAY TRAIN USED
FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES MIGHT PASS THROUGH

832
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,455
Two.

833
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,373
- Two?
- One here.

834
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,208
- One here.
- Two here.

835
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,045
THERE'S A NOISY TABLE IN THE AREA
WHERE NONINFECTED PEOPLE ARE

836
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,131
- Come on.
- You saw it.

837
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,341
- Why aren't you listening?
- Never.

838
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,135
What are you doing?

839
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,804
Just playing games.
There's nothing to do all day.

840
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,681
How do you play it?

841
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,890
It's a shell game.

842
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,892
Oh, Jun-pyo?

843
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,145
- Jun-pyo. What the…
- Hello.

844
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,188
How did you end up here?

845
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,065
Hello.

846
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,484
MAGICIAN KIM JUN-PYO
IS THE OWNER OF THIS TABLE

847
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,610
He's a professional.

848
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,822
Oh, my!

849
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,824
If you win the game, you keep that…

850
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,159
- Of course.
- And if you lose?

851
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,952
PLAYING SHELL GAMES TO RELIEVE THE BOREDOM

852
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,539
They have alcohol. Soju!

853
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,249
It looks like there's a lot.

854
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,293
SEEMS LIKE THEY CAN GAIN SOMETHING HERE

855
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,503
- You need to guess the number of balls.
- Oh, okay.

856
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,922
I'll place the balls in here individually.

857
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,132
One by one.

858
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,385
After I do this,
guess the number of balls here.

859
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,636
All three of them.

860
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,971
- No, two.
- Three.

861
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,347
- Three?
- Three?

862
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,390
There are two.

863
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,267
Let's go with three.

864
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,269
Be careful.

865
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,898
Oh, what?

866
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,525
WITNESSED SOMEONE WINNING

867
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,738
- We have something to give.
- We have a lot.

868
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,072
Use your dynamic visual acuity.

869
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,157
ALREADY UNDER THE SPELL

870
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,742
Dex, you have a good vision.

871
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,243
I'll try this.

872
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,328
I can find it.

873
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,871
It's a different game now.

874
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,955
This…

875
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,957
Dex, pay attention. He's a pro.

876
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,627
- I choose four of diamonds.
- Four of diamonds?

877
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,754
I will use that.

878
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,839
This should be easy to remember.

879
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:53,302
I'll place the cards like this
and shuffle them around.

880
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,304
This should be familiar.

881
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,388
And…

882
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,432
What was that?

883
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,809
You need to guess where it is.

884
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,604
- I lost it.
- Where is it?

885
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,189
This.

886
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,400
- Shoot.
- What?

887
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,778
What?

888
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,322
SWINDLED EVEN WITH THEIR EYES WIDE OPEN

889
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,575
I told you from the start,
we shouldn't play his games.

890
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,661
- It's our first time.
- Try another round.

891
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,121
If you wear this, zombies can't bite you.

892
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,706
Immunity against zombies.

893
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,833
OUT OF HIS MIND,
SELLS HIS PRECIOUS WETSUIT

894
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,460
Let's go!

895
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,670
Okay, let's go!

896
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,256
- Follow your instincts.
- They're crazy.

897
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,924
- One by one. Slowly.
- Okay.

898
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,510
What?

899
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,893
What the heck?

900
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,605
Hold on…

901
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,065
ALREADY A LOST CAUSE

902
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,110
I feel like it's this one.

903
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,695
Let's do this! It's this one!

904
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,447
No, it's not!

905
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,283
- Flip all of them.
- Which one is it?

906
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,617
I told you it's this one!

907
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,743
Eun-bi is good.

908
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,582
IF SI-YOUNG FINDS OUT,
HE WILL DEFINITELY GET A BEATING

909
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,874
Oh, Jun-pyo.

910
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,209
How about this lantern?

911
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,544
YIKES! PUSHING THE LIMIT

912
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,129
And then I will do this.

913
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,922
This and this.

914
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,465
- Where is it?
- Here, this one.

915
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,758
The one at the end.

916
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,927
- What?
- I told you not to do this.

917
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,929
BEST TO GIVE UP ON THE MAGICIAN

918
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,764
Jun-pyo, why are you doing this?

919
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,309
You can't live like this.
Return everything.

920
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,060
You just have to take the risk.

921
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,062
Keep betting until you hit the jackpot.

922
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,272
- The information?
- Yes.

923
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,608
Okay, we have more. Okay…

924
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:32,985
Get away! Help me!

925
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,280
Get away!

926
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,409
ONE OF THE SEVERELY INFECTED IS GOING WILD

927
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,411
- Calm down.
- What a mess.

928
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,789
I told you to take care of it properly!
If you can't, just kill it!

929
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,708
There's a kid here.

930
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,336
Did it just go wild?

931
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,754
We're scared!

932
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:52,880
IS DEX STEPPING IN?

933
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,214
Let's hurry.

934
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,424
WRONG! STEPS IN TO WIN

935
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,177
Do what you have to do. Let's go.

936
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,470
You can do it.

937
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,846
- Okay!
- Take him down!

938
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:05,392
Do you know if there's a way out of here?

939
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,560
CONTINUING TO SEARCH

940
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,979
You heard that there's no exit?

941
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,523
Do you know where the exit is?

942
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,901
I heard that there are noises over there.

943
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,654
Do you know if the subway runs here?

944
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,406
They said there's always some noise.
We heard it too.

945
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,617
Can you tell us how to get on the subway?

946
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,743
Well…

947
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,630
HANDMAKING WEAPONS AFTER BEING LOOTED

948
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,881
Everyone is exhausted.

949
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,508
You're here.

950
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,096
What's wrong?

951
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,932
What's wrong?

952
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,141
Something's up. What is it?

953
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,351
We found the subway.

954
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,895
- You found the subway?
- We found the subway.

955
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,356
- It's running.
- The subway…

956
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,692
The subway's track…

957
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,443
SOMEONE WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION

958
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,863
- It's an important information.
- Can you just share it with us?

959
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,658
SI-YOUNG'S GAZE IS TERRIFYING

960
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,576
There's a door back there.

961
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,206
If you go out of that door
and walk straight ahead,

962
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,500
something good will be waiting for you.

963
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,336
Stairs.

964
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,712
What is this?

965
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,172
It's dark in here.

966
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,924
It's dark.

967
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,593
What's that?

968
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,554
I see the tracks!

969
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,722
It's a subway track.

970
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,266
Didn't we hear it just now?

971
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,769
I hear it!

972
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,438
I hear the sound!

973
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,856
- I hear it.
- It's coming.

974
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,023
Oh, the wind!

975
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,192
Oh, the wind!

976
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,322
It's coming!

977
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,116
Seriously!

978
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,045
The subway is running!

979
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,172
It's actually here!

980
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,381
Eun-bi!

981
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,260
Are people on it?

982
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,387
We don't know.
We couldn't check the sides.

983
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,972
We aren't sure about that.

984
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,515
It moves too fast anyways.

985
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,850
How often does it come?

986
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,187
Talk softly. Everyone will hear it.

987
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,772
Shouldn't we tell this to everyone here?

988
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,400
No, that means the zombies would come too.

989
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,610
PLATFORM NOT FOUND YET

990
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,320
It's best if just only we leave.

991
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,613
- Don't tell anyone?
- Yes.

992
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,407
If we suddenly go out as a big group,

993
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,034
it might be suspicious.

994
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,911
Let's wait until it's a bit quiet.

995
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,454
I agree. We should go later.

996
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,580
Let's take a break.

997
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,916
- It'll be obvious.
- Let's eat something first.

998
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,043
I'm so hungry.

999
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,340
Thanks, DinDin.

1000
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:44,009
MILD FLAVOR? UNDERSTANDABLE
GIVEN THE SITUATION

1001
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,890
It's still delicious.

1002
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,601
We haven't had anything to eat.

1003
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,485
There's way too much fighting here.

1004
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,446
Even if they're zombies,
they stay because they're family.

1005
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,114
The others were swearing at them.

1006
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,616
Hong-chul.

1007
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:11,161
I get where Jun-ho is coming from.

1008
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,082
They said a vaccine could be made
with the antibodies and save people.

1009
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,251
How could you leave them
when there's still hope?

1010
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,629
I'd do the same in their situation.

1011
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,172
I'd definitely stay together.

1012
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,340
Definitely.

1013
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,842
I thought I'd leave them behind.

1014
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:26,885
- Your family?
- Yes.

1015
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,054
But seeing the situation here…

1016
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,603
I don't think I can.

1017
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,855
- Will you stay with them or…
- That's right.

1018
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,066
You have to stay if your family is bitten.

1019
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,359
- Exactly.
- No choice.

1020
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,194
- You have to be together.
- Get bitten?

1021
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,320
- Yes.
- Get bitten?

1022
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,365
We'd stay together.
What's the point of surviving otherwise?

1023
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,534
Even if they were family,

1024
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,870
they turned into zombies.

1025
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,539
So…

1026
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,166
doesn't that mean it's over?

1027
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,967
Will you stay till the end?

1028
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,844
How do you give up on your family?

1029
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,221
Would you abandon yours
if they were bitten?

1030
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,723
But for me,

1031
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,226
I think the people who survived
with us are more important.

1032
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,857
They were your family.

1033
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,735
Don't you need to survive,
at the very least?

1034
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,612
Isn't that what your brother wants?

1035
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,821
You need to survive.

1036
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:30,490
"Jun-ho, just go."

1037
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,998
That's not wrong too.

1038
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:43,003
Because your zombie family might be
wishing for you to at least survive.

1039
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,631
I don't think I would be able to do that.

1040
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,758
You need to think about this rationally.

1041
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:52,012
Someone should be alive
so that a vaccine could be developed,

1042
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,555
and humanity could be saved.

1043
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,098
That's the truth.

1044
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,769
If I turned into a zombie,
I'd want to be killed.

1045
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,396
Because I might become a burden.

1046
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,191
Then if you turn into one,

1047
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:05,609
can we strike you?

1048
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:07,778
We're not family, though.

1049
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,906
NOT THAT CLOSE YET

1050
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,075
If anyone tries to kill me, I'll bite.

1051
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,911
We're practically a family now.

1052
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,954
I feel sleepy after the food.

1053
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,623
Let's take a break.

1054
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,334
- Yes, a small one.
- Let's rest. I'm so tired.

1055
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,754
Should we take a nap and then leave
in two or three hours?

1056
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,547
Is it okay to take a nap?

1057
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,758
DECIDE TO TAKE A BREAK UNTIL IT GETS QUIET

1058
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:30,717
Oh, it hurts.

1059
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,344
Don't leave me behind.

1060
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,138
Now that we've found a destination

1061
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,975
and something that can help us escape,
I feel so much better!

1062
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,478
I can see the faint ray of light.

1063
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,522
How can you tell?
It might actually be darkness.

1064
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:47,693
Let's focus on getting some rest
for one or two hours and continue our way.

1065
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,945
This might be our last break.

1066
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,530
We haven't had a break in ages.

1067
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:56,118
It's been too long since we got to eat,
sleep and lie down like this.

1068
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,079
I'm tired.

1069
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,222
Are you okay?

1070
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,890
He looks worse than before.

1071
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,476
No, I can control him.

1072
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,061
Get a grip!

1073
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,690
We were one from the beginning,
and we'll be one until the end!

1074
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,424
Zombie!

1075
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,011
What the…

1076
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,054
What is it?

1077
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,347
- What?
- What's happening?

1078
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,016
Cho Jun-hyun?

1079
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,562
Isn't that the judo player?

1080
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,063
- Get up…
- What is it?

1081
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,857
Where's his brother?

1082
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,615
Oh, my!

1083
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:23,997
What's happening?

1084
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,833
He remembers the moves.

1085
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,711
How do we handle that?

1086
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,925
You'll get bitten!

1087
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,553
What are you doing? Stop him!

1088
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,305
How do we stop him?

1089
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,019
Where did he go?

1090
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,397
No!

1091
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,321
No! Don't touch my brother!

1092
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,698
Move!

1093
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,793
No, Dad!

1094
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,212
Dad!

1095
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,340
Dad.

1096
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,508
Stop there, stop!

1097
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,093
Sweetie, stay back!

1098
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,177
Leave him alone!

1099
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,388
Leave him alone! I can control him!

1100
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,056
Kill the zombie!

1101
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,933
Just kill it!

1102
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,269
Why would you kill someone
who's still alive?

1103
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,687
Just kill it!

1104
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,896
Be quiet!

1105
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:37,279
FOUR PLAYERS ARE STANDING NEAR
JUN-HYUN WHO HAS BECOME UNCONTROLLABLE

1106
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:43,285
ONE OF THEM NEEDS TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION

1107
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,079
We need to kill it!

1108
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,543
Move!

1109
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,508
Don't just stand there! Do something!

1110
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,969
- Take this.
- No, wait.

1111
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:09,603
If your family turned into zombies,
would you stay with them until the end?

1112
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,646
Or would you leave them to survive?

1113
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,690
I would never leave them.

1114
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,193
You should stay with them.

1115
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,156
How could you leave them
when there's still hope?

1116
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,450
No!

1117
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:30,540
Even if they were family,
they turned into zombies.

1118
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,167
So…

1119
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,545
doesn't that mean it's over?

1120
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,339
- Take this.
- No, wait.

1121
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,341
CHOOSES TAEYEON AFTER EAVESDROPPING

1122
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,676
Why? Why is it TAEYEON?

1123
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,219
Hey…

1124
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,308
FROM NOW ON, IT'S UP TO TAEYEON

1125
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:57,651
TAEYEON'S DILEMMA:
A ZOMBIE TO ME, FAMILY TO YOU

1126
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:03,323
Dad!

1127
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,449
Strike him!

1128
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,577
30 SECONDS TO MAKE THE DECISION

1129
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:13,625
TAEYEON, HOLDING A WOODEN STICK,
HAS TWO OPTIONS

1130
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,212
Kill it!

1131
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,923
STRIKE JUN-HYUN
AND SAVE THE INNOCENT CIVILIAN

1132
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:23,927
Dad…

1133
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,053
Don't kill him!

1134
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,930
OR GIVE THE BROTHERS A CHANCE TO SURVIVE

1135
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,099
I can't live without him.

1136
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,559
If one dies, the other follows.

1137
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,728
HER CHOICE WILL DETERMINE THEIR FATE

1138
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,188
Hurry!

1139
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,399
No!

1140
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,234
Kill him!

1141
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,902
It's the kid's dad!

1142
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,570
The kid's dad!

1143
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:49,995
Kill him! Kill him now!

1144
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,664
What if it's your family?

1145
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,874
Do you think you can kill him then?

1146
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,213
I can control him! Don't do it!

1147
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,341
- Dad!
- Don't kill him!

1148
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:08,638
Hurry and decide!

1149
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,899
Don't!

1150
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,276
No!

1151
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,569
- Don't do it!
- No!

1152
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:25,905
Hey!

1153
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,160
- Don't kill him!
- Hey!

1154
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:31,870
He…

1155
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,791
He's bleeding!

1156
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,627
Are you okay?

1157
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,379
My baby!

1158
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,299
Are you okay?

1159
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,592
No!

1160
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,605
TAEYEON…

1161
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,565
Wasn't it TAEYEON?

1162
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,692
Are you okay?

1163
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,956
He's still human!

1164
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,508
You just killed a person!

1165
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,469
No, that's not…

1166
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,554
He's not a zombie yet!

1167
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,933
You know that anyone would have done
the same in that situation.

1168
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:43,149
From now on, your wife, friend,
sibling can end up like this!

1169
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,400
No!

1170
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,487
Are you going to let them?

1171
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,240
- You killed a person!
- That's right.

1172
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,616
Murderer!

1173
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:52,992
Kill her!

1174
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,828
He was a zombie.

1175
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,664
You told her to strike him earlier!

1176
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,040
No, Jun-ho!

1177
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,625
Jun-ho, no…

1178
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,085
Stay out of this!

1179
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,462
Cho family should stay out of this!

1180
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,339
We have to kill all of them!

1181
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,550
- It was an accident!
- Kill them!

1182
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,765
Get your stuff!

1183
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,724
Grab your stuff!

1184
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,476
That's not a human!

1185
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,186
That can't be a human!

1186
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,021
Dex, let's stay out of it.

1187
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,441
- You killed someone!
- Why did you kill someone?

1188
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,775
We have no choice.

1189
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,027
You killed someone!

1190
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,988
This…

1191
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,448
You bastards!

1192
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,285
Kill all of them!

1193
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,663
Why are you doing this to us?

1194
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,665
- No!
- It was an accident!

1195
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:44,210
Why?

1196
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,546
It was an accident!

1197
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,131
Kill them!

1198
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,050
Kill them!

1199
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,385
- Kill all of them!
- Here!

1200
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,470
Over there!

1201
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,682
Kill them!

1202
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,476
Kill them now!

1203
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:04,647
Kill them!

1204
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,401
They killed a person!

1205
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,153
Close the door!

1206
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,529
- Kill them!
- Murderer!

1207
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,239
Kill all of these jerks!

1208
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,616
They killed a person!

1209
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,159
They killed a person!

1210
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,619
You murderers!

1211
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,992
