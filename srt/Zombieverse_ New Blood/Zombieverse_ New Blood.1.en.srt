1
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,851
How did it spread so fast?
It wasn't this bad before.

2
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,980
We fled to a place
that's even more dangerous.

3
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,195
Seoul is completely locked down.

4
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,239
It's collapsed.

5
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,907
It's totally wrecked.

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,161
How did we end up here?

7
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,330
What if we all die?

8
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,876
What if this leads us to hell?

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,506
You said Hong-chul died.

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,218
It's presumed that there's an individual
with a rare condition.

11
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,472
For a vaccine and a cure
to be developed quickly…

12
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,599
We need to take him.

13
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,808
To Seoul!

14
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,146
It would be great
if your blood can resolve this disaster.

15
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,648
It's ideal for creating antibodies.

16
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,984
- We can save humanity.
- You're right.

17
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,527
Wow, this looks bad.

18
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,321
Try and catch me!

19
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,614
Ro Hong-chul!

20
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,116
Why are you doing this to us?

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,910
This doesn't need to be so hard.

22
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,994
Help me!

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,913
You weaklings!

24
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,289
Hang on tight!

25
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,541
- Come on.
- The zombies are flying.

26
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,876
It's on a whole nother level.

27
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,044
It must be a mutant.

28
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,588
Seriously, someone help me.

29
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,131
Wow, it's fast!

30
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,508
It's crazy fast!

31
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,968
- Sung-jae!
- Is it too late?

32
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,929
But it died instantly.

33
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:36,846
Unbelievable.

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,973
- There's a lot of them.
- Too many.

35
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:39,974
We have to hurry…

36
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,309
Dex, get here!

37
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,186
Let's hurry before the blood clots.

38
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,437
Do you have the blood?

39
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,648
You need to save the people!
You're our only hope.

40
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,233
Traitor!

41
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,444
Do we need him alive?

42
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,613
- We're a team.
- What do you mean by "we"?

43
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,200
This person caused all of this.

44
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,744
I'm going to die.

45
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,246
That's not a human!

46
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,455
That's a zombie!

47
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,915
You killed someone.

48
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,291
You murderer!

49
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,043
Filthy bastards!

50
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:07,961
Selfish jerks!

51
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,420
I want to be free!

52
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,630
You crazy fool!

53
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,759
Not bad! This isn't bad either.

54
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,512
Don't run off.
I'll chase you to hell if I have to.

55
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,933
3 WEEKS AGO, JEJU ISLAND

56
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,435
A mysterious new virus
has emerged in Korea.

57
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,273
It's been ten days since the so-called
zombie virus first appeared.

58
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,860
As the number of infections
in the locked-down Seoul

59
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,820
and surrounding areas has increased,

60
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,365
the government is maintaining
the highest state of emergency.

61
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,533
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT

62
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,035
Hence, there's been
a sharp increase in visitors

63
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,663
to Jeju Island,
the furthest location from the breakout.

64
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,082
Due to the island's nature,

65
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,626
a breach of measures
could pose a serious threat.

66
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,254
The special task force
from Jeju Island Provincial Office

67
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,089
has set up an emergency
evacuation shelter,

68
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,507
and all incoming visitors

69
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,011
are subject to a mandatory quarantine
for three days.

70
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,266
Some are voicing significant concerns
about the current situation.

71
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,018
The Disease Control…

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,272
JEJU ISLAND
SAME-DAY DELIVERY

73
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,917
We have arrived.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,919
All right, let's get off.

75
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,712
Please get off.

76
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:37,675
A GROOM-TO-BE WITH HIS
WEDDING APPROACHING, FLED TO JEJU ALONE

77
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,596
FORCED OUT OF UDO WHILE FISHING, INITIALLY
DID NOT BELIEVE THE NEWS OF THE VIRUS

78
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,597
We've arrived.

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,851
ESCAPED TO JEJU WITH HER MANAGER BUT ENDED
UP COMING HERE ALONE ON THIS TRUCK

80
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,436
- Get off, please.
- Where are we?

81
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,938
Wow, where am I?

82
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,273
No one's bitten, right?

83
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,650
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

84
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:58,363
After you're disinfected,
you'll be quarantined for three days.

85
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,614
- Firstly--
- A quarantine.

86
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,823
- What?
- We're quarantined.

87
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,909
- For three days.
- What?

88
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:03,910
Once you're inside,

89
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,578
- the officer will brief you.
- A shelter?

90
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,122
AFTER ARRIVING IN JEJU,
ALL THREE WERE BROUGHT HERE

91
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,375
What is this?

92
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,878
"Let's run together and overcome this!"

93
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,838
This is scary.

94
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,131
This seems messed up.

95
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,759
Are we allowed in?

96
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,428
JEJU ISLAND DESIGNATED
TEMPORARY QUARANTINE FACILITY

97
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,306
This is a temporary quarantine facility
run by Jeju City.

98
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,353
Due to the crowded situation,
please follow the staff's instructions.

99
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,983
You will be quarantined
for three days in this facility.

100
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,986
If you do not show any virus symptoms,

101
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,029
you will be issued
an official entry permit.

102
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,282
If you have a fever, difficult breathing,

103
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,867
trauma or other symptoms, report yourself.

104
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,536
Any symptoms?

105
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,537
I have a toothache.

106
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,705
- A toothache?
- Yes.

107
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,623
THAT WAS UNNECESSARY

108
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,710
For everyone's safety,
please abide by the regulations.

109
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,004
Move to the disinfection tunnel.

110
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,672
DISINFECTION

111
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,881
HARMLESS TO HUMANS

112
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,134
But I didn't even get bitten.

113
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,431
Is this disinfectant?

114
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,269
This may be necessary
to ensure our safety.

115
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,357
This must be the shelter.

116
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,317
Yes.

117
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,819
- Incredible.
- It feels so real.

118
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,950
ABANDONED RESORT TURNED INTO
A QUARANTINE FACILITY

119
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,577
It's quite crowded.

120
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,245
It feels like a village.

121
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,331
There are relief supplies.

122
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,832
DONATED RELIEF SUPPLIES

123
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,379
GO KOREA! NO SURPRISE THAT
THE FACILITY IS WELL-EQUIPPED

124
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,422
Hurry and give it.

125
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,549
I said I don't need the bandage.

126
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,842
No…

127
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,801
You asked for it.

128
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,969
- What else?
- Medicine.

129
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:45,887
Cold medicine.

130
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,804
What do we have?

131
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,222
THE MOTHERS' CLUB MEALS

132
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,390
I'm hungry.

133
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,893
Do you want to smell this?

134
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,603
Oh, good?

135
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,772
Looks good.

136
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,734
DESPITE THE VIRUS OUTBREAK, HOPE REMAINS

137
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,028
I kind of like this place.

138
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:11,329
THE ADVENTURE FOR SURVIVAL STARTS HERE

139
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,039
I'm the commander here. Follow me.

140
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,207
Come over here.

141
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,793
Take whatever you need
from the relief supplies.

142
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,794
Water, hot packs…

143
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,753
EXPLORING AROUND

144
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,004
- It's all here.
- I know you.

145
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,297
- Oh, hello.
- Yes.

146
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,381
Yes, I'm the commander.

147
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,341
Nice to meet you.

148
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,510
Where do we need to go?

149
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,303
Let's just head in first.

150
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,389
Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

151
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,642
I've only seen something like this on TV.

152
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,477
Incredible.

153
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,438
- What do you need?
- A mask.

154
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,564
You'll need a lot of things.

155
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,192
This seems serious. I'm really worried.

156
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,111
Have you seen an actual zombie?

157
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,529
- Is Jeju safe?
- Yes, for now.

158
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,947
- Do you have toilets?
- Yes.

159
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,073
Do you have toilet paper?

160
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,324
Is it for free?

161
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,118
- Can I take them?
- Yes.

162
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,661
SEEMS LIKE THE WORRYING TYPE

163
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,207
That startled me.

164
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,125
Any symptoms?

165
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,209
EASILY SCARED TOO

166
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,752
I have irritable bowel syndrome.

167
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,254
Wait, hold on.

168
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,214
- Get me a bowl of warm broth.
- Broth?

169
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,882
Why is everyone asking that?

170
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,467
AN OFFICIAL CONVERSING WITH CITIZENS

171
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,219
Firstly, let's…

172
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,971
Please disinfect yourself. Name?

173
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,514
- Come over here.
- Yes?

174
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,473
Write your name.

175
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,350
- Gosh.
- Slowly.

176
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,352
- Officer.
- Slowly.

177
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:17,895
What?

178
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,232
AN OFFICIAL FROM CHUNGJU CITY IS
DISPATCHED DUE TO A STAFF SHORTAGE

179
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,316
I was dispatched.

180
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,776
Oh, were you?

181
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,861
I was technically forced.

182
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,446
OFFICIALS REMAIN COMMITTED

183
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,531
Wow, they have hot packs.

184
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,824
Thank you.

185
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,033
Oh, thank you.

186
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,285
Please head inside.

187
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,204
Okay, get ready. Great.

188
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,164
- Three to two.
- Wait.

189
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,459
- That's right.
- Is that Defconn?

190
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,461
Show me your skills, don't just talk.

191
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,713
It is him.

192
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,131
He must have arrived first.

193
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,843
Must be nice to sit around
and play table tennis.

194
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,094
Life is…

195
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,804
Was that a spin?

196
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:57,518
FLEW TO JEJU AFTER THE NEWS, ADAPTING
QUICKLY THANKS TO HIS OUTGOING PERSONALITY

197
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,229
You never know what's coming.
You need to stay fit.

198
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,481
- Defconn.
- Bro.

199
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,607
Defconn.

200
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,649
Bro.

201
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,486
- Defconn.
- You're here?

202
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,862
What brings you here?

203
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,905
Why are you here?

204
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,864
Defconn.

205
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,908
A JOYFUL SURPRISE

206
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,326
Why are you here?

207
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,619
- I'm quarantined.
- What?

208
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,870
Quarantine.

209
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,787
Why are you…

210
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,125
Why did you come all dressed up?

211
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,835
THIS ISN'T A TYPICAL SHOOT!

212
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,003
What's with the sunglasses?

213
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,963
- But my eyes hurt.
- Then keep them on.

214
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,298
Now…

215
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,716
This seems serious.

216
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,218
When did you get here?

217
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,719
A day earlier than you.

218
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,513
It's a relief to see you here.

219
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,805
Yes, it means a lot.

220
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,474
Don't worry. You're here now.

221
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,475
Is it crowded?

222
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,227
Code Kunst is inside.

223
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,770
- Code Kunst?
- He's inside.

224
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,355
- Code Kunst?
- Yes, he's here.

225
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,114
MAKING SURVIVAL TOOLS
AFTER CHECKING IN YESTERDAY

226
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,909
- Do you need help?
- Yes.

227
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,745
Since you broke your leg,
you need to be careful.

228
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,455
- Hello.
- Hello.

229
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,623
INDOOR LIVING AREA

230
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,292
Ask anyone if you have any questions.

231
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,711
Everyone is in here.

232
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,300
Code Kunst?

233
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,720
WOW! BEST FRIENDS REUNITED IN THE FACILITY

234
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,222
- You were here?
- Yes.

235
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,265
When did you arrive?

236
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,349
I got here yesterday.

237
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,226
I've already finished making this.

238
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,228
- What's that?
- A protective gear.

239
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,813
But it's meant to be safe here.

240
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,275
You never know though.
I was helping him and sharing these out.

241
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,317
Is he hurt?

242
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,403
Yes, he is. So just in case,

243
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,530
I wrapped the protective gear for him.

244
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,700
The atmosphere here isn't
as bright as outside.

245
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,368
It still feels

246
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,954
a bit early for a bright mood here.

247
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,707
Everyone here…

248
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,835
EXHAUSTED EVACUEES ARE GATHERED HERE

249
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,671
LEAVING THESE MESSAGES ARE THEIR ONLY HOPE

250
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,882
They are written by people
looking for their family…

251
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,886
She lost her husband
at their wedding photoshoot.

252
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,142
Are their family members unreachable?

253
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,437
I was here with Chang-hee,
but he's gone now.

254
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,689
SAE-HO HAS A SAD BACKGROUND TOO

255
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,899
Then write something.

256
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,068
It might help…

257
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,325
Wasn't he supposed to be the MC
at your wedding?

258
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,872
ONLY TEARS, NOT LAUGHTER, FOR THE SAD NEWS

259
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,375
Oh, my.

260
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,378
Gosh.

261
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,507
- Defconn.
- Hey, Code Kunst. So you guys met?

262
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,675
Yeah. Have a seat.

263
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,968
Make yourself at home.

264
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,305
This is quite overwhelming for me too.

265
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,057
My phone isn't working at all.

266
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,017
- None of the devices work.
- Exactly.

267
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,728
Did you make all of this
to prepare yourself?

268
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,313
I cut them out myself.

269
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,689
Is this a helmet?

270
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,776
A birthday hat.

271
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,110
DEFINITELY NOT A HELMET

272
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,236
It suits you.

273
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,280
- Looks good.
- You haven't changed a bit.

274
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,157
Since we all know each other,

275
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,867
let's make sure to support one another.

276
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,078
We should help everyone else who's here.

277
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,790
Even when the world is falling apart,
we should aim to bring joy.

278
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,625
AN ATTEMPT TO LIFT THE SPIRITS

279
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,085
If we work as one…

280
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,920
- We'll survive.
- That's right.

281
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,254
When do we get to eat?

282
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,714
I have three MREs.

283
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,966
- Three meals.
- I've never tried one.

284
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,426
I have two energy bars.

285
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,844
Wait, I had them yesterday.

286
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,305
I always keep my bag with me.
Keep yours close.

287
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,105
My bars were stolen.

288
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,106
- Seriously.
- Really?

289
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,982
I even carry it
while playing table tennis.

290
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,695
What's wrong with him?

291
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,406
Excuse me?

292
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,366
What's wrong?

293
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,330
What's going on?

294
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,249
- What?
- What?

295
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,708
What's going on?

296
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,545
What's wrong with him?

297
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,004
Excuse me, over here!

298
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:54,964
Sae-ho.

299
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,301
Sir, you shouldn't be doing this here.

300
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,553
- My bag.
- Is he drunk?

301
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,720
Geez.

302
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,639
I only had a glass of soju.

303
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,182
He's drinking again.

304
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,642
A SURPRISE WELCOME EVENT

305
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,726
That startled me.

306
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,146
It's just soju.

307
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,440
He really caught me off guard.

308
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,357
My gosh.

309
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,904
UNFLATTERING MOMENTS RIGHT FROM THE START

310
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,573
- I'm sorry.
- Bro!

311
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,074
I'm going to escape.

312
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,034
He was secretly drinking.

313
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,328
- He drank a lot.
- Seriously, that guy…

314
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,498
Hey, Sae-ho is the only one who ran off.

315
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,458
He ran off alone.

316
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,667
He went that way alone.

317
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,586
- Where is he?
- Don't forget this.

318
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,920
- Sae-ho!
- Yes?

319
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:35,838
Why did you run?

320
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,839
- Why?
- To catch him.

321
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,966
- How?
- From behind.

322
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,302
If we work as one…

323
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,304
- We'll survive.
- That's right.

324
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:48,601
INSTEAD OF STAYING TOGETHER,
HE RAN OFF ALONE

325
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,935
That scared me.

326
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,979
That was frightening.

327
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:56,275
This is the commander speaking.
Your meals are ready.

328
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,278
Your meals are prepared with care
using valuable tax funds.

329
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,240
Please maintain order
and enjoy your meal safely.

330
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,201
At least we're getting hot meals.

331
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,368
- How great.
- I agree.

332
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,453
It's a real shelter.

333
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,121
It smells delicious.

334
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,331
- I'm hungry.
- Hello.

335
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,708
Appreciate your help.

336
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,835
Isn't that DinDin?

337
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,962
DinDin? What's going on?

338
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,300
- What?
- Hey!

339
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,511
EXPERIENCED WITH ZOMBIE OUTBREAKS,
WENT THROUGH HELL

340
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,554
ALSO EXPERIENCED,
HAS UNEXPECTED SURVIVAL SKILLS

341
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,639
Tsuki, it's been a while.

342
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,598
You were here?

343
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,266
- I didn't know.
- We just arrived.

344
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,311
1 WEEK AGO, OFF THE COAST OF INCHEON

345
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,479
What a mess.

346
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,899
SURVIVED THE ZOMBIES
BUT TOOK THE WRONG BOAT

347
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,567
JEJU ISLAND
SAME-DAY DELIVERY

348
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,863
COULDN'T CROSS THE MARITIME BOUNDARY,
DRAGGED HERE UPON ARRIVAL

349
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,031
Please get off.

350
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,325
Wow, what's this?

351
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,495
They have water and food too.

352
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,955
They have everything.

353
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,250
Why do you look so beat down?

354
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,460
We just got off a deep-sea fishing boat.

355
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,003
THEY'RE FINALLY SAFE!

356
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,421
You rode the wrong boat.

357
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,257
I'm glad you're all here. It's safe here.

358
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,925
- Really?
- Yes, it's safe here.

359
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,262
- Hey, it might be safer to stay near him.
- Who?

360
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,180
Isn't he a famous chef?

361
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,723
The famous chef, right?

362
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,350
That's him.

363
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,977
- The White House Chef.
- Yes.

364
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,063
STOPPED BY JEJU FOR A SHOOT,
BUT PEOPLE FOUND OUT HE'S A CHEF

365
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,649
SO HE WAS FORCED TO DO VOLUNTEER WORK

366
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,950
Amazing.

367
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,830
You can get your meals from over there.

368
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,789
Amazing.

369
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,001
So cool!

370
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,048
Me too, wow!

371
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,925
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

372
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,303
Hey, mine is too small.

373
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,179
Thank you.

374
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,389
COMMUNICATION FAILURE

375
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,183
He gave Tsuki a bigger piece,
and I got a small one.

376
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,685
Nice body. Nice body.

377
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,062
It's so nice to meet you this time.

378
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,191
Oh, I'm sorry. It's so small.

379
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,151
Thank you.

380
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,569
- It's so small.
- Thank you.

381
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,820
- It's so small.
- Thank you.

382
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,779
Yes.

383
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,781
Can you give me one more pineapple?

384
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,241
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

385
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,618
COMMUNICATION ISN'T THE ISSUE

386
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,369
Even insects won't eat this.

387
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,370
I got a tiny piece.

388
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,039
He's a bit biased.

389
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,624
- Have a nice dinner.
- Thank you.

390
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,375
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye!

391
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,835
Hey, let's just eat first.

392
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,753
Go on and eat.

393
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,837
Thank you.

394
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,881
Just eat first, and we'll talk after.

395
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,885
I haven't eaten for four days.

396
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,011
Enjoy your meal.

397
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,847
I'll ask about their journey.

398
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,225
So, what happened?

399
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,561
Haven't you seen a zombie?

400
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,855
- No, we haven't.
- No, we've never seen one.

401
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,190
Really?

402
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,150
- We've never seen one.
- Ever?

403
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,360
They were all zombies.

404
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,986
Park Na-rae is dead.

405
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,696
- She's dead?
- Yes, she is.

406
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,989
So is Hong-chul.

407
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,407
- That's right.
- Hong-chul?

408
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,784
So is Jonathan.

409
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,702
MANY FRIENDS WERE LOST ALONG THE WAY

410
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,620
- Hee-kwan?
- Yes.

411
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,538
He turned into a zombie.

412
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,999
Are these zombies the same
as the ones we know?

413
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,542
- The scary ones?
- They bite?

414
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,294
Like the ones we see in movies.

415
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,671
- Yes.
- The ones that bite?

416
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,339
- Oh, shit.
- You're clueless.

417
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,715
We fought with them.

418
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,300
We really did.

419
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,511
- Really?
- Yes, with weapons.

420
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,680
We got rid of a lot of them.

421
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,974
YOU SHOULDN'T LIE JUST BECAUSE
THEY WERE NOT THERE

422
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,183
How fast are they?

423
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,685
There are fast ones.

424
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,686
I'm curious.

425
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,895
Some can run fast.

426
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,480
Some are slow, right?

427
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,190
If an athlete turned into one…

428
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,692
They stay the same.

429
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,860
That's why it was so fast.

430
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,363
- If a fit person turns into a zombie…
- Oh, right.

431
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,032
If that chef turns into a zombie,

432
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,325
he'll be unstoppable.

433
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,412
He'll be like those titans in video games.

434
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,496
A destroyer.

435
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,126
I want to ask if there's anything
that we should avoid doing.

436
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,503
Like running off alone?

437
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,381
Well, to be honest…

438
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,382
DUG HIS OWN GRAVE

439
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,134
Runners will always run off.

440
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,260
Just like Hong-chul.

441
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,805
- He pushed Na-rae and she died.
- DinDin.

442
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,558
As soon as we heard growls,
someone ran off alone.

443
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,934
Leave them behind.

444
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,062
Let me be honest, he's talking about me.

445
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,192
I did it.

446
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,528
I thought it was a zombie.

447
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,072
I was scared. I didn't want to get bitten.

448
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,073
HAUNT HIM FOR LIFE

449
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,285
The thing is,
it's hard to trust someone during a crisis

450
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,078
if they have betrayed you before.

451
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,330
Better talk about it when I'm not around.

452
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,874
Not when I'm here.

453
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,208
- Sae-ho.
- Yes.

454
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,501
We should part ways here.

455
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,254
Hey, it wasn't exactly betrayal.

456
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,964
Was it just survival instinct?

457
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,467
- He's engaged.
- I got scared. I'm sorry.

458
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,554
Anyway, zombies can't swim over
to the island. What's the worry?

459
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,097
Right, I think it's safe here.

460
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,558
- I don't think so.
- Why?

461
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,436
If one person turns
into a zombie here, we're doomed.

462
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,271
It's the perfect setup for chaos.

463
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,232
That'll be the end of us, seriously.

464
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,526
It takes some time
for the symptoms to show.

465
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,279
If there's an outbreak,

466
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,490
we'll be trapped
since this place is sealed.

467
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,824
IF ZOMBIES COME, IT'LL BE CHAOS

468
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,582
The thing is,
we've never seen a zombie yet.

469
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,500
That's true.

470
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,795
Sir, would you like some tangerines?

471
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,588
- No.
- Are you okay?

472
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,591
He doesn't look too well.

473
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,926
I'm scared.

474
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:14,968
That's strange.

475
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,387
You should always stay vigilant.

476
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,313
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT

477
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,580
I have no idea how long
we'll have to keep this up.

478
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,291
You know what's worse?

479
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,754
Once you're full and warmed up,
you start getting sleepy.

480
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,923
- That's true.
- I'm so sleepy.

481
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,217
ALMOST TIME FOR THEIR FIRST CHOICE

482
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,218
Oh, you scared me!

483
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,887
- Did everyone enjoy their meal?
- Yes.

484
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,932
I have an announcement to make.

485
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:07,020
Since our temporary shelter was set up
so suddenly,

486
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,106
we have windows and walls to reinforce.

487
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,316
- Splitting tasks?
- We need to cook too.

488
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,526
We have a lot to handle.

489
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:17,197
We need anyone who's fit to help us out.

490
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,157
Please step up.

491
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,956
- Anyone?
- I'm pretty fit.

492
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,915
Fit?

493
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,336
THOSE IN THEIR TWENTIES VOLUNTEER

494
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,672
WITH DINDIN
WHO IS IN HIS TWENTIES AT HEART

495
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,673
Put your hands up.

496
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,468
We should go.

497
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,179
You're pretty fit, right?

498
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,639
But I have a neck injury.

499
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,183
Come over here.

500
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,225
Then Tsuki can…

501
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,810
- Let's go together.
- But I'm…

502
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,936
- Wait, no.
- Let's go.

503
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,479
- No.
- I'll help out too.

504
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,689
- My neck…
- But she'll…

505
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,857
But she'll be alone.

506
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,359
We can't let her go alone.

507
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,612
THE CHOICE THEY JUST MADE

508
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,113
Why don't we just go?

509
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,907
HAS DETERMINED

510
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,200
Wish us luck.

511
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,367
THEIR FATE

512
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,038
Shit!

513
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,873
It's stuck onto it.

514
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,626
I can go, but I can't be much help.

515
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,044
No!

516
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,714
I can't be much help too…

517
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,341
I'm scared.

518
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,512
Please come this way. Watch your step.

519
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,430
This way?

520
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,724
Ugh, let's just get to work.

521
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,934
What needs to be done?

522
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:32,189
We need to break down
these useless boxes to make firewood.

523
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,774
Okay.

524
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,776
- Hello.
- Come this way.

525
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,735
Oh, officer.

526
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,238
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.

527
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,531
- We heard this earlier.
- Yes?

528
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,035
When humans get infected
after getting bitten by zombies…

529
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,581
What's going on?

530
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,295
They start biting others too.

531
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,089
What's happening?

532
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,344
But I'm not sure if it's okay
to share this with everyone here.

533
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,721
We'd lose control over the public

534
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,267
if they find out about this information.

535
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,476
It'll start rumors.

536
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,728
Maintaining control is important.

537
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,861
What's that?

538
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,446
Is it empty?

539
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,864
Wait, where are they?

540
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,576
What's happening?

541
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,669
Be careful.

542
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:39,047
We have manuals for various disasters.

543
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,341
But not for a zombie outbreak.

544
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,388
So basically…

545
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,601
Wow, impressive.

546
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,604
Be careful.

547
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,273
You're better than the officer.

548
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,524
That's perfect.

549
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
Is this really praiseworthy?

550
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,155
DinDin, it's your turn.

551
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,489
Sung-jae can take care of it.

552
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,116
My wrist hurts.

553
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,034
- What's that?
- What?

554
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,537
What?

555
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,707
What is it?

556
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:16,877
Shit. It's a zombie!

557
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,545
Shit. It's a zombie!

558
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,464
- Zombies!
- Block them.

559
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,174
Block them.

560
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,097
- Close it!
- Close it.

561
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,140
Close it quickly.

562
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,266
How do we stop them?

563
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,934
What do we do?

564
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:33,935
Block them!

565
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,520
Block all of them!

566
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,480
Hey!

567
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,732
- Block them.
- Darn it.

568
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,358
Block them!

569
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,526
Block them!

570
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,737
- What?
- What is this?

571
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,865
- Use your foot.
- What do we do?

572
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,408
Lock it up.

573
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,827
Lock it! The hole!

574
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,370
It won't lock, push instead!

575
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,164
- Push.
- It's not working!

576
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,583
Lock it. It touched my hand.

577
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,253
There are more of them!

578
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,214
They're coming from that way!

579
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,131
My hand.

580
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,841
They're coming. Let's go, Tsuki!

581
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,052
But how?

582
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,136
I'm scared.

583
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,101
- Tsuki!
- Run!

584
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,815
LET'S RUN TOGETHER AND OVERCOME THIS!

585
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,066
Run!

586
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,359
Hurry and run!

587
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:26,530
QUEST: ESCAPE THE FRONT YARD IN 1 MINUTE

588
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,156
It's supposed to be safe here!

589
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,618
Watch out!

590
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:45,423
Zombies are coming! Run!

591
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,470
Run!

592
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,640
I can't believe it.

593
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,392
Hey!

594
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,309
My goodness!

595
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,061
DinDin!

596
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,486
TSUKI TURNED THE WRONG WAY

597
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,571
Tsuki!

598
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,494
NEW SURVIVORS JOIN THE GROUP

599
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,480
- Here!
- Tsuki!

600
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,274
- Over here!
- Oh, hello!

601
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,192
Go that way!

602
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,234
- Over here!
- Hello!

603
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,320
- Wait? Dex!
- Hurry!

604
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,279
Dex!

605
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,406
Si-young!

606
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,325
- That way!
- Tsuki!

607
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,662
- Tsuki!
- Dex!

608
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,085
Is that everyone?

609
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,545
Come here quickly!

610
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,630
Let's go!

611
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,215
Any more? This way!

612
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,507
That's all, let's go!

613
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,675
WELCOME TO JEJU CITY

614
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,843
- Hurry!
- Be careful.

615
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,929
Come on.

616
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,351
I think it's safer to stay here for now.

617
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,310
What's that?

618
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,021
What's going on?

619
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,816
Quickly!

620
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,526
People are running this way.

621
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,237
Why are they running?

622
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,657
Officer, shouldn't we be doing something?

623
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,741
What's wrong?

624
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,368
What is that?

625
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,285
There are zombies.

626
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,205
The zombies are coming.

627
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,122
Zombies!

628
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,457
Zombies?

629
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,959
Officer, look!

630
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,043
Get down there…

631
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,753
What the…

632
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,713
What's going on?

633
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,640
What?

634
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,641
Goodness.

635
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,227
What is it?

636
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,689
What do we do?

637
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,236
Over here!

638
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,196
Hold on…

639
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,949
What are you doing?

640
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,619
Defconn.

641
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,590
Get inside.

642
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,398
PLEASE FIND MY HUBBY!
BABE, WHERE ARE YOU?

643
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,866
What do we do?

644
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,493
Gosh.

645
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,789
They are over there.

646
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,293
Everyone has turned into a zombie.

647
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,755
One bite, you're gone.

648
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:12,964
They were bitten earlier.

649
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,216
Where did they come from?

650
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,301
They ambushed us.

651
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,433
Isn't that the guy from earlier on?

652
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,601
The guy who was in pain.

653
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,980
The bride turned into a zombie.

654
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,983
Look at the blood on her.

655
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:33,985
Over there too.

656
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,278
They've changed.

657
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,405
ALL OF THE EVACUEES ARE ZOMBIES NOW

658
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,953
I see five of them.

659
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,498
Darn it.

660
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,544
How do we escape from this?

661
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,962
Haven't you seen a zombie?

662
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:53,880
No, we haven't.

663
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,215
No, we've never seen one.

664
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,383
So zombies exist?

665
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,760
EVERYONE'S FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH A ZOMBIE

666
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,721
How do we escape from here?

667
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,889
FIVE WEAK ZOMBIES

668
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,894
MUST USE ITEMS THEY HAVE
TO SUBDUE THE ZOMBIES

669
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:13,274
TUTORIAL:
SUBDUE BEGINNER LEVEL ZOMBIES AND ESCAPE

670
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,240
- He's coming.
- Hide.

671
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,325
- He's coming.
- Hide.

672
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,284
Wait.

673
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,297
He's playing table tennis.

674
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,258
Table tennis?
Oh, I played with him earlier.

675
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,096
ZOMBIES REMEMBER
SPECIFIC ACTIONS FROM THEIR PAST

676
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,522
DUE TO POOR VISION,
THEY CAN'T DETECT HIDDEN HUMANS

677
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,361
First, I'll…

678
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,156
Let's try to lure them
over there with noise.

679
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,490
ANALYZE THE ZOMBIES' TRAITS

680
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,533
Throw it far away.

681
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,911
NO REACTION

682
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,290
They don't walk towards noise.

683
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,249
This one, right?

684
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,626
Noise won't work.

685
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,424
Let's catch them with a blanket.

686
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,426
He's coming.

687
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,220
He's coming.

688
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,729
AS EXPECTED, NO REACTION TO SOUND

689
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,402
He thinks it's a dead end.

690
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,239
STUCK IN FRONT OF A TABLE

691
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,160
LIMITED VISION FROM ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

692
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,244
He can't see us here.

693
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,873
I think someone needs to hold him down
and put a blanket over him.

694
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,625
Approach from behind.

695
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,460
EVERY QUEST HAS A SOLUTION

696
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,928
Okay…

697
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,436
ZOMBIES DON'T NEED CAPES

698
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,736
WOW! IS HE SUPERZOMBIE?

699
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,987
What are they doing?

700
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,781
A cape isn't going to help.

701
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,160
HIS WARM-HEARTED GESTURES HAS MADE

702
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:33,289
THE ZOMBIE WORLD A BETTER PLACE

703
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,291
BUT ZOMBIES CAN'T FEEL WARMTH

704
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,964
It worked.

705
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,674
FIRST ATTEMPT FAILS

706
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,133
It keeps becoming a cape.

707
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,427
Let's hold it up together.

708
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,512
Hold this.

709
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,472
Let's go that way.

710
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,723
- That way.
- Just do it.

711
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:51,724
Come on.

712
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,184
NEW TARGET DETECTED

713
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,269
Let's use this.

714
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,523
This way.

715
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,858
Bro.

716
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,234
Let's catch him.

717
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,695
- That one over there.
- Code Kunst!

718
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,282
One, two, three.

719
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,432
Darn it.

720
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,559
THIS ISN'T A WAR MOVIE SET

721
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,443
WEAK ZOMBIES ARE STILL ZOMBIES

722
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,905
My neck feels better now.

723
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:47,947
Gosh.

724
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,494
HARDER TO SUBDUE ZOMBIES IN GROUPS

725
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,787
The three are together.

726
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,707
Instead of flipping over a blanket,

727
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,500
we need to tie them up.

728
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,877
We might get bitten.

729
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,379
But they keep pulling the blanket off.

730
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,966
Let's just push them in the tent.

731
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,718
- Let's do that.
- The tent?

732
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,595
Okay, I get what you mean.

733
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,888
From below?

734
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,475
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF ITEMS NEARBY,
USE THEM TO YOUR ADVANTAGE

735
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,603
CAN THIS POP-UP TENT BECOME
THE ZOMBIES' NEW SHELTER?

736
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,855
- Turn it around and put them in.
- Over them?

737
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,608
- Stay low.
- Now?

738
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,985
- Wait, no!
- It's stuck.

739
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,278
- Wait, no!
- It's stuck.

740
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,084
It's here. Wait, no!

741
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,962
It's here. Wait, no!

742
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,296
No!

743
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,507
OH, NO! AT THIS RATE, THEY'RE DOOMED

744
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,391
No!

745
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,310
BARELY ESCAPED
WHILE SOUNDING LIKE A MONKEY

746
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,361
We caught one.

747
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,408
CODE KUNST SEIZES THE OPPORTUNITY!

748
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,245
- Okay.
- We did it.

749
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,247
We did it.

750
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,332
- Okay.
- We did it.

751
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,626
We did it.

752
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,545
That one is strong.

753
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,838
Why is he so strong?

754
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,092
Back off. Run!

755
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,052
This is tough.

756
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,513
USING THE TENTS FAILED

757
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,889
What's up with them?

758
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:46,315
THEY STRUGGLE WITH NO ZOMBIE EXPERIENCE

759
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,735
Wow, they're really strong.

760
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,738
Is the alcohol making him stronger?

761
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,822
They move as a group.

762
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,948
Break them apart.

763
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,409
- But how?
- Lure them.

764
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,328
STUCK? TRY A NEW APPROACH,
DON'T REPEAT FAILURES

765
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,414
Well, should you lure them or should I?

766
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,665
I'll lure them.

767
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,584
I'm the quickest here. I'll do it.

768
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,960
TSK-TSK! DON'T STARE LIKE THAT

769
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,003
Put it on and tie it.

770
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,881
Eventually, one will be left out.

771
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,178
CODE KUNST STEPS UP!

772
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,649
- Crawl…
- Crawl on the floor.

773
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,279
AMONG THE COWARDS, HE'S THE BRAVE ONE

774
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,868
He's fearless.

775
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,705
He's fearless.

776
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,250
Go!

777
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,251
No, not yet.

778
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,338
THANKS TO CODE KUNST,
THE ZOMBIES ARE SEPARATED

779
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,882
From behind.

780
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,550
Wait.

781
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,427
Catch this one first.

782
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,057
ENOUGH WITH THE CAPES!

783
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,813
He's coming back.

784
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,523
Darn it.

785
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,946
IT'S CLEAR THAT HIS NECK IS HEALED NOW

786
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,072
Seriously.

787
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,281
It's so difficult.

788
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,449
That man.

789
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,456
That wasn't a bad attempt.

790
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,208
NO TIME FOR SELF-PRAISE!

791
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,085
Go!

792
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,796
Are you sure? Is it not heavy?

793
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,839
This would do.

794
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,923
Over there.

795
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:34,841
Is this better?

796
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,384
Isn't the thicker one better?

797
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,107
HE'S CORNERED AFTER LURING THEM

798
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,414
What's that?

799
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,208
Who is that?

800
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,505
If that chef turns into a zombie,

801
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,506
he'll be unstoppable.

802
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:16,966
A destroyer.

803
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,020
A NEW SURVIVOR JOINS THE GROUP

804
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,147
Get him!

805
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,982
LUCKY US! ANDRE ISN'T A ZOMBIE

806
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,317
Andre?

807
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,902
Get him!

808
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,113
Get him!

809
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,032
Take this.

810
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,492
Get in.

811
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:51,125
Get in. Get in and have some rest.

812
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,677
Okay!

813
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,680
Okay.

814
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,141
Okay!

815
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,354
THIS ZOMBIE IS STILL ENERGETIC!

816
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,445
We caught it.

817
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,616
Put the stockings over his head.

818
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,411
ELASTIC STOCKINGS
HOW WILL THESE STOCKINGS HELP?

819
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,707
He won't be able to bite us.

820
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,918
We did it. He can't bite us.

821
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,343
That's it!

822
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,595
Get him!

823
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,314
See you in your next life.

824
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,776
Gosh.

825
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,736
Finally, we see zombies.

826
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,864
Thanks, Andre.

827
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,076
PRACTICE QUEST COMPLETE

828
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,035
You're the best.

829
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,953
I'm okay.

830
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,831
ALL SIX SURVIVED

831
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,790
How did you get here?

832
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,500
MOVING TO A SAFE LOCATION

833
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,128
I was let out
after my three days of quarantine.

834
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,337
- Sung-jae.
- What?

835
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,922
- Hello.
- Be quiet.

836
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,881
Please! Be quiet!

837
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,096
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

838
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,973
Where are we?

839
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,683
Wait, there's water.

840
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,728
LOWER SECTION OF THE FACILITY, DEAD END

841
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,189
We need to cross over it.

842
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,275
ESCAPE THE DEAD END
AND HEAD FOR THE ESCAPE ROUTE

843
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,443
We're out of options.

844
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,819
This is the only way out.

845
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,529
So is this our only way out?

846
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,531
CROSSING THE STREAM IS THEIR ONLY OPTION

847
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,782
- Wait.
- We can't go around.

848
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,034
How do we do it?

849
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,243
This is the way out.

850
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,244
Close the door.

851
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,829
We should!

852
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:59,003
MOVING IN THE WATER IS RISKY,
NEED TO FIND A WAY ACROSS

853
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,464
Oh, my! What was that?

854
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,425
Gosh, please don't do that.

855
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,885
You get scared easily.

856
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:06,886
NOW, NOW, DON'T TEASE!

857
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,637
Wait, so, what should we do?

858
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,806
- With this?
- Any other way?

859
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,766
Hold on.

860
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,018
Can we use this?

861
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,728
EXPLORE THE AREA FOR A SOLUTION

862
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,399
Isn't this a bridge?

863
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,650
How do we use this?

864
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,195
Wait.

865
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,072
Hold on.

866
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,658
Let's use this.

867
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,951
Put it on the rocks?

868
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,203
Place it like this

869
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:37,666
and then, we can use this rope
to withstand our weight.

870
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,420
That way, we can get across easily.

871
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,421
You're right.

872
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:46,342
I'll cross first and help you guys.

873
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,553
Just pass me two more of the bamboos,
and I'll make a bridge.

874
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,722
- Use this rope.
- Is it strong enough?

875
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,641
I'll go first.

876
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,518
Wait, you're just going like that?

877
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,602
No, hold on.

878
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,398
Dex, are you okay?

879
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,192
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my!

880
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,736
THE SKILLED DRILL INSTRUCTOR
LEAVES THEM SPEECHLESS

881
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,200
HERE DEX GOES AGAIN!

882
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,201
Be careful.

883
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,413
Wow, great job.

884
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,039
We need to pass this to Dex.

885
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,083
Place it there.

886
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,084
Okay.

887
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,044
Let's do it quickly.

888
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,879
I'm scared.

889
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,715
THEY'RE CROSSING THE SAME BRIDGE,
BUT HOW THEY CROSS LOOKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT

890
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,467
- Let's be careful.
- It's cracking.

891
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,845
The bamboo cracked.

892
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,597
Be careful. Hurry!

893
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,640
Hey!

894
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,434
Tsuki, pull the rope from above.

895
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,102
The bamboo is going to snap.

896
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,437
THE BAMBOO IS WEAKENING

897
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,355
I'm holding it down.

898
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,649
It's going to snap any moment.

899
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,776
I'll hang onto the rope.

900
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:51,907
If we cross it…

901
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,117
Gosh.

902
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,996
YIKES! THE BAMBOO FINALLY SNAPPED

903
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:57,997
Wait.

904
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,373
- I can do it.
- Hang on tight.

905
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,542
My gosh.

906
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,586
- I got this.
- Hang on tight.

907
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,920
My goodness.

908
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,172
ROOKIE BARELY SURVIVED

909
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,840
- That was close.
- Okay.

910
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,633
Careful.

911
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,885
They're coming.

912
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,429
The zombies are approaching.

913
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,555
They're coming.

914
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,681
ZOMBIES IN THE WATER!

915
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,599
They're coming!

916
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,645
They're coming!

917
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,730
Watch out!

918
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,401
THIS MAN WILL OVERCOME
WHATEVER COMES HIS WAY

919
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,319
Are you okay?

920
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,741
Hurry up and go!

921
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,742
They're coming.

922
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,537
- In the water.
- They are coming.

923
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,830
They're approaching fast.

924
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,666
Tsuki and Sung-jae, come over.

925
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,712
We don't have time, just get down!

926
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,342
FORTUNATELY, THE WATER
WAS SHALLOW ON THIS END

927
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,426
Just get down.

928
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,013
Over there!

929
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,350
- Careful.
- Hurry up!

930
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,644
My shoes are wet.

931
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,853
Seriously!

932
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,149
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

933
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,984
Wait, hold up.

934
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,779
Is your hand okay?

935
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,864
Yes, I have gloves in my bag.

936
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,243
That was frightening.

937
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,620
So are you all used to this?

938
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,206
Wait, Sung-jae…

939
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,374
You crossed the line.

940
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,291
Why?

941
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,876
"Tsuki!"

942
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,004
Si-young!

943
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,089
- That way!
- Tsuki!

944
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,675
RUNS AWAY AFTER SCREAMING HER NAME

945
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:36,136
In a crisis, you discover a side
of yourself you didn't know existed.

946
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,722
You remind me of Hong-chul.

947
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,391
Please be quiet.

948
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,519
NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR CHITCHAT

949
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,312
- Dex.
- Yes.

950
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,731
There are people on the ground.

951
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,025
Is it better to leave now?

952
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,069
- What now?
- Someone's dead.

953
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,779
We have to go now.

954
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,782
THEY NEED TO CROSS
THE FRONT YARD TO ESCAPE

955
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,409
I'll lead the way.

956
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,493
Let's go.

957
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,872
There is someone there.

958
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,457
Oh, shoot.

959
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,876
STOP GETTING STARTLED

960
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,837
- Gosh.
- Careful.

961
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,255
I'm terrified.

962
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,339
What is this?

963
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,258
Why is it so quiet?

964
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,759
We need to hurry.

965
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,303
Follow my footsteps.

966
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,603
Zombies! Run!

967
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,396
Run!

968
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,315
Hurry and get here.

969
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,233
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

970
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,528
- Get out.
- Wait.

971
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,823
I'm so scared.

972
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,575
My gosh.

973
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,243
Hey!

974
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,911
Shoot!

975
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,496
Where do we go?

976
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,041
- Oh, no!
- Up there.

977
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,709
- Climb up.
- Where?

978
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,629
Come up here.

979
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,923
Si-young.

980
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,092
What? Gosh!

981
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,388
Si-young, come this way.

982
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,514
Si-young.

983
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,474
Dex.

984
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,809
Okay.

985
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,061
That's it. Hurry.

986
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:07,978
Is she up?

987
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,021
- She did.
- She's up.

988
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,649
It's okay.

989
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,609
It's going to be all right, Si-young.

990
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,569
- Oh, my.
- Is she up?

991
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,321
She's up.

992
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,990
Careful.

993
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,159
Gosh.

994
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,577
Don't touch me.

995
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,662
Geez.

996
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,833
Behind you.

997
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,085
Wait.

998
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,586
WHAT A SCAREDY-CAT

999
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,171
Be careful.

1000
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,423
What do we do?

1001
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,633
We're trapped.

1002
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,637
THE EXIT IS BLOCKED AND
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OUT

1003
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,180
- Please!
- Look.

1004
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,432
I think we will be safer up there.

1005
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,475
We're hopeless here.

1006
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,143
- There's a net over there.
- Yes.

1007
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,855
THERE'S A SAFETY NET
AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE

1008
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,903
Can we get there safely?

1009
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:58,987
If we're quick.

1010
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,323
- So are we going one by one?
- Yes.

1011
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,741
One, two, three.

1012
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,911
THE EXPERIENCED ONES
COME UP WITH A STRATEGY

1013
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,289
Goodness.

1014
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,374
He did it.

1015
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,837
SOME ZOMBIES START CHASING DINDIN

1016
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,674
I'm scared. Hurry, Si-young.

1017
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,927
Is it safe here?

1018
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,098
Hurry!

1019
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,307
It's too cramped here.

1020
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,392
Bad boy!

1021
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,560
Please don't grab me.

1022
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,270
Wait. Excuse me, Dex!

1023
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,187
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1024
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,605
I'm not your shield!

1025
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,191
VERY WORRIED ABOUT HIS FUTURE

1026
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,109
Their hands!

1027
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,652
Get your hands off me!

1028
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,570
Sung-jae!

1029
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,780
Hurry!

1030
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,285
- They're grabbing me.
- Bad boy!

1031
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,828
Don't do it.

1032
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,082
You should get down first.

1033
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,001
How about you?

1034
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,336
I'm going to jump over.

1035
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,005
ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?

1036
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,089
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1037
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,091
Great meeting you.

1038
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,843
- What?
- You're handsome.

1039
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,387
Get down first and go that way.

1040
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,108
Shoot.

1041
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,738
I can't climb. What do I do?

1042
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,615
- Oh, no.
- Start climbing.

1043
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:25,616
Are you okay?

1044
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,743
TSUKI CAN'T CLIMB UP

1045
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,412
I can't climb. What do I do?

1046
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,875
Hurry…

1047
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,343
Oh, no.

1048
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,428
Climb up.

1049
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,263
What do I do?

1050
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,775
Let me pull you up.

1051
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,320
Thank you so much.

1052
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,406
NO WAY! THE SCAREDY-CAT PULLED IT OFF

1053
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,491
Seriously…

1054
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,787
Tsuki, that was close.

1055
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,455
That was so close.

1056
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,040
- Sung-jae saved you.
- Thanks.

1057
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,458
I almost died.

1058
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,585
- You did.
- I saved her in the end.

1059
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,380
See? I step up when it really matters.

1060
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,714
HE'LL TELL THIS STORY FOREVER

1061
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,551
There are more zombies here.

1062
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,885
Below us too.

1063
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,012
THERE ARE ZOMBIES STUCK IN THE NET

1064
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,306
THEY CAN'T GO BACK DOWN NOW

1065
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,183
I see zombies here too.

1066
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,685
Seriously.

1067
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,397
Watch out! Above you.

1068
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,690
There are more up there.

1069
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,484
Gosh.

1070
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,530
We can't go back down now.

1071
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,365
That's not an option.

1072
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,533
We need to climb up.

1073
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,744
QUEST:
CLIMB THE NET AND FIND AN ESCAPE ROUTE

1074
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,497
THERE ARE TERRACES AND WINDOWS
THAT THEY CAN ACCESS

1075
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,957
Let's try climbing up.

1076
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,292
Tsuki.

1077
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,209
Climb the rope.

1078
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,502
Got it.

1079
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:04,381
FALLING MEANS INSTANT DEATH!
STAY ON THE NET AT ALL COSTS

1080
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,763
No zombies here.

1081
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,015
- Any zombies?
- None there?

1082
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,683
THIS WINDOW SEEMS TO BE SAFE

1083
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,852
There are no zombies here.

1084
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,938
I'll come over to your side.

1085
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,531
Shit.

1086
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:32,909
Be careful.

1087
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,248
- This way won't work.
- No.

1088
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,001
No, not this way!

1089
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,971
Be careful, Si-young!

1090
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,056
Watch out!

1091
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,141
Be careful, Si-young!

1092
