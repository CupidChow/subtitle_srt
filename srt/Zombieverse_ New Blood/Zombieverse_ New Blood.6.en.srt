1
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,263
ALL HONG-CHUL WANTED WAS FREEDOM

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,181
How long has it been since I had a break?

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,851
Oh, it looks like it's kiss time!

4
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,812
Kiss!

5
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,689
BUT HIS WISH DIDN'T LAST LONG

6
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,399
Wait, wasn't that DinDin?

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:27,902
Hong-chul.

8
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,822
- Stay still.
- No, no.

9
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,282
No, I'm not!

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,700
We need to use him as a shield.

11
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,452
Let's run some tests on him.

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,828
Tests?

13
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,122
Those who escort them
to the National Medical Center

14
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,623
will receive a 5 billion won…

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,584
- Five billion!
- 500 million per person.

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,880
Those bastards!

17
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,131
Ro Hong-chul!

18
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,717
We'll take him and whether
they cut him up or what not…

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,344
We'll bring justice to
those who died unfairly.

20
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,888
That way, I can die in peace.

21
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,473
But this is our five billion won.

22
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,557
It's 500 million each.

23
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,769
500 million per person?

24
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,770
Don't come any closer!

25
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,898
How long do I need to wear
these tinted glasses?

26
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,524
I want to be free!

27
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,612
- I'd choose that side over you guys.
- Okay! Leave Eun-bi!

28
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,405
What are you doing?

29
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,324
You crazy fool!

30
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,742
Please!

31
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,744
No!

32
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,253
See how it feels, you jerks!

33
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,379
Hong-chul, wait.

34
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,714
I'll just say one thing.

35
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,049
We'll meet again.

36
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,009
No, let's each go our own way.

37
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,891
Hey! Get back first!

38
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,850
Get back!

39
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,060
Get back here for now!

40
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,688
ZOMBIES FROM THE NEXT CART ARE SWARMING
IN DUE TO HONG-CHUL'S SUDDEN BETRAYAL

41
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,023
Save me!

42
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,400
Do you know how it feels?
Try becoming a zombie.

43
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,860
- Why me?
- See how it feels.

44
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,862
Down here! Get across!

45
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,489
Get back! Press them down one by one.

46
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,865
- Get down below.
- Come in!

47
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,950
- Come in!
- From below!

48
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,537
Look at how many of them are here!

49
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,873
If they break through, it's all over.

50
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,791
Be careful!

51
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,502
CRAZED HONG-CHUL
WILL KEEP SENDING IN THE ZOMBIES

52
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,884
We need to block them.

53
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,844
We need to pull back!

54
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,762
Pull back!

55
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,848
- Jump over!
- Pull back even further!

56
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,059
THEY HAVE 30 MINUTES
UNTIL THEY ARRIVE IN SEOUL

57
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,895
FEND OFF THE ZOMBIES IN THE SUBWAY
WITH NOWHERE TO ESCAPE

58
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,481
If you get closer,
I'm going to send all of them in.

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,363
QUEST TO SEOUL:
ENDURE THE ZOMBIE WAVE FOR 30 MINUTES

60
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,575
THE FIRST WAVE HAS STARTED
"ALL OF US ARE DEAD" REMAKE

61
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,076
Get in!

62
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
Get down!

63
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,412
From below!

64
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,872
Get a taste of this!

65
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,542
I'm sending 500 million won
worth of zombies your way!

66
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,544
Let's block this area beforehand.

67
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,421
Oh, no! We're all going to die!

68
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,344
Hey!

69
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,429
How is it?

70
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,722
THE FRONT LINE OF DEFENSE IS COLLAPSING

71
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,849
They're coming through! Back off!

72
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,267
No, get back!

73
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,021
This seems more like a trap for us.

74
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,900
Get over here!

75
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,485
Si-young, you're retreating?

76
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,237
Dex, why don't you come over here?

77
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,280
Geez.

78
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,282
Hey, Justin! Get over here!

79
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,203
IMPRESSIVE EFFECT OF THE WRAP BARRIER

80
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,872
Just come!

81
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,459
RETREATING TO THE NEXT CART FOR NOW

82
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,211
See? They've abandoned you just like that.

83
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,339
Look at them retreating,
trying to save themselves.

84
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,506
How sneaky of them.

85
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,217
Save me!

86
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,719
Take 500 million worth of this!

87
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,804
For each one of you!

88
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,473
Take some zombies for yourself!

89
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,436
HOLDING ON FOR NOW BUT IT LOOKS SHAKY

90
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,231
- The rear is too weak right now.
- We need to reinforce the rear!

91
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,398
Okay!

92
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,777
NEED TO SET UP
A STRONGER DEFENSE IN THE NEXT CART

93
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,946
We should've killed him.

94
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,573
Wow, this is insane.

95
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,991
Crazy!

96
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,912
THE OBSTACLES ARE WORKING EFFECTIVELY!

97
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,249
Keep adding one more line,
even to the very end.

98
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,168
- Dex, let's back off for now.
- They're coming. Let step back.

99
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,257
Let's go.

100
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,221
Hey, look!

101
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,015
The zombies are caught
in our trap and can't move.

102
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,394
THE ZOMBIES HAVE GOTTEN TANGLED
IN THE BARRIER

103
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,278
You cowards!

104
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,779
Eun-bi! Look properly!

105
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,489
No one is coming to save you!

106
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,615
Wow, he's still at it?

107
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,741
Geez, Ro Hong-chul!

108
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,536
I'm here! I'm still alive!

109
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,540
WITH THE ZOMBIES IN THE FIELD, HONG-CHUL
AND THE SURVIVORS ARE IN A STANDOFF

110
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,041
Lee Si-young!

111
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,293
It doesn't hurt for me?

112
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,420
Do you know how much it hurts?

113
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,463
Why don't you get here?

114
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,756
Dex.

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,591
Come and take her.

116
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,302
Hang on tightly!

117
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,139
I think I can catch him if I go now.

118
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,728
FEARLESS DEX SPOTS
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A RESCUE

119
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,272
Oh, what?

120
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,440
Oh, you're coming over?

121
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,818
Hey!

122
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,777
Don't come!

123
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,865
Don't get closer! I'm going to bite her!

124
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,493
- Should I bite her?
- Why are you doing this?

125
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,580
The baseball team is in the back!

126
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,168
PACKED WITH ZOMBIES WHO MISTOOK THIS
SEOUL-BOUND TRAIN FOR "TRAIN TO BUSAN"

127
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,711
Roughly, how many are there?

128
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,504
Around a hundred?

129
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,507
The baseball team is coming!

130
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,676
They're coming!

131
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,890
Get back here!

132
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,559
When I see you next time, I'll kill you!

133
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,019
Get back here!

134
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,231
CHOOSING TO RETURN AFTER THROWING
A DEATH THREAT RIGHT TO HIS FACE

135
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,736
Not bad!

136
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,404
This isn't bad either!

137
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,322
Hey!

138
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,407
A TRIPLE LAYER DEFENSE SET UP
TO PREPARE FOR THE BASEBALL TEAM ZOMBIES

139
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,117
I'll block them! Reinforce the guards!

140
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,786
DinDin!

141
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,370
Lee Si-young!

142
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,705
Where are you guys?

143
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,540
Justin, we need to fight them here.

144
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,958
Let's stall for time.

145
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:21,130
Let's go!

146
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,590
It's opened!

147
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,800
Baseball team incoming!

148
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,637
THE SECOND WAVE HAS STARTED
"TRAIN TO SEOUL BASEBALL TEAM"

149
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,473
Let's go!

150
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,226
We need to pile this up!
We need to stall for time.

151
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,565
- Get down and increase the intensity here.
- Why are there so many of them?

152
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,363
It's not going to work! What do we do?

153
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,991
DEX, DINDIN, AND JUSTIN
ARE HANDLING THE FRONT LINE

154
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,619
Go one by one!

155
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,037
DinDin, get back!

156
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,038
Go first!

157
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,039
Get behind!

158
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,999
Come over!

159
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,709
Darn! They're so strong!

160
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,839
DEFINITELY STRONGER THAN
THE STUDENT ZOMBIES FROM EARLIER!

161
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,674
Hold on.

162
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,384
Dex, you go first!

163
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,970
- Dex, you go first!
- Hey!

164
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,471
Dex, come over quickly!

165
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,473
Justin, come over from below!

166
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,101
Get here, Justin!

167
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,271
FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE
NEUTRALIZED IN JUST 30 SECONDS

168
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,981
We need to hurry!

169
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,650
SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE
IS IMMEDIATELY AT RISK

170
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,318
DinDin! Get over there!

171
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,032
Dex, get over here too!

172
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,992
Come over!

173
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,452
- Hurry!
- DinDin, come here first!

174
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,786
From below!

175
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,329
Justin, go!

176
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,499
Dex, get over from below!

177
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,294
Shoot! What's that?

178
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,545
Quick! Let's tie this up.

179
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,255
Let's tie it up quickly!

180
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,259
They're coming through!

181
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,471
They're coming!

182
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,597
Reverse!

183
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,223
THE DEFENSES ARE COLLAPSING HELPLESSLY

184
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,017
Get behind!

185
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,272
They're coming!

186
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,232
Get back!

187
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,233
Behind!

188
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,320
- Pull back for now.
- What do we do?

189
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,322
Dex, there's nothing we can do from there.

190
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,907
Get over here!

191
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,867
Get over here!

192
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,662
ALL DEFENSES INSIDE
THE CART HAVE COLLAPSED

193
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,131
Shoot!

194
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,227
It's working.

195
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,561
Oh, it worked!

196
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,562
FIVE MINUTES AGO

197
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,148
It's not about us retreating right now.

198
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,483
We need to save Eun-bi.

199
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,027
We have to go across.
There's nothing left behind us.

200
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,737
NOT A SINGLE PLACE TO HIDE
IN THE LAST CART

201
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,907
Should we wrap this area?

202
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,159
Like this?
Let's wrap it in this direction.

203
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,452
No zombies here!

204
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,453
In a U-shape.

205
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,121
- U-shape?
- From here…

206
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,665
Like this.

207
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,582
Sounds good!

208
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,209
You're going to trap them in there?

209
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,126
Yes, that's right.

210
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,920
Let's trap them and slip through the gaps.

211
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,009
THAT'S HOW CODE KUNST'S
ZOMBIE CORRAL TRAP WAS COMPLETED

212
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,388
- Hey!
- Hey!

213
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,014
- Hey!
- Get in!

214
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,225
What a chaos.

215
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,143
A festival for everyone!

216
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,230
- They're getting caught in here.
- Let's go to the end.

217
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,440
- They're caught?
- Yes!

218
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,776
There's no way that
they can break through this.

219
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,862
Eun-bi.

220
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,823
You should follow the law.

221
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,158
It's a priority seat.

222
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,411
Sit over there.

223
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,329
- Yes.
- Let's keep to the rules.

224
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,331
SENDS FRIENDS IN DANGER
BUT FOLLOWS THE RULES

225
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,001
Eun-bi, scoot over.

226
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,377
This seat is for pregnant women.

227
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,503
Okay.

228
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,754
We need to follow the rules.

229
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,758
Ah, the taste of freedom.

230
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,801
Let's get across!

231
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,136
- Now?
- Let's go and save her.

232
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,637
Let's go!

233
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,638
How do we get through?

234
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,599
MUST REACH THE OTHER SIDE
BEFORE THE TRAP FAILS

235
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,975
From above.

236
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,143
Be careful.

237
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,358
SCARIER THAN YOU THINK

238
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,873
EXACTLY! THIS METHOD IS SAFER

239
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,045
Sae-ho, help me out.

240
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,011
Let's go!

241
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,971
How are we supposed to get through this?

242
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,972
We're in big trouble.

243
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,599
Can you get up there?

244
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,309
I can, but I'm scared.

245
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,269
I'll go first, so follow me. Help her up.

246
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,482
THOSE WHO WENT AHEAD
ARE QUIETLY SETTING UP THE BARRICADE

247
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,705
OH NO! HIS CLOTHES GOT CAUGHT

248
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,627
TRADED HIS CLOTHES
FOR THE COST OF HIS LIFE

249
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,381
LOOKS HARD TO GO
THROUGH THE SHELF

250
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,508
How do we get through?

251
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,676
Defconn, put this on.

252
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,676
What?

253
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,389
Push away their faces.

254
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,307
Shoot.

255
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,309
- Defconn.
- Hey.

256
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,937
One of you, come up!

257
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,188
You can go first, TAEYEON.

258
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,190
NEXT UP, THE BIGGEST COWARD IN THE AREA

259
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,025
Just grab and pull.

260
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,739
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

261
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,662
They'll breach soon.
We must go.

262
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,955
We should head that way.

263
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,040
THE LAST TWO PEOPLE NEED TO HURRY NOW

264
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,085
Hold on. Get off me!

265
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,545
A TOUGH COWARD IS CLIMBING UP NOW

266
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,921
Shoot!

267
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,881
Don't grab me!

268
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,008
Stop!

269
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,054
We need to stall for time.

270
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,055
Hey!

271
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,311
It's okay. I got this.

272
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,064
EVERYONE WILL HAVE PASSED SAFELY
IF DEX MAKES IT THROUGH

273
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,865
DEX, WHO WAS DISTRACTING THEM,
HAS DISAPPEARED

274
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,417
Hold on until Dex makes it over!

275
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,421
Is Dex here?

276
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,714
- Let's go!
- Go!

277
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,632
We have to go!

278
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,885
Let's go!

279
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,721
Sung-jae! Get here!

280
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,556
They're coming.

281
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,682
Get over.

282
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,892
- Get over.
- Go!

283
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,727
Darn!

284
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,936
Go!

285
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,605
The zombies are tied up here!

286
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,772
Go first!

287
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,940
We have to run!

288
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,692
What's happening?

289
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,863
- What are you doing?
- Run!

290
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,032
Hey!

291
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,576
Don't come here!

292
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,994
Why are you doing this?

293
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,287
You!

294
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,580
Ro Hong-Chul!

295
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,415
Don't come!

296
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,585
- Save me!
- Don't come!

297
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,295
Save me!

298
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,213
Don't come closer!

299
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:20,925
Hold up!

300
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:21,967
Hey!

301
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,093
We get it!

302
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,136
Okay! Don't do it.

303
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,387
Go away!

304
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,472
Don't come!

305
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,224
What's this? There's someone here!

306
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,141
People at the back.

307
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,644
GROUP OF SURVIVORS
AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TRAIN

308
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,103
What? Aren't they the uninfected?

309
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,481
Why are they here?

310
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,652
Don't come closer!

311
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,694
Hold on.

312
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,404
Sir!

313
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,822
Sir!

314
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,616
They're exposed!

315
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,119
They're exposed to the zombies!
Please open the door!

316
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,204
No!

317
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,748
- Don't listen to him!
- Don't listen! We're normal people!

318
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,708
Don't you dare open the door!

319
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,835
We are not bitten!

320
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,337
They're exposed to the zombies!

321
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,964
Wait, are they human or zombies?

322
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,341
- We can't tell them that he's a zombie.
- I know.

323
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:08,180
QUEST: IS HONG-CHUL HUMAN OR A ZOMBIE?
ANSWER WITHIN TEN SECONDS

324
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,558
Stay still. Relax.

325
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,685
IF THEY SAY 'HUMAN'

326
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,979
ONLY HONG-CHUL
WILL MAKE IT TO THE SAFE ZONE

327
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,608
IF THEY SAY 'ZOMBIE'

328
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,820
THE FACT THAT HE'S WORTH
FIVE BILLION WON WILL BE EXPOSED

329
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,613
Are they human or zombies?

330
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,073
ANSWER QUICKLY BEFORE THE EVACUEES PANIC

331
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,993
- Should I open the door?
- No!

332
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,663
Please, open the door!

333
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,629
QUEST FAILED

334
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,172
I'll go in first.

335
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,424
I'll go in alone.

336
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,675
Darn!

337
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,387
What's happening?

338
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,682
What's going on?

339
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,437
- What's happening?
- No!

340
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,646
Eun-bi! Stay back!

341
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,275
Why are you hitting him?

342
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,819
WITH NO RESPONSE,
A PANICKED EVACUEE STRUCK HONG-CHUL

343
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,322
Look at his eye! He's a zombie!

344
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,615
Hong-chul.

345
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,283
Hong-chul!

346
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,035
- He's bleeding!
- Hong-Chul!

347
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,202
- What?
- He's bleeding!

348
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,370
Is he dead?

349
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,128
Hong-chul…

350
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,755
Are you okay?

351
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,048
He's the one who said so.

352
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,758
I didn't say that.

353
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,304
Hong-chul, are you okay?

354
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,221
I can't see.

355
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,222
You can't see?

356
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,518
When I see you next, I'll kill you!

357
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,563
We should've just taken him down
when Defconn suggested it.

358
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,024
I told you we should've killed him.

359
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,611
Hong-chul!

360
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,030
Wake up!

361
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,491
ESCORT MISSION
HONG-CHUL IS DEAD

362
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,537
FAILED THE OPERATION
TO ESCORT RO HONG-CHUL

363
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,292
This train will arrive in Seoul shortly.

364
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,419
Please prepare in advance.

365
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,839
We'll arrive in Seoul in a few minutes.

366
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,716
Please prepare in advance.

367
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,359
ARRIVED AT A STATION
WHERE NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER IS LOCATED

368
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,448
Should we put him down here first?

369
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,950
Watch his head.

370
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,169
But he died out of nowhere.

371
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,505
It's a bit anticlimactic, isn't it?

372
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,049
We made it to Seoul.

373
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,176
But it's meaningless now.

374
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,636
This is messed up.

375
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,806
If he hadn't acted out like that,
we would have survived together.

376
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,643
It's disheartening.

377
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,521
Looking at him like this
makes me think about a lot of things.

378
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,317
We were all compatible with Hong-chul.

379
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,610
He truly was a great guy.

380
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,279
How can this happen to him?

381
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,448
I had a lot to thank him for.

382
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,784
After all, he helped and saved me.

383
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,705
Farewell.

384
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,458
By the way,

385
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,836
when I was with him,
he was talking about himself.

386
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,296
I felt sorry for him.

387
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,714
- What did he say?
- Why?

388
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,758
He said he wanted to find freedom.

389
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,719
Eun-bi.

390
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,346
I don't want much.

391
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,515
I don't want to hurt anyone.

392
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,392
Nor do I want anyone to hurt me.

393
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,645
I want to be free on my own,
whether I become a zombie or stay human.

394
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,733
Once this train stops,
I don't want to belong anywhere.

395
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,152
Let's all go our separate ways.

396
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,864
I don't know how it ended up like this.

397
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,997
I feel sorry for him.

398
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,836
But honestly, it's a shame that
he lived a life that wasn't impressive.

399
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,090
THE MEMORIAL SERVICE
WAS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED

400
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,801
The ending was so pathetic.

401
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,013
What is this? He died so miserably.

402
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,309
Not bad! This isn't bad either!

403
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:26,063
HE WAS PRETTY DISGRACEFUL
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE END

404
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,232
That was a bad ending for him.

405
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,525
The way you end is so important.

406
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,151
His end was so tragic.

407
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,907
Wait, he's still twitching.

408
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,951
Could he still be alive?

409
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,953
No…

410
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,043
What the heck is this?

411
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,046
I think he might still be alive.

412
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,756
CAN'T TELL IF THEY'RE LAUGHING OR CRYING

413
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,717
Wait a second, he's swelling up.

414
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,345
You need to stab it
with something really sharp.

415
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,139
- To let some air out?
- Yes.

416
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,307
Sae-ho, stop it.

417
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,059
You need to stab it with something sharp.

418
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,937
Just stop.

419
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,564
Okay.

420
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,523
All right.

421
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,941
What is this?

422
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,110
Everyone is criticizing you.

423
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,737
No one's saying
anything good about you.

424
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,911
Si-young, how could you slap
a corpse like that?

425
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,122
You did hit him a bit too much.

426
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,123
Are you okay? Get up!

427
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,000
SHOWING HER AFFECTION EVEN UNTIL THE END

428
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,172
What do we do now?

429
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,674
But he might still hold some value, right?

430
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,676
Let's try calling them.

431
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,344
Should we? Is there a phone?

432
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,848
THERE MUST BE A PAYPHONE
IN THE SUBWAY

433
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,308
There is a payphone…

434
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,309
Does it work though?

435
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,477
I have coins.

436
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,189
I'll find a payphone
and call the National Medical Center.

437
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,648
How do you have coins?

438
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,150
From the claw machine.

439
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,111
PICKED TO MAKE THE CALL
FOR HOLDING ONTO THOSE COINS

440
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,112
Payphone!

441
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,822
Here it is!

442
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,160
VIRUS CARRIERS, RARE SYMPTOMS
REPORT TO NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

443
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,544
Hello?
Is this the National Medical Center?

444
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,504
Hi, a person with
a rare condition is dead.

445
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,048
What should I do?

446
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,344
- That looks perverted.
- It actually suits him well.

447
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,181
If only he hadn't gone off on his own,
we'd be safe by now.

448
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,975
Honestly, we're being
pretty polite about this.

449
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,727
Okay, I understand.

450
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,521
I need to collect a blood sample?

451
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,192
Yes.

452
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,570
Don't they usually extract
the eyeballs or something?

453
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,155
- Yes.
- If they do that…

454
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,241
Should we at least pluck out some hair?

455
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,242
Poor Hong-chul.

456
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,118
Hey!

457
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,662
I talked to them!

458
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,579
You did?

459
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:52,876
Firstly, since he's a half-zombie,
he's different from ordinary people.

460
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,753
- His blood clotting is delayed.
- Really?

461
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,964
They want us to draw some blood
and bring it to them.

462
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,715
- His blood?
- Yes, his blood.

463
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,550
Where did you get that?

464
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,094
When I was on the call…

465
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:06,014
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES ARE PLACED AT
ALL SUBWAY STATIONS IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

466
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,517
Oh, it's here!

467
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,977
- It's there, right?
- Yes.

468
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,939
He's getting cold. We have to be quick.

469
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,691
They told us to bring it quickly.

470
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,318
The needle's in.

471
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,155
There's blood!

472
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,659
The color of his blood
is different to ours. It's so pink!

473
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,702
It's pink?

474
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,370
Why is it pink?

475
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:34,793
THE BLOOD OF AN INFECTED PERSON
WITH SPECIAL ANTIBODIES HAS A PINKISH HUE

476
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,382
This feels a bit weird, doesn't it?

477
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,053
Let's do one more just in case.

478
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,017
- This should be enough.
- I'll take out a bit more after you.

479
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,146
Why are we all taking turns to do this?

480
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,689
Hey, this doesn't seem right.

481
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,566
Dividing this up like it's money or what.

482
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,193
No, we should be holding
onto several of these, just in case.

483
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,403
If we keep several of them,

484
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,197
we can still submit it
in case something happens to any of us.

485
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,449
I want to try stabbing…

486
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,159
Hong-chul stabbed us multiple times too.

487
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,411
Yes, let's put them in here.

488
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,455
It should be fine
if we just stick it in here.

489
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,081
How many do we have in total?

490
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,541
About five or four?

491
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,043
FIVE SPECIAL ANTIBODIES
'NEW BLOOD' ACQUIRED

492
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,128
Thanks, Hong-chul. It's all thanks to you.

493
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,049
- Do we just leave like this?
- Yes.

494
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,467
We have to hurry now.

495
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,094
- Let's go then.
- Let's go.

496
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,304
We have everything, right?

497
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,932
- Poor him.
- Hong-chul.

498
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,517
We're leaving.

499
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,269
I feel uneasy.

500
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,729
Hong-chul, we're going.

501
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,106
Let's hurry. We won't be able
to leave if we keep looking.

502
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,441
Bye, Hong-chul.

503
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,276
We'll be back.

504
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,819
We have a long way to go.

505
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,907
Let's hurry before the blood clots.

506
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,242
You have the blood, right?

507
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:54,623
NEW MAIN QUEST: BRING 'NEW BLOOD'
TO THE NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

508
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,707
I see it!

509
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,084
I see something!

510
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,376
We're outside!

511
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,424
It's blinding!

512
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,510
Wow, it's blinding!

513
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,973
It's been so long
since I've seen sunlight.

514
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,435
Isn't this Cheonggyecheon?

515
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,686
It is Cheonggyecheon.

516
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,273
We're right in the middle of Seoul.

517
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,150
CHEONGGYECHEON,
JUNG-GU, SEOUL

518
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,486
We have to head to
the National Medical Center now.

519
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,488
That's close to Cheonggyecheon.

520
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,324
ACCORDING TO CHUNGJU MAN,
THE NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER IS NEARBY

521
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,202
It should be this way. Let's go.

522
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,538
I thought Seoul was in chaos.

523
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,414
It seems better than I expected.

524
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,505
- Here…
- Wait, Sae-ho!

525
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,589
Oh, my!

526
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,591
It's a zombie!

527
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,634
- Is it?
- It's a zombie.

528
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,386
- Where?
- Let's just go.

529
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,472
A FEW ZOMBIES ARE NO BIG DEAL ANYMORE

530
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,057
Be careful, Code Kunst.

531
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,058
Hush!

532
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,186
We should be fine
as long as we don't provoke them.

533
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,604
Sae-ho.

534
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,859
Do you want to go with me?

535
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,569
What?

536
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,154
Do you want to go with me?

537
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,613
What?

538
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,991
- What are you doing?
- What?

539
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,910
- What's wrong?
- What?

540
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,495
What's happening?

541
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,705
Why are you doing this?

542
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,498
- Hey!
- That crazy bastard!

543
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,541
- What's he doing?
- Hey!

544
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,458
- No!
- What!

545
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,752
- Justin!
- Why did you take it away?

546
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,172
- Hey!
- Justin!

547
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,381
What the hell is he doing?

548
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,967
Are you being serious?

549
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,846
Stop joking around!

550
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,644
We're letting it go this easily?

551
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,689
JUSTIN EARNED EVERYONE'S TRUST
AFTER PLAYING AN ACTIVE ROLE

552
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,482
I don't need the money.

553
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,525
With this…

554
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,862
THOSE WHO SAY THEY AREN'T INTERESTED
IN MONEY ARE USUALLY THE OBSESSED

555
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,071
Hey, bring it back!

556
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,740
He's so fast! Seriously!

557
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,075
Hey, Justin! Catch that jerk!

558
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,911
Hey!

559
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,954
He's too fast!

560
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,749
Hurry and catch him!

561
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,666
Get him!

562
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,792
Where is he going?

563
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,170
Where are we?

564
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,256
Where did they go?

565
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,008
- Where are they?
- Did they go in?

566
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,260
Where are we?

567
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,970
ARRIVED AT A BUILDING
AFTER CHASING JUSTIN

568
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,722
There's a place like this in Namsan?

569
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,395
Did this punk know where he was going to?

570
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,522
It feels way too deliberate.

571
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:25,941
Let's go in first.

572
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,153
What?

573
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,450
I hear music from that direction.

574
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,202
This way.

575
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,997
This place is huge.
I have no idea where they went.

576
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,876
Catch him!

577
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,294
JUSTIN AND THE CHASING TEAM
ON THE 1ST FLOOR

578
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,381
THE REST HEAD TO THE 2ND FLOOR

579
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,342
- I can hear music from here.
- I guess we can escape this way.

580
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,150
We have to catch him!

581
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,068
Where are we?

582
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,362
Hey, Justin!

583
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,447
- What is this?
- What's this, a gym?

584
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,825
You got here quicker than I expected.

585
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,661
- What?
- A sports day going on here?

586
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,289
CHASED JUSTIN AND ARRIVED AT A GYM

587
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,000
THE PLACE IS FILLED WITH VARIOUS
GYMNASTIC TRAINING EQUIPMENT

588
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,169
Justin!

589
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,671
He's so weird!

590
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,755
What does he want?

591
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,425
Taking that with you is meaningless!

592
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,843
Let's just talk.

593
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,136
- Justin, hold on!
- Why?

594
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,972
You can't suddenly
start competing with us.

595
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,974
I was always looking out for you.

596
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:44,853
To be honest, I really like you, but…

597
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,981
I have a bigger brother.

598
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,649
- What?
- A bigger brother?

599
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,526
A brother who's way more important.

600
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,528
Someone is backing him up.

601
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,113
You were a spy, Justin?

602
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,367
What's this?

603
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:00,994
What sound…

604
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,622
They're zombies.

605
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:24,100
THE ZOMBIES WERE PLAYING THE MUSIC
THAT WAS HEARD FROM OUTSIDE

606
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,727
There's an audience.

607
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,157
They've put something
on the zombies so that they can't bite.

608
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,409
You can control them
since they can't bite.

609
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,540
That's not it!

610
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,626
No!

611
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,087
Is this the best you can do?

612
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,797
What's wrong? Seriously?

613
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,590
Let's do better.

614
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,258
Let's go out.

615
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,427
- There's someone there!
- Sae-ho, let's go out.

616
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,806
Right? Try to bring out the emotions.

617
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,140
Try it.

618
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,141
That's right.

619
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,769
Now, more!

620
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,354
Bring it out of you!

621
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,647
What kind of act is this?

622
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,315
- He's a psychopath.
- Yes.

623
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,109
This is bizarre.

624
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,903
You guys bring it out too.

625
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,531
Oh, it's Hyun-joon!

626
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,784
- Hey! Shin Hyun-joon?
- It's Hyun-joon!

627
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,327
- Shin Hyun-joon.
- Oh, my!

628
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,788
Good!

629
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:31,126
It's good!

630
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,544
Hyun-joon!

631
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,379
Hyun-joon!

632
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,089
That's right!

633
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,048
Hyun-joon!

634
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,967
- Hyun-joon!
- Hyun-joon!

635
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,388
It's me, Si-young.

636
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,681
Lee Si-young.

637
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,890
- Oh, Si-young!
- Yes.

638
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,767
- It's Sae-ho!
- Oh, Sae-ho!

639
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,477
What brings you here?

640
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,187
- Hyun-joon.
- What are you doing here?

641
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,647
Are you okay?

642
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,399
- Why? Do I not look okay?
- No!

643
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,276
Why are you here?

644
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,652
I'm playing music.

645
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,071
- What kind of music is this?
- With the zombies…

646
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,700
No, I play music as a hobby. I like music.

647
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,287
HE'S DEFINITELY SOMEONE THEY KNOW,
BUT HE'S TALKING NONSENSE

648
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,581
You're Hyun-joon, right?

649
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,498
That's right.

650
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,499
I don't think so.

651
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,334
No, that's Hyun-joon's nose for sure.

652
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,962
NOSE IS AS GOOD AS AN ID

653
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,883
It's dark. Who's that?

654
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,009
It's DinDin.

655
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,427
- Hey, DinDin.
- Hello.

656
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,636
We've met before.

657
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,721
That's right.

658
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,805
Who's your boss again?

659
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,015
I have a new boss now.

660
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,475
Who's that?

661
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,851
It's Lee Jong-hyun…

662
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,269
Your boss changed?

663
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,104
THERE'S NO NEED TO MENTION THAT

664
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,731
Who's that?

665
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,816
- TAEYEON from Girls' Generation.
- TAEYEON?

666
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,193
You're a good dancer.

667
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,611
Actually, I'm more of a singer.

668
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,529
I'll start again. You're a good singer.

669
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,240
- A little.
- She's good at dancing and singing.

670
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,160
You dressed really well at the airport.

671
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,495
Sorry?

672
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,413
Nice to see you.
You dress better than Sae-ho.

673
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,290
Come down.
Si-young, it's nice to see you.

674
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,501
Yes, how have you been?

675
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,711
We worked together for ten years!

676
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,379
Si-young, get down. Let's talk.

677
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,507
Do we have to?

678
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,550
Who are these people?

679
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,844
- They're wearing something.
- Aren't they zombies?

680
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,096
If you're scared, you can leave.

681
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,515
Why can't you trust me?

682
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,559
But shouldn't we be looking for Justin?

683
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,269
Should we ask him about it?

684
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,313
Let's just go. They're all tied up anyway.

685
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,232
It must be safe. They're all tied up.

686
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,192
Come on! Why not?

687
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,527
- We'll go down.
- Come over.

688
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,570
- Hurry and come over.
- Okay.

689
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,572
He seems a little weird.

690
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,282
He seems a little sensitive.

691
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,205
Wow, in that case…

692
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,583
Sae-ho, Si-young. We've got an actress.

693
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,669
And a singer.

694
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,048
Should we step back a little?

695
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,341
Let's not get too close.

696
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,009
- Yes, let's slow down.
- I'm scared.

697
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,679
Come on. What's wrong?

698
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,515
Do you not realize
everything's going crazy right now?

699
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,016
What's going crazy?

700
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,643
The world is in a complete mess.

701
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,103
Did you eat?

702
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,646
KOREANS STILL HAVE TO EAT,
EVEN IN A ZOMBIE OUTBREAK

703
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,939
We're fine, right?

704
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,023
Of course.

705
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,402
- I'm TAEYEON.
- I love your hair color.

706
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,403
It's just black.

707
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,738
- It's just natural black…
- Come over to the light.

708
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,740
We don't understand what's going on here.

709
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,784
- What don't you understand?
- This situation.

710
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,910
These zombies…

711
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,625
They have numbers written on them,
like Z and something.

712
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,003
Should I introduce them to you?

713
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:20,920
Yes.

714
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,922
These are all incredible people.

715
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,591
We've got a doctor.

716
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,801
- Oh, that's true.
- Yes, he's a doctor.

717
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,971
We also have cheerleaders.
And soldiers too.

718
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,188
DinDin, let's attack him
and grab his arms from behind.

719
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,482
Let's try to search him,
what do you think?

720
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,984
- A body search?
- Yes.

721
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,069
Si-young. Hey, Si-young.

722
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,907
You haven't changed a bit.

723
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,867
Why are you touching me? What's going on?

724
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,161
DOING A BODY SEARCH
SINCE HE'S SUSPICIOUS

725
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,787
Hyun-joon, we're sorry.

726
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,372
Stop it! What are you doing?

727
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,790
Hyun-joon, we're just…

728
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,168
It's a real emergency,
please be understanding.

729
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:02,921
What's going on?

730
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:03,922
What's going on?

731
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,214
I just wanted to check…

732
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,467
She's always liked my teeth.

733
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,927
Me? Wait a minute…

734
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,053
You did it on purpose.

735
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,679
Crazy… He's mad crazy.

736
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,306
It's not him.

737
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,767
- I don't think it's him.
- He's not the Hyun-joon we know.

738
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,185
DEFINITELY NOT IN HIS RIGHT MIND

739
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,771
This guy seems like a real psychopath.

740
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,314
I think something happened to him.

741
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,815
Oh, geez! Goodness!

742
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,942
With the conductor…

743
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,070
Even if we go up…

744
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,780
THE COMEDIAN IS CURIOUS
ABOUT THE ORCHESTRA

745
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,114
He's not scared at all.

746
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,241
They're tied up.

747
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,369
- Where are you going?
- Be careful.

748
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,539
What are you doing?

749
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,583
It's not funny at all.

750
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,794
THEY START PLAYING MUSIC
WHEN YOU HIT THEIR THIGH

751
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,462
TAEYEON, try it.

752
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,755
You should give it a go.

753
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,134
THEY'RE NOT XYLOPHONES

754
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,014
THE MECHANISM BEHIND THE ZOMBIE ORCHESTRA
HAS BEEN REVEALED

755
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,195
I guess zombies laugh too.

756
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:19,247
BRIEFLY, THE ZOMBIE PLAYS JOYFULLY
AS IF SHE WAS ALIVE AGAIN

757
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,415
I'm sorry.

758
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,127
Let's go find Justin.

759
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,212
We don't have much time. We need to hurry.

760
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,464
Hyun-joon, please help us out.

761
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,382
Hyun-joon.

762
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,009
Do you know Justin?

763
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:31,926
The foreigner.

764
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,720
- Justin? Foreigner?
- Foreigner?

765
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,179
He's tall with a good physique.

766
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,389
I know Justin.

767
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,016
Oh, you know him?

768
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,892
He stole something from us!

769
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,769
Can you take us if you know where he is?

770
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,146
Please tell us!

771
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,277
Who could be his big boss?

772
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,822
Wow, look at this body!

773
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,909
ONCE TRUSTWORTHY,
NOW TERRIFYING

774
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,203
He's got a great physique.
He's not an average person.

775
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,330
He's like an agent.

776
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,125
We are so close to the medical center,
but what are you doing now?

777
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,210
What's this?

778
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,837
Hey! Don't touch that!

779
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,256
Hey! Don't touch that!

780
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,674
What's wrong with him?

781
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,719
TREATING HUMANITY'S HOPE LIKE A TOY

782
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,180
- What's wrong with him?
- Is he crazy?

783
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,350
Hey! Justin!

784
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,977
Why is he doing this?

785
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,729
Shoot!

786
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,230
Hold on.

787
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,108
What's happening?

788
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,694
THE FATE OF HUMANITY RESTS IN THEIR HANDS

789
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:35,031
I'm going to take a nap
since you're taking so long.

790
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,365
Why is he so laid back?

791
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,993
It's like he has someone to rely on.
Something is off about him.

792
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,661
There must be a reason he's up there.

793
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,246
We should stick to staying up there.

794
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,247
That's right.

795
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,584
We're in trouble if we fall.

796
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,921
It could be dangerous if we fall,
so we should stay up here.

797
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,340
THE NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR

798
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,509
RECOVER THE BLOOD
BEFORE IT STARTS CLOTTING

799
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:01,015
QUEST HUMANITY'S HOPE:
OPERATION NEW BLOOD RETRIEVAL

800
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,351
Justin!

801
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,603
It's not too late now, so just come here.

802
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,646
- Justin.
- Yes.

803
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,107
How about we negotiate peacefully?

804
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,278
Wow, he just walks across like that?

805
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:18,157
HE MAY BE A TRAITOR,
BUT HIS PHYSICAL ABILITIES ARE IMPRESSIVE

806
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,034
We have to retrieve it no matter what.

807
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,244
It's so important.

808
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,250
Justin, I'm going this way!

809
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,584
Okay, come.

810
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,885
CAUTIOUSLY CLOSING IN THE PERIMETER

811
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,226
What was that?

812
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,522
- What?
- What was that?

813
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,315
He fell in. Can't we just get him now?

814
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,197
Hey!

815
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,616
- Oh, what?
- No.

816
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,287
THE IMPACT ON THE FLOOR
CAUSES HIDDEN ZOMBIES TO RISE

817
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,038
What's going on?

818
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,331
Shoot!

819
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,249
No!

820
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,168
I knew something like this would happen.

821
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,796
FALLEN RIGHT INTO THE TRAP
JUSTIN SET UP

822
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,506
How do we catch him now?

823
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,136
Defconn, you're in danger.

824
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,263
I'm okay! They can't come up.

825
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,306
Stay there.

826
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,559
TOO DIFFICULT FOR THE ZOMBIES
TO CLIMB UP THE HIGH EQUIPMENTS

827
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,103
What's happening?

828
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,938
- What?
- What's happening?

829
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,398
What's happening?

830
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,110
What's happening?

831
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,696
TA-DA! PARKOUR ZOMBIE HAS APPEARED

832
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,072
The zombie can jump!

833
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:40,990
Hey!

834
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:41,908
The zombie!

835
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,410
NOW, THE HIGH PLACES ARE DANGEROUS TOO

836
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,039
- Justin, give it to me!
- Justin, get here!

837
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:48,956
Get here!

838
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,797
DEX IS CLIMBING UP ROPES ONCE AGAIN

839
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,800
There's another zombie here!

840
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,012
Avoid it and get here first!

841
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,224
EVERYONE PULLS BACK FOR A REGROUP

842
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,391
How do they jump like that?

843
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,559
The zombies are flying.

844
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,275
What's going on?

845
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,321
These zombies are like acrobats.
Like flying squirrels.

846
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,824
Justin, give it to me!

847
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,162
Really? Catch it then.

848
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,542
Should we have some fun?

849
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,545
Come here.

850
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,465
Catch him!

851
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,968
Catch him!

852
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:43,678
- Shoot!
- Darn!

853
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,971
SHOWING OFF HIS STRENGTH
TO A 47-YEAR-OLD

854
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,389
He's teasing me.

855
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,809
Why aren't you catching me?

856
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:05,992
Catch him!

857
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,703
Catch him!

858
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,206
Darn it.

859
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,503
THAT WAS A GREAT JUMP
BUT MISSED IT BY A HAIR

860
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,758
Dex!

861
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,926
Sung-jae!

862
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,469
Is there a way to corner him?

863
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,762
Corner Justin!

864
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,931
Corner him!

865
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,436
Sung-jae, get in!

866
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,437
Get in!

867
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,814
Sung-jae, corner Justin!

868
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,899
DEX AND SUNG-JAE TEAMING UP
FOR THEIR FIRST JOINT MISSION

869
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,654
Shoot!

870
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,240
Shoot!

871
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,621
Hold on!

872
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,083
Hey! Give it to me!

873
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,631
I got it!

874
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,883
Make him let go of it!

875
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,634
- Let go!
- Catch him!

876
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,845
Justin!

877
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,556
Take it away!

878
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,604
- Nice!
- Dex!

879
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,397
Hey, Dex!

880
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,775
- Nice!
- Dex!

881
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,151
Wait, we need to help Dex out!

882
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,528
Hey!

883
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,365
Hey, Dex!

884
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,949
Watch out!

885
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,289
CLAP CLAP! THE FIRST JOINT MISSION
AS BUDDIES IS A SUCCESS

886
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,668
- Is it in there?
- It's not in here!

887
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,045
- It's not?
- It's not in here!

888
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,130
- It's gone.
- Shoot!

889
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,715
Hey, Justin!

890
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,008
Are you looking for this?

891
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,513
SNEAKILY SNATCHED
THE GOODS BEFORE LOSING THE BAG

892
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,847
- Nothing left?
- It's all gone.

893
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:52,848
Really?

894
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,061
What do you want?

895
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,604
- Should I give it back?
- Yes!

896
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,605
Should I?

897
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,316
- You can't throw that!
- Don't throw it!

898
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,859
- Don't throw it!
- Okay.

899
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,028
Hey, zombies!

900
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,655
Zombies!

901
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,912
Darn!

902
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,997
What? He threw it in there!

903
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,833
Why did you throw that?

904
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,584
I've got one more!

905
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,088
Find it!

906
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,177
- Where are we going?
- Come here.

907
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,762
MEANWHILE, IN THE LOBBY

908
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,056
Why are you all on edge?

909
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,558
Let me just ask you a question.

910
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,892
How do you know Justin?

911
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,686
I know him. The big guy, right?

912
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,645
That's right!

913
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,480
We have to find him.

914
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,068
- Come in.
- Do you know where we are? You go first.

915
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,903
- Why are you…
- Why?

916
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:54,410
ENTERING THE CIRCULAR STRUCTURE
THAT THEY PASSED BY IN THE LOBBY

917
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,911
What's in there?

918
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,956
Are you guys suspicious of me?

919
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,499
- Let's go in together.
- Go.

920
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,750
You're coming with us.

921
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,044
- It's four against one anyway.
- Let's follow.

922
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:07,965
Slow down.

923
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,884
- It's scary in here.
- Go ahead first.

924
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,180
There's another door here.

925
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,139
What?

926
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,849
Follow me. Seriously.

927
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,017
- What's this?
- Follow me.

928
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,270
Come in.

929
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,189
What's in here?

930
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,818
- Blood!
- Wait, what?

931
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,777
That startled me!

932
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,112
What is this?

933
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,031
There's blood everywhere…

934
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,741
Why is there blood everywhere?

935
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,786
THE CIRCULAR GALLERY

936
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,665
THE PLACE THEY'VE ENTERED
HAS UNSETTLING POOL OF BLOOD ON THE FLOOR

937
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,585
- I think we should go back.
- Wait, just stay still.

938
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,587
Aren't you all here to see Justin?

939
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,255
Where's Justin? We need to find him.

940
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,216
- Do you want me to look for him?
- Yes.

941
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,760
- I'll show you. He's here.
- Where are you going?

942
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,261
- Where are you going?
- Don't go.

943
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,096
Si-young!

944
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,681
Don't close the door.

945
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,391
What's wrong with you?

946
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,644
- Why are you abandoning us?
- I won't. Why would I…

947
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,771
They'll all turn into zombies
when you leave, right?

948
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,315
Don't touch that.
Have I ever ditched you before?

949
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,318
Let's not remove it for now.

950
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,653
Remove it?

951
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,279
What's there to be suspicious about?

952
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,364
It's like a colosseum…

953
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,074
Why can't we remove it? Why?

954
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,033
Oh, no!

955
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,409
Why?

956
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,162
Why?

957
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,539
Why not?

958
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,498
Oh, my!

959
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,457
That scared me.

960
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,917
Why not?

961
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,960
It's a mannequin.

962
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,879
It's just a mannequin. What's wrong?

963
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,049
It feels like a cage in here.

964
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,217
Oh, geez!

965
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,885
It feels like a cage in here.

966
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,303
Hey.

967
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,347
BROKE THE ARM OF A PRECIOUS COLLECTION

968
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,348
Would you like it

969
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,809
if someone breaks your arm?

970
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,478
Would you like it?

971
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,521
It's just a mannequin.

972
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,774
It's not just any mannequin.
They are precious to me.

973
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,775
Okay.

974
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,069
Hey!

975
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,195
No, I'm just putting it back on!

976
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,905
You told me to put it back on.

977
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,990
Don't touch its arm.

978
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,325
Just stay still.

979
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,035
- You'll die.
- Justin.

980
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,870
That's a big head.

981
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,622
Justin!

982
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,374
What is this?

983
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,002
Oh, it's not him again.

984
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,878
This isn't Justin.

985
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,964
It's not him too. Where is he?

986
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,431
It must be this one. Sorry.

987
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,269
Be careful now.

988
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,489
Who did this?

989
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,577
Oh, shit!

990
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,580
No!

991
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,248
Oh, shit!

992
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,750
Shit!

993
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,470
He left!

994
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:01,680
It's Andre.

995
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,307
The big guy, right?

996
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,224
That's right!

997
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,602
HYUN-JOON THOUGHT 'ANDRE'
WAS 'JUSTIN', THE FOREIGNER

998
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,354
He must have been bitten by a zombie.

999
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,065
Andre got bitten! What do we do?

1000
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,026
They all turned into zombies
and were captured in Jeju Island.

1001
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:14,943
Hello.

1002
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,154
THEY PARTED WAYS WITH CHEF ANDRE
2 WEEKS AGO IN JEJU

1003
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,072
Thank you.

1004
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,533
THOUGHT HE ESCAPED JEJU ISLAND,
BUT HE TURNED UP AS A ZOMBIE

1005
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,743
- Andre.
- Andre.

1006
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,536
Andre.

1007
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,121
It's four against one anyway.

1008
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,414
We can't beat that dude.

1009
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,458
He's gotten even bigger now.

1010
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,709
He's bulked up.

1011
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,128
He has numbers on him too.

1012
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,589
Number one. It's Z-001.

1013
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,719
What's going on?

1014
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,430
Hyun-joon, what are you doing right now?

1015
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,351
You turned into a real psychopath.

1016
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,812
Who are you?
You're not Shin Hyun-joon, are you?

1017
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,731
What song can we all sing together?

1018
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,316
- What?
- What?

1019
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,442
Aren't you a singer?

1020
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,527
Is he crazy?

1021
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,029
DinDin, you were asking me earlier.

1022
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,114
What?

1023
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,574
- Why there are so many people in there.
- Yes.

1024
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,618
Didn't you realize I collect people?

1025
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:07,788
That's insane.

1026
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,792
I'll take good care of you all.

1027
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,170
AFTER LOSING EVERYONE
AROUND HIM IN A ZOMBIE ATTACK

1028
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,548
HYUN-JOON HAS GONE CRAZY

1029
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:20,717
Si-young. We've got an actress.
And a singer.

1030
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,471
DISPATCHING JUSTIN TO COLLECT RARE ZOMBIES

1031
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,140
We've got a doctor.

1032
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,852
STARTED TURNING THE ABANDONED BUILDING
INTO A ZOMBIE MUSEUM

1033
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,563
AND THIS

1034
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,940
IS HYUN-JOON'S FAVORITE PIECE OF WORK

1035
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:38,277
I'll make sure you're all part
of a great collection here.

1036
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,243
What's happening? Andre is moving.

1037
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,917
Andre! It's us!

1038
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,923
Let's go!

1039
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,720
What's going on? Why?

1040
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,221
No!

1041
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,892
Hey!

1042
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,610
I've got one more!

1043
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,030
JUSTIN'S WICKED DEEDS ARE CONTINUING

1044
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,951
ALL OF THE BLOOD IS SCATTERED
AROUND THE ZOMBIES

1045
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,537
It's there, right?
I'll call and gather them here.

1046
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,623
Hey! Come here!

1047
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,929
NEED TO FIND THE PRECIOUS BLOOD
BEFORE THEY GET TRAMPLED AND DESTROYED

1048
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,144
It's hard to look for it in there.

1049
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,814
Hey! Watch out!

1050
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,567
No, it's too dangerous!

1051
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,236
It's dangerous. This isn't right.

1052
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,325
We've got an actress and a singer.

1053
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,995
THE GYM IS FILLED WITH GREAT CANDIDATES
FOR THE COLLECTION

1054
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,172
JUSTIN SNEAKS OUT THE BACK
TO SET UP THE NEXT TRAP

1055
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,682
What's happening?

1056
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,020
What's happening?

1057
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,069
Justin!

1058
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:45,904
Justin, are you okay?

1059
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,450
What?

1060
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,368
No way.

1061
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,787
What's up with that guy?

1062
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,455
- What's happening?
- It's coming!

1063
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,675
Why is it attacking?

1064
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,427
Why is a zombie attacking other zombies?

1065
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,264
Is he like the king of the zombies?

1066
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,310
What's going on?

1067
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,695
They're running away.

1068
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,196
It must be a mutant.

1069
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,742
HYUN-JOON'S 220CM COLLECTION
THE TALLEST ZOMBIE EVER HAS JUST APPEARED

1070
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,452
It's on a whole another level.

1071
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:37,331
- We can't handle that zombie.
- There's no way.

1072
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,375
Does it make sense for its body
and hands to look like that?

1073
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,669
Look how long its arms are.

1074
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,256
THE MONSTER THAT
TOOK DOWN JUSTIN IN ONE BLOW

1075
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,468
It's not that fast though.

1076
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:50,636
We can slow down.

1077
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,387
We might need to lure it.

1078
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,014
We'll handle it, Eun-bi. Get the blood!

1079
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:54,931
Hey!

1080
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,392
Hey!

1081
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,227
It's coming up here!

1082
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,354
We have to fight now!

1083
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,688
- Fight back!
- Grab it!

1084
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,106
- Push it off!
- Grab it!

1085
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,068
- Push it off!
- Grab it!

1086
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,153
- Grab it!
- Let's push it off!

1087
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,946
Stay still!

1088
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,823
- Drag it!
- Hey!

1089
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,241
We got it!

1090
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,618
What's happening?

1091
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,619
What's happening?

1092
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,872
What?

1093
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,749
- What's going on?
- Watch out?

1094
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,336
It's no longer a safe zone anymore.

1095
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,631
EVERYWHERE IS A DANGER ZONE
WITH A 220CM-TALL ZOMBIE

1096
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,257
Hey!

1097
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,760
We need to come up with a plan.

1098
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:35,847
NEED TO TAKE DOWN THE TALL ZOMBIE
AND FIND THE BLOOD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

1099
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:46,191
THE GYM HAS AN ELASTIC ROPE
HANGING FROM THE CEILING

1100
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,403
I've got a good plan!

1101
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,447
Can you block this zombie
for five seconds?

1102
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,908
- From where?
- I'll tie a knot around him in 5 seconds.

1103
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,410
- In five seconds?
- Yes.

1104
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,953
- The two of us hold it off?
- Yes.

1105
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,329
Okay.

1106
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,039
This zombie is slow anyway.

1107
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,791
Just watch out for its mouth.

1108
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,838
- Hey!
- Come over here!

1109
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,256
- Defconn!
- Yes?

1110
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,967
- Defconn, this way!
- Let's go!

1111
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,101
This zombie is slow anyway.

1112
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,315
IT'S CRAZY FAST

1113
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,030
Defconn!

1114
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,747
No! Defconn is bitten!

1115
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,790
Defconn is bitten!

1116
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:45,917
Get away!

1117
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,005
Hey, Dex!

1118
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,841
Let go!

1119
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:56,928
Hurry!

1120
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,891
I don't want to die!

1121
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,776
DEFCONN IS INFECTED

1122
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,277
I don't want to die…

1123
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,780
NO TIME TO BE SAD!
THEY NEED A NEW PLAN

1124
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,072
It's too fast.

1125
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,617
Let's take it down first.
I think we need to hold it down.

1126
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,993
Move out of the way!

1127
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,679
I'll get on its back by swinging on this.

1128
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,889
No. Isn't that too dangerous?

1129
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,684
I'll get on its back and tie its arm.
Tie the other arm with that.

1130
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,478
THOUGHT EUN-BI WAS STILL
BUT SHE WAS WAITING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT

1131
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,147
Are you certain this is the right choice?

1132
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:35,694
IT'S A SOLID PLAN BUT COULD BE RISKY

1133
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,113
You can do it.

1134
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,246
- Hurry and tie it up!
- Hey!

1135
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,708
Hurry and tie it up!

1136
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,751
SHE COULDN'T GET ON IT PROPERLY

1137
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,068
Push it down!

1138
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,862
Push it down!

1139
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,114
Push it down!

1140
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,911
Sung-jae!

1141
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,050
Sung-jae!

1142
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:43,428
Sung-jae!

1143
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,391
Someone should be alive

1144
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,477
so that a vaccine could be developed,

1145
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,437
and humanity could be saved.

1146
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,649
Dex! I got bitten. Just tie it up.

1147
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,198
I'll hold it down!

1148
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,533
Tie it now, Dex!

1149
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:07,994
Excuse me, Dex!

1150
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,704
Wait, hold on.

1151
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,665
- I'm not your shield.
- Bad boy!

1152
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,834
If you're going to get bitten,
go underwater.

1153
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,337
I saved her in the end.

1154
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,049
See? I step up when it really matters.

1155
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,092
I just talk like that.

1156
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,221
Tie me up with him!

1157
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,892
Just do it!

1158
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,770
Dex, tie us up!

1159
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,148
Sung-jae!

1160
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,191
Tie it!

1161
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,863
THE SECOND JOINT MISSION

1162
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:47,242
THE LAST JOINT MISSION

1163
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:50,578
FAILED

1164
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,618
