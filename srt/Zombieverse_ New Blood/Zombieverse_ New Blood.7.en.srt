1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,425
Sung-jae!

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,469
I got bitten. Just tie it up.

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:13,972
Dex, tie us up!

4
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:15,890
Tie it!

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,812
I tied it.

6
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,067
Avoid it! Onto the trampoline!

7
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,454
I'm doing it.

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,586
Eun-bi!

9
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,681
Tie it for me!

10
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,017
This arm.

11
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,440
Tie it up.

12
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,817
I'm done.

13
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,069
Get down, Eun-bi!

14
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,074
Let's find it.

15
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,575
Find the ampoule!

16
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,829
Shoot! Where is it?

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,206
Defconn, get up there.

18
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,508
Z-220 TALLEST ZOMBIE
SUCCESSFULLY NEUTRALIZED

19
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,096
What's going on?

20
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,181
Andre! It's us!

21
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,059
Let's go!

22
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,354
QUEST: ESCAPE THE SECRET ROOM
WHILE DODGING THE MIGHTY ANDRE

23
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,238
FELL INTO HYUN-JOON'S TRAP
AND ENCOUNTERED ZOMBIE ANDRE

24
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,490
No!

25
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,660
No!

26
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,911
No!

27
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,329
Andre, calm down!

28
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,957
No. Andre, calm down!

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,127
ANDRE HAS REUNITED WITH OLD FRIENDS,
BUT HE IS NO LONGER HUMAN

30
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,130
No!

31
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,302
No!

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,345
What is that?

33
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,931
ANDRE, WHO IS AS STRONG AS AN OX,
LAUNCHES RELENTLESS ATTACKS

34
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,852
DinDin! Watch out!

35
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,312
Shoot! The door's locked!

36
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,480
No!

37
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,525
- TAEYEON, do you want to be protected?
- Yes!

38
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,818
- TAEYEON.
- Please!

39
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,905
- Do you want me to protect you?
- Please!

40
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,293
Andre, calm down!

41
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,919
Andre, calm down!

42
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,087
Calm down!

43
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,757
THERE'S NO WAY TO REASON WITH HIM!

44
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,927
- Andre!
- Andre!

45
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:58,887
Andre!

46
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,514
Remember me?

47
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,021
Hamburger!

48
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,231
Time to eat!

49
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,989
You made hamburgers for us, chef.

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,199
Andre, it's us!

51
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,369
Catch him!

52
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,371
Catch it!

53
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,083
It's me!

54
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,793
Andre is born in the year of 1993.

55
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:35,214
Andre? Born in 1993?

56
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,135
PERHAPS THE MEMORIES
OF THEIR TIME TOGETHER REMAIN

57
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,512
Yo! It's us, Andre! Calm down!

58
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,223
If Andre decides to stay behind,

59
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,891
we just need one more person.

60
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,684
…we just need one more person.

61
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,937
OH, NO! BAD MEMORIES ARE RESURFACING

62
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,147
- What's happening?
- Andre weighs 140 kg.

63
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,024
That's four times TAEYEON's weight.

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,484
Four times.

65
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,906
Andre!

66
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,658
Teamwork!

67
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,542
If you're late, you lose,
rock, scissors, paper!

68
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,544
- Andre didn't make a move.
- Why didn't you?

69
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,922
Andre is clueless.

70
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,386
THE EMOTIONAL APPEAL BACKFIRED

71
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,470
Shoot!

72
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,102
IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S REALLY ANGRY
HE GOT MORE AGGRESSIVE

73
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,145
Why aren't you getting caught?

74
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,405
MANAGING TO DODGE PRETTY WELL

75
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,406
Justin.

76
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,241
Why can't you catch them?

77
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,285
He's Andre, not Justin.

78
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,162
THIS IS ANDRE'S, NOT JUSTIN'S,
BEHAVIORAL PATTERN

79
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,502
HE SCANS THE AREA AND CHARGES
STRAIGHT WHEN HE LOCKS ONTO A TARGET

80
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,212
Please.

81
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,841
TIED TO A 200KG TIRE,
HE RETURNS TO THE CENTER

82
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:00,967
Be careful!

83
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,262
THE ESCAPE METHOD IS HIDDEN
BEHIND THIS BEHAVIORAL PATTERN

84
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,981
AIM FOR THE BACK OF ANDRE'S HEAD
WHILE HE'S SEARCHING FOR A TARGET

85
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,780
BLOCKED BY HIS MASSIVE TRAPS

86
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,492
Hold on.

87
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,077
Si-young, do you want to live?

88
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,078
Yes.

89
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,496
Si-young, move to the center.

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,956
Show us a dance.

91
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,710
What song can we all sing together?

92
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,669
Is he crazy?

93
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,964
JUST MOMENTS AGO,
HE FORCED THEM TO PUT ON A TALENT SHOW

94
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,966
Let's see you dance, Si-young.

95
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,761
I'll dance.

96
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,096
Okay. Go ahead, Sae-ho.
I'll let you off the hook.

97
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,016
AT THE MENTION OF DANCING,
THE ENTERTAINER JUMPS RIGHT IN

98
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,227
That's right!

99
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,145
You're doing great!

100
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,939
That's right!

101
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,817
HAZING DANCE IN FRONT OF A ZOMBIE…
THIS IS PRICELESS

102
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,860
Yes!

103
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,237
That's right!

104
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,407
THIS ISN'T CHO HYE-RYUN

105
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,496
ANDRE DOESN'T KNOW KOREAN VARIETY SHOWS

106
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,000
Whoa!

107
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,086
I danced for you!

108
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,673
Oh, no!

109
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,514
Are you okay?

110
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,765
Are you okay? Go that way.

111
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,975
Are you okay?

112
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,227
Are you okay? Go that way.

113
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,605
No!

114
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,068
Are you okay? Go that way.

115
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,862
No!

116
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,947
TAEYEON!

117
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,367
TAEYEON! Move that way!

118
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,409
TAEYEON! Move!

119
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,452
TAEYEON! Move that way!

120
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,539
TAEYEON! Go!

121
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,844
Sae-ho!

122
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,803
No!

123
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,596
No!

124
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,188
You crazy jerk!

125
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,151
Sae-ho.

126
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,825
Why did you come all dressed up?

127
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,370
It's on my face!

128
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,666
SAE-HO ENDURED SO STUBBORNLY
EVEN WITH POOP ON HIS FACE

129
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,254
HIS DANCE ENDS HERE

130
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,007
Oh, no!

131
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,717
Sae-ho saved me!

132
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,691
He will be a good collection.

133
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,734
Sae-ho!

134
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,240
Oh!

135
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,702
CHO SAE-HO IS INFECTED

136
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,080
You psychopath!

137
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,708
Let's go!

138
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:25,004
GIVING NO TIME TO MOURN,
HE SETS TARGET ON HIS NEXT COLLECTION

139
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,717
This bothers me too much.

140
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,011
But he saved your life.

141
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,395
THE ORDEAL CONTINUES
EVEN AFTER BEING BITTEN

142
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,314
DinDin!

143
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,232
DinDin!

144
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,861
Guys, let's find a way.

145
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,488
- This…
- Should we cover him with this?

146
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,282
The door's locked.
How do we get out of here?

147
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,326
Hyun-joon!

148
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,912
Is there a way out of here?

149
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,664
Give us a hint!

150
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,000
Tell us how to get out of this place.

151
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,043
From the back…

152
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,170
- Draw attention from the front.
- Let's go that way.

153
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,267
Watch out! No!

154
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,395
Watch out! No!

155
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,772
Watch out! No!

156
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,234
No!

157
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,946
No! Hey!

158
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,200
DinDin!

159
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,711
No!

160
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,753
What do we do?

161
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,589
What do we do?

162
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,010
Oh, no!

163
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,136
Hey!

164
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,392
DinDin, are you okay?

165
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,022
- Why?
- What are we going to do?

166
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,148
No!

167
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,661
DINDIN IS INFECTED

168
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,833
- What do we do now?
- How do we find a way out of here?

169
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,209
Should we try going up?

170
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,336
Geez.

171
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,630
You're struggling to survive.

172
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,965
But even he's getting exhausted now.

173
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:36,886
Si-young.

174
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,221
That's my arm!

175
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,890
Put it down!

176
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,650
Hold on.

177
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,241
Maybe there's something in the walls.

178
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,868
Oh?

179
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,828
Maybe there's something in the walls.

180
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,497
Oh?

181
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,414
Wait. What was that?

182
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,291
That wall.

183
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,585
They all sound different.

184
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,430
THE SOUND REVEALED A HOLLOW WALL

185
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,431
TAEYEON.

186
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,766
Hold on. Come this way.

187
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,352
Come here.

188
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,771
Stay here.

189
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,356
On three, run to the left.

190
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,941
I think I know what it is.

191
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,069
ONCE ANDRE LOCKS ONTO A TARGET,
HE CHARGES IN THAT DIRECTION

192
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,281
THE PLAN IS TO MAKE ANDRE CRASH
INTO THE WALL THAT SOUNDS DIFFERENT

193
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,785
DinDin, hang in there.

194
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,415
Hey! Don't damage my property.

195
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,724
Shoot!

196
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,061
Dang!

197
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,729
What was that?

198
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,693
Unbelievable! He broke through!

199
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,028
You could break through that?

200
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,950
QUEST COMPLETE
SUCCESSFULLY NEUTRALIZED ANDRE

201
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,591
Is he dead?

202
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,550
I don't know.

203
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,218
Are you okay?

204
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,974
Geez.

205
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,602
We can get out.

206
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,396
A PATH OUT OF THE SECRET ROOM
HAS BEEN SECURED

207
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,607
Wait. What if he wakes up again?

208
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,568
I'm not sure if he's dead or not,
but he's definitely out of it now.

209
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,569
Are you okay?

210
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,572
I should tie something around my leg.

211
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,073
- Your leg is bitten.
- DinDin…

212
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,202
He got bitten on the neck. Are you okay?

213
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,829
Won't it spread quickly?

214
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,998
AVOIDED FATAL INJURIES
BUT COULD TURN AT ANY MOMENT

215
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,666
Oh, my!

216
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,752
Sung-jae!

217
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,591
Are you okay?

218
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,093
TWO PEOPLE WERE INFECTED IN THE GYM TOO

219
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,762
- Are you bitten?
- Sit down.

220
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,555
- Come here.
- He's bitten.

221
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,473
Are you okay?

222
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,599
What? DinDin?

223
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,476
Don't come near me.

224
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,395
But seriously,

225
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,189
does it make any sense to take us along?

226
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,941
Justin, that bastard…

227
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,401
- Justin's dead too.
- He is?

228
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,279
Traitors are bound to die.

229
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,573
What happened? Andre?

230
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,866
Why is Andre here?

231
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,327
What on Earth happened here?

232
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,121
You know Shin Hyun-joon, right?

233
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,873
Hyun-joon was here?

234
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,042
Earlier, did the zombies
have number tags on them?

235
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:55,960
Yes.

236
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,002
Yes, they did.

237
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,296
- We saw them too.
- Hyun-joon is a zombie collector.

238
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,881
He's like a zombie collector.

239
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,716
- That's his hobby?
- Yes.

240
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,843
He gathered all the zombies.

241
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,888
Looks like he collects special zombies.

242
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,558
But how did the four
of you manage to deal with him?

243
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,475
Well…

244
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,228
He ran into the wall and…

245
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,897
Oh? Did you find the bag?

246
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,232
Where is it? Where's the blood?

247
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,692
- Did you find it?
- Are there a lot?

248
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,111
- But we couldn't find them all.
- We only have two.

249
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,948
JUSTIN THREW AWAY FIVE AMPOULES
OF BLOOD INTO THE SEA OF STYROFOAM

250
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,158
- I found one! We've got one!
- You found it?

251
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,120
I found it!

252
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,080
THEY MANAGED TO ONLY FIND TWO
IN GOOD CONDITION

253
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,874
Good job. At least we have these.

254
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,959
We have two of them
and we're running out of time.

255
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,878
We have to hurry or they'll spoil.

256
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,422
- Hurry and go before we start changing.
- You know…

257
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,840
I'll be honest.

258
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,217
Do we need to bring them
or should we lock them somewhere

259
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,594
since they'll turn into zombies?

260
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,220
What do you mean by "they"?

261
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,180
Are you going to ditch us?

262
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,395
But we're so close to
the National Medical Center.

263
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,647
But we don't have much time left.

264
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,024
What should we do?

265
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,944
THE FINAL DESTINATION,
THE NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER, IS NEARBY

266
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,865
THEY DECIDE WHAT TO DO
WITH THE INFECTED TEAMMATES

267
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,658
Hey.

268
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,536
I have to tell you guys something.

269
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,871
What is it?

270
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,331
He knows something.

271
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,707
Well…

272
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,542
- I was on the phone.
- Yes.

273
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,337
There's something I haven't told you guys.

274
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,755
At the subway station?

275
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,924
- You planned this with Justin?
- I didn't.

276
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,091
Just hear me out.

277
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,052
Okay. Go on.

278
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,179
So you know that blood is from Hong-chul?

279
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,515
If you get injected with that…

280
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,478
- The blood shouldn't be in the corpse?
- Yes, or it'll solidify.

281
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,313
- Is there an emergency kit there?
- Yes.

282
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,232
- Draw the blood immediately.
- So we need to collect it.

283
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,150
- The blood?
- Yes.

284
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,736
This isn't something
many people need to know but…

285
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,113
- Is there anyone around you?
- What?

286
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,616
If you get bit
while transporting the blood,

287
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,159
inject yourself with it immediately.

288
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,120
If our research is correct,
the antibodies should stop the infection.

289
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,121
I understand.

290
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,958
So we'll become immune
to the zombie virus if we inject it.

291
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,085
Yes, you must bring
the blood no matter what.

292
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,002
Got it.

293
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,254
That's what he told me.

294
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,464
If we get injected,

295
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,883
the infection will stop spreading.

296
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,009
- It'll stop?
- Yes.

297
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,552
Does that mean they won't turn?

298
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,638
WITH HONG-CHUL'S NEW BLOOD,

299
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,556
YOU CAN STOP THE VIRUS FROM PROGRESSING

300
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,562
Isn't that a needle? What is it?

301
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,648
Why were you hiding that?

302
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,400
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

303
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:29,405
I couldn't tell you guys
because that person might be lying.

304
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,115
- Because it hasn't been tested?
- Yes.

305
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,243
Honestly, If I really wanted to,
I would've taken one and injected myself.

306
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,620
That's why I couldn't tell you guys.

307
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,748
But wait…

308
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,209
Since we have two of these,

309
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,336
can't we use one for ourselves?

310
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,380
If we inject it,
we might not turn into zombies.

311
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,798
It'll stop the infection.

312
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,218
First of all,
we have two ampoules of blood.

313
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,387
We need to send one
to the National Medical Center.

314
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,638
One of them has to get there.

315
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,306
- Send one.
- It surely has to get there.

316
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,934
- They need to mass produce it.
- Then we have one left.

317
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,561
Let's inject one of us.

318
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,479
Let's inject one of us.

319
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,984
WITH THE ONE REMAINING AMPOULE OF BLOOD,
THEY CAN ONLY SAVE ONE PERSON

320
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,444
What should we do?

321
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,655
- We have to save at least one sample.
- You have to.

322
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,450
Then inject the most suitable person
and the rest can go with us.

323
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,451
Go where?

324
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,493
We are so close.

325
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,037
If we turn on the way, it'll be bad.

326
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,413
We're injecting one person.

327
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,457
Hold on.

328
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,250
- Then…
- Either block their mouth…

329
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,877
- To be honest…
- Be quiet for a second.

330
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,961
Hold on.

331
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,592
Wait. Be quiet for a second.

332
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,219
Andre is snoring.

333
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,807
Didn't you say he was dead?

334
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,060
- He's actually sleeping.
- His stomach is moving.

335
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,686
- He's actually asleep.
- He isn't dead.

336
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,521
ANDRE HAS FALLEN ASLEEP AFTER SOME TIME

337
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,148
From what I heard,

338
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,277
zombies start snoring when they die.

339
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,534
Sae-ho's not looking good right now.

340
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,619
They snore one last time.

341
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,537
HE STARTS TALKING NONSENSE
AS HE TRANSFORMS

342
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,832
Let's get out of here
before Andre wakes up.

343
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,502
Hey, so I have a suggestion.

344
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,421
If I take one of those injections

345
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,342
and follow you guys,
the zombies won't attack me anyway.

346
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,636
- So I can help you…
- That's insane.

347
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,596
- It's a bit too loud.
- Why is he so…

348
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,306
THIS IS THE ACTUAL SOUND
OF HIS SNORING

349
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,307
Why is he snoring

350
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,476
like a tank?

351
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,646
THEY CAN'T CONTINUE THEIR DISCUSSION

352
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,065
He's jet-lagged.

353
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,192
He must be tired, it's really early.

354
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,693
AS IF HE'S SUFFERING FROM A JET LAG

355
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,279
Recently, zombies have started snoring

356
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,447
when they die.

357
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,201
Actually, it's not that.
People snore when they're tired, right?

358
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,745
He did use up a lot of energy.
We know that.

359
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,413
HE'S COMPLETELY WORN OUT

360
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,873
We saw him use up his energy.

361
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,000
He broke through the wall several times.

362
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,336
Honestly, if I'm being frank…

363
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,089
I know everyone wants it.
Just vote and decide.

364
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,386
QUEST: CHOOSE ONE PERSON
TO RECEIVE THE BLOOD OF SALVATION

365
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,683
WITH WISE JUDGMENT,
CHOOSE THE PERSON WHO WILL BE MOST HELPFUL

366
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,561
The most helpful person should get it.
Honestly, what else can we do?

367
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,986
Why is that punk on his knees?

368
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,028
He's on his knees.

369
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,412
Honestly, unlike these guys…

370
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,289
"These guys"? Look at this jerk!

371
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,374
I've dealt with half-zombies before.

372
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,794
So I know when I need to step up.

373
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,130
I know exactly
how to handle things like this.

374
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,465
- Where do we go?
- Oh, no!

375
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,469
CONTRARY TO HIS LAID-BACK IMAGE,
DINDIN ALWAYS TOOK THE LEAD

376
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,930
It's not going to work! What do we do?

377
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:46,351
HE BRAVELY STOOD UP TO ANDRE,
ONLY TO BE FIERCELY BITTEN IN THE END

378
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,189
I've been through everything.

379
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,482
EARLY OUTBREAK EXPERIENCE
IS AN ADVANTAGE

380
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,609
And also…

381
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,944
I'll just end it here.

382
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,196
RAN OUT OF THINGS TO SAY

383
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,697
Poor DinDin.

384
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,408
I…

385
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,911
At first,

386
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:08,498
I was only worried
about surviving on my own.

387
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,793
I was determined to survive on my own,
even if everyone else died.

388
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,794
That was on my mind.

389
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,924
But after spending so much time together,

390
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,594
I found myself wanting
to help others in danger

391
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,930
even without realizing it.

392
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,725
SUNG-JAE EMBODIED
THE ARCHETYPE OF A GROWTH IN CHARACTER

393
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,272
In fact, even today when Eun-bi
looked like she was in danger…

394
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,357
He's right.

395
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,777
Things aren't looking promising

396
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,363
because I got bitten in two spots.

397
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,744
I'll hold it down!

398
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,455
HE STARTED AS A SIX-STAR PLAYER,
SHIFTING FROM ONE TO SEVEN STARS

399
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,539
Sung-jae!

400
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,083
It's okay! Tie it!

401
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,503
HIS FINAL PERFORMANCE WAS OFF THE CHARTS,
REACHING A PERFECT TEN-STAR LEVEL

402
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,673
- You'll live.
- The infection will stop.

403
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,216
Come on! You have to survive!

404
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,513
But, Eun-bi looks like Andre to me
right now.

405
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,432
Hello.

406
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,522
To be honest…

407
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,067
Jeju Island…

408
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,076
Ever since we arrived in Jeju Island…

409
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,996
Life…

410
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,791
My life felt meaningless.

411
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,211
Already…

412
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,550
I was supposed to get married.

413
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,593
But now…

414
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,642
SEEMS LIKE INTENSE PAIN IS HITTING HIM NOW

415
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,269
Get Sae-ho out.

416
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,566
Wait. What about your fiancée?

417
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,985
Your fiancée?

418
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,654
Your soon-to-be fiancée is
somewhat of a half-zombie.

419
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,072
Are you still going to marry her?

420
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,032
- Of course.
- Yes.

421
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,160
Instead of a kiss, I'll just get bitten
right there on the spot.

422
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,204
- Are you crying?
- Oh, no!

423
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,122
Don't cry.

424
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,832
It's just that this sunset reminds me

425
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,834
of the time I watched it with my fiancée.

426
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,170
Please tell her,
"Thank you for loving me."

427
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,092
But I've already…

428
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,845
FORGET ABOUT GETTING MARRIED,
HE'S ON THE BRINK OF DEATH

429
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,138
I'll live…

430
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,892
Oh…

431
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,398
Well, I'll live and…

432
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,108
He's snoring again.

433
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,194
AT THIS POINT,
IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO RETURN HOME

434
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,653
I'm going crazy.

435
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,238
How is he sleeping like a log?

436
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,324
Is Andre snoring again?

437
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,243
At this rate, just give it to Andre.

438
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,787
Should we give it to Andre?

439
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,372
I knew it would be
the end of me once I got bitten.

440
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,374
Because what's the point
of living after that?

441
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,966
- What's the point?
- That makes sense.

442
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,884
That's true.

443
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,469
It's better to go together.

444
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,347
But I still want to live.

445
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,062
Hey.

446
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,314
Anyway, what I want to say is,

447
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,690
I'm strong, right?

448
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,110
I'll be helpful one way or another.

449
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,946
We should be careful.

450
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,364
After all we've been through.

451
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,449
KNOWN FOR BEING A REALIST
AND MAKING CALM DECISIONS

452
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,618
It's not about us retreating,
we need to save Eun-bi.

453
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,411
Go!

454
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,958
DESPITE HIS SIZE AND STRENGTH,
HE WAS BITTEN IN THE END

455
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,253
I figured my physical strength
would be useful.

456
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,796
That's what I think.

457
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,215
That guy didn't tell us
after the phone call.

458
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,675
IMMEDIATELY SPOILED THE MOOD

459
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:50,053
Why don't we do this?
All four of you should close your eyes.

460
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,472
Should we just go with a majority vote?

461
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,557
Okay. Good.

462
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,017
Can you close your eyes?
Keep your eyes closed.

463
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,936
Don't even take a peek.

464
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,819
I always took the lead.

465
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,321
I think that…

466
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:12,951
the person who died
the most noble death should be the one.

467
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,456
Is that Michael Jackson in the middle?

468
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,624
Or Bruno Mars?

469
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,339
HE'S NEARLY CROSSING OVER TO THE AFTERLIFE

470
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,426
But I can't help but say that
I want to save Sung-jae.

471
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,928
Does that mean there are two candidates?

472
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,765
Sister-in-law, this is how
Sae-ho's life ends.

473
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:40,729
Forgetting all the pain

474
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,190
Everyone will be able
to survive later anyway.

475
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,482
So there's no need to argue.

476
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,067
Let's just decide quickly.

477
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:51,948
Trying day and night to grow me well

478
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,326
No hard feelings. No matter
who gets chosen to survive.

479
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,452
- Of course.
- Yes.

480
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,789
We have the results.

481
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,541
Okay. We'll respect it.

482
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,752
I absolutely won't hold any grudges.

483
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,756
THEY WILL BID FAREWELL
TO EVERYONE ELSE EXCEPT ONE PERSON

484
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,056
Anyway, whoever gets the shot,
hurry up and go get the medicine made.

485
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,016
- No matter what.
- Seriously.

486
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,935
- Yes.
- Even if it's not me.

487
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,270
It's okay if it's not me.
Just bring the medicine back.

488
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:26,066
You can turn around now.

489
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,158
We chose DinDin.

490
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,076
DinDin!

491
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,584
Let's go!

492
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,128
Let's go together!

493
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,756
Thank you.

494
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,384
- I choose DinDin.
- DinDin?

495
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,052
I choose Sung-jae.

496
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,471
Sung-jae took care of everything for us.

497
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,348
But we need to think about this too.

498
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,226
What if we get betrayed again?
It could be possible.

499
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,395
Apart from Sung-jae,
everyone else is easy to catch.

500
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,355
We need to keep that in mind.

501
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,941
- Then let's go with DinDin.
- Yes, let's choose DinDin.

502
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,651
GOT PICKED BECAUSE HE'S EASY TO HANDLE

503
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,694
I'll inject it for you.

504
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,071
No, I'll do it. I know how.

505
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,407
We will come back to save you guys.

506
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,660
I think it was a good strategic choice.

507
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,372
But honestly,
shouldn't you inject it out of our sight?

508
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,207
No, I want everyone to see.

509
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,043
You have to take it out slowly.

510
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,504
Just hurry up.
I'm going to turn into a zombie.

511
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,426
It's happening!

512
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,761
What was that?

513
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,305
He's turning into one.

514
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,727
HIS TONGUE IS GOING WILD

515
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,405
That's very deep.

516
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,240
Do it slowly. Don't rush it.

517
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,079
Not sure if it was a right choice.

518
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,088
- What was that?
- I feel better.

519
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,882
THE EFFECTS ARE AMAZING AND IMMEDIATE

520
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,633
Hurry and go.

521
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,844
Hurry! We're changing!

522
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,138
HIS TONGUE IS ACTING UP AGAIN

523
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,639
Go!

524
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,558
- You're okay, right?
- Hurry and leave!

525
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,560
Something's wrong with him.

526
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,478
Let's go.

527
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,688
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HURRY AND LEAVE THEM

528
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,773
Eun-bi, go!

529
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,191
- Sae-ho.
- Go.

530
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,734
Go now and…

531
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,444
- Get the medicine made.
- That's right.

532
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,155
The zombies won't bite you,
your job is to…

533
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,281
- Protect them.
- Go.

534
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,991
- Go on. Hurry up.
- My body's twisting.

535
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,284
What's wrong with him?

536
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,244
Seriously. Go!

537
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,788
AS IF IT'S SPREADING ALL OVER HIM

538
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,997
Hey. Bring him with you.

539
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,499
I'm changing now. Go.

540
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,753
- Sae-ho.
- Go!

541
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:59,469
FULFILLING HIS MISSION
TO SPREAD LAUGHTER UNTIL THE VERY END

542
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,595
Go now!

543
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,889
- Wait!
- Gosh!

544
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:03,973
What?

545
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,934
- Does it work?
- What's wrong?

546
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,352
- Actually, we have one more.
- How?

547
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,520
What?

548
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,857
We have one more ampoule?

549
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,192
- We have more?
- What?

550
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,193
What?

551
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,486
Did you guys stash one away?

552
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,695
Traitor!

553
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,739
Why are we all taking turns?

554
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,907
I want to try stabbing…

555
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,034
DINDIN SECRETLY TOOK AN AMPOULE OF BLOOD

556
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,080
What? No.

557
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:34,295
AFTER GETTING CAUGHT, HE CALMLY
MADE AN ACCOMPLICE INSTEAD OF CONFESSING

558
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,714
Let's save one more person.

559
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,174
Don't we have one more?

560
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,760
So we have exactly one left?

561
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:41,678
Just one.

562
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,637
- Last one.
- Seriously.

563
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,888
But that's not important now.

564
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,223
- We can save one more.
- Hurry!

565
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,141
What do we do?

566
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,101
Isn't it too late for you though?

567
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,561
- No, I'm back.
- No.

568
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,813
- You were dead earlier.
- I feel better again.

569
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,106
HIS SHAMEFUL ANTICS BACKFIRED

570
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,441
Sae-ho's practically gone.

571
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,526
You were doing this just now.

572
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,862
No, it was different.

573
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,572
- It was different.
- You were doing this.

574
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,449
My shoulder was just stiff, that's all.

575
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,117
Then prove that you're okay.

576
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,119
Can you do jumping jacks?

577
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,246
Can you do jumping jacks?

578
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,460
That's possible?

579
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:19,007
A MIRACLE HAPPENED
OUT OF A DESPERATE DESIRE FOR BLOOD

580
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,633
How about basketball?

581
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,512
HIS STIFFENING JOINTS HAVE LOOSENED UP

582
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,764
How about bowling?

583
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,931
He can do everything.

584
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,934
What was that earlier?

585
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,394
Golf!

586
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,813
Show us some light dance moves.

587
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,400
NO PROBLEM WITH ANY SPORTS,
INCLUDING DANCE MOVES

588
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,526
High toss serve!

589
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,903
How can you suddenly do that?

590
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,070
- Pogo stick.
- Tennis.

591
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,655
Sae-ho, that's…

592
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,240
Nike, windmill…

593
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,909
Windmill.

594
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,702
Do you even need the injection?

595
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,662
I don't think you need it at this rate.

596
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,706
Hurry!

597
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,874
- No.
- Hurry!

598
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,835
Isn't he that special someone?
The one in 2.5 million?

599
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,920
Like Hong-chul.

600
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,087
Just take him.

601
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,840
- What do we do?
- If he's gone this far…

602
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,051
If he's gone this far…

603
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,552
No, but…

604
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,138
after seeing you save DinDin,

605
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,058
it might be strategically better
to save me next.

606
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,976
Now you want to live?

607
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,937
Do you want to live?

608
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,105
- It's important to save them.
- Okay.

609
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,691
- Let's just take a vote.
- Okay.

610
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,360
Raise your hand if you choose Sung-jae.

611
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,449
It feels like the entertainers
are going to be left out.

612
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,005
Let's just leave quietly.

613
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,389
If you choose Sung-jae, raise your hand.

614
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,518
If you pick Sae-ho, raise your hand.

615
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,604
- Okay.
- These two picked Sung-jae.

616
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,481
- Four picked Sae-ho.
- Four picked Sae-ho?

617
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,399
Right?

618
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,443
HE WON THE FUN AWARD
FOR HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE FINAL MOMENTS

619
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,205
It feels like the entertainers
are going to be left out.

620
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,040
Sae-ho, you overdid it.

621
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,542
HE SURVIVED BECAUSE HE OVERDID IT

622
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,043
Hey. Hold on, DinDin.

623
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,713
- Let's just leave.
- Leave?

624
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,922
Because I feel so bad!

625
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,757
I feel so bad that I can't look at them.

626
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,551
- Let's get out.
- Let's go.

627
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,677
I feel so sorry for them.

628
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,678
I feel so bad.

629
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,055
I can hear the sound of busy footsteps.

630
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,432
This sound…

631
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,476
We don't have time for this.
We need to get the medicine!

632
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,612
Defconn.

633
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,573
It sounds like they're gone.

634
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,419
Let's die heroically.

635
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,212
Let's wait for them.

636
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,589
But…

637
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,716
it's quite upsetting, right?
We worked hard…

638
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,553
No. There must be a reason.

639
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,770
Darn.

640
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,772
It was a good life.

641
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,303
What's happening?

642
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,013
What?

643
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,264
This way!

644
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,976
- Go up!
- What?

645
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,769
- Up!
- Hurry! Go first!

646
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:00,812
They're coming!

647
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,981
Get up! Why are there so many of them?

648
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,399
My legs!

649
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,651
Why are there so many of them?

650
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,115
Let's go!

651
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,574
Hurry!

652
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,118
Hurry up!

653
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:20,373
FLED FROM THE ZOMBIES
AND REACHED THE BUILDING'S ROOFTOP

654
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,000
- What?
- What's this?

655
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,668
I'm so tired.

656
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,961
What? Is this a bridge?

657
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:25,962
What is it?

658
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:31,509
SUSPENSION BRIDGE ON THE ROOFTOP

659
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,302
How do we cross this?

660
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,762
They're coming!

661
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,180
Eun-bi, go ahead first!

662
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,682
Okay!

663
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,731
Go!

664
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,153
It's too shaky!

665
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,404
- Are we going?
- Be careful!

666
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,823
WOW! THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE IS SHAKY

667
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,575
No. It's okay!

668
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,872
Careful! Let's go.

669
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,512
Eun-bi, is there a path?

670
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,140
It's blocked!

671
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,641
- There's no path?
- There isn't?

672
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,809
But there's no path!

673
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,561
- No path!
- There's no way out!

674
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,064
CROSSED THE BRIDGE WITH NOWHERE TO GO
AS ZOMBIES CREEP UP

675
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,398
They're coming!

676
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,316
They're coming!

677
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,610
A zombie is coming!

678
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,405
Eun-bi, get down!

679
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,578
That jerk is coming!

680
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,789
Not that jerk!

681
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,082
Let's go!

682
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,503
FINAL QUEST: PROTECT THE BLOOD
ON THE SWAYING BRIDGE

683
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,173
NO ESCAPE FROM THE ZOMBIES
CROSSING THE BRIDGE

684
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,174
We need to fight them.

685
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,383
How?

686
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,887
Turn around!

687
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,305
What do we do? Hang on.

688
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,389
- Turn around!
- Shake this!

689
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,557
Let's sway the bridge.

690
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,356
This isn't working.
We have to sway it like this.

691
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,857
Shake it from side to side!

692
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:10,775
Left!

693
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,692
Right!

694
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,693
Left!

695
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,070
- Okay!
- Right!

696
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,613
- Left!
- Right!

697
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,739
Left!

698
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,282
Okay!

699
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,326
THE ZOMBIE'S SENSE OF BALANCE IS A MESS

700
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,579
Okay!

701
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,747
- Good!
- Now.

702
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,958
Let's shake it. Right, left…

703
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,960
Left! Right!

704
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,003
Left! Right!

705
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,965
Left! Right! Left!

706
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,591
- Left!
- Oh! It's falling!

707
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,717
Right!

708
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,844
- Left!
- Okay!

709
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,303
- Right!
- Left!

710
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,429
Right!

711
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,223
- Left!
- Okay!

712
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,393
SEEMS LIKE THEY CAN HOLD OUT
WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE

713
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,853
Now.

714
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,772
It's that zombie!

715
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,732
Oh! It's the zombie leader!

716
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,776
DANGER! THE PARKOUR ZOMBIE HAS APPEARED

717
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,319
That zombie's balance is no joke.

718
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,320
Left!

719
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,657
No! It's crawling!

720
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,033
Watch out!

721
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,915
I'm scared!

722
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,627
- Kick it!
- What do we do?

723
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,222
No!

724
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:24,932
Hey!

725
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,604
Okay.

726
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,613
HUH? THE ZOMBIES
ARE WATCHING AND GROANING

727
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,823
What's up with them? They're singing.

728
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,201
What are they doing? Those zombie jerks!

729
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:47,163
OH MY… THEY'VE EVEN STARTED CHEERING

730
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,292
Seriously, these jerks…

731
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,461
Looking good right now.

732
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,962
Take it slow!

733
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,423
Take it slow. That's right.

734
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,636
- Okay.
- Get out!

735
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,304
- I'll go ahead!
- Shake it!

736
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,514
Hold on…

737
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,769
I'm scared!

738
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:14,774
THE TALLEST ZOMBIE, WHO HAD FOUGHT
FIERCELY, WAS RELEASED BY HYUN-JOON

739
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,401
What's going on?

740
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,945
- Oh? Justin?
- What?

741
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,447
Hey! It's Justin!

742
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,448
You!

743
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,866
Justin, how could you do this?

744
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,244
EVEN JUSTIN, WHO HAS TURNED
INTO A ZOMBIE, JOINS IN

745
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,037
- What's going on?
- Why are there so many?

746
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,373
Sung-jae! Defconn!

747
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,708
This is revenge!

748
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,793
Kwon Eun-bi!

749
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,586
Kwon Eun-bi!

750
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,130
Let's turn into zombies
and bite them!

751
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,091
It's a bit offensive.

752
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,175
Hey! Sung-jae!

753
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,134
It's us!

754
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,928
What's wrong with you?

755
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,306
FIRSTLY, HE'S REALLY ANGRY

756
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,976
One step at a time.

757
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,852
FRIENDS WHO BECAME ZOMBIES WANT REVENGE

758
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,895
They're all here.

759
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,230
Dex, watch out!

760
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,819
WEAKLINGS ARE OUT
AND THE REAL BATTLE BEGINS

761
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:00,987
Left!

762
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,863
Right! Left!

763
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,782
Right! Left!

764
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:11,289
THE TALLEST ZOMBIE
HAS BOTH HEIGHT AND SPEED

765
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,957
- Right! Left!
- Left!

766
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,958
Right!

767
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:14,917
Left!

768
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,252
Right!

769
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,212
Amazing!

770
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,006
- Amazing!
- Careful!

771
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:20,965
Left!

772
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:21,966
Right!

773
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,427
ITS BALANCE IS COLLAPSING

774
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,471
HIGH CENTER OF GRAVITY
PUTS HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE

775
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,431
Right!

776
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,348
Left!

777
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,184
Down…

778
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,397
Is that all you can do?

779
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,401
Oh!

780
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,319
Left!

781
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,656
Look over there!

782
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,950
Andre! Andre is coming!

783
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,785
Andre is coming!

784
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,579
Oh, this isn't right.

785
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,205
THE ULTIMATE WEAPON HAS JUST APPEARED

786
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,544
FRESH FROM A DEEP SLEEP,
HE'S FULLY RECHARGED

787
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,505
Steady. Let's go.

788
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,428
Andre, don't come! Go away!

789
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,305
Come on, Andre!

790
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,308
LOOKS LIKE HE'S READY
TO TAKE DOWN THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE

791
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,476
Help us!

792
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,311
- Help us!
- Andre!

793
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,229
Hey! Stop Andre from getting here!

794
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,147
Go away!

795
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,608
Wow!

796
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,734
He's coming!

797
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,700
HIS SENSE OF BALANCE IS TERRIBLE

798
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,245
Thank you.

799
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,581
HE LASTED THREE SECONDS

800
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,381
WOKE UP ONLY TO FALL
INTO AN ETERNAL SLEEP RIGHT AFTER

801
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,424
REMAINING MEMBERS, SEVEN TO FIVE

802
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,592
- Left!
- Left!

803
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,344
- Right!
- Good! We're doing great!

804
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,762
Left!

805
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:50,721
Right!

806
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,680
Left!

807
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,015
Right!

808
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,185
WITH EVERYONE IN SYNC,
THE BRIDGE SHAKES FIERCELY

809
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,646
Justin! Are you going to keep this up?

810
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,314
F*** you, Justin!

811
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,109
You go to hell!

812
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,361
- Right!
- Left!

813
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,113
CLUELESS ZOMBIE FALLS INTO THE ABYSS

814
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,030
Good. Keep it up!

815
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:08,948
Left!

816
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:09,865
Right!

817
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,783
Left!

818
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:11,826
Shake it!

819
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,952
Good!

820
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,497
STRONG VIBRATIONS MAKE
THE ZOMBIES TUMBLE DOWN ONE BY ONE

821
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,791
No! We need to get revenge!

822
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,295
Dex!

823
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,964
Sung-jae! Get a grip!

824
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,424
THERE'S NO WAY TO COMMUNICATE

825
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,550
Sung-jae!

826
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,801
Are you with me?

827
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,010
Eun-bi, fall off!

828
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,637
- No!
- Eun-bi fall off!

829
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,973
Defconn!

830
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,141
Are you with me?

831
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,267
No, I'm not!

832
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,435
I'm not with you!

833
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,478
Hey! Get a grip!

834
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,398
TEN MINUTES SINCE THEY STARTED SHAKING

835
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,566
- Watch out!
- Right!

836
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,483
Hey!

837
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,401
- Left!
- Eun-bi!

838
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,360
Right!

839
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,283
THIS TRIO… THEY'VE GOT
PRETTY GOOD COORDINATION

840
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,368
Get off!

841
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,833
Get off!

842
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,043
THEIR LEGS ARE STARTING TO GIVE OUT

843
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,507
THE ZOMBIES ARE SHAKING
WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT

844
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,925
No!

845
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,471
My thighs are about to explode.

846
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,055
My thighs…

847
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,098
Hold on.

848
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,933
I've reached my limit.

849
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:23,189
THE TRIO STILL SHOW
NO SIGNS OF FATIGUE

850
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,149
- What do we do?
- Let's switch up our strategy.

851
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,859
THE GREATEST CRISIS
AT JOURNEY'S END

852
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,360
Okay. This isn't going to work.

853
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,490
Hey! Get back here.

854
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,657
No. I'm okay!

855
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,700
No! Get back!

856
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,369
Dex! Get back.

857
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,789
THE DUO WHO GOT A SECOND CHANCE
AT LIFE STEPPED UP

858
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,125
We're left with no choice, Justin.

859
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,043
Let's just go!

860
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,336
Thumbs up for Sae-ho!

861
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,129
- I'll be back!
- Fight!

862
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:56,889
No!

863
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,102
Sae-ho!

864
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,026
WHY DID HE FALL OFF?

865
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,281
Defconn!

866
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,285
That's right!

867
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,537
Sae-ho!

868
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,705
- Sae-ho!
- Sae-ho!

869
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,873
No!

870
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,753
Sae-ho!

871
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,338
Sae-ho!

872
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,219
REMAINING MEMBERS, SIX TO ONE

873
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:38,097
POOR SUNG-JAE IS LEFT ALONE

874
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,890
Remember us!

875
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,975
Sung-jae!

876
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,435
HE CAN'T CONTROL HIS EMOTIONS

877
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,312
- What's wrong?
- No!

878
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,899
Send Eun-bi away.

879
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,401
- Send her away!
- Remember us!

880
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,444
Sung-jae, I'm sorry!

881
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,905
I choose Sung-jae.

882
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,533
EUN-BI SIDED WITH SUNG-JAE
THROUGHOUT THE DAY

883
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,744
SUNG-JAE IS UNAWARE OF THIS TRUTH

884
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,167
Eun-bi!

885
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,669
- I'll go!
- Send Eun-bi!

886
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,587
No!

887
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,839
Sung-jae!

888
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,136
Yook Sung-jae!

889
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,973
- Sung-jae!
- Sung-jae!

890
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,350
DinDin!

891
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,561
DinDin!

892
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,646
DinDin!

893
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,482
Oh, no! We saved them for what?

894
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,318
DinDin!

895
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,698
PRECIOUS BLOOD WAS PROTECTED
BUT IT CAME AT A GREAT COST

896
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,408
Darn.

897
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,373
- What's that?
- Hyun-joon!

898
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,791
What? Who's that man?

899
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,169
- Give it to me.
- He's the owner.

900
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,337
What?

901
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,546
- Give it here.
- What?

902
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,089
No! Shake the bridge!

903
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,591
Give it to me!

904
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,844
Give it to me.
If you give it to me, I'll set you free.

905
00:43:58,927 --> 00:43:59,845
Hold on!

906
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,430
Don't come.

907
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,890
- I'm not going to take it.
- Wait.

908
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,058
- Get back.
- I won't take it.

909
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,185
- Back off!
- Hey.

910
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,812
I would never take it away.
Just give it to me.

911
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,023
We're throwing it away.

912
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,483
Listen, I…

913
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,776
- No.
- We'll throw it away.

914
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,820
I'll…

915
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,405
- We'll throw it.
- No!

916
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,992
No!

917
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,202
I'll set you free!

918
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,372
No! Throw it away!

919
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,873
No!

920
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,876
- Throw it! No!
- No!

921
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:31,919
Not this!

922
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,509
Hold on.

923
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,512
That's crazy.

924
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,389
He just jumped off with it.

925
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,973
Shoot.

926
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,684
- That's all we had.
- No, that crazy…

927
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,519
That's the only one we had.

928
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,913
They're here.

929
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,331
- Where?
- Everyone's here.

930
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:10,749
Defconn.

931
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,585
Defconn.

932
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,172
Sung-jae and DinDin. What do we do?

933
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,969
What's up with him?

934
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,642
This is too horrifying.

935
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:29,726
Oh, my.

936
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,644
It's all broken.

937
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:33,188
- It is?
- It's all broken.

938
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,898
Shoot.

939
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:40,320
LAST HOPE OF HUMANITY HAS BEEN SHATTERED

940
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,575
Hey. This guy got bitten here.

941
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,534
You fool!

942
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,577
He got bitten?

943
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,912
- Oh?
- He got bitten on his left arm.

944
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,373
- He got bitten but why was he okay?
- Si-young.

945
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,459
His blood is pink!

946
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,751
Hold on.

947
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,421
Like Hong-chul.

948
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,755
It's pink, right?

949
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,800
Wait, let's search him.

950
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,051
Hold on.

951
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,769
Wow. This guy had
the same thing as Hong-chul.

952
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,396
That's why he could control zombies.

953
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,689
And collected them.

954
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:20,611
IF IT'S THE SAME THING…

955
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,208
Let's go this way.

956
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,128
We have to hurry. They have
to draw the blood within 12 hours.

957
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,838
Slow down. Careful.

958
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,548
Zombie!

959
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,258
Let's just break through them.

960
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,834
ZOMBIEVERSE
NEW BLOOD
