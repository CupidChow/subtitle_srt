(The Heirs)

3
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,699
(Episode 13)

4
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,680
Are you okay?

5
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:22,819
What happened?

6
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,890
You said this in America.

7
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,659
You said you'd hold my hand and
run away with me when I'm in danger.

8
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,900
Can you also do that in Korea?

9
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,849
I see.

10
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,599
This is so ridiculous.

11
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,659
How could they completely
deceive us like this?

12
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:41,969
Did you really not know?

13
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,740
How can you ask me that?

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
You should've looked into it
before getting me engaged!

15
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,169
What did they think of us as?

16
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,009
If both of your grandfathers
find out that you're engaged...

17
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,050
with an illegitimate son,
they're going to faint.

18
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,750
Can you please be quiet?
I need to think.

19
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,750
What's there to think about?
The answer is clear.

20
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,719
Even full brothers sharpen
their swords against each other,

21
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,259
when their inheritance
is on the line.

22
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,830
But between a legitimate
and an illegitimate son?

23
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,500
Mr. Kim and Tan will 100 percent
fight against each other.

24
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,469
You should break off the engagement
only then.

25
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,639
Why should I do it then?

26
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,310
Tan and Mr. Kim will buy up stocks
as if their lives are at stake...

27
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,310
in order to defend their right
of management.

28
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,879
Then the Jeguk Group's stocks
will soar like crazy.

29
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,310
We're going to dispose our stocks
and break the engagement then.

30
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,990
Do you really have to calculate
all that even in this situation?

31
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,719
I'm going out for a moment.

32
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:42,889
Where are you going?

33
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,729
Who are you?
What on earth are you thinking?

34
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,000
Having a younger sister is more
tiring than I expected.

35
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,310
- What's the object?
- You knew it. Why did you hide it?

36
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,740
Why did you hide
such crucial information?

37
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,250
Why didn't you tell me that Kim Tan
was a son of a mistress?

38
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,750
My sister finally entered
her fiance's house.

39
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,050
Don't mess with me.

40
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,090
Kim Tan said everything himself.

41
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,860
He wants to break off
the engagement.

42
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,829
Why didn't you use this hidden card
this whole time?

43
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,629
What are you going to do now?

44
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,670
I'm going to shut your mouth.

45
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,769
- What?
- I said keep your mouth shut.

46
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,610
This is not a request.
It's a warning. Sister.

47
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,680
So...

48
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,079
you're going to keep this secret?

49
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,980
Why would you?

50
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,920
Because it's the best thing
I've ever done so far.

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Out of all the things I've done,

52
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,160
it hurt Kim Tan the most.

53
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,970
I guess Tan is one step closer
to Cha Eun Sang.

54
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,569
So all you need to do is
make up your mind.

55
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,009
Are you going to break off
the engagement or not?

56
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,910
Come on in.

57
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,579
Where is this place?

58
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,019
Go down first.

59
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,060
- What are you doing?
- It'll be over soon.

60
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,259
Whose place is this?

61
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,670
It's Myung Soo's studio.
Let's sleep here for tonight.

62
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,170
- What are you talking about?
- "I'll take care of it."

63
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,339
"I'll go to a friend's house."
"It's okay to be alone."

64
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,240
You used all those excuses
in America.

65
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:41,980
It won't work anymore.

66
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:44,920
You held onto me.

67
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,350
Hey, when did I...

68
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,949
Right, you didn't hold onto me.
You hugged me.

69
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,990
Sorry.

70
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,790
Sit down.

71
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,199
Why are you sitting there?
There's a perfectly fine sofa.

72
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,509
Where have you slept all this while?

73
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,110
Why did you cry earlier?

74
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,910
Why were you with Choi Young Do
late at night?

75
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,410
On the day you were caught by me.

76
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,480
Why did you cry?

77
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,220
Did you sleep at his family's hotel?

78
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,120
I asked why you cried!
Why are you changing the subject?

79
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,519
- Says the one who did the same.
- You should ask a proper question.

80
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,160
Because of global warming,

81
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,790
penguins are endangered.

82
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,660
- What?
- That's why I cried.

83
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,230
Isn't it so sad?

84
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,670
Can you give me a proper answer?
Stop making me worried.

85
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,899
- It's a wrong password.
- Who is coming?

86
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,610
It must be Myung Soo.

87
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,009
What do we do?

88
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,310
What do we do?
We just have to be quiet.

89
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:46,680
He can't come in anyway.

90
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,350
I changed the password.

91
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,050
Why would you change
someone else's password?

92
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,220
Hey! Who is it inside?

93
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,220
I heard your voices for a second!

94
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,519
You're definitely not
of the same sex!

95
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,060
Open the door
when I'm saying it nicely!

96
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,560
- I'll forgive you if you open it.
- I'll go open it.

97
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,930
I told you to not open it.

98
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,660
Do you want to die?

99
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,110
Gosh. How can you think of beating
a man with strength?

100
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,750
I told you. Myung Soo has left.
It's quiet.

101
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,379
I got it. Let me go now.

102
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,550
I asked who you were with at night.

103
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,850
I couldn't even sleep a wink
because I was worried.

104
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,629
Are you really not going back home?
Ms. Han will worry about you.

105
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,199
I said I'm not going.
It's scary to walk outside at night.

106
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,829
What about your school uniform?

107
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:40,870
Are you not going to go to school?

108
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,269
I can call someone to bring it
to the school in the morning.

109
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
It's vibrating.

110
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,040
What are you doing?

111
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,839
What kind of freak is calling you?

112
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,939
(Choi Young Do)

113
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,639
Look.

114
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,810
You're caught again.

115
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,949
Caught with what?
It's fine if I don't pick it up.

116
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,480
It's even more suspicious!

117
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,750
Hello.

118
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,819
Doesn't Cha Eun Sang have hands?

119
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,220
Why do you always pick up her phone?

120
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,959
Because I'm always with her.

121
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,829
Tell me why you called.

122
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,459
Although I can't guarantee
that I'll pass on your message.

123
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,870
Tell her to make her social media
account public.

124
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,529
Before I explode it.

125
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,199
That's nothing on there that's good
for you to see.

126
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,779
- Are you friends on social media?
- We're lovers.

127
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,009
Shut up.

128
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,180
I heard you let the world know
that you're illegitimate.

129
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,120
What on earth were you thinking?

130
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,649
You wouldn't be able to find out
with your brain.

131
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,360
Just go to sleep.

132
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,139
What did he say?

133
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:00,879
Hey.

134
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:02,779
Why did you take this?

135
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,779
Did you two make memories
when I was gone for a moment?

136
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,519
Look at your face.

137
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,019
You're not hating it.

138
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,720
You have the potential to have
delusional jealousy in the future.

139
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,259
I don't know who my wife will be,
but she must be lucky.

140
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,429
Let's just stop.

141
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,529
What are you doing?

142
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:21,929
What do you think?
I'm a student.

143
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,870
But then again, it's something
a guy who's 100th place wouldn't do.

144
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,039
Seriously...

145
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,809
Go to sleep first.

146
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,690
It's because I filled the wrong
bubbles on the answer sheet!

147
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,870
Can you really study when you're
in an enclosed room with me?

148
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,230
Really?

149
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,610
Sweet dreams.

150
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,210
I'm already dreaming it.

151
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,419
You're there.

152
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,419
In front of me.

153
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,779
We're late!

154
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,929
Hunger and coldness!

155
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:04,860
And finally the moment of truth!

156
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,929
Did you stay here all night?

157
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,799
I couldn't go because I didn't want
to feel like losing!

158
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,970
I got you!

159
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,009
It's cramped.

160
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,649
When I'm telling you nicely,
get rid of the photos.

161
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,289
You may not know,

162
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,789
but I used to hurt people
with just a spoon.

163
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,159
Violence will only make
this situation worse!

164
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:37,600
But are you two really dating?

165
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,629
- Yes.
- Hey!

166
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,230
Conflicting statements.

167
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,669
You hugged me last night!
Why are you lying?

168
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,370
- That's...
- What did you just say?

169
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,269
What did you do in my studio
last night?

170
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,840
You hugged and then what?

171
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Guess.

172
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,519
What?

173
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,990
Does it feel different
to go to school together...

174
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,490
now that we spent
the night together?

175
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:40,659
Wife?

176
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,870
Why don't you gather up
some courage?

177
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,450
I'm sorry I did it too late.

178
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,450
That's more like it.

179
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,659
Let's go.

180
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,200
- Are they really...
- They're dating.

181
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,039
- What about Rachael?
- Did she not know?

182
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,580
- It's big news.
- Cha Eun Sang and...

183
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,710
Unbelievable.

184
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,340
School is a sacred place
for knowledge and refinement.

185
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,809
What in the world are you doing?

186
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,350
Go to the broadcast room first.

187
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,279
I can't ignore him
when he acts like that.

188
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,220
You saw it many times, right?

189
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,590
Cha Eun Sang.

190
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,159
Pick up your phone by yourself,
from now on, will you?

191
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,190
Go straight.

192
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,399
No fist fights. Both of you.

193
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,139
Don't call Cha Eun Sang from now on.

194
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,649
It looks like you're going to block
all phone signals...

195
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:18,919
within the entire Seoul
just to block my call.

196
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,019
You're lucky that we don't have
a telecommunications company...

197
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,389
among our affiliates.

198
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,990
Move away.

199
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,860
About what you revealed
to the public yesterday.

200
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,289
How could you reveal
that with your own mouth?

201
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,299
I've been waiting for that moment
for so long.

202
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,529
It's not late yet.

203
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,570
It might've ruined your expectation
a little,

204
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,870
but it seems like people don't
know about it yet. So reveal it.

205
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,100
That's my plan anyway.

206
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,809
Like you said, it ruined
my expectations,

207
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,039
so I'm thinking
about upping the scale,

208
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,179
making it more fun and dramatic.

209
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:50,110
Good. It's nice to see you
doing your best.

210
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,450
It must've been hard to clean up the
mess already. Sorry I'm in it now.

211
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,490
I'm not cleaning the mess.
I'll gladly take it.

212
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,259
The me you used to know
and the me now are a bit different.

213
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,799
So don't act like we're friendly,
like you know me.

214
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,420
Go on. I have something to show you,
but I can't now.

215
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,589
And here he is. Right away.

216
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,559
Come out. You can't talk to her
from now on.

217
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,589
Let's go out and talk...

218
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,529
Right. Like this.

219
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,299
Do it to me like this from now on.
Don't bother Cha Eun Sang.

220
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,039
Shut up.
You're just an illegitimate son.

221
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,180
Why are you surprised?

222
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,980
By his secret?
Or by me slapping him in his face?

223
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,450
By your attitude.

224
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,920
How is it so easy for you guys
to say such things?

225
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,220
In our world,
your blood can give you the crown.

226
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,289
It's a topic too heavy
for an Upstart to discuss, right?

227
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,230
This is the difference
between me and that low life.

228
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,130
But how dare you break off
the engagement with me?

229
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:15,430
It has to be me.

230
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:18,339
The secret of your birth
makes me even a better partner!

231
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:20,299
You're supposed to
hang onto me and beg!

232
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,339
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,710
But you're still not the one for me.

234
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,849
Why? Are you going to follow her?

235
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,789
Yes. Bye.

236
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,119
About your biological mother.

237
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,660
I can't understand no matter
how much I think about it.

238
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,200
Why did she show up at the parent
meeting as Cha Eun Sang's mother?

239
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,900
She paid for the camping,
flaunting her money.

240
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,900
As if she can't miss a chance
to prove that she's an upstart.

241
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,740
Why would she do that?
Isn't it too strange?

242
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,109
Don't stick your nose
in my mother's,

243
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,710
Cha Eun Sang's, and my business.

244
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,900
Cha Eun Sang. Are you crying?

245
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,470
If you don't answer me,
I'm just going to go in.

246
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,910
Cha Eun Sang is inside.
Go upstairs.

247
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,410
- You heard me.
- Let's go.

248
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,920
What are you doing
in front of the ladies' room?

249
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,380
Cha Eun Sang is inside. You should
especially go to the third floor.

250
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,190
Hey, I'm Cha Eun Sang's savior.

251
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,250
I let her sleep at my home
for two nights.

252
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,759
Did she sleep at your place?

253
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,519
- Yes! Why?
- Raise your hand.

254
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,630
- My hand?
- Well done.

255
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,130
Hey! Why did you touch me?

256
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,329
Chan Young!

257
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,630
You're driving me crazy!

258
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,539
This is a women's bathroom!

259
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:01,710
Now you said that, can you use
the men's bathroom from now on?

260
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,910
Seriously...

261
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,339
It's not because of you, stupid.

262
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,680
Why do you keep crying?

263
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,549
I don't know about your world
filled with companies and stocks.

264
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,349
But is there really no way...

265
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,549
I can protect you?

266
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,559
You hurt me by saying I should just
protect myself before.

267
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,259
But now you want to protect me?

268
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,430
Yes. Why? What are you
going to do about it?

269
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:37,839
("A Lone Room")

270
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,980
Someone said spending time
on things that don't pay a wage...

271
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:50,019
is a waste. But she went around
school, holding hands with a guy.

272
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,319
- Stop it.
- Hey, Cha Eun Sang.

273
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,960
What are you whispering about
with my boyfriend? Stop what?

274
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,299
I was threatened by your boyfriend
just now.

275
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,730
Just wait until later.

276
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,099
What? Did you threaten her?

277
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,170
Yes. Let's take a huge sum
of share, okay?

278
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,940
I'm going to the teachers' room.
Go ahead and have lunch.

279
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,609
What was that? It's annoying.

280
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:13,140
Cha Eun Sang is amazing.

281
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,609
Even onto Yoon Chan Young now?
You should just break up with him.

282
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,250
What are you talking about?
Why would I break up with him?

283
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,619
I'm saying this for your sake.

284
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,349
Honestly, what does he have?

285
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:21,789
He's just a son
of a chief secretary.

286
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,349
What did you just say?

287
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,549
It's true though.

288
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:28,230
- You're too good for him.
- Kang Ye Sol. How can you say that?

289
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,859
I never thought I was too good
for him. Apologize right now.

290
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:32,400
I'm just saying you should keep
an eye on them before it's too late.

291
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
Don't cry after
Cha Eun Sang takes your man.

292
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,369
Someone's engagement broke off.

293
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,769
Is that "someone" me?

294
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Who said that?

295
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,210
Who said my engagement
was broken off?

296
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,450
I saw Kim Tan and Cha Eun Sang
holding their hands.

297
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,819
Didn't your engagement break off?

298
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,619
Kim Tan went to another girl...

299
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:57,190
because your family is messed-up.
That's what everyone says.

300
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,089
How is my family messed-up?

301
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:00,890
When your mother divorced your
biological father,

302
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,329
your mother took
half of the company.

303
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,730
Is her next target
Young Do's father?

304
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,900
That's what you call
a messed-up family.

305
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,099
I was just going to let it slide,

306
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,240
but what do you think I'll do to you
if you keep messing with me?

307
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,500
Messing with you?

308
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,210
I was just asking
because I was curious.

309
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,170
Should I ask you
what I'm curious about too?

310
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,049
Why did you hide that your mother
was working in an escort bar?

311
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,150
What? Is that true?

312
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,680
- An escort bar?
- An escort bar?

313
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,690
- Really?
- It's crazy.

314
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,819
Bo Na asked you if it's true.

315
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,829
Answer her.

316
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:37,329
Hey, Kang Ye Sol. You're ridiculous.

317
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:39,700
And you called him
just a chief secretary's son?

318
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Lee Bo Na.

319
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,869
Do you want to eat lunch with me?

320
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,799
What?

321
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,980
What's going on?
Why is everyone acting like that?

322
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,279
Well, Lee Bo Na and Yoo Rachel
are trying to make...

323
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,519
Kang Ye Sol sit in the seat for
students on the welfare scholarship.

324
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,500
What are you doing? Sit.

325
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,369
Didn't you hear me?

326
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,269
What's going on?
What about Kang Ye Sol?

327
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:21,170
She's been hiding the fact that her
mother was working in an escort bar.

328
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,609
That's insane.

329
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,049
It's too early to cry.

330
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,190
Why won't you sit down?
That's your seat.

331
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,759
Lee Bo Na.

332
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,589
What are you doing now?

333
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,890
There's a reason.
Kang Ye Sol said...

334
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,329
Just go play soccer.

335
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,759
Stay out of our business.

336
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:53,700
I'm hungry.

337
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:55,640
This looks so good.

338
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,109
I'm sorry but can you move?

339
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:02,849
Thanks.

340
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,819
Hey, Kim Tan. What are you doing?

341
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:16,059
What? I'm eating.

342
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,200
Why aren't you eating? If you're not
going to eat it, I'm eating it.

343
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,529
Don't you know
what kind of seat that is?

344
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:23,569
This seat?

345
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,539
Right. Isn't it the closest seat
to the food?

346
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,730
- What are you doing?
- Do I have to repeat myself?

347
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,430
I'm eating!
Let me just eat the food.

348
00:24:57,869 --> 00:24:59,140
You're breaking the rule.

349
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,039
It's the rule I made.
So I can break it.

350
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,450
It's you who made it. But it's me
who've kept it going.

351
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,150
It's not polite to do this
without my permission.

352
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,779
You can't break the rule.

353
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,950
Let me tell you why.

354
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,890
That seat is this kind of seat.

355
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,349
Up until yesterday,
it was that kind of seat.

356
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,119
But starting today,
it can be this kind of seat.

357
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:56,490
I'm sorry, Cha Eun Sang.

358
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:01,529
Follow me.

359
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:20,880
Lee Bo Na, come on.

360
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:36,829
Stop right there.

361
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,710
What's wrong with you two?

362
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:42,940
Do you feel good after doing that?

363
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,440
I'm not the one who started it.

364
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,009
- Choi Young Do was the one who...
- He's always like that.

365
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,710
Because you keep
reacting strongly...

366
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,809
Am I supposed to hold it in then?

367
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,819
How can I
when he's acting like that?

368
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:54,549
Smell this.
It still smells like curry.

369
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,190
Choi Young Do
is like an elementary kid.

370
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,559
I thought you were at least
a middle school kid.

371
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,759
What?

372
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,329
Lee Bo Na. What was that?

373
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,059
What on earth did you do?

374
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,599
I'm not the only one who did wrong.

375
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,200
I'm not the first one
who did bad.

376
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,799
Who started it isn't important here!

377
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,130
Kang Ye Sol said to me first...

378
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,670
that I was too good
for a son of a chief secretary.

379
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,039
But still, you shouldn't have
acted like her.

380
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,470
What's wrong with Ye Sol's word?

381
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,809
If you were mad at that,
I guess you felt embarrassed.

382
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,809
How did you date me if I was
embarrassing the whole time?

383
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,150
That's not what I mean!

384
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,319
Haven't you thought that
I'd be disappointed by your actions?

385
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,750
Are you that childish?

386
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,289
How did you date me if I was so
disappointing to you the whole time?

387
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:32,390
Why do I have to be a disappointment
to you because of those stupid kids?

388
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,059
Your words are so nice.

389
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,960
Go. I don't want to see you.
Get out of my sight!

390
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:50,140
- I'm back.
- You don't have to be back now.

391
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,779
Yesterday, you lost your right
to live under my roof.

392
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,210
Get out of my house.

393
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,450
Are you really going to do this?

394
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,349
Even if Tan leaves,
things won't change.

395
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,789
It was an insurance for him
to live his life with ease.

396
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,589
If he doesn't like it, I have
no reason to stop him.

397
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,960
Your wallet, cell phone, coat,
put everything down.

398
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,599
- Chairman!
- He doesn't want my money.

399
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,869
You can't leave
with what I bought for you.

400
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,670
You try living with regret.

401
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,720
Let me have my school uniform
and shoes.

402
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,619
I'll pay you back later.

403
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,990
Fine. You should go to school
at least.

404
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,930
I know that Rachel was
an insurance for my life.

405
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,960
But...

406
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,200
Insurance can't be my life.

407
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,730
Thank you,

408
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,970
for everything.

409
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,339
Why are you doing this?
Where would you go?

410
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,880
If you act like this,
what am I to do?

411
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,380
I'm not leaving.
I'm getting kicked out.

412
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,849
It's because he's angry.

413
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,720
What parent wouldn't be angry
if such a thing happened to them?

414
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,089
I'm asking you for the last time.

415
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,819
Are you really going to let
our Tan leave?

416
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,970
Why? What happened?

417
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:27,569
What's with your clothes?
Aren't you cold?

418
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,170
- Do you have some money?
- What money?

419
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,440
I was kicked out like this.
Can you pay for my taxi fee?

420
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,079
You were kicked out? Seriously?

421
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,710
The taxi fee first.
I'll pay you back.

422
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,509
You were kicked out without a penny,
and still took a taxi?

423
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,980
Seriously!

424
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,279
It hurts!
I said I would pay you back!

425
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,319
You really left
just because he told you to?

426
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,630
- Then what was I supposed to do?
- When parents tell you to leave,

427
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,529
they mean they're going to forgive
you if you beg. Don't you know?

428
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:53,559
I can only beg when I did wrong.

429
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,099
Let me have a drink first.
I'll pay you back later.

430
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,799
Water is free. Drink water.

431
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,170
What are you going to do now?

432
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,869
You got your wallet and credit cards
taken away.

433
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:05,309
A week or two would be okay.
But what about after that?

434
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,279
I will succeed on my own.

435
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,180
- How?
- I'm going to study hard...

436
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,849
and succeed.

437
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,089
- Just go on a talent show.
- I can't sing.

438
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:18,349
And can you study?

439
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,359
Hey!

440
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,269
Give me your phone. You have
Hyo Shin's number, right?

441
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,769
What about Hyo Shin?

442
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:33,940
I need to borrow money.

443
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:36,240
How can you think
of borrowing money first?

444
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,269
With what for security? Your kidney?

445
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,609
Do you know
Jo Myung Soo's number too?

446
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,039
You must know Yoon Chan Young's.
What about Bo Na's?

447
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,609
- What about Choi Young Do's?
- Seriously?

448
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,410
Call him quickly!

449
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,279
I'll pay you back for using
your phone later.

450
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,619
Thank you for spending
your free time with me.

451
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,430
I'll cut to the chase.

452
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,960
Who can let me sleepover tonight?

453
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,170
Then can anyone give me
a ride from tomorrow?

454
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:11,269
Then can anyone buy me meals
from now on?

455
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,819
Where is Bo Na, by the way?

456
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,220
Are you guys really
going to do this?

457
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,220
You too?

458
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:37,900
Lee Bo Na.

459
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,569
I'll leave. You stay.

460
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,509
I'll get going first.

461
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,079
Did you guys fight?

462
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:48,009
Hey! I was kicked out!

463
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:49,680
Can you focus on me please?

464
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,849
What kind of trouble did you cause
to be kicked out like this?

465
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:56,250
I can't tell you the whole story.

466
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,589
Angry father, crying mother,

467
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:00,920
and I was slapped in the face.
It can be summarized like this.

468
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,130
Did you really get slapped?

469
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,529
I don't know what it is,
but I guess it's big trouble.

470
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,200
Where are you going to sleep
tonight? Do you want to come over?

471
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,970
It's a familiar suggestion,

472
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,829
but your mom is scary.
I'm not going.

473
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:12,470
She is scary indeed.

474
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,339
It's my first time to be jealous
of someone who ran away from home.

475
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,759
When A is less than zero, and B
is a natural number,

476
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,119
where are you?

477
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,240
It's a wrong answer.

478
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,319
Wear this for tomorrow's interview.

479
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,049
I'll pick the shoes
for you tomorrow morning.

480
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,089
What interview?

481
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:05,019
The early-action university
interview you missed last time.

482
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,990
- I arranged it again.
- You arranged the interview...

483
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,559
again?

484
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Is that possible?

485
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,500
It was quite hard.

486
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:17,470
This is a doctor's note.

487
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,970
Just in case you need it,
read it before you go.

488
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,970
Are you telling me, the son
of the Attorney General...

489
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,440
to get accepted to university
illegally now?

490
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,150
You are really doing...

491
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,049
what I can't even imagine
as if it's nothing.

492
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,789
How can you do this?

493
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,759
How far are you going to go?

494
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,099
Will you stop if I die?

495
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,099
Do you still believe...

496
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,710
that threatening me
with your life will work?

497
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:02,150
I will never let you give up
on yourself.

498
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,009
I'm confident.

499
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,940
Bo Na, it's me.
If you're with Tan...

500
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,880
Sorry. I'll get back to you later.

501
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,050
Hello.

502
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,780
This is where you work?

503
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,389
- Yes.
- And you sleep here too?

504
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,889
The staff room is quite nice.

505
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:48,960
The staff room?

506
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,329
You're really something else.

507
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,659
Even if I told you to leave, how can
you really leave like this?

508
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,900
It's getting colder every day,

509
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,369
and I know you have nowhere to go.

510
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,800
Don't you think I'd be embarrassed
to see your mother?

511
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,070
Are you trying to see if I could
sleep comfortably,

512
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,780
and eat the food your mother
cooked well,

513
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,309
after kicking you out?

514
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,250
You look gaunt in just a few days.

515
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,750
You know Tan left home, right?

516
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,730
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind.

517
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,730
It's my fault, not yours this time.

518
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,130
Anyway, where is my Tan?

519
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:29,170
Did he come to see you?

520
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,869
He did, didn't he?

521
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,070
I'm so worried about him
because he left his phone at home.

522
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,170
Why aren't you answering me?

523
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Did he come here or not?

524
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,980
He came. Why?

525
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,280
I knew it.

526
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,119
I knew I would see you here,
you brat!

527
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:47,320
Let's just talk.

528
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:50,320
Why do all the women I like
use their fist first?

529
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,119
Let me go!

530
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,760
I came here to drag you home!

531
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,929
Let's go home.

532
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,559
Let's go and ask
for forgiveness, okay?

533
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,130
I got kicked out. Why would I go?

534
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,769
- I'm not going back.
- If not,

535
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,699
are you going to live together
or something?

536
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,139
- If he knows about this...
- He must know about it already.

537
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:12,039
I heard he placed someone
on my tail.

538
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,780
What?

539
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,510
How far is this going to go?

540
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,250
Get in the car first.
Get in and talk.

541
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,219
Are you going to stay still?

542
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,750
Aren't you going to take my side?

543
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,730
I'll go, Ms. Han. I'll go home.

544
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,059
- Will you?
- Hey, how can you go back?

545
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:34,099
I left.

546
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:35,670
That's exactly why I should go back.

547
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,400
You should come back too.

548
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,670
She's indeed a smart kid.

549
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,269
She's my hostage from now on.
Get in the car quickly.

550
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,840
Seriously... I said I won't!

551
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,909
But Mom, didn't you bring my phone?
What about my clothes?

552
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:55,179
Mom, I walked around like this.

553
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,719
Why don't you just freeze to death?

554
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,219
You're saying what you don't mean.

555
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,090
Please take good care
of my girlfriend, Mom.

556
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,659
Bye.

557
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,289
That brat!

558
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,559
Take your phone! Your clothes too!

559
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,400
You two look good together.

560
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,039
I'll call you.

561
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,769
How can he ask me
to take care of you?

562
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,079
How can he trust me?

563
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,420
How did you come home
with Ms. Han?

564
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:32,050
She came to get me.

565
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,489
In person?

566
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,260
Why? Were you scolded?

567
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,000
No. We need to pack for moving.

568
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,760
And I missed you so much.

569
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,429
That's why I'm back.

570
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,670
Well done.

571
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:47,869
How is the Chairman doing?

572
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,769
Did he yell at you?

573
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,039
After kicking out his younger son,

574
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,909
he stays in his study all day.

575
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,880
Wait a minute.
Let me bring you some food.

576
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,219
Okay.

577
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,159
Can you...

578
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,159
Just for one night.

579
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,920
I was slapped by Father.

580
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,630
I heard.

581
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,829
He said nothing when you left.

582
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,300
How could he kick me out
without giving me a penny?

583
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:54,539
Is it because
I'm an illegitimate son?

584
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,309
I was a little sad.

585
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,719
- Hello.
- Can we talk?

586
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,889
Please go ahead.

587
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:16,889
Out of Jeguk Holding's shares,

588
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:19,099
the shares that would have
the biggest impact on you...

589
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,730
when the Chairman hands
them over to Tan...

590
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,769
are held by Ms. Jung Ji Sook.

591
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:26,900
Almost five percent of shares
will be handed over.

592
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,809
That's based on
the assumption of when...

593
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:34,780
the stocks owned under borrowed
names will be handed to Tan.

594
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,010
- Yes.
- Okay. I'll get back to you later.

595
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:43,820
- Was it about me?
- Did you not get it?

596
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,349
Or are you acting like you didn't?

597
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,869
I can't sleep in the same room
with you. Go get another room.

598
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:04,610
What are you talking about?

599
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,610
I'm sorry, but you can't check-in.

600
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,380
We're put in a very difficult
position too.

601
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,150
We were told not to let a person
who looks like this check-in.

602
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:16,550
(Kim Tan)

603
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,289
Do I look like this?

604
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:21,320
What did you think
you looked like then?

605
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:27,230
Isn't it a good drawing? I saw you
taking an elevator earlier.

606
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,000
I see your hotel
has no set of rules.

607
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,400
Why did you do this?

608
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,039
First, because you're Kim Tan.

609
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,940
Second, because you're Kim Tan.

610
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,670
Third, because you're Kim Tan.

611
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,510
Fourth, because you towed away
my motorcycle.

612
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,550
Fifth,

613
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,409
because Kim Tan broke
the rule first.

614
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,250
- Is this fun to you?
- It is for me.

615
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,150
But you have to go back
to your brother. How about that?

616
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,119
As expected,
hardships and struggles...

617
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,090
bring the family closer, I guess.

618
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,190
I hate to say this,
but I'm thankful for you tonight.

619
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,000
You helped me.

620
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:20,880
Won, are you sleeping?

621
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:27,420
Are you really sleeping?

622
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,869
I have so many questions for you.

623
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,809
And I have so many things
to say to you.

624
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,949
But you went to bed too early.

625
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:19,409
Thank you for the ride.

626
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:20,780
Get out.

627
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,079
Okay.

628
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,280
Won. Well...

629
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,719
Would it be hard for you
to come after work?

630
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:33,889
Have a safe ride.

631
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,900
Bye.

632
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:12,489
I heard you discriminate
each other based on money.

633
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,530
So I'm going to discriminate
you based on your grades.

634
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,739
There are only two types
of students to me.

635
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,679
The ones with good grades,

636
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,510
and the ones with bad grades.

637
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,519
The one next to the window
with raised eyebrows.

638
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,550
Put away your phone
and lower your eyebrows.

639
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,420
Who has the best grades here?

640
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,590
- He has.
- Your name?

641
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm Yoon Chan Young.

642
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:49,500
Now I have two types of students
in this class.

643
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,300
Yoon Chan Young...

644
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,269
and the rest.

645
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,070
Open your textbook.

646
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,780
It seems Mr. Yoon
found out about it.

647
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:04,380
I see. It seemed like it.
That's why I called him out.

648
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:17,090
I'll get going.

649
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Sit down.

650
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,340
You know who it is, right?

651
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,710
Yes.

652
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,079
I forgot to ask if my face was in...

653
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,639
any of the pictures too.

654
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,050
There is of course.

655
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,079
Stop with your dating.

656
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,420
What importance do first loves have?

657
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,059
First, the stocks that are going
to be handed to Tan...

658
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,789
Stop the process
of handing them to him.

659
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:57,469
CEO Lee from RS International
will soon buy up our stocks.

660
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,969
There's a great possibility that she
will approach the stockholders...

661
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:03,269
on our side, trying to buy stocks
over the counter.

662
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,309
If you think someone is
going to sell, go to them first,

663
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,510
and make sure to get the stocks
back even if you have to pay more.

664
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,880
I understand.

665
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,619
You should meet CEO Lee
and see if there's a possibility...

666
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:14,650
to change her mind.

667
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:16,219
I'll be seeing her soon.

668
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:19,690
Every time I meet her, I notice
that she's not an ordinary fox.

669
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:23,630
And...was it Cha Eun Sang?

670
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,730
About that girl...

671
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,530
Prepare to send her abroad to study.

672
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,300
Sending her to Jeguk High School
didn't work.

673
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:34,699
I...

674
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,610
forgot to put "youth" as a variable
in my equation.

675
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,590
You look handsome today.

676
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,989
I always do.

677
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,159
You were late this morning.

678
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,690
I slept in. I had a deep sleep
after a long time.

679
00:45:58,789 --> 00:45:59,960
That's ridiculous.

680
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:02,059
I guess you could sleep well
in the house without me.

681
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,199
How was it with your brother?

682
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,940
We slept in the same room,

683
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,639
talked about little things,

684
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,170
and had a great meal.

685
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,309
Sounds like you're lying.

686
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,840
You're not falling for it.

687
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,480
Don't be like that
and just come back home.

688
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:17,550
Can't you defy your father
at home at least?

689
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,949
Did Mom ask you to do this?

690
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,480
How's Mom doing? Did she drink wine
last night as well?

691
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,349
And you're now the one
who is making me a spy.

692
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,460
- Do you want to have some?
- Yes.

693
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,099
Do you want to die?
Don't act like you're hurt.

694
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:43,170
I didn't say I wanted
to have that one!

695
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,610
You don't miss a chance.

696
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,739
I thought about this last night.

697
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,510
I think we're too slow.

698
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:53,219
What do you mean we're slow?
We just didn't hold hands,

699
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:54,219
but on the rooftop, we...

700
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,789
Is it okay to talk about it now?

701
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,429
I, I mean everything has to happen
in order!

702
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:07,130
Where are you going?
Your face is so red now.

703
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,929
To the broadcast room. Why?

704
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,699
We take turns taking care
of the room.

705
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,199
Hyo Shin said he can't
come to school today.

706
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,599
Lee Hyo Shin didn't come
to school today?

707
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,510
I heard you had fainted in front of
the building before the interview.

708
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,079
Did I?

709
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,980
Why did you apply to our school,
Mr. Lee Hyo Shin?

710
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,250
I never applied.

711
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,849
How did you decide your career path?

712
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,389
Mr. Lee Hyo Shin? Your answers...

713
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,320
are inappropriate for the questions,
don't you think?

714
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,360
Mr. Lee Hyo Shin.

715
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,239
(Hyo Shin)

716
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:59,079
(Mother)

717
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,190
I'm sorry I hurt you.

718
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,460
Sorry?

719
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,559
Do you think being sorry is enough?

720
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:11,760
I heard you had been slapped
by your father,

721
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,630
so I tried to hold it in.

722
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:16,630
But as time goes by, it's
getting more difficult to do that!

723
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,000
How dare you toy with me?

724
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,070
How dare you toy with your father?

725
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,269
I and your father raised you...

726
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,539
for 18 years as our
legitimate son, deceiving the world.

727
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,409
Do you think we tried our best
with all our abilities...

728
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,480
just to hide the secret
of your birth?

729
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,480
Your father had to fight his
brothers to win his position now.

730
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,750
Do you think that war was easy?

731
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:39,960
Your uncles
and even their children...

732
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,719
are still in the middle of lawsuits
with your father.

733
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:44,929
If they find out that you're
his illegitimate son,

734
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,599
do you think they will stand still?

735
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,530
They will come at us and bite us,
trying to get what they want!

736
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,599
It's another war then!

737
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:53,039
You're just a high school student,

738
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,239
and it's been only three years since
your brother became CEO.

739
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,809
Now it will be a war for you
and your brother to fight.

740
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:01,239
What are you even going to do?

741
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,900
What are you doing here?
You don't take the golf class.

742
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:24,670
I was looking for a place Eun Sang
would never go to and it's here.

743
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,769
Why are you avoiding her?

744
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:28,840
I don't want to show her this face.

745
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,610
And what kind of face is this?

746
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,110
A face of the person who is counting
the number of hurdles ahead of him.

747
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,679
What does that mean?

748
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:46,150
(Orders are closed.)

749
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,530
In 5 minutes, we have a reservation
for the entire cafe for 2 hours.

750
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,829
Don't accept other orders.

751
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,960
What is it for? A birthday party?

752
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,429
It must be some kind
of a surprising event.

753
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:00,900
I'll get going. You must be happy.

754
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:02,739
Sorry?

755
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:18,650
If you want to come, come after
two hours. We have a reservation.

756
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,920
- I know.
- I mean I can't accept your order.

757
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,090
The cafe should be vacant
for the reservation.

758
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,789
I was the one
who reserved it though.

759
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,630
Is it you who rented this place?

760
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,929
Yes.

761
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:38,409
But why?

762
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:42,039
Because you wouldn't
pick up my calls,

763
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,909
wouldn't go eat
janchi guksu with me,

764
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:46,780
and run away when you see me.

765
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:49,989
Once again, I spent money
just to see you.

766
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,050
That's why you rented this place?
For two hours?

767
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,420
Are you not taking my order?

768
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,590
I guess you spoiled kids
never ordered coffee before.

769
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:58,860
Follow me.

770
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,329
Two cups of whatever it's easy
for you to make.

771
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,829
Don't spit in it.

772
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:40,070
I feel like you're doing the work
you don't have to.

773
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,539
Sit for a moment and rest.

774
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:47,139
At this rate, you're going to become
a real upstart.

775
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,420
Listen to me, will you?

776
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,460
Hey!

777
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,170
If you don't sit,
I'll spill the rest too.

778
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,250
It would've been nice if you sat
right from the start.

779
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,449
You always make me do this.

780
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:28,179
What on earth do you want from me?

781
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,500
Answering your phone by yourself.

782
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,099
Answering back
when I'm talking to you.

783
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,440
Greeting...

784
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,380
when our eyes meet.

785
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:04,820
Now I know.

786
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,889
Now that I know that you like me,

787
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,190
I understand why
you pretended to not know...

788
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,829
about my secret
when you clearly knew everything.

789
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:14,130
I'm sorry I always avoided you.

790
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,230
There's only one thing
I can do now then.

791
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:24,570
I can't accept your feelings.

792
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,510
I'm sorry.

793
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,260
I really have been dumped.

794
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,860
Can I take revenge?

795
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,170
I'd hope you wouldn't,

796
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,070
but if that's your worth, go ahead.

797
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:56,139
It's the price of rejecting you,
so I'll take it.

798
00:53:57,309 --> 00:53:58,869
I can't bully you anymore.

799
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:01,809
Because it will hurt.

800
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,010
So I'm going to bother
everyone but you.

801
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:08,349
- Choi Young Do.
- Make sure to rest...

802
00:54:08,349 --> 00:54:09,420
for the remaining 20 minutes.

803
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,079
There's only one thing
I can do now then.

804
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,019
I can't accept your feelings.

805
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:47,860
I'm sorry.

806
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:07,840
(Kim Tan)

807
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,409
Mic test. 1, 2, 3.

808
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,780
Dear students at Jeguk High School,

809
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,449
this is Choi Young Do.

810
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,420
To everyone who's tired
from studying,

811
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,159
I'm going to tell you
an interesting story.

812
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,030
The main character of this story...

813
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,929
is the great Jeguk Group's
second son, Kim Tan.

814
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:33,570
I'm feeling mixed emotions...

815
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:35,869
now that I'm finally
telling this story,

816
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,909
I took a long detour
to be able to tell this story.

817
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,880
That's why I'm very nervous now.

818
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,650
The Kim Tan that you know
is actually...

819
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,889
and ridiculously...

820
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:55,760
Seriously.

821
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:02,800
The truth...

822
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,340
is going to be revealed
in 60 seconds.

823
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:09,199
Right.

824
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,239
This proverb comes to my mind.

825
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:14,880
Your enemy...

826
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,849
is not the one who is holding
a knife against you,

827
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,250
but the ones who are hiding a knife
behind their back,

828
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,590
standing beside you.

829
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,360
It's exactly the same feeling
I have for Kim Tan.

830
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:33,389
Right.

831
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:37,130
Most of you wouldn't understand
because you don't know anything.

832
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,769
As I speak, here she comes.

833
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:45,940
The person I've been waiting for.

834
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:49,440
Choi Young Do. Is the broadcast
room your playground?

835
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,179
This is worthy
of a disciplinary action.

836
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:52,849
I don't care.

837
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,420
You always fall for the trap
when it's about Kim Tan.

838
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:00,889
Is the purpose of your relationship
to become each other's weakness?

839
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:01,989
Be quiet.

840
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,760
Get out.

841
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:13,230
Let go of me! Is this the revenge
you were talking about?

842
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,199
- Let go.
- I'm not.

843
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,769
I will have to do it soon anyway,
so I'm not letting you go now.

844
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,880
I'm doing all this
just for this brief moment.

845
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,980
So you endure this.

846
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,449
Please stop, Young Do.

847
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,389
Don't call me like that.

848
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,780
Open the door.

849
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,780
Before I kill you, open it!

850
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,519
Open the door, Choi Young Do.

851
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:07,989
Open it.

852
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:10,190
You're going to die in my hands
if I open the door myself.

853
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,590
Open it!

854
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,630
When I said I was going to bother
everyone but you,

855
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:19,500
it included Kim Tan,

856
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,739
and myself, of course.

857
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:53,429
Go inside your room. Don't come out.

858
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,469
Rachel is here.

859
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:57,210
During the parent meeting,
why did you come as Eun Sang's mom?

860
00:58:57,309 --> 00:58:58,510
A change of positions
all of a sudden?

861
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,039
You started a war.

862
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:03,079
Make your mind. Should I put your
name on the last line of the list?

863
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:05,550
Cha Eun Sang and you fell
into water. What would you do?

864
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:08,050
Then I should save her
and let her live without me.

865
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,250
- Welcome to Yoon Chan Young...
- And Lee Bo Na's...

866
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,920
getting-back-together party.

867
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,489
Catering service is here.

868
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,059
I ordered it. It seemed like
we didn't have enough drinks here.

869
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:16,360
Am I nothing to you?

870
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,289
Because you're already having
a hard time with your own problems.

871
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,599
I've been having a hard time
ever since I was born.

872
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:22,099
Should we just run away?

873
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,599
Do you want to go to the States
with me?

874
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:31,010
(The Heirs)
