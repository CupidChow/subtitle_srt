00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,610
(The Heirs)

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,329
(The Heirs)

3
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,429
(Episode 6)

4
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,769
I missed you, buddy.

5
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,070
- Welcome.
- Relax.

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,810
I won't do anything right now.

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,880
Let's only say hi.

8
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:38,909
They'll be scared.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,049
Chan Young. Where are you?
I'm at school...

10
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,310
What a nice gift set.

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,180
Why are you not wearing the uniform?

12
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,390
Follow me.

13
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,170
- It's so annoying.
- I know.

14
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,079
Is the touching reunion over?

15
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,310
Let's...

16
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,920
Brothers are still talking, sister.

17
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,790
How can we end it
without a hug and tears?

18
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,250
Let me go.

19
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,659
I don't need a hug.

20
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,890
But tell me if you need tears.

21
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,730
I can make you cry.

22
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,930
See? It's getting fun already.

23
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,569
I'll be so excited to come to school
every morning.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,370
If you're worried about that,
consider transferring.

25
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,509
I can't do that. My mother is
the Chief Director.

26
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,280
Oh, so it's Mom and Mother?

27
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,780
Did I go too far for the first day?

28
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,919
I'm just very glad to see you.

29
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,419
I'll see you around.

30
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Bye.

31
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,199
Wait up, Young Do.

32
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,699
We need to talk.

33
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,979
Is he the famous Kim Tan?

34
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:03,120
I heard he was more evil than
Choi Young Do, but he's so hot.

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,689
That's why he's an evil.
He bullies kids with that face.

36
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,930
- How do you know him?
- My first love. A jerk.

37
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,960
Really?

38
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,699
You dated Kim Tan?

39
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,430
I can't believe it all happens
at once.

40
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,669
I should thank Myung Soo.

41
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,069
If he didn't spread the word
that you're in Korea,

42
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,310
I would've looked at you
like an idiot.

43
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,909
I'm your fiancee after all.

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,610
Thank him big time.

45
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,419
Does that witch transferring
to this school...

46
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,919
have something to do with you?

47
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,280
I can't say it doesn't.

48
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:36,020
My mother probably signed
the transfer document.

49
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,060
I'm asking if you wanted it
even for a bit.

50
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,659
Since when did our families care
about what we want?

51
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,129
Even my engagement was
against my will.

52
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,900
Cha Eun Sang's transfer...

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,300
has nothing to do with me.

54
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,599
Okay.

55
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,340
Then let's talk about us now.

56
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,770
We did until now.

57
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,610
If you called, I would've come
to school with you.

58
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,449
You're the one who
should've called me.

59
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,689
Why didn't you tell me
that Kim Tan's Jeguk Group's son?

60
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,620
You found out in the end.

61
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,189
You should've told me.

62
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:14,889
If I did, would you have moved out?

63
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,329
This is why I didn't tell you.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Compared to what
you have to face now,

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,040
who he is didn't seem
that important.

66
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,170
Instead,

67
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,910
I'll tell you about important things
you have to face now.

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,779
Why do you sound so grim?
You're scaring me.

69
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:36,810
Listen carefully.

70
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,220
There's a strict class system here.

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,220
Class?

72
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,519
First class, the management
inheritance group.

73
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,160
You can go to PGA.

74
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,829
In other words, the rich's
sons and daughters.

75
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,860
I heard there will be personnel
transfers at your hotel.

76
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,300
Wasn't there one recently?

77
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,829
That's what my dad is like.

78
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,329
He doesn't think he's bad.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,040
By the way, your brand opened
10 stores at once.

80
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,639
That's what my mom is like.

81
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,610
She should manage
what she already has.

82
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,379
Second class,
the share inheritance group.

83
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,050
They won't inherit
the family business,

84
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,449
but they're already
major shareholders.

85
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:17,560
You must be very happy these days.

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,889
Thanks to my broadcasting
station's drama with Kim Tae Hee,

87
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,529
Mega Entertainment shares
went up a lot.

88
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,629
You need to say it right.

89
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:24,129
Thanks to Tae Hee from my agency,

90
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,829
your broadcasting station
shares went up.

91
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,470
They're still entertainment shares.

92
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,300
You never know when it will fall.

93
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
- What?
- What?

94
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,439
Third class,
the honor inheritance group.

95
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:39,610
Ministers. Politicians.
Chief Justice.

96
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,449
Children of honorary positions
like the CEO of law firms.

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,579
Your father will struggle
in the upcoming trial.

98
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:49,750
My dad told me there are many
precedents favorable to the accused.

99
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,560
Since when did prosecutors charge
people based on precedents?

100
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:57,600
As long as justice is alive,
the wrong will be punished.

101
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,699
And the fourth.

102
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,199
The underprivileged group
like you and me.

103
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,000
The underprivileged group?

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,199
The students who enrolled...

105
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,040
through the underprivileged
student criteria.

106
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,269
I get that I'm it, but why you?

107
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,069
Do you know the caste system?

108
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,480
Chief Secretary's son?
I'm a Sudra here.

109
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,310
"Untouchable".

110
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,319
If you're an untouchable,
what about me?

111
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,019
Will I be able to endure it?

112
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,990
At least, you have someone
on your side.

113
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,430
All other kids were alone.

114
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,860
So was I.

115
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,110
Transfer student.

116
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,839
Go to the staffroom.

117
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,149
By the way,
I'm the student president.

118
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,649
Ask me if you have any question.

119
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,209
Thank you.

120
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,319
Here's my question.
Where is the staffroom?

121
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,019
Sit down.

122
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,629
Take mandatory classes
based on the schedule.

123
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,230
You schedule electives on your own.

124
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,129
It's similar
to the university system.

125
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,899
Fill this out now.

126
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,069
(Family Background Survey)

127
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,819
I heard your mom is a housekeeper.

128
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,620
So your tuition is exempted.

129
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,759
She's also a housewife.

130
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,160
Well... Sure.

131
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,199
Your first class is with me.
It's a mandatory class.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,069
Let's do our best.

133
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,240
She's a transfer student.
She'll join you from today.

134
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,810
Say hi.

135
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,980
Hello. I'm...

136
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,550
I'm Cha Eun Sang.

137
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,389
I'm ordinary and simple
in every perspective.

138
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,430
I always do well on my own.

139
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,389
So I will reject any attention.

140
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,930
Your help will be a burden.
Nice to meet you.

141
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:17,000
Go sit in the empty seat.
Let's start.

142
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,199
I have a question
for the transfer student.

143
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,370
How did you get into our school?

144
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,529
Here's one more transfer student.

145
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,399
Who doesn't know Tan in this school?

146
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,769
Still, you need to do
what you need to do.

147
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,950
Why don't you move? It's my turn.

148
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,860
I'm Kim Tan.

149
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,429
Even if I tell you my old school,

150
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,700
you wouldn't know.

151
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,429
I recently returned from the US.

152
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,340
I also want to have
an ordinary and simple school life.

153
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,970
Work with me.

154
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,190
Ms. Park.

155
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,690
Ms. Park.

156
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,159
Where is she?

157
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,200
Why are you wearing something
like that? It's uncomfortable.

158
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:09,179
For a change.

159
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,350
What about my feeling?

160
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,490
Are you trying to look like a person
in the movie? Is that it?

161
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,620
Why did you have to pick that movie?

162
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,330
Have you seen my cream color blouse?

163
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,830
There are only two in Korea.

164
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,330
Jun Ji Hyun has one, and I have one.

165
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,470
Dry cleaning only.

166
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,299
Oh, that's right.

167
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,409
I lose mentally without it.

168
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,750
Does she even know what she hung?

169
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,490
Are you out of your mind?

170
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,690
Where do you think you are?

171
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,700
I'm here as a parent.
To meet the Chief Director.

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,129
Don't you know what moms are like?

173
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,129
What?

174
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:02,970
It was my Tan's first day
in this school.

175
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,200
Did school go crazy?

176
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,340
Are you insane?

177
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,610
If I gave you the house you wanted
so desperately,

178
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,539
you should've stayed quiet.
Why are you outside?

179
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,340
Don't you know we must not
be seen together?

180
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,610
I can't even get some fresh air?

181
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,850
Am I Rapunzel?

182
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,549
If you want fresh air,
go to Han River.

183
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,480
Who do you think you are
to go to a gallery?

184
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,220
Why would I go near the water?

185
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,590
Who knows someone will push me?

186
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,889
What? You...

187
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,919
What? Are you going to hit me again?

188
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,389
The 1st time is hard,
but 2nd time...

189
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,330
See this? Two weeks
of medical treatment.

190
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,299
You got a medical certificate?

191
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,100
I wouldn't suffer twice.

192
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,399
You know I can sue you with
two weeks of medical treatment.

193
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,100
(Injury certificate)

194
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,509
Depression. Panic disorder.
Social phobia?

195
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,679
You look fine even though
you have a social phobia.

196
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,340
Aren't I a person?

197
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,980
Honestly, you're not.

198
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,419
You should be at least 168cm tall
to be a person.

199
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,490
Then do you get a fear of heights
if you can't fly?

200
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:57,860
Just sue me before you get
a fear of heights.

201
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,690
You better do it. Got it?
Now, leave.

202
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,289
You think I can't?

203
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:06,659
If I can't,
I'm going to hit you too.

204
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,730
Leave.

205
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,429
Leave now!

206
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,740
(Recruiting JBS Producer)

207
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,480
(Recruiting 1 person)

208
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,620
Why did you even knock?

209
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,419
Be nice to me. It's been a year.

210
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,389
Get up to greet me if you can.

211
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,490
What? Do you want a hug?

212
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,230
You're getting me excited.

213
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,370
How's everything?
Are you still good at studying?

214
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,570
It's nothing.

215
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,299
Are you back or visiting?

216
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,440
I'm wearing a uniform.
I'm back obviously.

217
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,009
What kind of high school
broadcast room is so fancy?

218
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,409
Because your father is rich.

219
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,879
Want to take a test
since you're here?

220
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,409
Do you want to be a producer?

221
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,379
I'm too hot for that.

222
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,659
Have you been well, Lee Bo Na?

223
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:08,889
Totally well.

224
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,389
Where is Yoon Chan Young?

225
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,460
He's done nothing wrong.

226
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,000
That's what she says.

227
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,299
What on earth did I do wrong?

228
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,169
Why does he look for Chan Young?

229
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,580
Is he going to have a fight or what?

230
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,179
Why would Kim Tan fight Chan Young?

231
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,980
What else?
Because he still loves me.

232
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,320
I mean, why did he show up?

233
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,179
I just wanted to put
everything behind us...

234
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,549
because past is just past.

235
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,820
Gosh. I hate him so much,
but he's so hot.

236
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,820
Well, he is hot,

237
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,789
but when they were standing
together, Young Do was hotter.

238
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
What?

239
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,460
- What do you think?
- What do you mean?

240
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,629
The transfer student.

241
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,870
She looks familiar.

242
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,169
Don't you think she looks familiar?
Is it just me?

243
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,440
If you've met her,
it'd be at the club.

244
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,809
Is that right?

245
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,309
Hey. Transfer student.

246
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,590
Do you remember my name? The
clear water of Jeguk High School.

247
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,620
(Jo Myung Soo)

248
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,059
Jo Myung Soo.

249
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,090
You're smart.

250
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,000
I know your name too.
Cha Eun Sang. Right?

251
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,230
Which one are you?

252
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,370
What do you mean?

253
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,700
There are only two reasons
if someone appears so suddenly.

254
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,500
Either you're an underprivileged
student or an upstart.

255
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,039
Which is it?

256
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,179
Why are you looking at me?
You answer.

257
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,750
Do you know her?

258
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,480
If I do, do you think I'd tell you?

259
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,990
You didn't tell me
Kim Tan came back to Korea.

260
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:42,590
Forget it.

261
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,529
By the way, you're very interesting.

262
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,460
You just transferred, but Tan
knows you and Young Do knows you.

263
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,629
And Bo Na knows you too.

264
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,629
Chan Young grabbed your wrist
and dragged you.

265
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,600
Rachel hates you
as soon as she sees you.

266
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,100
What's your deal?

267
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,149
Upstart.

268
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,320
Right? I knew
she looked like an upstart.

269
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,889
An upstart who doesn't know
how to spend her money yet.

270
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:21,590
My goodness. I'm against
this marriage.

271
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,659
Upstart. Let's talk.

272
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,690
Are you okay?

273
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,330
But you tripped me over.

274
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,389
Or I can't hold you.

275
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,529
You're a weirdo.

276
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,730
Am I only weird? Am I not scary?

277
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Why should you be scary?

278
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,139
Because I'm going to
keep tripping you over.

279
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,840
Then let me ask you something again.

280
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,409
You have to answer properly
this time.

281
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,750
What's your relationship
with Kim Tan?

282
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,220
If you're interested in Kim Tan,
go ask him yourself.

283
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,220
Oh, I forgot to introduce yourself.

284
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,789
You're mine from today.

285
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:35,500
- What?
- In other words, it's a bully.

286
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,840
If you know how I feel now,
answer me.

287
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,610
- How do you know Tan?
- What if she knows me?

288
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,450
Ask me directly.

289
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,679
I said I wanted to talk.
Why do you keep avoiding me?

290
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,220
Don't even think about running away.

291
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,149
You go first.

292
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,829
I just want to become
the transfer student's friend,

293
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,569
but you interrupt too actively.

294
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,470
You don't deserve friends.

295
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,910
Why make them
when you'll abandon them soon?

296
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,789
Are you going to keep avoiding me?

297
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,019
How can I avoid you?
You're even at home.

298
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,359
I didn't hide it on purpose.

299
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,089
Regardless, you still
saw the very bottom of me.

300
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,029
Did you cry?

301
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,299
I beg you.
Can you act like you don't know me?

302
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,140
I want to graduate from this school.

303
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,970
I need the diploma from this school.

304
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:52,910
But it went wrong
from the first day.

305
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,910
What were you thinking
when you made me an upstart?

306
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,009
You don't like the upstart?

307
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,380
Should I have made you a rich?

308
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,680
I'm serious.

309
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,119
You think I'm joking?

310
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:04,559
It's for your ordinary and simple
school life.

311
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,890
An upstart is simple?

312
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:07,119
What if they find out?

313
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,190
Stay next to me.

314
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,859
If you and I are close,
you won't have to worry.

315
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Try to avoid Choi Young Do
with your best.

316
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
No. Choi Young Do keeps
talking to me,

317
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,140
and girls stare at me
because of you.

318
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,910
People are still glancing at me
because of you.

319
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,309
The person I should avoid
with my best is not Choi Young Do,

320
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,549
but you.

321
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,829
Yes, it's me. Kim Tan.

322
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,099
Let's meet after school.

323
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,299
Where is that?

324
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,609
What's this place?

325
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,880
Myung Soo's hideout
under the name of workroom.

326
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,549
What he does can't be done
without club lights.

327
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,279
What are you doing?

328
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,420
Fixing the computer Myung Soo broke.

329
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,720
Are you good at computers?

330
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:08,950
I'm not bad.

331
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,289
Why did you want to see me?

332
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,190
You know Cha Eun Sang's
staying at my house, right?

333
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,130
She knows that she's staying
at your house too.

334
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,230
Speaking of which,

335
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,599
don't tell others that
Eun Sang's an underprivileged,

336
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,500
the relationship
between her and my family,

337
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,200
and other private information
on her.

338
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,940
Are you telling me to be quiet?

339
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,670
Who's been Cha Eun Sang's friend
for 10 years?

340
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,880
Friends can be potential enemies.

341
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,549
As they know so much
about each other.

342
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,019
That's the world I experienced.

343
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,680
Chan Young.

344
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,119
Hello? Yes. Go ahead. Yes.

345
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,390
I guess she still has
lingering feelings for me.

346
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,890
Who avoids a crappy car
because of lingering feelings?

347
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,599
What? A crappy car?

348
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,789
How was school?
Were kids nice to you?

349
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,289
Say something. I'm curious.

350
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,400
Mom. Let's leave this house.

351
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,329
Can't you take out a loan?
Or borrow money from someone?

352
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,140
Go where?

353
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,710
Stop talking nonsense
and focus on school.

354
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,769
Forget about school.

355
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,980
Let's stop hiding here
like a criminal and leave.

356
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,140
I can do two more jobs.

357
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,650
Then we can pay for the rent.

358
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,210
Don't think about such a thing.

359
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,279
Not even in your dream.

360
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,220
You know I've done
practically every job.

361
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,559
Every place has fired me
in three months.

362
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:55,359
No place takes me in like here
who can't talk.

363
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:57,390
Is it my fault that you can't talk?

364
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,200
Then is it my fault?

365
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,599
It's unfair.

366
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,240
Why do we have to live like this
with no exit?

367
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,170
It drives me crazy.

368
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,900
(Used Jeguk High School uniform)

369
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,369
(No result found)

370
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,339
(Kim Tan)

371
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,799
Can I see you for a second?

372
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,609
Where are you?

373
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,480
- Here.
- My goodness.

374
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,980
Why were you hiding? You scared me.

375
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,619
You're so slow.

376
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,849
Didn't you see bright light
from there?

377
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:39,690
Since when were you here?

378
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,930
Did you pretend
like you weren't here before?

379
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,329
Why do you ask? I did.

380
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:44,759
- When?
- Why?

381
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,660
Did you do something
you shouldn't in here?

382
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,200
What are you doing?

383
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,670
You were not smoking.

384
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,769
Did you curse me in here?

385
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:56,869
Move.

386
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:01,609
Have lunch with me tomorrow.

387
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,480
Didn't you hear what I said earlier?

388
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,750
I'll do well only if you cooperate.

389
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,519
Transfer back to your old school.

390
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,849
- What?
- Or live as an upstart...

391
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,490
under my shade until you graduate.

392
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,319
- Both...
- Even if you don't want to,

393
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,029
have lunch with me tomorrow.

394
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,369
(Jeguk High School)

395
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,829
Move. That's my seat.

396
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,609
There's no designated seat
in the cafeteria.

397
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,109
I know you're not listening
to music.

398
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,109
How do you know that?

399
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:08,450
Lower your voice.

400
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,279
Kids think differently of you,

401
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,490
but I heard everything
in the staffroom.

402
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,490
Even your mom's occupation.

403
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:24,329
I'm telling you out of concern.
Don't reveal it yourself.

404
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,299
It's never better
to get it over with.

405
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,200
Feeling guilty?

406
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,599
No one cares about you.

407
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:33,970
The only thing they care about...

408
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,269
is how you suffer.

409
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,079
Endure it well.

410
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,480
Even though I couldn't.

411
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,880
What do you mean?

412
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,150
I'm transferring soon.

413
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,359
Get up. It's my seat.

414
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,240
Upstart. What?
You have something to say?

415
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,769
You want to eat with us?

416
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,509
I'm down.

417
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,809
Joon Young. Have some beans.
They're healthy.

418
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,920
Hey. I told you,
Joon Young likes potatoes.

419
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:21,890
Eat a lot.

420
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,289
Hey. What are you doing...

421
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,720
I told you to eat with me.

422
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,289
Let me go. They...

423
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,059
Do you want to become like him?

424
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,769
If you want to go to school
quietly, just eat.

425
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,509
Is that why you wanted to
eat with me?

426
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:49,509
So you should've listened.

427
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,750
How did you predict it?

428
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,480
You just transferred
to this school too.

429
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,390
Because I made the rule.

430
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:59,819
Back then, I did it with them.

431
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:13,000
They're bullying their friend.

432
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,109
Can I sit here?

433
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:16,869
Sit elsewhere.

434
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:19,539
One should enjoy the meal.

435
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,710
Both you and me.

436
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,779
Now I finally feel like eating.

437
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,750
I barely got to sit
with the transfer student.

438
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,990
- I'll get going first.
- Don't get going first.

439
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,259
Let's just eat...

440
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,789
without her.

441
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,160
Not without the transfer student.

442
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,769
There are many people watching.
What if they think we're fighting?

443
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,210
Eat a lot, transfer student.

444
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,339
Sure. Let's eat. You eat a lot too.

445
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,420
Look at her.

446
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,119
This is why
I'm getting interested in her.

447
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:22,210
I opened the workroom
to go to college,

448
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,740
but it only benefits others.

449
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,240
There might be a picture
of you and Bo Na somewhere.

450
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,910
And a picture with Young Do...

451
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,049
Show me later.

452
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,690
Even the one with Young Do.

453
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,089
Sure. I'll look for it.

454
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:55,339
I'm sorry,

455
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:00,539
but can you all leave?

456
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,950
I need to talk to Kim Tan.

457
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,900
- Me too?
- Go stand guard for me.

458
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,700
I can't trust them.

459
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,910
You're acting so childish.

460
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,049
Why did you kick everyone out?

461
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,079
Because I'm about to say something
they shouldn't hear.

462
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:47,759
You must've forgotten about
our unique history,

463
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,660
culture and sentiment after
spending too much time in the US.

464
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:57,500
In Korea, we do what's called
settling for peace.

465
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,039
We used to do that a lot too.

466
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,170
What? You want to fight?

467
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,779
We're not 8 years old. We're 18.

468
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,279
Then what?

469
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,779
We can't go to the same school.

470
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,480
Either you leave or I leave,
one of us has to transfer.

471
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,690
I transferred yesterday.

472
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,160
Do it again.
I'm giving you a chance.

473
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:22,690
A chance to leave
before I tell everyone...

474
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:26,660
you're a concubine's child.

475
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,240
I'm too young to understand
the saying,

476
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,809
"Losing is winning."

477
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,440
I'm so bad-tempered...

478
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,210
that it's upsetting to watch
Kim Tan coming at me.

479
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,720
I guess we can't be friends.

480
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,420
It's too late to avoid.

481
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,559
But it's illegal to tune like that.

482
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,930
Why is everything
I want to do illegal?

483
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,740
Because you're still a minor.

484
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,569
If you do it for me, I'll grow fast.

485
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,740
Delivery.

486
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,779
- Enjoy.
- Yes.

487
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,500
It's 16.1 dollars.

488
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,140
You already delivered.
We finished eating.

489
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,240
You ordered one more chicken
for a guest.

490
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,940
I can stand you teasing me,

491
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,579
but I can't have a money problem.

492
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:47,640
We really didn't order it.

493
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,150
Are you sure it was us?

494
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
That's strange.

495
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,789
Hello. Did you order fried chicken
to the bike shop?

496
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,460
- Is this your number?
- What?

497
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Behind you.

498
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,230
I ordered fried chicken.

499
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
I'm sorry.

500
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,940
It's 16.1 dollars.

501
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,650
I can't believe I'm spending money
to get a girl's number.

502
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,250
I should've just asked Rachel.

503
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,619
Don't call me.
I'm not going to answer.

504
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,990
Enjoy.

505
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,289
Are you going to save my number?

506
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,400
If not, I'm going to ask you
why an upstart is...

507
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:46,740
working part-time.

508
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,059
I'm home.

509
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,630
Hi.

510
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,269
What?

511
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:29,849
Now that one son is back,
the other son left.

512
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,180
I know.

513
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,289
I like them both.

514
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:40,059
But neither me nor Won...

515
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,329
likes you that much.

516
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:46,299
That's fathers' fate.

517
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,700
Empty your schedule tomorrow.

518
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,470
Why?

519
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,670
To bring back the son who left.

520
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,389
Aren't you going home?

521
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,360
If you're sick, you should
stay at home.

522
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,760
Why are you in a hotel room?

523
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,989
It's sadder if I'm sick at home.

524
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,429
The housekeeper will
make porridge for me.

525
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,929
But you came because I'm here.

526
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,570
It sounds like
you're lying about being sick.

527
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,909
Why did you make porridge
if you knew I was lying?

528
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,039
You should've bought
something delicious.

529
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,780
Stop making me do errands.

530
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,750
Let me go on dates.

531
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,079
You're too mean to a sick person.

532
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,449
You look easy now that you're sick.

533
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,860
So get well soon.

534
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,800
It's cooled now. Try to eat some.

535
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,309
Yes.

536
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,679
Now? When did you get the call?

537
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,889
I'll go now.
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

538
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,619
I have to go. You should go home.

539
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,789
To work? Is everything all right?

540
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,030
I'm not sure.

541
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:09,710
What about President Kim?

542
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:10,809
He's on the way.

543
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:13,679
He's not feeling well, so he went to
the hotel after going to hospital.

544
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,309
If he doesn't feel well,
he should step down like me.

545
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:19,920
Today is Saturday, sir.

546
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,989
I didn't care about the day
when I ran the business.

547
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:26,159
Mr. Yoon. I'll get going first.

548
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,130
- Now?
- Stop right there.

549
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,760
You said we were going to see Won.

550
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,599
We are.

551
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,460
You didn't say it was
at the company.

552
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:38,130
When I think about it...

553
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,369
Of course,
it's not for your brother.

554
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,369
But it's not for you either.

555
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,579
You're doing this for me.

556
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,579
As long as you live as my son
under Jeguk Group,

557
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,079
you don't have the right
to avoid it.

558
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,139
Hello, Chairman Kim.

559
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,059
I guess you haven't quit
playing golf wagers.

560
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,699
It wasn't a wager, sir.

561
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,829
It's all for business.

562
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,400
All right, you go first then.

563
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,170
Tell me what kind
of business it was.

564
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,369
Pardon?

565
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,289
Our important
JG Convention Jeju Project...

566
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,829
for the second half of 2014...

567
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,030
will have rooms in 30 floors.

568
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,670
For candidates, Union Hotel...

569
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,320
I must've forgotten.

570
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:36,250
Junior Director Jung and Senior
Director Park have met him.

571
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,550
But I don't think the rest of you
have seen him before.

572
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,760
This is my second son.

573
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,800
I brought him to get familiar
with you.

574
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:48,500
Your second son?

575
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Then...

576
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:58,210
It's nice to meet you.

577
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,340
I'm Kim Tan.

578
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,110
You must feel reliable.

579
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,480
He's handsome.

580
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,079
He takes after you, Chairman Kim.

581
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,449
He's good-looking.

582
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,730
Hello, Uncle.

583
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,530
Oh, yes.

584
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,760
I wouldn't have recognized you in
the street. When did you come back?

585
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,570
My sister didn't tell me
you came back.

586
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,369
Since when did you get a report
on my family affair?

587
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,909
That's not it...

588
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,110
You may go.

589
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,340
You should spend the weekend
with your family.

590
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,510
I'm sending you home early,

591
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:40,920
but don't you dare go to places
with twinkling lights.

592
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,719
No, sir.

593
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,719
How do you feel?

594
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,190
If I knew you were coming...

595
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,030
I thought you'd know
when to stop and come home.

596
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:55,659
We should go too.

597
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:01,800
Drive me and Tan home, Jae Ho.

598
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,010
Yes, sir.

599
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:07,179
You're always so tough on me,
Mr. Yoon.

600
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,610
I'll see you later.

601
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,929
Don't get me wrong.
I didn't come on purpose.

602
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,630
Father said we were going
to see you.

603
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,730
I didn't know it would be
in the company.

604
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:35,070
Have you ever done anything
on purpose before?

605
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,610
You never know anything...

606
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,579
or did anything on purpose, but...

607
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:44,480
look what happens when you move
without knowing better.

608
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,550
What you said is right,

609
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,590
but why do I feel unfair?

610
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:53,059
Even if I don't know anything
or do anything,

611
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,590
my existence itself is
a misunderstanding to you.

612
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,030
Bye.

613
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,250
What did you do in the company?

614
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,820
Nothing.

615
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,860
Your father said you attended
a meeting.

616
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,099
I didn't. I only watched.

617
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,329
It's the same thing.

618
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,070
Where did he make you sit?

619
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,440
Next to him? Or two seats down?

620
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:44,909
Why are you mixing rice with water
when you have so many dishes?

621
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,510
I want to eat fast because
I don't want to hear you talking.

622
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,539
You punk.

623
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,409
Then I will ask you fast.

624
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,619
What was the meeting about?

625
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,250
Did Father make you do something?

626
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,019
Did he tell you to say your opinion?

627
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,590
Who was there? Was Won there?

628
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,860
Where did he sit?

629
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,230
Where are you going?

630
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:32,389
Finish this by yourself. I have to
go check the beef bone soup.

631
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:33,820
Okay.

632
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,519
The weather is awesome.
It upsets me.

633
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,400
An upstart in the daytime
and a housekeeper at night.

634
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:17,730
What kind of life has
such a big difference?

635
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:22,530
Mom. Five more minutes.
I have to go to work soon.

636
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:44,090
What time is it?

637
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:51,360
My gosh. I thought I was late.

638
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:05,730
(Received call)

639
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,239
Now you're calling?

640
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:37,900
I keep seeing you here.

641
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,239
Because you keep having a lot
of business to take care of here.

642
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,469
I heard President Kim is
staying here.

643
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,980
You also have a lot of business
here too.

644
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,980
Don't be sarcastic.

645
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,809
One kiss doesn't give you
the right to do that.

646
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,119
I see.

647
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,880
Then go take care of your business.

648
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,320
How could you not call me at all
after that?

649
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:00,820
Why didn't you?

650
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,389
I don't know your number.

651
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:04,960
It's not hard to get it
as the CEO of RS International.

652
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,989
Exactly.

653
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:08,960
What excuse does the CEO
of RS International have...

654
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,369
to get some
Chief Secretary's number?

655
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,070
All right, then.
Wish for a coincidence.

656
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:15,869
The more desperate person will
come up with an excuse.

657
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,579
What? Scholarship?

658
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:01,719
Yes. Do I just need
good grades to get it?

659
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:05,420
Do you think kids here just
waste money and party?

660
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,590
Since they started walking, they
have prepared for the IVY league...

661
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,960
with a tutor. Do you feel confident
to compete against them...

662
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,460
and win a scholarship?

663
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:16,730
Pay this by this week.

664
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,530
I thought the tuition was exempted.

665
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,239
That's not the tuition.
It's a special elective fee.

666
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,710
If this was exempted, why would
the underprivileged students...

667
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:26,809
quit school?

668
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,440
Tennis, gold, horseback riding.

669
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,809
One of them is a must.

670
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:32,449
Get your clothes and gears.

671

(Special elective fee, 550 dollars)

672
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:37,489
By the way,

673
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,250
when will you start
wearing a uniform?

674
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:02,780
(Recruiting JBS Producer)

675
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,480
(A scholarship is provided.)

676
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,190
Scholarship?

677
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:11,849
I know there are many applicants.

678
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:14,389
And I know kids here started
preparing for the IVY League...

679
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:15,559
when they started walking,

680
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,860
but I'm curious.

681
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,059
Will I get the scholarship
in advance or later?

682
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:22,230
Why do you ask?

683
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,199
I need money to buy a uniform.

684
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,900
How much do you want?

685
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,039
Pardon?

686
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:32,610
Are you applying for it
for the scholarship?

687
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,940
- I also have passion...
- Let's say you do.

688
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,909
It's different from the rumor.

689
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,980
Do you really not have money
to buy the uniform?

690
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,719
I thought you were an upstart.

691
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,420
I bought a bag. I'm quite wasteful.

692
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:48,289
Are you telling me
to choose such a wasteful person?

693
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:50,190
Aside from that, I have no flaw.

694
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:51,289
I'm quite diligent.

695
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:52,690
How do I know if you're diligent?

696
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,360
I looked up who you are...

697
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,530
before coming here. Diligently.

698
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:59,429
- Look at you.
- I heard you're very nice.

699
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,099
You're upright and gentle.

700
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,309
Will you give me a chance
to take the test?

701
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,289
Why do you keep hurting my heart,
Joon Young?

702
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,630
If you report it anonymously,
did you think I wouldn't find out?

703
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,739
Gosh.

704
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:39,039
Aside from you telling
the teacher on me,

705
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:42,510
how many times have I told you
that my dad has...

706
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:45,150
a secretary who answers calls
for him, unlike your dad?

707
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:49,920
Why do you keep making secrets
between me and the secretary?

708
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:51,789
Why?

709
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:57,159
How much more should I show you,
so you'd become considerate?

710
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,500
Because you're not
being considerate of me,

711
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,099
I'm doing this in front
of everyone...

712
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:07,739
to appeal to you. You know that?

713
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,809
Are you going to do this again?

714
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,039
Answer me.

715
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:19,679
I said, answer me.
Stop staring at me.

716
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,949
Don't touch me.
I won't take it anymore.

717
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,969
Why do you worsen the situation?

718
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:44,469
You want to die?

719
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,369
I won't take it anymore, you jerk.

720
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,949
I'm going to transfer soon.
I'm not scared of anything.

721
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:52,579
I'm going to kill you.

722
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,809
You should've endured it
for some more.

723
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:22,940
Now I can't wait...

724
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,480
to see what will happen to you.

725
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:48,239
Are you okay?

726
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,010
You want some water?

727
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:00,179
What are you doing?
I was giving it to him.

728
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:01,650
Don't you see that's the problem?

729
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,750
Don't get involved
in something like this.

730
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:06,219
I was only asking if he was okay.
I didn't get involved.

731
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,489
Does anyone else talk to him
other than you?

732
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,630
Don't stand on the weak's side
in Jeguk High School.

734
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:22,039
they'll be nothing but the weak.

736
00:53:57,139 --> 00:53:58,170
Hello?

737
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:01,309
It's me. You recognize my voice,
don't you?

738
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,980
Is this your number?

739
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:05,110
You better bring my name tag back.

740
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,550
I'm a lot less patient than I look.

741
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,820
Come get it if you want.

742
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,590
You want me to go with Kim Tan?

743
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:15,019
Where are you?

744
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,599
- My name tag?
- Where's my customs declaration?

745
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,840
Arrogant witch.

746
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,909
Didn't Yoon Chan Young on employee
benefit tell you about school?

747
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,940
What if he did?
What difference does it make?

748
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,679
Your attitude should be different.

749
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,880
You're an upstart.

750
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,780
I don't know how your family
got rich,

751
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,289
but there has never been a moment...

752
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:47,590
where my family wasn't rich.

753
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:52,289
So don't make people talk about
you and Tan together.

754
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,159
That degrades my and Tan's class.

755
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,570
You wouldn't believe it,
but that's what I want.

756
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,699
Here. Give me back
my customs declaration.

757
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:06,639
Oh, that. I threw it out.

758
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:09,010
What? In the airport trash can.

759
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,179
You've come all the way here.

760
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:15,420
This is for your trouble.

761
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,389
Don't refuse it.

762
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,320
It means you should get lost now.

763
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,909
I'm in a convenience store
near your house.

764
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,409
I'll be having ramyeon. Hurry up.

765
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:48,050
I'm hanging up.

766
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,670
Hey.

767
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,449
Hey.

768
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:57,750
Why do you always sleep here?

769
00:56:58,449 --> 00:56:59,849
It makes me want to protect you.

770
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,070
How did you know my number?

771
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:16,269
You also know mine.

772
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,239
Let's say we're even.
Why did you call me?

773
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,409
How's the ramyeon?

774
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,550
- Take what?
- A family photo.

775
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,119
I can't break off the engagement,
but I can break off the photoshoot.

776
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:41,820
I'm the crazy one to trust you.

777
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,559
Your expensive dress
will reek of swear words.

778
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:44,829
I'm so sorry.

779
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:46,389
I won't sue him, so don't worry.

780
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,960
If you're going to be like this,
transfer to another school.

781
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,699
Why did you send Eun Sang
to Jeguk High School?

782
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:52,570
Because she'll hear why she and Tan
shouldn't be close...

783
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,639
through 100 people's mouths there.

784
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,500
- Hello.
- Are you rebelling against me?

785
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,269
What are you thinking so hard about?

786
00:58:58,269 --> 00:58:59,269
About Cha Eun Sang.

787
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,710
Why are you thinking about Upstart?

788
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:03,949
I'm also thinking about
why I'm thinking about Upstart.

789
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:06,050
I told you several times
to be careful of Choi Young Do.

790
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,349
He said he wanted to protect me.

791
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:09,019
That's a threat.
