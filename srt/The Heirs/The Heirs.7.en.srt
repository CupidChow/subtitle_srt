(The Heirs)

3
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,000
(Episode 7)

4
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,140
Hey.

5
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:35,539
Hey.

6
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,009
Why do you always sleep here?

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,210
It makes me want to protect you.

8
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,130
How did you know my number?

9
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,990
You also know mine.

10
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,369
Let's say we're even.
Why did you call me?

11
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,200
How's the ramyeon?

12
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,680
Do you want to eat some ramyeon?

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,310
You think I called
because I'm happy to see you?

14
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,209
How can friendships change?

15
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,049
I'll wake up the person
you'll be happy to see.

16
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,849
Wake up already.

17
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,890
Kim Tan is here.

18
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,099
Why are you so noisy?

19
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,580
What are you doing
in someone else's neighborhood?

20
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,479
Come on. Don't be like this.

21
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,150
What are you two doing?

22
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,250
Why are you here
and why is he there?

23
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,419
What are you two doing?

24
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,189
Didn't you come to meet her?

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,030
Cross the road.

26
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,430
Why would I come to meet her?

27
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't know what you two
are doing there,

28
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,300
but go to your neighborhood
to misbehave.

29
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:45,469
This isn't
that kind of neighborhood.

30
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,250
He's just leaving.

31
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,319
Follow him quickly.

32
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,949
I didn't come to meet Kim Tan.

33
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,759
Are you saying that this situation
is a coincidence?

34
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,990
Did we meet after making
an appointment?

35
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,759
Bye, then.

36
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,879
What can I do if you say so?

37
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,680
Gosh, I'm confused.

38
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,849
Oh, my gosh!

39
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:40,330
How could a girl sleep at a place
like that? It's dangerous.

40
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,090
I didn't want to come home early,

41
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,129
but I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

42
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,870
Why don't you have anywhere else
to go? There are cafes everywhere.

43
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,199
You must also spend money
to spend time.

44
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,169
I'll go in first.

45
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,439
I'm not done talking.

46
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,340
Why did you meet Choi Young Do?

47
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,080
I didn't meet him,
I just ran into him.

48
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,009
He was sitting there when I woke up.

49
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,479
I told you several times
to be careful of Choi Young Do.

50
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,979
What did he say to you?
Didn't he threaten you?

51
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,189
No, he actually said
that he wanted to protect me.

52
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,889
That's a threat.

53
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,889
Please just listen to me.

54
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,259
Don't run into Choi Young Do
from now on.

55
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,459
I'm not nagging you,
I'm warning you.

56
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,300
It's not up to me.

57
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,060
You didn't even try your best.
How dare you say that?

58
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,129
What happened between
Choi Young Do and you?

59
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,470
I don't remember clearly.

60
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,339
I just know that
we hate each other now.

61
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,509
I'll go in first. You should come in
five minutes later.

62
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,180
Don't you think we could run into
each other once in the garden?

63
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,750
I'm doing my best not to run
into you as much as possible.

64
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:55,029
I'm home.

65
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,970
You should come home early.
I had to get this myself.

66
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,639
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,240
Mom, give me some water.

68
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,480
You should've just asked for it.
Why come to the kitchen?

69
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,680
Hey, give him some water.

70
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,189
Is it your first time seeing him?

71
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,589
He's my son, Kim Tan.
He's the second son of Jeguk Group.

72
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,430
You know the lady who can't
talk, right? She's her daughter.

73
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:29,899
Nice to meet you.

74
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,769
I saw you a lot.

75
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,370
Did you see her? When? At home?

76
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,370
At school.

77
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,040
I was like, "Who's that
country bumpkin?" It was you.

78
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,149
Nice to meet you.
I hope I see you often.

79
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,149
You don't have to see her often.

80
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,120
Didn't you see him at school?

81
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:48,889
I didn't.

82
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,189
Really?

83
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,889
But it's really hard
not to notice him.

84
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:53,990
Isn't that right?

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,490
She's strange.

86
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,430
I'm going upstairs.

87
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,269
I will also go to my room.

88
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:02,829
Did you look at him carefully?

89
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,399
Yes?

90
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,209
Now that you know his face,

91
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,439
why don't you report how Tan is
doing at school to me from now on.

92
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,279
Report?

93
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,410
Why?

94
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,180
You're going to a
private school for free,

95
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,250
but you can't do that for me?

96
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,879
That's not it.

97
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,720
I'm not saying
that you two should become close.

98
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,120
Just because you live in the same
house and go to the same school,

99
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,759
doesn't mean you two can
become close.

100
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:32,399
Just like you're living in different
spaces in the same house,

101
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,129
he and you should breathe
in different places at school.

102
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,800
Don't call him "Tan" and talk down
to him because you're the same age.

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,269
You understand that, right?

104
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,180
Yes, he's something
like a young master.

105
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,839
Yes, exactly.

106
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,610
You really are smart.

107
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,779
Give me a glass of water.

108
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:52,480
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,399
Why are you sleeping like that?
Lie down even if it's for a moment.

110
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,939
Mom, what is this?
Where did you get it?

111
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,110
Where would I get it?
Of course, I bought it.

112
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,620
You bought it? Mom, how could you?

113
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,550
It costs about 1,000 dollars.
With that money, we could...

114
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:37,329
You can let me handle this much.

115
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,629
Try it on. Let's see if my daughter
looks pretty in it.

116
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,769
You know I look pretty
in anything.

117
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,569
Thank you, Mom.

118
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,279
To be honest, I'm really happy.
Thank you so much.

119
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,480
Should I iron it?

120
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,230
What? We're going to take what?

121
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,230
A family photo.

122
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,000
It's going to be displayed at
the engagement venue and invitation.

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,060
Mom, are you sick?

124
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,529
Why would we take
a darn family photo?

125
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,139
Lower your voice. How dare you?
You're at my store.

126
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,569
What are you thinking?

127
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,170
Why would I take a photo
with those people?

128
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,839
Does taking a family photo make
us a real family?

129
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,610
- Bring this to me in pink.
- Yes, ma'am.

130
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:30,410
A temper tantrum only works
until you're three years old.

131
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,620
It won't work, so stop it.

132
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,289
You also could run my life
as you wanted until I was three.

133
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,190
I don't care whether you will take
a family photo or wedding photo.

134
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,019
I'm not going.

135
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,600
Where are you going?
I'm going home soon.

136
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,399
Where are you right now?

137
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,639
You heard about the photo, right?

138
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,620
You're not the only one
who feels bad right now.

139
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,789
I'm seriously asking you. Is there
no way to break off this engagement?

140
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:11,820
Do you want to go out with me?

141
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,789
You know I'm not talking
about my engagement.

142
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,330
Can't you be a little more serious?

143
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,059
I can't break off the engagement,
but I can break off the photoshoot.

144
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,669
Are you serious?

145
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:22,669
What will you do for me
if I break it off?

146
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,769
Ask me after you do it.

147
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,240
I see. You must want to take
the family photo.

148
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,580
What do you want?

149
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,809
Will you give me...

150
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,279
anything I want?

151
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:48,629
Gosh, it's cold.

152
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,269
What are you doing here this early?

153
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,340
Gosh. The driver didn't even
come to work yet.

154
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:02,309
I wondered when you leave since
I never saw you in the morning.

155
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,840
Do you leave this early to avoid me?

156
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:06,340
You're not the only one
I'm avoiding. I'll get going first.

157
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,480
Do you think I waited this early
to send you alone first?

158
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,710
- Hey.
- It will be no good...

159
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,919
if the struggle gets longer.

160
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,919
There's a surveillance camera
over there.

161
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,460
Please go to Jeguk High School.

162
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,970
Kids like Kim Tan
because he's handsome.

163
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,809
Kim Tan has good grades
because he's handsome.

164
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,740
- Kim Tan is...
- What are you doing?

165
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:39,039
These are the content
that you must report to my mom.

166
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,210
I heard everything yesterday.

167
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,149
Are you telling me to lie?

168
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,450
What part is a lie?

169
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,480
Never mind.

170
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:48,019
When she told you to report
about me,

171
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,789
you answered "Yes" immediately.
Were you waiting for it?

172
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:54,029
I can't really say "I don't want to"
at your house, can I?

173
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,360
I guess that's why you say
"I don't want to" and...

174
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,460
"Forget it" only to me.

175
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,500
Did I?

176
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,440
Why do you go to school this early?

177
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,740
What exactly are you avoiding?

178
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,620
Your car. I'm being
careful of your car.

179
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,450
My car?

180
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,559
Please drop me off
by the crosswalk.

181
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,159
No, we'll get out
at the school entrance.

182
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,289
We can't get out together.

183
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,830
There's no one at this hour.

184
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,830
Let's go together just for today.

185
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,029
I won't go to school this early
from tomorrow, so don't worry.

186
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,370
- Still...
- What's that?

187
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,779
I'm sleepy.

188
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,909
I woke up too early because of you.

189
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,450
What do you think you're doing?

190
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,980
Let's get out together later.

191
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,759
You look good in the uniform.

192
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,190
What are you doing?

193
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,289
Don't tie your hair up at school.

194
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,190
Give me back my hair tie.

195
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,429
You look prettier
when you cover up your face more.

196
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,700
Wear your hair like this, okay?

197
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,299
Don't do that.
What if someone sees us?

198
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,169
- Who would see us at this hour?
- Kim Tan?

199
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,110
Upstart, you're also here.

200
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,210
How did you come together?

201
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,480
What are you doing at this hour?

202
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,149
Did you sleep here?

203
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,889
It looks like you came to school
directly from a club.

204
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,889
It somehow ended up like that.

205
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,559
I might wake up from here tomorrow
if my mom knows I didn't go home.

206
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,830
Let's go in.

207
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,129
What?

208
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,840
You stepped on that.

209
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,940
This? It's okay to step on it.

210
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,940
It's fake.

211
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,779
Is it fake? Are you sure
someone didn't die there?

212
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,279
No way. Someone just drew it.

213
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,679
They draw it over and over again
whenever someone erases it.

214
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,379
It's like picking up a fight
in a way.

215
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,990
Who is so passionate?

216
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,190
How would I know?

217
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,019
Maybe it's Joon Young.

218
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,129
Anyway, Upstart,

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,299
have we met before?

220
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,870
You look familiar at this hour.

221
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm not sure.

222
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,740
She doesn't go to clubs.

223
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,940
How would you know that?

224
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,379
Clubs must have certain standards
for their guests.

225
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
What?

226
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,350
She's not bad.
She just has a tacky style.

227
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,750
Gosh...

228
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,090
Hey, you came.

229
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,259
Oh, my. Do you live like this?

230
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,759
The house is amazing.

231
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,330
Really? Does it look nice?

232
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,860
This isn't a house. It's a castle.

233
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,070
How many rooms are there?

234
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,399
This is all worth being called
"Second Madam" in life.

235
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,110
"Second Madam" would be bearable.

236
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,769
I'm just a live-in girlfriend now.

237
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,909
Take a look.
I'll show you around the house.

238
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,679
But is it okay
for me to come here?

239
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,179
Won't the chairman say anything?

240
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,779
The chairman isn't here today.

241
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,990
And I'm not going to walk
on eggshells from now on.

242
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,159
Now that Tan is back,
nothing's going to stop me now.

243
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:54,159
Gosh, Lady. You're persistent.

244
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,330
What did I do?

245
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,759
I wasn't talking to you.

246
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,360
It's Ye Sol's school.

247
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,600
They've sent so many text messages
for the parent meeting.

248
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,669
They call me immediately
when I ignore them.

249
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,399
I should just kick them.

250
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,340
I'm jealous of you, Girl.

251
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:09,539
I can't go there even if I want to.

252
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,440
It will be only exhausting
if you go there.

253
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,980
You have to doll yourself up
from head to toe.

254
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,309
You must let people
see your handbag well.

255
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,190
"What do you do?
What does your husband do?"

256
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,350
They make a fuss doing that.

257
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,519
So what did you say?

258
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,690
What did I say?
I told them I sell drinks.

259
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,629
Are you crazy? Is Ye Sol okay?

260
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:30,830
Don't worry.

261
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,860
It takes one to know one.

262
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,600
I told them I sell drinks,

263
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,840
and they think I run
a mineral water company.

264
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,669
Gosh, Girl. You're fearless.

265
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,169
Life isn't that much of a big deal.

266
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:45,309
Madam, where is your bedroom?

267
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,679
How's thing about the first madam
going?

268
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,850
I forgot about it.

269
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,649
There are no photos of her
that I can use.

270
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,820
She always goes around to see
paintings and buys dishes.

271
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,019
Whenever I think she must be going
on a date, it's just Mr. Yoon.

272
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,360
She doesn't pray, but she's almost
like a Buddhist nun.

273
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,430
Really?

274
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,099
Let's do this then.

275
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,359
Do you have any ideas?

276
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:09,529
Change the target.

277
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,400
Let's put someone
who will become a flaw to...

278
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,839
Won, no, President Kim.

279
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,769
Women are the best way
to lose his father's favor.

280
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,640
Are you sure you're an expert?

281
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:22,579
If the first madam is a Buddhist
nun, Won is a Catholic priest.

282
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,880
What is wrong with everyone?

283
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,480
This house must've been built
on a bad site.

284
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:30,319
Oh, my gosh! Who is that?

285
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,559
Why are you coming out from there?

286
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,660
You're driving me crazy.

287
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,400
Did you hear everything? Again?

288
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,940
Is she the lady
you were talking about?

289
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:49,609
The lady who can't talk?

290
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,680
I can't stand it anymore.

291
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,410
Let's bury this lady today.

292
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,980
The old Han Ki Ae is coming out.

293
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Why? Did she catch you
doing a lot of things?

294
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,819
Are you sure she can't talk?

295
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,059
What?

296
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,099
Oh, my gosh!

297
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,440
How did you know?

298
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,680
From the reflection there.

299
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,140
I see.

300
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,450
You really can't talk, right?

301
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,450
Then when did you lose
the ability to speak?

302
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,130
Forget it. Tell me later.

303
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,500
Get back to work.

304
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:02,410
After I suffered from a fever
when I was three years old.

305
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,819
(JBS New Staff Application)

306
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,220
Sign language? Is sign language
your specialty?

307
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:08,619
Yes.

308
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,519
That's unique. It's usually
"I can speak three languages."

309
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,630
That's one of the many reasons
you should pick me.

310
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,829
I've had a sense
of sacrifice and service...

311
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,859
- You're rejected.
- Why?

312
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,069
Didn't you want to join the club
to buy your uniform?

313
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,769
You're wearing one now.

314
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,740
You said you bought a handbag.
You must have sold it back.

315
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,339
I lied about buying a handbag.

316
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,539
It looked like that.

317
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,380
If you have anything left
to say, say it.

318
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,349
Please pick me.

319
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,920
If you don't, I will take revenge.

320
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,589
What does that mean?

321
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:45,059
Please pick me.

322
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,660
You signed too long for that.

323
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,130
What are you doing?

324
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,400
Don't tell me you're wasting
your time by interviewing her.

325
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,539
No, you can't pick her, Hyo Shin.

326
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,869
- What is your reason?
- She's my boyfriend's best friend.

327
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,339
Men and women can't be friends.

328
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,509
You can't pick her.

329
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,240
That's a pity.
I like a love triangle.

330
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,339
Hyo Shin!

331
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,049
Why did you come here?

332
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,420
Hello.

333
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,490
Hyo Shin, I'm here
for the interview.

334
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,190
You got it.
Hyo Shin, let's pick her.

335
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,920
Cha Eun Sang, you're the next
producer to be with JBS.

336
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,089
Congratulations.

337
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,750
Hey.

338
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,299
So? Did Eun Sang join
the broadcasting club?

339
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,670
I don't know.
Hyo Shin will take care of it.

340
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,710
Say "Ah".

341
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,380
Are you on a diet again?

342
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,940
No, I'm eating this for my brain.

343
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,180
A mock test's coming soon.

344
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,750
Gosh, that's so admirable.

345
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,779
What does that mean?
Why do you think I'm like Kim Tan?

346
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,220
Is the world all about
Kim Tan for you...

347
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,019
to hear "admirable" as "Kim Tan"?

348
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,990
I dated him for a short time.
I was too young then.

349
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,490
You're still not over him.

350
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,430
What are you talking about?
We just held hands.

351
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,700
- It's true.
- Is it true?

352
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,759
I swear.

353
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:36,930
By the way, did Kim Tan tell you
that he and I used to date?

354
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,200
No, Rachel told me.

355
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,569
But I'm a little upset because
I just found out you held hands.

356
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,869
You didn't know that we held hands!

357
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,740
What? Rachel told you?

358
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,950
Kim Tan is Lee Bo Na's ex-boyfriend,
and I'm your current boyfriend.

359
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,279
She introduced me like that.

360
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,819
Rachel, that crazy...

361
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,119
I'm sorry. My usual language
just popped out.

362
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,119
You can also call me
crazy beforehand.

363
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,690
- Why?
- Don't tell kids that...

364
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,059
Eun Sang is
on a welfare scholarship.

365
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,960
That's ridiculous.
Why should I do that?

366
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,500
Because I trust you.

367
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,069
No, don't trust me.

368
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:10,430
The past is the past,
but I still don't like Eun Sang.

369
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,500
I will get going now.

370
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,579
(October 16, 2009, Tan and Young Do)

371
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,250
Why are you here?
What about Myung Soo?

372
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,450
He went outside for a moment
because he missed his mom.

373
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,079
She's nearby.

374
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,950
What are you doing?

375
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,789
I'm thinking about the old days.

376
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,900
How long have you been dating Bo Na?

377
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,000
A year and a half? What stage
are you in with Eun Sang?

378
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,500
I'm about to confess
my feelings for her.

379
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,039
You've been friends
for half of your life.

380
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,769
Nothing's happened between you two?

381
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:49,809
What are you talking about?

382
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:52,509
Was there any attraction
or feelings for her?

383
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,640
What if there was?

384
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:57,779
Right. Of course, there was.

385
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,950
When?

386
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,019
When I was about nine years old.

387
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,289
Eun Sang was taller than me then.

388
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,720
So she beat up the kids
who bullied me half-dead.

389
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,930
My heart fluttered so much.

390
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,599
Is that really it?

391
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,359
Why did you hold my Bo Na's hand?

392
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,799
- Because I was cold.
- Is that it?

393
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,670
Bo Na was stronger than me then.

394
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,910
Bye.

395
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,950
(October 16, 2009, Tan and Young Do)

396
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,119
What brings you here?

397
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,130
Didn't you leave for good?

398
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,900
It would be less embarrassing
if you tried to hide how you feel.

399
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,029
I'm so dumbfounded since you said
what you were really thinking.

400
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,200
I was like that
because I was glad to see you.

401
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,940
What did you just say?

402
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:00,440
I'm going to live in another place
for a while.

403
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,849
I came to tell you that
in case you would worry.

404
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:09,549
But you're living
somewhere else lately.

405
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,619
I had a place to come back
until now,

406
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,759
but I don't have one anymore.

407
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,359
I thought you'd deal with this in a
smarter and more sophisticated way.

408
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,829
Bringing Tan to the company wasn't
a smart and sophisticated way too.

409
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:23,630
Tan is only 18 years old.

410
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,500
Do you only amount to that much?

411
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,410
I was only six years old
when mom passed away.

412
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,180
And I was only 12 years old when
I had to welcome a stepbrother...

413
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,509
as well as a stepmother.

414
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:40,880
I know that I will lose more
than I gain.

415
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,890
But it's not like I don't have
anything to gain at all.

416
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:45,259
Because someone will get hurt.

417
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,819
That someone's wounds...

418
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,559
will be a comfort to me.

419
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,000
Do you even have any idea
what you will lose?

420
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,400
No, but...

421
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,599
I will lose them if I have to.

422
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,839
I'll get going now.

423
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,150
Won.

424
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,690
Are you back for good?

425
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:23,259
Are you and your mom
curious about that most?

426
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,630
Get out. You're bothering me.

427
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,640
Can't we live together...

428
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,440
regardless of whether
we hate each other or not?

429
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,539
Only real families do that.

430
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,279
Don't you feel bad...

431
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,680
when you talk to me like that?

432
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,349
I do. But you feel bad too.

433
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,619
That's enough for me.

434
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:56,289
- Step aside.
- Won.

435
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,789
I told you to step aside.

436
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,160
How could you do this?

437
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,799
How could you leave home
just because I'm back?

438
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,670
It's because you keep following
me around.

439
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,670
- What?
- You came to my hotel...

440
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,839
and the company.

441
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,369
If you keep following me around
like a seven-year-old,

442
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,910
I have nowhere to hide from you.

443
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,480
How could I do this?

444
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,420
Don't you think you're taking
away places I can stay at?

445
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,190
Or should I go to the US this time?

446
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,759
When will you grow up?

447
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,430
I can't fight with
a high school student, right?

448
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,829
Please grow up quickly.

449
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,569
I'm sorry for turning up
at the hotel unannounced.

450
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,700
I'm also sorry for going
to the company.

451
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,069
It's also my fault...

452
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,140
to come back from the US.

453
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:24,910
It's all my fault, so stay home.

454
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,950
Won.

455
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Let go.

456
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:34,059
How dare you grab me?

457
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:36,289
Am I not even allowed to touch you
like this?

458
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,829
I know I may be out of line,

459
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:43,930
but I understand you.

460
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,440
You understand me?

461
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,500
Are you mocking me right now?

462
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,670
Who are you to understand me?

463
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,609
You courageously came back, but
you don't have the courage to fight?

464
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,910
How dare you...

465
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,279
I'm not going to fight with you.

466
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,150
It's obvious that I will lose.

467
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,849
How could I win a fight
when I'm not...

468
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,319
even serious about it?

469
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,930
- So...
- I don't know who you take after,

470
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,069
but you're really noisy.

471
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,670
- Are you coming home now?
- Oh, my gosh!

472
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,470
Hello.

473
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,079
Are you rebelling against me?

474
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,180
Since your mother might come out,
I will get going now.

475
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,650
You're talking nonsense. Stop there.

476
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,150
- Why?
- Why aren't you giving...

477
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,289
my dream catcher back?

478
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,019
You didn't even say thank you.

479
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,230
I like it when the left hand
recognizes what the right hand did.

480
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,789
Bring it to the wine cellar.

481
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,059
Right now. Do you understand?

482
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,579
(Connecting)

483
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:57,470
Thank you for this.

484
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,700
This is kind of surprising.

485
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,910
I had nightmares right away
without it.

486
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,240
You're lying.

487
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:09,380
I turned music on. Just listen
to one song before you go.

488
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:17,650
I will because you chose
a good song.

489
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,259
Do you like this song?
You played this song before.

490
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,829
Yes, someone who I passionately
liked used to like this song.

491
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:30,599
Have you dated someone before?

492
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,369
When? Before going to the US?

493
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:35,539
What was the punk like?

494
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:36,940
I didn't say it was a boy.

495
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,740
You didn't date then.

496
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:42,380
So who is it?

497
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,279
My sister.

498
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,390
Do you still want to go to the US?

499
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,190
I didn't really want
to go to the US.

500
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,859
It didn't matter as long as
it wasn't Korea.

501
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,190
So?

502
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,400
Is Korea good enough to live
after you came back?

503
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,400
It's the same. I'm always
doing part-time jobs.

504
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,369
Transferring the school was
quite a shock to me.

505
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:08,640
I became unhappier thanks to that.

506
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:12,579
Tell me when you need my help.

507
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:16,279
That's okay. I'll just accept
your thoughts.

508
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,680
Who said I would give them to you?

509
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,119
What does it feel like to be born
as the son of Jeguk Group?

510
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,660
It feels like
I can't call my mother "Mother",

511
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,890
and I can't call
my brother "Brother".

512
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,200
I guess most young masters
from rich families are like that.

513
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,900
I didn't know you'd hold grudges.

514
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,900
Can I also ask you something?

515
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,170
- No.
- You didn't even hear the question.

516
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:42,539
Your questions were
always dangerous.

517
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,910
I enjoyed listening to this song.
Good night.

518
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,329
But even the first verse
hasn't ended.

519
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:15,440
Do I...

520
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,740
like you?

521
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,380
Cha Eun Sang.

522
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,980
Did I...

523
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,150
miss you?

524
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,579
(Jeguk High School)

525
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:00,049
- I told you to leave.
- How can we wait for that?

526
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,720
- Be quiet.
- But the class will begin soon.

527
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,920
What is it? Is it Young Do again?

528
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,259
- Go in a little later.
- You go in a little later.

529
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,559
Choi Young Do, did you rent
this school out?

530
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,400
Even if you did, this school
belongs to Kim Tan.

531
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Who are you to tell
everyone to leave?

532
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,900
I had to find something out
from Upstart.

533
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:24,710
Don't be nervous.

534
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,049
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

535
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,079
You have come at a good time.

536
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,059
You psycho, are you crazy?

537
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,160
Can you see this?

538
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:01,680
Take a look.

539
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,579
You never spent money
for real before.

540
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,349
You're not an upstart, are you?

541
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,989
Lee Bo Na.

542
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,730
Is she really an upstart?

543
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,530
I heard that you know
a little about her.

544
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,000
I don't know. You're so childish.
What does that matter to you?

545
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,199
It matters to me.

546
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,510
If she pretended to be an upstart
when she's on a welfare scholarship,

547
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:35,110
she deceived the entire school.
How could that not matter to me?

548
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,050
Everyone is a victim then.

549
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:38,820
Isn't that right?

550
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,389
Can you just leave if you have
no intention to apologize?

551
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,300
Will it be too rude to ask you...

552
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,530
what makes you so cheeky?

553
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,840
Step aside.

554
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:01,900
Bo Na, what's wrong?

555
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:04,809
What happened?

556
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,039
Chan Young, Choi Young Do
finally went crazy.

557
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,880
You keep disturbing everyone
preparing for class.

558
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,289
You're starting to annoy me.

559
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,630
How come there are so many guys
willing to help you?

560
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,559
It's making me feel competitive.

561
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,900
I will go astray that way.

562
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,880
Are both of you okay?
Let's clean up quickly.

563
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,980
It's so annoying.

564
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,349
What am I doing because of you?

565
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:54,389
Thank you, Bo Na.

566
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:56,929
I hate you the most.

567
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:01,929
I'll do it. Help Bo Na.

568
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,650
This is big news.

569
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,360
Choi Young Do turned the Upstart's
bag inside out next door...

570
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,690
asking if she's really an upstart.

571
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,489
- When?
- Just now.

572
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,760
He was quiet for a few days,
and now he's starting again.

573
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,599
All right, everyone.

574
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,230
Take your seats, please.
Class has begun.

575
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,639
Everybody have your books ready.

576
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:41,000
Very good.

577
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,909
Everyone please turn to
page 1, 0, 9, 109.

578
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
"Beyond Your Dreams".

579
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,320
Today we will be discussing dreams.
Dreams in history...

580
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,920
are visions of the future.

581
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,690
Ways to predict what will happen.

582
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,730
No way, it couldn't be.

583
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,300
(Complaint)

584
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,639
(Accuser, Choi Young Do)

585
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,340
(The accuser sues the accused
for assault, so please punish him.)

586
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,179
Please drop the charge.

587
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:57,579
Come on. Don't give in so easily.
You're disappointing me.

588
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:00,349
Did you hit me without
even thinking through this much?

589
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,289
How nice did you think I was?

590
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Please.

591
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,699
I got three weeks of
medical treatment.

592
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:17,170
I was in so much pain.

593
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,300
Tears were pouring
because I was so sad.

594
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:22,940
I'm sorry.

595
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,139
Please drop the charge. Please...

596
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,650
How could I do that when I was hit?

597
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,619
So my friend,

598
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:39,889
take this back and spend a lot
of money to get a good lawyer.

599
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,329
I'll do anything you want.

600
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,059
You're making me get soft-hearted.

601
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:53,739
Then... I can't guarantee you
that it will work,

602
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:56,070
but will you go on your knees?

603
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,150
Who knows? My mind might change.

604
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:10,989
(Complaint)

605
00:39:57,869 --> 00:39:59,900
Hey, stand up.

606
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:03,210
It's none of your business.

607
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,309
- Stand up.
- Don't pretend to be nice.

608
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,079
Because you are not.

609
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
You're no different
from Choi Young Do.

610
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,550
As I expected,
our Joon Young is so smart.

611
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,750
By any chance,

612
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,289
did I bully you in the past?

613
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:23,730
Choi Young Do at least
remembered it.

614
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,800
I'm sorry.

615
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,730
I'll repay you like this instead.

616
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,880
I also hit you, so you should
make me go on my knees too.

617
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,550
Can I do that?

618
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,719
I'm looking forward to it.

619
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,820
How would I be feeling then?

620
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:00,800
What are you doing?
Who is fighting?

621
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

622
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,710
What are you doing?

623
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:21,019
Don't you have to go
to the hospital? Doesn't it hurt?

624
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:23,690
This could happen between friends,

625
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,360
but my heart is so broken.

626
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,989
I'm so sorry.

627
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:31,659
Your father will be upset
if he sees this.

628
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,500
I won't sue him, so don't worry.

629
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:37,300
That's not what I meant.

630
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:40,199
I'm apologizing as Tan's mother
right now.

631
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,909
You've just transferred here,
and you're already causing trouble?

632
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,880
Did you have to do this
as soon as you came?

633
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,610
Have you forgotten
about the promise we made?

634
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:50,849
I'm sorry.

635
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:52,550
If you're going to be like this,
transfer to another school.

636
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:54,480
I warned you,
and you made a promise.

637
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,119
What more should I do about you?

638
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,519
Who should I tell this
to make you scared?

639
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,289
Should I tell your brother?

640
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:02,860
I'm okay, ma'am.

641
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,190
Don't be too harsh on Tan.

642
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,940
Your mother also recommended it.

643
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,280
You should consider transferring.

644
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,849
Wouldn't it be right for the person
embarrassed from getting hit to go?

645
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,190
Are you disregarding her
since she's not your real mother?

646
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,329
Just go...

647
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,869
before your right side
also gets beaten.

648
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,030
I'm waiting for that.

649
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,940
The chance that I don't have
to hold back anymore.

650
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,739
Do you want to hit me once more?

651
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,340
I think there will be
another chance.

652
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,800
(Kim Tan)

653
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,369
(Choi Young Do)

654
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,010
Choi Young Do.

655
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,139
Why are you avoiding me?

656
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,480
I'm not avoiding you.

657
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,280
Is it because the thing
we saw the other day?

658
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:32,179
Because you're embarrassed?

659
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,650
What about the other day?

660
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,690
What did we see?

661
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,690
Choi Young Do.

662
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:41,659
That's not embarrassing.

663
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,730
It's just hurtful.

664
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,860
What do you know?

665
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:46,659
Everyone has a secret like that.

666
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,860
It's also the same for me.

667
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,530
To tell you the truth,

668
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,469
I'm not the chief director's son.

669
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,510
What?

670
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,940
My real mom is a different person.

671
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,579
You're the first person
I'm telling about this.

672
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:04,909
Are you the son of a mistress?

673
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,750
So...

674
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:13,159
if a child is born between my dad
and the woman we saw yesterday...

675
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,989
You're just like the child,
aren't you?

676
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,820
I heard that Tan beat Young Do up.

677
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:46,019
What a pity. I didn't see that.

678
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:48,489
You should say it properly.
Young Do wasn't hit, he blocked Tan.

679
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:51,690
Why don't you just say that
Young Do's jaw hit Tan's fist?

680
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,230
You should stop hanging around
with Young Do.

681
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,829
You really won't be able to go
to college later.

682
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:57,030
You should hate the crime
within legal boundaries.

683
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,230
You shouldn't hate the person.

684
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,940
Isn't Young Do the victim this time?

685
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,400
Are you taking
Choi Young Do's side...

686
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,739
after I suffered like that?

687
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:04,170
You're subtly taking Kim Tan's side.

688
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,309
Old affection is scary.

689
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:08,179
I don't have any old affection
toward Kim Tan.

690
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:10,550
- Be quiet.
- Who cares if she hears it?

691
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,750
Do we have to walk on eggshells
around Kim Tan's fiancee?

692
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:13,949
Hey, Yoo Rachel.

693
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,889
Do you have something to say?

694
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:18,949
Don't you have anything to say?

695
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,559
You should go first. I'll catch up.

696
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:29,570
In the US, you told Chan Yong about
me dating Kim Tan, didn't you?

697
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,500
- So?
- How dare you say "So?"

698
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:34,670
What right do you have to babble
about someone else's past?

699
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,469
It's not like I made it up.
You should've...

700
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:38,469
taken care of your boyfriend
in the first place.

701
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:40,409
Why did you let him
flirt with another girl?

702
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:44,480
I already took care of that issue
with Chan Young.

703
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,320
I rather think there's something
between Tan and Eun Sang.

704
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,619
Considering the circumstances.

705
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:51,289
I have a lot of things that are
making me mad apart from you.

706
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:53,360
I'm helping you accumulate
your anger more.

707
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,320
I'll repay you
when everything is over.

708
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:58,630
That's funny.

709
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,340
Why did you come here in person?

710
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:09,840
I had an appointment near here,
and I felt guilty to just leave.

711
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,170
Your second marriage must not be
included in your guilt.

712
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,010
Don't make me regret coming here.

713
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:18,380
Isn't that Tan?

714
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,480
Don't do that.

715
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:23,889
That punk.

716
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:26,619
He came back to Korea,
but never came by to say hello.

717
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:33,659
It's been a long time, right?

718
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:34,929
How have you been?

719
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:39,599
You came back quite a while ago. You
should've visited me to say hello.

720
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,369
I've been busy with several things.

721
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:42,369
Is that so?

722
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:43,869
We should still have
a meal together.

723
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:57,389
That punk never says
something he doesn't mean.

724
00:46:58,389 --> 00:47:00,659
Well, that's better
than being embarrassed.

725
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,889
Tan hit Young Do today.

726
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,590
What? Why?

727
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,159
Why? Because he did
something to deserve it.

728
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,599
And I'm pretty sure Young Do
takes after his dad.

729
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:14,369
One thing is clear. My fiance is
better than yours.

730
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,909
Get out. I'm not going with you.

731
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,710
Why did you come
in the first place then?

732
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,519
Young Do hasn't arrived yet.

733
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:30,750
Could you contact me when he comes?

734
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,920
I'll be in the lounge.

735
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,090
Okay.

736
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,489
And Manager,

737
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,429
CEO Kim Won of
Jeguk Group stays here, right?

738
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:39,059
Yes, that's right.

739
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:42,429
I come here often, but I think I've
been too indifferent to my in-laws.

740
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:47,400
Could you tell me the phone number
of Jeguk Group's chief secretary?

741
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,769
(Lee Esther)

742
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:56,139
This is Yoon Jae Ho.

743
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,579
This really is your number. It's me.

744
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,719
I must be more desperate one
between the two of us.

745
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:03,650
Do you think that's true?

746
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:05,550
Don't act ambiguously.

747
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,820
I got this number after
a lot of determination.

748
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,030
I'm giving you a chance to think
more about whether it's worth it.

749
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,360
I'll call you later.

750
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:15,000
Are you going to hang up now?

751
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,570
I'm going to hang up.

752
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,780
Thank you.

753
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,679
Are you dating these days?

754
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,420
It's close to an affair.

755
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,989
Even after watching me? Just stop.

756
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,360
Okay, let's hear things
that will make my head hurt now.

757
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:44,630
Report them to me.

758
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,860
Yes.

759
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,699
CEO Lee Esther of
RS International...

760
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:53,800
currently owns 1.4 percent
of Jeguk Group's shares.

761
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:56,269
She inherited 1.2 percent,

762
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:58,440
and bought 850,000 more shares...

763
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,710
when Tan and Rachel got engaged.

764
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,110
She also owns
Hotel Zeus shares, right?

765
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,110
Yes.

766
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,179
She owns 1.1 percent,
so she already has a voting right...

767
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:08,050
at the general shareholders meeting.

768
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:11,050
After she marries Hotel Zeus
CEO Choi Dong Wook,

769
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,190
she will own 3.4 percent
of Hotel Zeus shares...

770
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,119
and 1.8 percent
of Jeguk Group shares.

771
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,659
She will own 1.8 percent...

772
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,960
Do you think this marriage
will really happen?

773
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:26,269
Since it's not a love marriage,

774
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,699
I think it will happen.

775
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:30,170
Is that so?

776
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:01,269
That's definitely
our company envelope. Who is he?

777
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,940
We studied exactly up
to where I folded the page.

778
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,409
This is the range where
the final exam will cover.

779
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:11,650
It will also help you
if you study this.

780
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,550
Thank you.

781
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,849
(Don't Receive)

782
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,920
What would I have done without you?

783
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,260
Who is "Don't Receive"?

784
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:23,760
I also have a secret, Friend.

785
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,030
Hurry up and go.
Bo Na will lose her temper.

786
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,929
Bo Na doesn't lose her temper.
She's just being cute.

787
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,570
Gosh, you're a fool for her.

788
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,630
I'll get going.

789
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,500
- Call if you don't know something.
- Okay.

790
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,179
(Don't Receive)

791
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,320
- Why?
- I want to eat jjajangmyeon,

792
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,079
but they won't deliver one dish.

793
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,489
- What?
- Why don't you come here...

794
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:51,719
and eat jjajangmyeon with me?

795
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,920
Order two dishes and just eat one.
You're rich.

796
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:57,530
How could you throw away food
when the economy is bad?

797
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,860
Find someone else.
Why would I go there?

798
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,030
You'll end up coming.

799
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,570
Haven't you met Joon Young yet?

800
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,010
I told him...

801
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,670
that if he makes you come here,

802
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,110
I might drop the charge.

803
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:18,079
You punk! How could you...

804
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,280
I'm going to hang up.

805
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:26,960
Hey...

806
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:31,690
I'm sorry, but...

807
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,059
I'm really sorry, but...

808
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:47,510
What is your intention
of playing with me?

809
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,820
Intention?

810
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,619
You're not even going to
really drop the charge.

811
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,159
Why are you playing with people?

812
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,059
Joon Young came to me looking like
he was about to die...

813
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:05,059
to ask me a favor.

814
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,960
You might be just playing,
but to him...

815
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,230
Who said I was just playing?

816
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:12,769
Are you really going to drop
the charge then?

817
00:52:12,769 --> 00:52:13,769
Yes.

818
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:15,900
- Why?
- Because you came.

819
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,809
What changes if I come?

820
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:19,110
My mind will change.

821
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,179
Why does it change?

822
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:23,780
It's something like, "You became
a flower after coming to me."

823
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:26,480
I'm not in the mood to joke.

824
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,949
Do you think
everything I do is a joke?

825
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,389
Don't you like flowers?

826
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:35,619
Do you dislike the part "flower"
or "coming to me"?

827
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,460
Pick one. I'll make you do
the part you dislike more.

828
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,760
I dislike both.

829
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,360
Gosh, I got dumped.

830
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:44,630
I'm going to take revenge.

831
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,190
Why aren't you answering my calls?

832
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:10,690
I'm in the middle of a meal
with an important guest.

833
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,159
You said you'd take care of it.

834
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,300
But why are we taking
a photo on the weekend?

835
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,900
I said I'm with a guest.

836
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,900
A guest? Who?

837
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:27,710
What kind of situation is this?

838
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,250
Don't be curious.
I'm not going to let you join us.

839
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,449
I also have no intention
to stay longer.

840
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,949
Anyway, take care
of the photo thing properly.

841
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,150
I'm not doing anything about it
because of you.

842
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,489
You never cease to surprise me.

843
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:00,139
Please drop the charge.

844
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:02,480
I can go since
you're done eating, right?

845
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,809
Where are you going?

846
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,480
To work?

847
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:21,329
It's me.

848
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,469
Do you know where Chan Eun Sang is
and who she is with?

849
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,699
- How would I know that?
- Do you want me to tell you?

850
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,170
Didn't you call to tell me?

851
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,739
Cha Eun Sang is in the suite
at Choi Young Do's hotel.

852
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:31,969
She's eating with Choi Young Do
alone.

853
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,210
I'm going to hang up.

854
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:46,989
The person
you're calling cannot...

855
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:23,889
Announcement for the
Jeguk High School parent meeting.

856
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,630
There's a parent meeting
next Wednesday at 2pm.

857
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,429
I'm Chan Eun Sang's mom.

858
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:35,570
I'm sorry, but due to
unavoidable circumstances...

859
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,809
What is it?

860
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:45,250
Both you and I can't go
to our kid's school.

861
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,780
Our lives are so sad.

862
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,619
I'll be out for a moment.

863
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,389
Where are you going at this hour?

864
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,449
Come on out.

865
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,179
Why? Did something happen?

866
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,750
Why didn't you answer my calls?

867
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,090
Can't you see that I'm working
right now?

868
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,559
Did you go to Young Do's hotel?

869
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:30,989
Gosh, Rachel.

870
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:32,130
Did you go there?

871
00:56:32,929 --> 00:56:34,599
Does that hotel belong to
Young Do's family?

872
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,059
Are you crazy?

873
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,429
Why would you go there?

874
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:40,400
I even went to your house
in the US...

875
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,239
when you could've been
a drug dealer.

876
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,610
I don't do stupid things.

877
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,269
That's being stupid.

878
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,679
How could you trust me
and follow me?

879
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,309
Something bad could've happened.

880
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,710
Because you'd never do
something to me.

881
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:55,579
How do you know
whether I would or not?

882
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:00,460
Why did you go to Young Do's hotel?

883
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:02,889
Because of Joon Young.

884
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:06,329
Choi Young Do said he would drop
the charge if I went there.

885
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,530
- Did you believe that?
- I didn't, but what could I do...

886
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,000
when a friend came to me and
desperately asked for a favor?

887
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,940
How is he your friend?

888
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,239
You've met him
just a couple of times.

889
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,309
He knew that I am on
a welfare scholarship.

890
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:22,940
He even knew what my mom does.

891
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:25,949
But he still kept my secret.
How could I not go?

892
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:27,980
He's going to transfer soon anyway.

893
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:31,250
How many times did I tell you
not to be involved in such a thing?

894
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,320
You want to pretend
to be nice that badly?

895
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,030
Why is Choi Young Do
bullying me in the first place?

896
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:41,329
It's because of you.

897
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:42,599
That's why I'm like this.

898
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,070
I'm afraid something might happen
to you because of me.

899
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:49,300
I'm asking you.

900
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,539
Can you please not do things
that will bother me?

901
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,909
Can't you just stay low?

902
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:56,949
Why don't you leave me alone?

903
00:57:58,449 --> 00:58:01,050
My life is already so hard as it is.

904
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,079
But I got on Young Do's bad side
for some reason,

905
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,650
and I'm getting more
uncomfortable with you.

906
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,389
I'm not asking for something big.

907
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:09,420
I just want to graduate safely...

908
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,789
and live a better life when I'm 20,
even if it's just a little better.

909
00:58:14,059 --> 00:58:16,199
But I really don't know
what to do now.

910
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,340
Should I tell you
what you should do?

911
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,539
Get out of my house tomorrow.

912
00:58:27,139 --> 00:58:28,579
- What?
- You can't get out?

913
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:30,480
Do you also want to continue
going to school?

914
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,750
Then start liking me from now on.

915
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:34,420
If possible, sincerely.

916
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:39,050
I caught feelings for you.

917
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,219
I said I like Cha Eun Sang.

918
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,719
So? What do you want me to do
about it?

919
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:16,719
Do we look good together?

920
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,030
Why are you asking
such an ugly question?

921
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,230
We look good together.

922
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,030
If you behave like that,

923
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:23,159
you and your mom can't stay
in this house.

924
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:24,530
- Sit down.
- What is the meaning of...

925
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,530
making me sit here?

926
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,099
Stand up. I told you to stand up.

927
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:28,840
What is wrong
with your table manners?

928
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,000
You punk!

929
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:39,980
(The Heirs)
