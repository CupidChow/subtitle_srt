(Episode 8)

4
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,000
Why didn't you answer my calls?

5
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,200
Can't you see that I'm working
right now?

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,710
Did you go to Young Do's hotel?

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,539
Gosh, Rachel.

8
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:36,539
Did you go there?

9
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,740
Does that hotel belong to
Young Do's family?

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,780
Are you crazy?

11
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,009
Why would you go there?

12
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,950
I even went to your house
in the US...

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,820
when you could've been
a drug dealer.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,789
I don't do stupid things.

15
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,649
That's being stupid.

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,560
How could you trust me
and follow me?

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,359
Something bad could've happened.

18
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,490
Because you'd never do
something to me.

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,530
How do you know
whether I would or not?

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,130
Why did you go to Young Do's hotel?

21
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,599
Because of Joon Young.

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,810
Choi Young Do said he would drop
the charge if I went there.

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,879
He's going to transfer soon anyway.

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,950
How many times did I tell you
not to be involved in such a thing?

25
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,379
Why is Choi Young Do
bullying me in the first place?

26
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,719
It's because of you.

27
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,849
That's why I'm like this.

28
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,819
I'm afraid something might happen
to you because of me.

29
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:26,689
I'm asking you.

30
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,930
Can you please not do things
that will bother me?

31
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,400
Can't you just stay low?

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,269
Why don't you leave me alone?

33
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,140
My life is already so hard as it is.

34
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,370
But I got on Young Do's bad side
for some reason,

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,109
and I'm getting more
uncomfortable with you.

36
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,780
I'm not asking for something big.

37
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,810
I just want to graduate safely...

38
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,280
and live a better life when I'm 20,
even if it's just a little better.

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,650
But I really don't know
what to do now.

40
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,689
Should I tell you
what you should do?

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,989
Get out of my house tomorrow.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,930
- What?
- You can't get out?

43
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,930
Do you also want to continue
going to school?

44
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,129
Then start liking me from now on.

45
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,800
If possible, sincerely.

46
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,610
I caught feelings for you.

47
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,900
So I'm going to actively interfere
with your business at school...

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,270
and invade your private life.

49
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,569
Do you really have nothing
better to do?

50
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,509
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

51
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,710
You heard everything.
You can't pretend to not hear it.

52
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,180
- I need to go back inside.
- Give me an answer before you go.

53
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,590
(Father)

54
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,129
(Madam)

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,900
- Don't answer it.
- It's your mother.

56
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,900
Don't answer it.

57
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,770
It may be okay for you,
but not for me.

58
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,810
That's the difference between us,
and it's also my answer.

59
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,819
Mom, it's me.

60
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm talking about
something important with her.

61
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,150
I'll call you later.

62
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,360
- Hey.
- We can reduce differences.

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,659
You should answer again.

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,990
- Give me my phone.
- Answer me.

65
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,330
I have no idea
what you're talking about right now.

66
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,000
You should like me from now on.
I caught feelings for you.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,270
What part is hard to understand?

68
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,800
- Give me my phone.
- If you answer me.

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,539
Give me my phone. Give it to me.

70
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,569
I still have a lot left
to pay for it,

71
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,509
and it's really expensive to me.

72
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,449
I have to text my mom with that,

73
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,349
and contact the restaurant
that I work at.

74
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,889
Give me back my phone!

75
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,659
Will you think I'm crazy
if I hug you right now?

76
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,189
Stop it!

77
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
Don't cry.

78
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,819
Don't say that you don't like me.

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,689
Tell me that you'll think about it.

80
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,060
Please.

81
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,459
Answer me! What was that call?

82
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,759
Why did you answer her phone?

83
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,389
We were together.

84
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:25,199
Were you together? Why?

85
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,860
Why would you be with her?

86
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,399
I went to see her
because I had to ask for a favor.

87
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,740
What kind of favor?

88
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,800
Why would you ask her for a favor?

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,670
I hit someone at school.

90
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,610
I asked her not to tell you.

91
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,980
What? Who did you hit?

92
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,649
Is that kid richer than us?

93
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,449
Aren't you curious about
why I hit him?

94
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,050
Does that come first?

95
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,519
Father must already know about it.
He called me.

96
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,860
Of course, he does.

97
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:54,259
The chief director's never quiet
when it's about your fault.

98
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,189
So why do you keep
causing trouble?

99
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,529
I'm going to Father's study.

100
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,629
Tell him that it's completely
your fault and beg.

101
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,910
Where are you right now?

102
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,449
What is this? Are you exercising
your right to remain silent?

103
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,149
Just tell me who he hit.

104
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,990
I'm sorry, but I think
you should hear it from him.

105
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,459
I'm doing this because
I can't hear it from him.

106
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,889
Didn't I tell you to report
what Tan is doing to me?

107
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,800
Who did he hit? Whose son is he?

108
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,670
That's enough. I get it.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,300
What was that call earlier?

110
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,040
How dare you make Tan
go to where you are?

111
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,810
Do you think Tan and you meeting
outside separately makes sense?

112
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,550
If you behave like that,

113
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,079
you and your mom can't stay
in this house.

114
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,220
Do you understand?

115
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,290
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,430
So, you hit CEO Choi's son?

117
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,069
Yes.

118
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,069
Why?

119
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,269
Father, this kind of attention is...

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,579
too late now.

121
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,350
I did worse things
before I went to the US...

122
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,920
as well as while I was there.

123
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,449
But you weren't interested.

124
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:29,350
Whenever I called you,
you hung up saying you were busy.

125
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,990
The company will run properly
when I'm busy.

126
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,560
Thanks to that, Won and I...

127
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,560
will receive more inheritance
than your attention.

128
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:42,399
- If you're done talking...
- Your mom is...

129
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,800
the chair director of your school.

130
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:48,910
Don't ever do something
that might be on everyone's lips.

131
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,579
The chair director is not my mom.

132
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,180
Your live-in girlfriend is my mom.

133
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,850
Good night.

134
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:19,639
Why are you coming out from there?

135
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,540
Did mom say something to you?

136
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,509
She can say something
in this situation.

137
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,209
What did she say?

138
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,310
I'm asking you.

139
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:29,509
Please don't talk to me
when we're home.

140
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,920
I don't want to get into a mess.

141
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,720
Cha Eun Sang.

142
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Hey.

143
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,039
What did my mom say?

144
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:56,809
Will you accept it
if I apologize on her behalf?

145
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,480
Can you just go? I'm nervous
that your mother might come out.

146
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,950
Are you sure that you're nervous?

147
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,320
Isn't your heart fluttering
because you're with me?

148
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,049
I'm not in the mood to joke.

149
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,519
Let me joke at least.

150
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,220
I want to make you feel better.

151
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,759
Just go.

152
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,330
Why do you keep telling me to go?

153
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,929
This is my house.

154
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,570
Okay, I'll go then.

155
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,799
That's also part of my house.

156
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,139
No matter where you go,
most of them will also be my house.

157
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,909
Do you know how happy I am
to have you in my house?

158
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,779
Good night.

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,850
(Alarm)

164
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,620
(Eun Sang)

165
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,220
"Just like we're living together."

166
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,690
Good night.

167
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:43,009
(Jeguk High School)

168
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,919
Did you sleep well?

169
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,450
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

170
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,820
I told you. I'm going to invade
your private life now.

171
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:00,559
I was also serious about actively
interfering with your business.

172
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,000
I think I asked if you had
nothing else to do better.

173
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,840
- I didn't hear it.
- You did.

174
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I don't remember.

175
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,879
Is that your breakfast?

176
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,049
I don't think one will be enough.

177
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,389
I'll get going since I saw you come.

178
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,320
Why? Did you think
I wouldn't come to school?

179
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,090
I had all kinds of thoughts
all night.

180
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,929
Let's see each other when we can
during breaks.

181
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,769
And listen to your teachers well.

182
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,679
What is the urgent schedule?

183
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,850
The CEO of Hotel Zeus called
last night...

184
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,919
to ask about having breakfast today.

185
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,019
I have to give him an answer
within 10 minutes.

186
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,519
Does he think I'm his friend
that he can ask...

187
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,690
to have breakfast with him
the night before?

188
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,960
Tell him I don't eat anymore.

189
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,059
How about meeting him
when he calls you first?

190
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,799
Why should I do that?

191
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,039
A situation might occur where
we will have to ask him to meet us.

192
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,309
What are you talking about?

193
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,840
Did something happen to
JG Convention?

194
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,409
JG Convention Jeju will become
the landmark of Jeju Island.

195
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,549
Since it's a big project where
two billion dollars is invested...

196
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:33,980
Did everyone have breakfast?

197
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,190
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

198
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,090
I didn't.

199
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,889
Let's just cut to the chase
so I can eat breakfast.

200
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,330
What is the problem?

201
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,470
Union Hotel, which was supposed to
rent 30th to 50th floor on a lease,

202
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,100
has demanded to change...

203
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,470
the conditions
to an investment contract.

204
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,210
So are you saying that
all 20 floors are about to be empty?

205
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,269
There are at least 400 rooms.

206
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,279
Since an entire hotel was
about to rent the floors,

207
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,340
we need an alternative plan...

208
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,480
Does anyone owe
Union Hotel money?

209
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,549
What makes them fearless
enough to demand this?

210
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,019
We think the China deal
went through for them.

211
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,889
The exclusion of Hotel Zeus
from the initial candidate group...

212
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,289
also seems to be one of the reasons.

213
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:16,190
They betrayed us as soon as they
got a rich Chinese boyfriend.

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,529
Expand the scope including...

215
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,500
Hotel Zeus and other foreign chains
planning to enter Korea...

216
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,299
and reexamine all of the candidates.

217
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,039
What about the breakfast
you canceled today?

218
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,139
Let's play hard to get
until they contact us again.

219
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,279
They will become polite
once they get desperate.

220
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,409
Leak rumors to Union that
Hotel Zeus joined the race.

221
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,450
That'll be all.

222
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:45,460
Father's checkup is today, right?

223
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,789
- Yes.
- You must be going to him then.

224
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,629
Should I not go?

225
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,799
As if.

226
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,039
What is the genre
of our relationship?

227
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:03,909
My head is aching.

228
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,049
It still feels like
my head is splitting.

229
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,929
That's why you shouldn't have
binge-drank...

230
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,970
What?

231
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,700
What are you doing?
Did you curse at me?

232
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,240
What did you write?

233
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,710
Let go.

234
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:41,549
Let go!

235
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,149
How are you so strong?

236
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,419
Oh, my.

237
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,960
So you want to go all the way?

238
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,059
Give it to me.

239
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,529
Give it to me. Now!

240
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,779
Ms. Park.

241
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,090
Yes, Madam.

242
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,159
I thought they were duck down,

243
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:31,299
but they're chicken feathers.

244
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,830
I was fooled.

245
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,580
I can't get an exchange now.

246
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,179
But looking at chicken feathers,

247
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,289
I want to eat chicken and beer.

248
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,190
Gosh, you still didn't get a grip.

249
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,400
What are you doing?

250
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,230
What did you write now?

251
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,670
"The morning of goodbye is walking
from far away..."

252
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,440
"with a smile."

253
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,869
"We are sunlight
that grew from the night."

254
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,240
"We are the sleepwalking
suffered at night."

255
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:21,380
"We will slowly be forgotten
in curves."

256
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,950
An excerpt from
the poet Park Yeon Jun's...

257
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,049
"The Words of Caramel".

258
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,549
Enjoy your lunch, everyone.

259
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,319
This was Lee Bo Na until now.

260
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,049
What are you doing here?

261
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,490
I heard you call Hyo Shin.

262
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,990
Did you get in the club?

263
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,289
I don't know yet.

264
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,329
I came here because he said
he wouldn't tell me on the phone.

265
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:39,829
Do you want me to lobby for you?

266
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,799
I'm really close with Hyo Shin.

267
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,200
What kind of lobby?

268
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,740
Lobbying with my body?

269
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,309
Are you thinking about it?

270
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,680
Just log out
of my social media already.

271
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,750
Announcer Lee Bo Na.

272
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,720
This is driving me crazy.

273
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,319
I enjoyed listening to your
program. I'm a fan of yours.

274
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,519
Thank you. But you can't take photos
or get my autograph.

275
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:08,960
You're so funny.

276
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,859
Where do you think...

277
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,569
Lee Bo Na, I'm sorry.

278
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:17,069
Chan Young, can you tell me
the range of the middle exam again?

279
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,609
Follow me. I'll see you later.

280
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,880
I can't believe Cha Eun Sang.

281
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,980
Gosh...

282
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,980
Kim Tan.

283
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,089
I feel uncomfortable when
you turn up unannounced like this.

284
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,759
Do you still have feelings for me?

285
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,390
Do I still have feelings left?

286
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,829
I knew it.

287
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,299
Kim Tan.

288
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,630
I'm really happy
with Chan Young right now.

289
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,930
You were also really happy with me.

290
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,640
You used to like me a lot.

291
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,140
I didn't like you a lot.
I just kind of liked you.

292
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,170
You're still cute, Lee Bo Na.

293
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,480
You have high standards.

294
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,940
I'm tell you this just in case.

295
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,210
I don't like you anymore.

296
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,279
I still like you.

297
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,650
Look. I have a boyfriend.

298
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,089
Does your boyfriend know...

299
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,819
that I like you?

300
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,619
He can't know that!
I can't believe it!

301
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,460
Please get over me.

302
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,000
Did something happen between you and
Kim Tan? Why are you avoiding him?

303
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,170
There are so many reasons
to avoid him.

304
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,109
I'm the housekeeper's daughter
and he's the young master.

305
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,779
My dad asked if you were
doing good at school.

306
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:36,279
I even made your dad worried.

307
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,720
Do you remember
when we were in middle school?

308
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,019
There were rumors of you being
rich because your dad...

309
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,049
works at a major company.

310
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:44,859
I realized this after coming here.

311
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,990
My dad works at a major company,

312
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,759
but my classmate's dad
runs a major company.

313
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,569
I'm going to tell the truth
to the kids now.

314
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,339
I don't know how I ended up here.

315
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,869
I'm too nervous to keep pretending
that I'm an upstart.

316
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,210
No.

317
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,150
Keep lying as much as possible and
graduate without getting discovered.

318
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,519
Are you really Yoon Chan Young?

319
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,119
Joon Young is transferring
to another school today.

320
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,829
I didn't even thank him yet.

321
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,839
Cha Eun Sang, is it?

322
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,240
I'm Kang Ye Sol,
just in case you don't know me.

323
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,039
What are you staring at like that?

324
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,380
It's nothing.

325
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,809
Isn't that Welfare Scholarship
Moon Joon Young?

326
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,349
It is.

327
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,119
He's finally transferring.

328
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,819
He lasted for a long time.
I'm proud of him.

329
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,859
Didn't the school get brighter?

330
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,589
Can't we send all of the welfare
scholarships away like this?

331
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,779
(Don't Receive)

332
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,180
What are you doing?

333
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
What won't you receive?

334
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,450
My heart?

335
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,089
Go away.

336
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,529
Gosh, you're making me upset.

337
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,359
I even bought you jjajangmyeon.

338
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,930
How could you
name me "Don't Receive"?

339
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,630
Change my name, Friend.

340
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,799
Why are we friends?

341
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,029
Do you want to be my flower then?

342
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,930
I told you to go away.
I need to go to class.

343
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,470
Let's not be this heartless.

344
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,269
You're making me curious about what
you named Kim Tan on your phone.

345
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,809
Let me see your phone.

346
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:54,279
(Choi Young Do)

347
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,420
Things won't proceed
without Kim Tan.

348
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,059
Isn't that enough?

349
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,529
Your name is on the bulletin board.

350
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,359
Congratulations.

351
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,730
My name? Why?

352
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,269
What's on the bulletin board?

353
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,839
Why are you surprised?
Did you do something wrong?

354
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,059
I got in the club.

355
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,890
(JBS Extra Producer,
Sophomore Cha Eun Sang)

356
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,990
I can't believe it.

357
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,259
Why did they put up a notice
like it's a big deal?

358
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,670
Hyo Shin really has a thing
for analog ways.

359
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,970
(It's been like
a midsummer night's dream.)

360
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,839
If I were you,
I would try my best to stay low.

361
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,640
You're pretending to be an upstart
but joining the broadcasting club?

362
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,809
Hey, where are you looking?

363
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,150
What is this?

364
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,980
Who are these teenagers
that lost their mind...

365
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,549
to be lovey-dovey
at our sacred school?

366
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:09,430
(Like last night's dream. Bye.)

367
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,359
How did you see this?

368
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,259
(It's been like
a midsummer night's dream.)

369
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,690
(Like last night's dream. Bye.)

370
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:53,339
What is that?

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,410
It's surprising.
How did you see this?

372
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,240
I asked you to call me,
but you never called.

373
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,779
But you did that
on the bulletin board?

374
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,579
I really didn't think
you would see it.

375
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,680
Why did you ask me to call you?

376
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,190
You're asking me so early.

377
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:12,259
Because I had something to tell you.

378
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,359
What did you want to tell me?

379
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,059
"Where are you?"

380
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:22,069
"Who are you with?"

381
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,000
"When will you go?
Can you not go?"

382
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,970
"Don't go."

383
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,579
"Stay with me longer."

384
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,980
"I miss you."

385
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,609
You must be angry.

386
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,170
It's not a joke.

387
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,940
I'm excited. I like a love triangle.

388
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:14,349
I didn't come back to Korea
because of you,

389
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,190
but you are one of the reasons.

390
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,829
You're thinking about it, right?

391
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,829
I need to go to class.

392
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,599
Do you even know which classroom?

393
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,099
- I do.
- You don't.

394
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:32,000
You have Ethics
in Room 301 at Building A.

395
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,279
Do you want me to go beat him up?

396
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:45,980
No, I should be the one beating him.

397
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,589
The college entrance exam's soon.
Aren't you studying?

398
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:52,819
You're right. I don't know
what I will grow up to be.

399
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,460
You'll at least
grow up to be healthy.

400
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,859
Talk to me again next year.

401
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,069
Your body won't be the same
as it was when you were 18.

402
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,539
Even if you smile like that,
I won't give you any.

403
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,779
Did I smile?

404
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,410
Yes, it was a really pretty smile.

405
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:16,710
I'm sure he also saw it.

406
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,019
Stay there. We need to talk
for a moment.

407
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,019
What?

408
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,430
What did you just say? Say it again.

409
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,859
I said I like Cha Eun Sang.

410
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:33,059
You finally ended up
saying that, Kim Tan.

411
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,170
So? What do you want me to do
about it?

412
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,240
Do you want my permission
or do you want me to go away?

413
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,069
Do you think I didn't know?

414
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:45,539
I don't need your permission
whoever I meet.

415
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,910
Why did you become naive again?

416
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,549
Let's say
that you don't need my permission.

417
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,690
But you know how our world works.

418
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:58,890
No matter how much you avoid me,
you won't end up with Cha Eun Sang.

419
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,589
It's either the second daughter
of Seo Yeon Group,

420
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:04,359
the elementary school twin girls
of Guyeong Group,

421
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,930
or the granddaughter of GK Group
who is at a Swiss boarding school.

422
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,599
- If not...
- I know. I thought about it.

423
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,769
Fortunately, you're not
completely crazy.

424
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,539
But I'm not going to think
about it from now on.

425
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,740
I'll think and worry about things
later. I'll do things first.

426
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,779
I have a lot of mountains to cross
besides you.

427
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,650
Let me pass you by
without crossing you.

428
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,349
We used to be friends.

429
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,430
I don't care
if you're being reckless,

430
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:38,259
but you're making a mistake.

431
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,900
And you must have thought
that I wouldn't get hurt at all,

432
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,900
but you got that wrong.

433
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,589
How is your condition?

434
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,960
Why do they always want
to do checkups?

435
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,000
They treat me
like I'm going to die soon.

436
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,670
I just saw Director Kang.

437
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,200
There won't be any problems if
you take care of your blood sugar.

438
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:22,410
He's such a quack.

439
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,569
He's been saying that for 10 years.

440
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,509
I told you to go to
the PR department. What happened?

441
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,480
I gave them orders to find the
direction of PR within this week.

442
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,420
Did you meet Hyun Joo?

443
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,660
I sent her a text message,
and I'm waiting for her reply.

444
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,460
Meet her, and take care of
everything within this month.

445
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,490
You can take care of it like that.

446
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,529
You're the one who introduced
Ms. Park Hee Nam...

447
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:49,900
to our house, right?

448
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,569
How do you know her?

449
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,640
We used to be neighbors.
The couple used to run a cart bar.

450
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
They had a good personality
despite being poor,

451
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,940
so I visited them frequently.

452
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,750
According to Tan's mom,

453
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,049
she has some debt.

454
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,349
Before Eun Sang's father
passed away,

455
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:10,519
he was in the hospital
for quite a long time.

456
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,190
The hospital bills became the debt.

457
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:15,059
As far as I know, she's still paying
her debt steadily.

458
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,730
I see.

459
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,400
Do you know that I sent that
child Eun Sang to Jeguk High School?

460
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,930
I heard from my son.

461
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,539
I actually wanted to ask you.

462
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,640
Why did you send Eun Sang
to Jeguk High School?

463
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:32,339
Because she'll hear why she and Tan
shouldn't be close...

464
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:36,549
through 100 people's mouths there.

465
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,910
I didn't expect to see you here.

466
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,049
I'm also a parent.

467
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,109
You're a sweet dad.

468
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,750
I came to see the chief director.
Tan and Young Do must have fought.

469
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,349
I thought I should at least
say something to her.

470
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,160
So you're here for your son.
What a good stepmother.

471
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,390
Don't be so sarcastic.

472
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,190
It's just an inferiority complex
of poor people.

473
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,359
You're especially pointed today.

474
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,630
I just clearly realized
the reason we broke up.

475
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,400
What are you talking about?

476
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:33,269
I heard the reason that you and I
couldn't end up together...

477
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,039
from 100 people.

478
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,109
Why can't people like you
say it directly...

479
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:39,880
but use 100 people to say it?

480
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:41,839
Isn't that a little below the belt?

481
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,279
I'm not sure.

482
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,549
We always have a butler at home.

483
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,049
I see.

484
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,890
Don't you want to know
how I found out your phone number?

485
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,230
Let's just mind our own businesses.
Goodbye.

486
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,289
Are you going to answer the phone?
Who is it?

487
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,299
It's a woman.

488
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,559
You're lying.

489
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,529
Yes, Hyun Joo. It's been a while.

490
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,069
I'm on my way to the tutoring.
Can I meet you afterwards?

491
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,809
Yes, I will call you.

492
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:34,000
I will be late about 20 minutes.

493
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,750
How could you come
exactly 20 minutes later?

494
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,519
Because there's this good invention
called the clock.

495
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,950
Why are you 20 minutes late?

496
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,519
Because I wanted
to become a good man?

497
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:01,589
I'm not in the mood to joke.
Open your book.

498
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:05,059
What do you eat for dinner
to be so exhausted every day?

499
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,500
Do you eat things like ramyeon?

500
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,730
What I eat has nothing to do
with this lesson.

501
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:17,609
You really ate ramyeon.
You smell like ramyeon.

502
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,009
Are you serious?

503
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,109
You will check
my homework first, right?

504
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,180
Don't you dare get anything wrong.

505
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:29,150
Do you have any questions
up to here?

506
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:32,490
I don't have any right now,
but what if I have some tomorrow?

507
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,789
Can I call you?

508
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,059
You have this.

509
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,589
Go in there, select my name,
and send a text message.

510
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,930
I will answer them immediately.

511
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,599
Will you solve any questions
right away?

512
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,769
Yes, immediately.

513
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,470
Are you a genie or what?

514
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,869
Open page 103.

515
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:51,109
So?

516
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,109
What do you want to say?

517
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,279
I don't want to take
the family photo...

518
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,009
on the weekend.

519
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,210
Taking the bull by the horns?

520
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,450
Yes.

521
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,619
I've never once beat you in Judo.

522
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,319
If I win this game,

523
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,289
cancel the family photoshoot.

524
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,630
Are you confident?

525
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm also curious about
how I will change...

526
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,730
if I desperately want something.

527
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,799
Okay, try to beat me.

528
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,839
I will let you have your way then.

529
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,059
You still don't know how to win.

530
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,469
This is cheating.

531
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:27,639
What's wrong with that?

532
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:30,110
I didn't set any rules.

533
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,210
I just told you to win.

534
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,179
There isn't a judge on this mat.

535
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,849
This is the result of you playing
fair by yourself.

536
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,119
People only remember the results.

537
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,750
The result that you just lost.

538
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,590
Don't be late on Sunday.

539
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,480
(Choi Young Do)

540
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:25,159
You're still not answering my calls
even after changing my name.

541
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,199
How did you know I work here?

542
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,099
Come on. What do you take me for?

543
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:36,239
The most surprising thing I found
out while looking into you is...

544
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:40,639
that you became an upstart by doing
a lot of part-time jobs.

545
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,449
What do you want me to say?

546
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,280
You don't have to say anything.

547
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:50,019
I just came because I'm lonely.

548
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,630
Oh, right. I dropped the change.

549
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,559
Really?

550
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,500
I told you I would do it
for you last time.

551
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,099
What did you say
you would do for her?

552
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,809
This is cheating.

553
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:15,210
How did you know she works here?

554
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,519
She already asked that.

555
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,980
How did you answer?

556
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,119
I just thought to myself,

557
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,019
"The fact that I know
this place means..."

558
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,929
"that I also know
the chicken place, pizza place,"

559
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,630
"and restaurant she works at."

560
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,739
So what?

561
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:43,739
The hotel owner's son also washes
dishes on the weekend and breaks.

562
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:45,809
Stop pretending to be clueless.

563
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,320
Aren't you going to work?

564
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:00,389
What about you?

565
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,429
How do you know
her schedule so well?

566
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,460
You know, I'm always
one step ahead of you.

567
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,360
That's why you should be
careful of your back.

568
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,900
I'm one step behind you.

569
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:11,900
Are you going to stab Eun Sang
in the back too?

570
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:15,369
Don't put too much effort in
pointless things.

571
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:17,409
Why? Are you two dating?

572
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,739
Do we look good together?

573
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:20,409
Why are you asking
such an ugly question?

574
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:21,610
We look good together.

575
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:26,980
Don't bother Cha Eun Sang.

576
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,190
I'm warning you.

577
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,420
You're taking the bull by the horns.

578
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,659
It's not that good of a strategy.

579
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,860
You should take care
of your knees.

580
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:43,130
There are no rules within my mat.

581
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,670
Take your drinks.

582
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,909
What about Cha Eun Sang?

583
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:54,139
She's done, so she left.

584
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,409
These are on Eun Sang. Take them.

585
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,929
(Towing Notice)

586
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,429
That's how you use the law.

587
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,840
You shouldn't use it
for ridiculous charges.

588
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,670
You also know that
tuning is illegal, right?

589
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,579
I guess it'll be troublesome.

590
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,070
(Hyun Joo)

591
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,989
I will think about your suggestion
and contact you.

592
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:16,090
Thank you for taking me home.

593
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,860
Who is it?

594
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,000
When did you come?

595
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,570
Whose car did you ride at this hour?

596
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,090
I won't make any excuses.

597
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,659
You don't have to.
It's none of my business.

598
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,329
Don't be mistaken. There's
nothing going on between us...

599
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:55,929
See you tomorrow.

600
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:57,599
Yes, sir.

601
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,039
How could you make him go like that?

602
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,610
Tell me what's going on.

603
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,550
Why would you meet
Chief Secretary Yoon?

604
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,050
Why would the two of you
meet separately?

605
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,050
Didn't you know
that he would meet me today?

606
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,150
That's why I'm asking.

607
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:19,559
Why did you meet him?

608
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:22,630
To talk about tutoring his son.
Are you satisfied?

609
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,960
Are you the only private tutor?

610
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,329
That's not the problem right now.

611
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,599
Why did you come here at this hour?

612
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,170
What if the chairman finds out?

613
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,699
You can provide for me then.

614
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,269
I don't earn much by tutoring.

615
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,869
- You don't want to?
- I don't want to. Just go home.

616
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:37,010
I have nowhere to go.

617
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,110
I left home for good.

618
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:40,579
What?

619
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,880
Can you let me sleep at your house?

620
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,010
Did you really leave home?

621
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,079
Don't scold me.

622
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,780
I feel like I've been scolded
all my life.

623
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:51,289
How could you leave home then?

624
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,219
So you will never say yes.

625
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,500
Why? Are you going to hit me?

626
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,940
Weren't you asleep?

627
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,010
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- Where are you going?

628
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,070
Madam.

629
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,739
You...

630
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,780
Ms. Park.

631
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,820
Ms. Park?

632
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,079
Eun Sang.

633
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,300
Be quiet.

634
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,699
Are they already sleeping?

635
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,239
Gosh.

636
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,159
Mom's gone.

637
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,719
Are you really not going?

638
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:38,289
No. Why are you doing
your homework here?

639
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,219
Because my mom has to sleep.

640
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,389
If the light is on,
she keeps waking up...

641
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,889
thinking it's already morning.

642
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,130
You have a typo here.

643
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,500
Why are you glaring at me like that?

644
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,969
I told you not to talk
to me at home.

645
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:56,239
I was talking to myself.

646
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,510
Don't answer me then.

647
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,550
Why did you run away earlier?

648
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:06,880
Is it because of Choi Young Do?

649
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,920
Because of you.

650
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,989
I told you not to answer.

651
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,849
Don't come to my part-time jobs
from now on.

652
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,860
Why? Did Choi Young Do say
that he would come from now on?

653
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,429
What did you talk about
before I showed up?

654
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,400
About something strange.

655
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:22,460
What kind of strange thing?

656
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,670
You don't have to say anything.

657
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,539
I just came because I'm lonely.

658
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,309
What kind of strange thing?

659
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,510
He said he came
because he was lonely.

660
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,579
Strangely, he looked lonely
for some reason.

661
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,719
So? Did you look him in the eye,
answer him, and play along?

662
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:45,949
Of course not.

663
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:49,019
How will you explain how he knows
you do part-time jobs?

664
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,760
How could I explain it?
I found out when he told me earlier.

665
00:44:58,369 --> 00:44:59,400
What?

666
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,039
Don't worry. I won't be
involved with him.

667
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,369
You're already involved with him.

668
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,739
I don't think he's bothering you
because of me anymore.

669
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,010
He just wants to see you.

670
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:34,769
("After Effect" by ZE:A)

671
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:42,010
Aren't you going home?

672
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,610
Go put a sheet mask on.
You have the photoshoot tomorrow.

673
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,030
What are you thinking so hard about?

674
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:41,000
About Cha Eun Sang.

675
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,269
Upstart?

676
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,739
Why are you thinking about Upstart?

677
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:46,110
That's what I'm wondering.

678
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,210
I'm also thinking about...

679
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,480
why I'm thinking about Upstart.

680
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:58,989
Don't you have any other songs?

681
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,389
There are a lot of good songs.
Why this song?

682
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,760
What is wrong with this song? Why?

683
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:06,559
Gosh.

684
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,239
Hey.

685
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:14,969
Hey!

686
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,679
Your makeup looks good, Sister.

687
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:31,690
You said you'd take care of it.

688
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,920
I'm the crazy one to trust you.

689
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,460
Come on. Your expensive dress
will reek of swear words.

690
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Hey, guys.

691
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,940
Young Do, you look cool today.

692
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:52,110
You will see something cooler later.

693
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:53,809
Really? Should I look forward to it?

694
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,079
What a happy family.

695
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,480
Don't be sarcastic
when it's such a good day.

696
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:00,619
If everyone is ready, let's begin.

697
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,659
It's been a long time.

698
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,469
You become more handsome
as you grow old.

699
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:24,840
How have you been, ma'am?

700
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,039
Why are you calling me "ma'am"?
I'm like your older sister.

701
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,210
You're a complete man now.

702
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,610
Did we last meet when you were
in middle school?

703
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,320
We also met a week ago,
in the elevator of our hotel.

704
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,320
You said you came to meet Dad.

705
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,360
What are you doing?
You said you would keep it a secret.

706
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:44,690
Anyway, is it a special day today?
What are you taking photos for?

707
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,000
Mr. Choi, I think you have a guest.
Let's cancel the photoshoot today.

708
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,030
I don't think I can smile.

709
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,570
Wait for me.

710
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:05,309
You...

711
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:09,179
"Cheating is also part of the game.
The important thing is the result."

712
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,690
"Win one way or another."

713
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,789
I was really moved by that.

714
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,119
People will...

715
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,030
only remember
that I won just now, right?

716
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,369
You were kind of cool earlier.

717
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,599
But how will you deal
with your dad after this?

718
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,070
You can't do anything
if you worry about that.

719
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,739
Anyway, I owe you.

720
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,679
You can repay me what you owe.

721
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,679
You should give me what I ask for.

722
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,349
What do you want?

723
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,289
Will you really give it to me?

724
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,219
What is it?

725
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,320
You have Eun Sang's
customs declaration, right?

726
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,090
- What?
- I want that.

727
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,300
Why would you want that?

728
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,360
Do you really have something
going on with her?

729
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,300
Why were you two
at the hotel that day?

730
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,969
That's none of your business.

731
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,599
Bring it to school tomorrow.
Don't forget it.

732
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,639
Kim Tan said he likes Cha Eun Sang.

733
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,349
He came to me and confessed.

734
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,090
Can't you take care of that?

735
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,519
What will you do for me then?

736
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,329
I might want something
that you can't give this time.

737
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,530
Tell me after you take care of it.

738
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,360
We made a promise.

739
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:41,809
Are you out of your mind?

740
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,409
It really hurts!

741
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,449
Why did you... Where does it hurt?

742
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:50,489
Right there. A little bit lower.

743
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,090
Is it right here?

744
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,059
Do you want me to hit you
once more? Kids are watching.

745
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:57,389
Who is watching?
They all left to eat.

746
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:59,590
- What aren't you eating?
- What about you?

747
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:00,659
I'm going now.

748
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:03,300
And please don't show up
so suddenly like that.

749
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,099
Where did you come from? My eyes
weren't even closed for 10 seconds.

750
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:08,500
- From a fairytale?
- I can't believe you.

751
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,440
Why do you have
earphones on then, you fool?

752
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,940
You didn't notice
someone following you.

753
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:15,210
Did you follow me?

754
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,710
What should I do then? You don't
let me talk to you at home.

755
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,050
You didn't just try to
talk to me at home.

756
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,519
Are we going to
talk about that freely now?

757
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,460
I'll go first. You should come
five minutes later.

758
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,599
For free? How much
do you earn per hour?

759
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,530
You should also pay
for my five minutes then.

760
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,869
Why is the son of a rich family
so sensitive about money?

761
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,340
We're rich because we're sensitive
about money.

762
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,110
Only upstarts spend
a lot of money...

763
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,139
because they don't know
when they will go bankrupt.

764
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:50,679
Come to think of it, you spend
a lot of money for other things,

765
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:52,710
but why aren't you treating me
to a meal you promised?

766
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,750
I will, once I receive the
broadcasting club scholarship. Bye.

767
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:58,289
Did you approach
the broadcasting club for money?

768
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:01,190
Okay, I will buy
your five minutes, okay?

769
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,289
Don't follow me.

770
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,730
Hey, do you even know
how much my five minutes is?

771
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,730
And you should pay in advance
for things like this.

772
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:25,849
What are you doing?

773
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,579
What do you think?

774
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:32,349
I wanted to eat with you.

775
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:35,489
Sit down.

776
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,230
Get up. It's my seat.

777
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:45,099
Have some beans.

778
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:48,070
Hey. I told you,
Joon Young likes potatoes.

779
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:53,309
What are you doing? Sit down.

780
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:55,179
I don't want to eat with you.

781
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,119
I just want to eat a meal with you.
You're making me embarrassed.

782
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:21,670
That's Moon Joon Young's seat.

783
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,510
Cha Eun Sang must be
Choi Young Do's next target.

784
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,809
Gosh, what is he, an 8-year-old?

785
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:28,780
But she's an upstart.

786
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,309
She's not even
on a welfare scholarship.

787
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,619
Why aren't Chan Young
and Tan coming?

788
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:45,989
Why aren't you eating?

789
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,860
What is the meaning of
making me sit here?

790
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,530
There isn't that much of a meaning.

791
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:53,300
I just feel comfortable
sitting here.

792
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:57,510
If you're using me
to make Kim Tan angry, just stop.

793
00:53:57,909 --> 00:53:59,309
I have nothing to do with him.

794
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:02,480
Really? I also have
nothing to do with him.

795
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,440
What are you doing right now?

796
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,119
What am I doing?

797
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,019
Can't you see that
I'm eating with her?

798
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:46,519
Stand up.

799
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,230
I told you to stand up!

800
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,050
What is wrong
with your table manners?

801
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:19,219
Must I talk about your upbringing
in front of everyone?

802
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,300
She's supposed to eat with me.

803
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:31,230
Let's go.

804
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:42,980
You punk!

805
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:45,179
Don't do it. Stop it.

806
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:49,780
I'm the one who fell down.
Don't do it.

807
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,619
You're being inattentive these days
because I'm letting you off, right?

808
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,389
I'm going to kill you.

809
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,760
Did I make Cha Eun Sang
go on her knees instead of you?

810
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,570
It's more than you expected, right?

811
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,900
Please take me outside. Please.

812
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:51,650
You made Eun Sang go on her knees,
but you let her go with Tan.

813
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:53,980
I'm letting him have her now.
That way, he'll be angrier later.

814
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,849
You trust me, right?

815
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:17,909
Are you okay?

816
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:20,809
Let me take a look.

817
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:22,579
Don't. You will ruin your uniform.

818
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,150
Stay still. Let me take a look.

819
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,980
- I said I was okay.
- I told you to stay still.

820
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,019
(Choi Young Do)

821
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:41,699
Don't do that. I need to answer it.

822
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,059
Don't answer it.

823
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,039
You saw it earlier. Ignoring
and avoiding won't work on him.

824
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,639
He knows that I'm not an upstart.
He knows everything.

825
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:51,570
It'll be okay.
Don't answer it anyway.

826
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:54,010
How will it be okay? Choi Young Do
figured everything out.

827
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,179
Don't answer it!

828
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,949
Hello...

829
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:04,409
(The Heirs)
