00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,100
(Episode 2)

4
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,329
You want to come to my house?

5
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,120
Will I be safer in your place...

6
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:21,349
than this place?

7
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,060
I don't know if you'll be safer
in my place,

8
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,930
but my house is better
than this place.

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,700
What do you want to do?
Do you want to come?

10
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,129
Come on down.

11
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,020
What about your family?
Are they not here?

12
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
No.

13
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,250
You live here alone?

14
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,389
What if I live alone?

15
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,460
What are you?

16
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:05,719
What do you mean?

17
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,490
Are you a drug dealer or something?

18
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,960
- What?
- What do you do?

19
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,060
Are you in a gang or something?

20
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,270
So you decided
that I'm a drug dealer?

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,840
You seem to know the policeman.

22
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,539
Also,

23
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,710
you're a friend of someone who
inhales powder whenever he sees it.

24
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,050
Right. But...

25
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,419
why do you think I only sell drugs?

26
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,189
- What?
- The person who took your passport.

27
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,620
Do you think he's a real policeman?

28
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,099
Do you still have two kidneys?

29
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,229
I'm warning you.
If you take one step closer...

30
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,479
This is your room.

31
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,650
Call me if you need anything.

32
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,590
Why would he leave
such an aftertaste?

33
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,589
Sorry. Just this once.

34
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,660
Let it go this once.

35
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,629
Don't do this. Mom went through
so much to make this money.

36
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,959
Leave.

37
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,529
Eun Seok. Eun Seok!

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,430
Eun Seok, don't go.

39
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,379
I haven't had anything
other than the food on the plane.

40
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm so hungry.

41
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,759
What are you doing in the dark?

42
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,029
Sorry I didn't get your permission.

43
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,829
I only ate what's expired.

44
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,129
So I think this is enough.

45
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,509
How can you eat something like this?

46
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,009
I paid for this too.

47
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,009
Hey.

48
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,050
Where do you think you're going?
Clean this up.

49
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,800
What about recycling?

50
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,870
I don't know. Never done it before.

51
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,470
What's your name?

52
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,209
- What?
- What do people call you?

53
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,610
I forgot to thank you earlier.
Thanks for letting me sleep here.

54
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,449
You got a pretty long name.

55
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,949
No need to thank me.

56
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,120
It's not a favor,
but a compensation.

57
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,060
It's for the multigrain drink.
You said it was for your sister.

58
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,550
As soon as we booked the flight
to the US, Hotel Zeus contacted us.

59
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,980
If you haven't booked
your accommodation in the US...

60
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,949
- Come to their hotel?
- Yes, sir.

61
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,790
I heard he's getting engaged
with CEO Lee of RS International.

62
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,360
They already want to act like
Jeguk Group stockholder?

63
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,459
What's wrong?

64
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,230
Nothing, sir.

65
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,100
I politely rejected their offer.

66
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,040
It's the list of people
coming to the family party.

67
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,379
It's 11 people in total, and
they're all bringing their families.

68
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,320
I also emailed it to you.

69
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,389
If you emailed me,
why did you have to waste paper?

70
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:37,990
It's the habit
from when serving the chairman.

71
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,789
I told the chairman
about your business trip.

72
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,460
Did you think I can't do it myself?

73
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,460
I've always been curious.

74
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,399
Who are you working for right now?

75
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,799
Is it me or my father?

76
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,429
I always work for Jeguk Group...

77
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,500
I see.

78
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,200
You know...

79
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:57,409
you look like you're getting mad at
a girlfriend who cheated on you.

80
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:58,480
You're wrong.

81
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,379
I was giving you advice to cheat
since you're such a romanticist.

82
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,450
Before you get buried alive
when the chairman retires.

83
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,250
Do you have any other advice?

84
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,019
You never get intimidated.

85
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,990
My father spoiled you.

86
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,070
Please be careful.

87
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:32,710
Now that I'm sick, I realize why
health is the most important thing.

88
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,480
Be careful not to get sick.

89
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,720
Eat a lot of good food.

90
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,950
Don't act sweet like that.

91
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,090
That won't make me divorce you.

92
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,429
I never asked you to.

93
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,360
It was you who brought
Tan's mom to this house.

94
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,899
What else can I do?

95
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,870
You kept letting people see
you and her together,

96
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,399
so I had to hide her here.

97
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,169
I know.

98
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,679
That it's all my fault.

99
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,779
As long as you know.

100
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,080
I'm never going to divorce you.

101
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,309
That's why I let her in.

102
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,490
So she won't be able to do anything
until the day she dies in my barn.

103
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,460
People usually become nice and kind
when they get old.

104
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,830
But you haven't changed a bit.

105
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,500
Maybe because I don't have a child.

106
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,970
What are they saying?

107
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,840
They're not talking about you.

108
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,250
They only gossip about me.

109
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,519
Won is here.

110
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,649
Go in. Your mother's here.

111
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,360
I have no mother in this house.

112
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,360
Right.

113
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,769
The woman. The woman who raised you.

114
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,740
- Are you going to keep listening?
- I'm leaving.

115
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,299
This woman is leaving too.

116
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,289
Long time no see.

117
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,190
You're here.

118
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,360
You never say hello to me first.

119
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,029
I'd raised you for 10 years
until you moved to the US.

120
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,139
I didn't raise you with love,
but I raised you with my best.

121
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,470
Don't make me look like
a bad stepmom.

122
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,539
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,279
You raised me for 10 years with your
best, but this is how I turned out.

124
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,950
- Are you...
- Stop it, both of you.

125
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,049
I'm leaving.

126
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,320
I'm not walking you out.

127
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,159
You're going on a business trip
to the US?

128
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:08,129
Yes.

129
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:12,039
Americans take
family businesses seriously.

130
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,210
To them, family is the best value.

131
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:20,309
So you should bring Tan with you.

132
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
- I'll take care...
- Do as I say.

133
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,519
I'll let Chief Secretary Yoon know.

134
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,919
It's my business. I'll take care...

135
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,789
I'm taking care of it myself too.

136
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,559
I'm saying
it's not your company yet.

137
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,870
What are you doing? I'm busy.

138
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,669
It will just be a minute.
You always say that.

139
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,970
You keep talking casually to me.

140
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,940
You said you were busy, so
I talked casually to keep it short.

141
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,710
- Again.
- Oh, all right.

142
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,710
I heard you're meeting
Rachel's family.

143
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,080
Did they want to see you first? Why?

144
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,490
Why do you want to know?
Will you go there yourself?

145
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,220
I'm asking because I can't.

146
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,059
I should know.
They'll be my in-laws after all.

147
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,590
Who's your in-law?

148
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,990
Have you forgotten Tan's my son?

149
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,059
Gosh.

150
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,799
Stop showing off like that,
or you'll regret it later.

151
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,299
- Regret?
- Tan will be very happy...

152
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:19,070
if he finds out
how his mom was treated.

153
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,299
Are you threatening me?

154
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,710
Sorry if that's
what it sounded like.

155
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,710
Don't be ridiculous.

156
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,009
- What?
- Since...

157
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,840
people call you the second madam,

158
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,110
you think you've become
the lady of this house.

159
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,580
As long as I'm alive,
you're just my husband's...

160
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,080
girlfriend until the moment you die.

161
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,990
I'm going to make sure
to keep it that way.

162
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,120
Do you get it?

163
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,440
Another woman's bag.

164
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,440
Another woman's house.

165
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,940
Another woman's husband.

166
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,620
She's miserable because she desires
what belongs to someone else.

167
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,250
That is...

168
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,000
(Missed calls, Mom)

169
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,029
Mom?

170
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,000
It's me. Were you worried
because I didn't call?

171
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,240
Sorry. It's my first time in the US.
It was hectic.

172
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,870
It's English everywhere.

173
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,710
Eun Seok...

174
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,580
got taller, and she got tanned.

175
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:42,820
You know the sun in California.

176
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,559
It's as hot as the sauna.

177
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,129
I'm at her house right now.
You know a house with green lawn?

178
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,200
A house with no fence
and a lawnmower.

179
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:59,269
She lives in such a house.

180
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,539
So don't worry about me.

181
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:11,379
Eat well and sleep well, okay?

182
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,960
I'm hanging up now.
I'll call you again.

183
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,330
What are you doing?
You should've knocked.

184
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,600
Not after you come in.
I know this is your house, but...

185
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,700
- What's this?
- Don't they have this in Korea?

186
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,009
Thank you.

187
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,580
No need to thank me.
That's healthy for your kidney.

188
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,110
Stop that.

189
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,049
I saw how good you are at lying.

190
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,809
I'm not...

191
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,879
Did you hear it? Why?

192
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
It was interesting to hear
a woman's voice in the house.

193
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,259
What's that?

194
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,019
For the phone.

195
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,860
You keep squandering money.

196
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,169
This is for the stay.

197
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,340
I was going to hang it
if I get a room in the US,

198
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,340
but I'll give it to you.

199
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,169
Are you throwing it out to me?

200
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,679
What's this?

201
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:48,509
A dream catcher.
It will block nightmares.

202
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,320
Only good dreams will come
through that hole.

203
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,750
What about a pretty woman?

204
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,120
Forget it. Give it back.

205
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:55,620
Get some rest.

206
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,720
Finish that. That's good for your...

207
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,990
I said, stop that.

208
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,230
Is this burnt?

209
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,819
Goodness. I even gave her food,
and what?

210
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,299
Your house looks so beautiful
in the morning.

211
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:03,730
- You think so?
- Are you going somewhere?

212
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,240
To school.

213
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,839
So you're not a drug dealer.
You're an international student.

214
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,140
Is it a school that might appear
in US TV shows and movies?

215
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,579
What kind of school is that?

216
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,509
Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry?

217
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,980
You're smiling again.

218
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,519
That means you smile often.

219
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,289
What? No, I was just curious
about schools...

220
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,230
that international students go to.

221
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,890
Wait here. I'll get ready quickly.

222
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,559
- Where are you going?
- I should go out when you go out.

223
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,170
I'll just brush my teeth
and wash up...

224
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,500
You can just stay here.

225
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,509
Stay until I'm back.
You have no place to go to anyway.

226
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,740
- To my sister...
- That place won't open until later.

227
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,180
It opens late in the afternoon.

228
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,980
- Then is there...
- There's no bus.

229
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,779
People who need buses
don't live here.

230
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,180
- Still...
- If you don't want to stay here,

231
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,819
come with me to my school.

232
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,359
- What?
- You said you're curious...

233
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,059
about schools
international students go to.

234
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,059
I'm good.

235
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,160
Put them on unless you want
to change your race.

236
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,059
It's not for the look.
It's necessary here.

237
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,279
I'm going to put my hand out.
Tell me if it's embarrassing.

238
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,240
Only for a minute.

239
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,789
Every word has a meaning.

240
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,490
As soon as you put our feelings
into a word, it becomes meaningful.

241
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,230
The word pencil takes an entirely
different meaning...

242
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,869
when you think of it as the pencil
that I use to write letters with.

243
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,079
- F, I, G, H, T.
- F, I, G, H, T.

244
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,480
- Fight, fight.
- Fight, fight.

245
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,720
- F, I, G, H, T.
- F, I, G, H, T.

246
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,750
- Fight, fight.
- Fight, fight.

247
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,319
- F, I, G, H, T.
- F, I, G, H, T.

248
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,190
- Fight, fight.
- Fight, fight.

249
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,289
- G, O, let's go, dogs.
- G, O, let's go, dogs.

250
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:16,930
- G, O, let's go.
- G, O, let's go.

251
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,000
- G, O, let's go, dogs.
- G, O, let's go, dogs.

252
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,730
- G, O, let's go.
- G, O, let's go.

253
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,799
- G, O, let's go, dogs.
- G, O, let's go, dogs.

254
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,369
- G, O, let's go.
- G, O, let's go.

255
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:34,279
The British council conducted
a survey of 102...

256
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,210
non-English speaking countries...

257
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:40,119
about what was the most beautiful
English word in the world.

258
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,589
What do you think took first place?

259
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:45,089
- Rainbow.
- Flowers?

260
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:47,289
- Unicorns.
- Is it love?

261
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:48,690
Lamar Odom.

262
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,099
The most beautiful English word
in the world...

263
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,230
was mother.

264
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,329
Would you agree?

265
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,440
The 2nd through 5th places were...

266
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,769
passion, smile,

267
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:07,109
love, and eternity.

268
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,509
Then what was the saddest
English word in the world?

269
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:12,880
- Death.
- Funeral.

270
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Bankrupt.

271
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,289
Lamar Odom.

272
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,230
(In English, "dry" is
Dry Cleaning Only.)

273
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,990
That's the end of the class
for today.

274
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,089
Don't forget to turn in your essays
before you leave.

275
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:01,630
Tan. What are you doing after class?

276
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:02,869
Just going home.

277
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,519
Tan.

278
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:20,980
Aren't you going to turn it in?

279
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,960
It's not for turning in.

280
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,160
Don't you think you might find a new
purpose if you turn it in? Sometime?

281
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,759
Oh, really?

282
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,630
Don't make me call Roy.

283
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,700
Don't you dare.

284
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,369
- Don't. Never.
- I'm calling him.

285
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:16,210
- I'm going to call Roy.
- Don't Never. Not that.

286
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,109
What are you looking at?

287
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,609
Just kids lucky
to have rich parents.

288
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,880
Do Korean students have parties
among themselves?

289
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,859
It's boring.

290
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Really?

291
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,970
I should get going.

292
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,930
Thank you for taking me
to your school.

293
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:46,799
Keep my stuff for a little longer.
I'll go get it tonight.

294
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,970
Are you going to see your sister?

295
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:49,640
I should.

296
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:52,309
I need to get back
the money Mom gave me.

297
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:55,150
I can't waste it on a drunk.

298
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:01,319
Then goodbye.

299
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,549
Since we're in the US.

300
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,529
Hey.

301
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,960
Do you even know how to get there?

302
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,500
I do.

303
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:22,410
I don't think so.

304
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:30,450
- I can go there on my own.
- I'll go with you.

305
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,220
- What about your class?
- It's the one I hate.

306
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,980
I'm using you as an excuse
to skip it.

307
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,150
- What is it?
- Math.

308
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,059
I like math.

309
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,329
You must be crazy.

310
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,059
Really?

311
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:48,970
She quit?

312
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,369
After she left like that,
she just sent me a text.

313
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:52,740
She only got her text.

314
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,869
She said that she wasn't coming back
after today.

315
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:56,140
That she's not coming to work
after today.

316
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,410
She wanted me to tell her sister...

317
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,480
And that...

318
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,680
- she'll contact you, not to worry.
- That she'll contact you.

319
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,180
And go back to Korea.

320
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,579
Don't worry and go back to Korea.

321
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,859
She really ran away.
I can't believe her.

322
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,500
Not with that money.

323
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Hey.

324
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,930
You're that girl.
You're that witch's sister.

325
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,339
Where is Stella?

326
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,609
That's what I want to know.
Where is she?

327
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,970
Where is that witch
who took all my money? Hey.

328
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,910
Who are you, man? Let it go.

329
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,049
Is that how you hit my sister?
You jerk.

330
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:38,410
- Translate it.
- Why ask? He obviously did.

331
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:47,819
Wait. Hey. That looks like Chris.

332
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,789
- Hey. Chris.
- Chris.

333
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:51,730
They must be his friends.

334
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,500
They don't look like
a morning pray group.

335
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,200
On the count of three...

336
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,799
Go get them.

337
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,400
Go get them!

338
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,259
Why are we running?

339
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:22,359
What do you mean?
You said on the count of three...

340
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,529
"On the count of three, I'm going
to let go of his arm,"

341
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:25,529
"so stand behind me."

342
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,859
What?

343
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,930
They can't catch us.

344
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,970
They are.

345
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,140
I know since I have some experience.

346
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,000
Their legs feel weak already.

347
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,039
I'm going to kill you.

348
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,809
Say that after you catch me.

349
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:42,410
I swear. You Asian kid.
I swear I'll kill you.

350
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,279
I know how badly you want it,

351
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,380
but I'll get old and die
before that.

352
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:48,720
If you speak Korean,
do they understand?

353
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,519
They can't hear me anyway.

354
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,490
It's for you.
So you wouldn't be scared.

355
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,059
Wait. Let me answer the call.

356
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,359
(Rachel)

357
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,869
- It's no time for this.
- Right. Since yesterday.

358
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,170
I just...

359
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,549
It's a drug order.

360
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:18,210
They're asking
if I have organic drug.

361
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,289
Let's go. We really have to run now.

362
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:24,319
Oh, come on.

363
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,339
The person you're calling cannot
come to the phone at the moment.

364
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,299
(Mom)

365
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,250
It's me. Why?

366
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:23,680
Are you with Tan?

367
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,519
Why would I be with him right now?

368
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:26,720
He went to school.

369
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,019
Oh, right.

370
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,349
- What did he say?
- About what?

371
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,089
Didn't you tell him about
me and Young Do's dad?

372
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:34,690
That's nothing to brag about.

373
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,990
You still need to tell him.

374
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,529
Young Do and Tan are best friends.

375
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,799
They're no longer friends. Bye.

376
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:19,740
The owner's son?

377
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:24,109
Yes. Since he was in middle school,
he's worked here during breaks.

378
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,740
It's a kind of apprenticeship course
to inherit the hotel.

379
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,680
He just does as he's told?

380
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,579
He's obedient
for a rich family's son.

381
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:32,980
Obedient, my foot...

382
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,589
Young Do. I clearly told you
to warm the plate...

383
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,589
when you set the service wagon.

384
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,529
If you're a customer,

385
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,000
do you want to get
food that got cold...

386
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,769
before you even get to taste it?

387
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,000
And when you enter the kitchen,
you must look neat...

388
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:00,809
Do I...

389
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,880
look happy now?

390
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,750
Then do I have to cut you some slack
just because you're my boss' son?

391
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,289
- If you keep acting like this...
- Report it...

392
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,019
to Father.

393
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,360
That's your job. So do your job.

394
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,769
When I become the owner
of this hotel 10 years later,

395
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,440
you'll need experience
to get a new job.

396
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,440
The Public Prosecutor General
arrived in the room.

397
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,909
- Okay.
- Gosh.

398
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,449
I think there's a job more suitable
for me than washing the dishes.

399
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,099
Hyo Shin's college entrance exam
is coming soon, isn't it?

400
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,139
I'm studying hard as always,
Grandpa.

401
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,880
The problem is to get higher
national rank than last year.

402
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,610
There's nothing else
to worry about, Father.

403
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,480
Right. Blaming time and date...

404
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,820
is just stupid.

405
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:17,349
Yes.

406
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:20,559
It would've been nice if you went
to the same school as your brothers.

407
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,559
Nowadays, Jeguk High School
is more prestigious.

408
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,059
It's different from
his brothers' time.

409
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,760
You think I don't know that?

410
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,300
Korea is all about connections.

411
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,769
Jeguk High School may
be prestigious,

412
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,570
but its history is too short
to produce...

413
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,610
leading figures
in politics and economics.

414
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:39,309
Then you can make history
by becoming one...

415
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,480
as a Jeguk High alumnus.

416
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,519
Keep in mind what your uncle said.

417
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:49,889
Yes.

418
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,190
Oh, Young Do.

419
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
Mr. Minister,
Mr. Prosecutor General.

420
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
It's an honor to have you here.

421
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,000
Mr. Director. Mr. Prosecutor.
My father told me a lot about you.

422
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,010
He's CEO Choi's son, Father.

423
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,639
He's a junior at Hyo Shin's school.

424
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:16,010
Even though CEO Choi is young,

425
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,150
he educated his son very well.

426
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,679
Thank you.

427
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,329
Do you like the food?

428
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,630
I heard you got a new chef.
It tastes even better.

429
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:56,320
You look very thirsty, so...

430
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:37,159
Let me use the restroom.

431
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,260
Did you not like the food?

432
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:14,530
Thanks for the restroom.

433
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,300
There's a restroom
in the first floor.

434
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,000
I can't run into Father
while throwing up.

435
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,280
Is it okay for me to catch you?

436
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,309
In that sense, I caught you
in more things.

437
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,079
Your voice sounds very nice
when you threaten people.

438
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:38,250
It's even nicer when I swear.

439
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:40,320
Do you want to hear it?

440
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,630
No thanks. Do you want a smoke?

441
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,659
I don't do what's bad
for my health.

442
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Bye.

443
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,650
Here. It's on me.

444
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,949
What took you so long?
Did you grow coffee beans?

445
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,789
So you can answer the calls
comfortably.

446
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:14,460
Did you sell the organic drugs?

447
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,670
- Oh, this is amazing.
- Stop exaggerating.

448
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,000
Please bear it.

449
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:27,000
I should drink Americano in America.

450
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,539
Or I'll only have bad memories
in the US.

451
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,440
Are you sure you'll only have
bad memories?

452
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,210
Well... When I think about it...

453
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:43,090
By the way, how long
have you been in the US?

454
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,519
Why do you stop thinking?

455
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,289
- 1, 2, 3.
- Wait.

456
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:50,929
Why didn't I think of that?

457
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,500
Not that...

458
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,159
- How is it?
- Take a look.

459
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:58,530
Do you know them?

460
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,199
No.

461
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,570
Give me your phone.
I think I know a way to go home.

462
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,539
Home? You mean Korea?

463
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,880
Yes.

464
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Thank you.

465
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:21,820
Can you show me
when you get a comment?

466
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:23,329
What are you doing?

467
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:29,000
(I know it's hard to believe...)

468
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,170
Who is it? Your boyfriend?

469
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,539
Just a friend.

470
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,869
Just call him. You don't know
when he'll leave a comment.

471
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,510
He recently changed his number.
I can't remember it.

472
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,679
He said he's going somewhere. I
don't know if he's in Korea or not.

473
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:44,809
You're asking him for help
when you don't know where he is?

474
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,650
He's in my heart. What?

475
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,489
He doesn't deserve to be
called like that.

476
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,750
How do you trust him so much?

477
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,019
I admire him as a friend.

478
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:56,530
Did he save the country
or did he create Korean?

479
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,889
Admire, my foot.

480
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:02,130
- What if he doesn't contact you?
- He will.

481
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:08,840
Where are you going?

482
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:21,579
Did you get a comment yet?

483
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,360
Not yet.

484
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,329
Are you two even close?

485
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:31,429
I spent half of my life with him.

486
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:32,630
- Are you dating?
- No.

487
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,630
Or you used to?

488
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,630
Why do you keep adding
a story to my friendship?

489
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,070
Just think as if you're saving
my life. Please check often...

490
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,739
and tell me when you get a comment.

491
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,210
He's my only hope.

492
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,039
Okay? Please?

493
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,309
Gosh.

494
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,230
Here's the key. Stay inside.

495
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:10,269
Where are you going?

496
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:11,769
I left the car there
when running away.

497
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:12,840
I have to get it back.

498
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,269
It won't take long.

499
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,500
(Cha Eun Sang)

500
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,599
Cha Eun Sang.

501
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,070
Cha Eun Sang...

502
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,809
I know it's hard to believe,
but I got a problem in the US.

503
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,380
I need your help.

504
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,349
Write a comment
when you see this message.

505
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,190
An office worker for 2,000 dollars
a month. I like that too.

506
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,230
What does that mean?

507
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,199
I hope Freddy and Jason reconcile.

508
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,210
(I hope Freddy and Jason reconcile.)

509
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,949
I don't want to go to work.

510
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,280
When it's raining,

511
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,920
I should watch
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".

512
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:39,019
What a weird taste.

513
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,469
Guys. I'm working again.

514
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:52,429
I don't even know whether
I'm a student or a worker.

515
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:53,969
It's sad and funny.

516
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,440
Why does she work all the time?

517
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,780
Number one annoying customer.

518
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,719
Oh, it's you.

519
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:11,219
What kind of annoying customer
is this handsome?

520
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:14,059
Handsome? Is he crazy?

521
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,460
- Get lost.
- That's right.

522
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:19,599
Well done today. Cheer up, Eun Sang.

523
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,960
I'll get lost now.

524
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,869
I knew it.

525
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:25,900
They're not just friends.

526
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,440
I hate how my mom is suffering.

527
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,409
I hope Jeguk Group goes broke.

528
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,219
It must've been
some misunderstanding.

529
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,429
It's not your first time.

530
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,570
It's ruined. It's all ruined.

531
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,440
Chan Young's not picking up.

532
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,610
It's ruined. Think about it.

533
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:05,769
Do you know
how sexy American girls are?

534
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:07,809
After seeing a skinny girl like you,

535
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:10,050
when he sees their
voluptuous bodies...

536
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,650
The back of that voluptuous body
is so beautiful.

537
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,119
Hey. Chan Young is not like you.

538
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:18,449
That's the mystery.
If he's not like me,

539
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,360
why isn't he answering your call?

540
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,659
Maybe he's super busy
or he doesn't know that I called.

541
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,429
Why are women nervous and anxious
when they know the answer?

542
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:26,730
Because I like this feeling.

543
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,929
What? What a perv.

544
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,139
Choi Young Do. Are you off work?

545
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,739
I'm jealous. You're a lawyer's son.

546
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:43,579
You're too stupid
to go to law school.

547
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:46,119
You don't have to work
to inherit the law firm.

548
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,980
I'm so lucky
that I suck at studying.

549
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,389
What's wrong with her?

550
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,659
It's none of your business.

551
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,730
You look like you have a lot to say.

552
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,360
Stop paying attention to me,
will you?

553
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,900
I can't help it...

554
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,269
because you're pretty.

555
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:08,869
Right. I'm quite pretty, aren't I?

556
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,110
So he should call me.

557
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:17,449
Hello? Chan Young.

558
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:18,909
You scared me.

559
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,280
I called you four times today,
but why didn't you call me back?

560
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,050
You're always one step ahead of me.

561
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,460
- How much is it?
- It's 10 dollars.

562
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,590
Can I get you anything else?

563
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,559
Wait. I hear a woman's voice.

564
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,429
Who are you talking to?

565
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,929
A woman with a look
that could make you nervous.

566
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,630
Chan Young. Are you cheating on me?

567
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,170
Put that witch on the phone.

568
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:40,969
That witch is answering
the phone right now.

569
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:42,969
I miss you so much
that I can't study.

570
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,510
What are you going to do?

571
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:46,610
I'm so happy.

572
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,210
Don't you check your social media?
I posted a crying selfie.

573
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,880
He's not going to come back.

574
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,320
What? I didn't hear that.

575
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
I quit social media.
It distracts me.

576
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,119
Don't be like that, and check.
Please.

577
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,519
She's the only girl who looks pretty
even when she's clingy.

578
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,659
Okay. I will.

579
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,699
Yes.

580
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,829
I'll call you at home. Wait for me.

581
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,969
Bye.

582
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,050
I know it's hard to believe,
but I got a problem in the US.

583
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:25,510
I need your help.

584
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,519
Write a comment
when you see this message.

585
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:32,920
The number you have dialed...

586
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,900
Are you home? That was fast.

587
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:47,940
I'm going to leave now.

588
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:03,920
Who are you?

589
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,889
I'm the one who should ask
that question.

590
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:07,320
Who are you?

591
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:10,960
I think we've met before.

592
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,630
In the airport, right?

593
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,130
So what if we have?
Are you glad to see me?

594
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,570
Who are you?

595
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,670
And who are you?

596
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,900
I'm the fiancee of the owner
of this place.

597
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,900
Fiancee?

598
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:25,940
The owner of this place
is only a high school student.

599
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,840
We got engaged last year,
when we were 17.

600
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,409
Now answer me. Who are you?

601
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:34,650
How many times do I have to
ask you why you're here?

602
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,860
I slept here last night
for some reason.

603
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:42,019
I was about to leave with my stuff.

604
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,730
You slept here?

605
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,059
Things you'd worry about...

606
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:48,059
Be quiet.

607
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,710
Why is this in your hand?

608
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,380
I left my stuff here.

609
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:05,980
Well, then...

610
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:30,809
What did you just do for?

611
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,469
It was just a mistake.

612
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,139
Just like how you ran into me here.

613
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,110
I said there was nothing
to worry about.

614
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,150
I'll just leave for the sake
of this place's owner.

615
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:47,820
Are you kidding me?
You can't just leave.

616
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,730
You even had a key
to the house without its owner.

617
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,230
Who knows what you stole?

618
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:55,960
- Open it.
- Look.

619
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,500
I thought you don't want me to
take it wrong.

620
00:49:58,269 --> 00:49:59,500
Then open it.

621
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,840
Fine. I will open it, but...

622
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,079
what if there's nothing inside?

623
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,980
That's not possible.

624
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:20,619
Happy now?

625
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,570
What are you doing?

626
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:35,070
I'm taking a look.

627
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:36,969
There's nothing.

628
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,139
You may go.

629
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,440
And don't forget
to take your garbage.

630
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,019
Hey.

631
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,949
Leave before the owner gets here.

632
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:31,489
What? What's the problem?

633
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:32,519
Does this make sense?

634
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:35,019
I posted a crying selfie.
I even told him.

635
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:37,460
How can he not say anything
for over two hours?

636
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,460
Hey. I'm saying this
as your brother...

637
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,599
Brother, my foot.

638
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,269
I've never seen a guy like
a crying selfie.

639
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:47,400
Then what do they like?

640
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,070
Rather than tears, adult stuff.

641
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,840
Post a selfie with a lot of skin.

642
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,019
I bet all my money and my wrist
that he'll return immediately.

643
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:01,849
Hey. Chan Young's not like that.

644
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:03,449
Apologize to Chan Young right now.

645
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:06,659
Which way is to the US? Beg
for forgiveness in that direction.

646
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:08,420
If he's not like that,
he's a weirdo.

647
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,559
He's 18.

648
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:11,960
Just break up with him
and date Myung Soo.

649
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,099
Are you crazy? Insane? I'm not high.

650
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:16,599
Why would you reject three times?
Hey.

651
00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:18,400
I wouldn't reject you.

652
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,900
Why do you involve me between you?

653
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,670
You two look great.
You should date each other.

654
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,940
How could you say that?

655
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:27,280
- But I wouldn't reject you.
- I'll kill you.

656
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,980
Hey. Does gender matter in love?
Are you that prejudiced?

657
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,909
Let's break up.

658
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,980
Gosh... You're too pretty to hit.

659
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,789
Hey. You should know when to stop.

660
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:42,360
How come you never know the limit?

661
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,030
Hey. The limit's there to cross.

662
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,860
Look at Rachel.
She crossed the border.

663
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,300
She went to the US to see Tan.

664
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,829
If you miss him, you should go.
Stop making a scene here.

665
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:53,300
Jo Myung Soo. I told you not
to mention Kim Tan in front of me.

666
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,469
- I said it next to him.
- Why are you just listening?

667
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:56,909
Doesn't it bother you?

668
00:53:58,139 --> 00:53:59,909
Myung Soo's better at fighting
than I am.

669
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:01,909
So I can't have a go at him.

670
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,510
Bo Na's better at fighting
than I am.

671
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,250
I'll kill you.

672
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,820
Pardon?

673
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,320
LA to Incheon is 1,040 dollars
including tax.

674
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:15,190
One second.

675
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,769
I'm way too short.

676
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,469
Can you still book it?

677
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:32,139
- Your passport, please.
- Right.

678
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,510
Oh, my passport.

679
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,610
She left?

680
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,280
To where? With all her stuff?

681
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:44,750
Hey, Kim Tan.

682
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:47,860
It's been half a year
since we last saw each other.

683
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,289
But that's the first thing you say?

684
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,260
Why do I have to know
where some random witch went...

685
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,500
You got prettier.

686
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,130
- I know that.
- What about her?

687
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,130
Did you kick her out?

688
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,869
Didn't you know that's
the fiancee's privilege?

689
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:03,070
Did you tell her
that we got engaged?

690
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,139
Of course I did.

691
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:06,809
You should've told her
before I did.

692
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:10,150
Then you should've kept her here.

693
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,280
I could've introduced you to her
at least.

694
00:55:17,489 --> 00:55:19,849
- Didn't you know that I was coming?
- I did.

695
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,889
Then why didn't you come
pick me up at the airport?

696
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:24,889
It was too hot.

697
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:27,030
Then come back to Korea.
The fall's coming soon.

698
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,030
It's too far.

699
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:32,670
Do you even know our engagement
anniversary is in two days?

700
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:35,400
- Yes.
- Is that all?

701
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:38,369
Why did you even get engaged?

702
00:55:39,409 --> 00:55:41,610
I didn't want to marry you
in the future,

703
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,610
so I had to get engaged at least.

704
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,469
Where are you going?

705
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:12,769
You should tell me
if you're leaving.

706
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:15,780
You're home.

707
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,349
I left the business card here.

708
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,849
The policeman's business card.

709
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:26,619
Why do you look for it?

710
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:28,789
I threw it out in the trash bin
when I cleaned the house.

711
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,460
Which trash bin?

712
00:56:30,989 --> 00:56:31,989
Outside the door.

713
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,530
No. You don't have to look for it.

714
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:36,969
Why not? I need it
to get my passport.

715
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:38,900
Hey...

716
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:44,510
You threw it out?

717
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,579
Throw what out?
I didn't even see it.

718
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,750
I know how annoying this is to you,

719
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:54,920
but the police took her passport
because of me and can't go to Korea.

720
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,250
What does that have to do
with me?

721
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,289
It's got nothing to do with you,
but...

722
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,989
it's got something to do with me,
so don't interfere.

723
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,550
The US? Where in the US?
I'm in the US too.

724
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:33,250
What's going on?

725
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:36,420
I can go there right now.
Call me as soon as you see this.

726
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,460
This is my number.
Call me immediately.

727
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,860
It's not in there.

728
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,230
No, it's not.

729
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,630
I can't find it anywhere.

730
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,329
Are you crying?

731
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,469
I don't want to,
but the situation...

732
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:26,670
My life never changes.

733
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:28,809
What?

734
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,079
I came all the way to the US
to be better off,

735
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:34,280
but I'm next to the trash bin.

736
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,289
There's never a turnaround
in my life.

737
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,630
I'm sorry. Get up.

738
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,230
Why are you sorry?

739
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:57,369
What? You got it back? When?

740
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,539
Just a little while ago.

741
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,449
- What are you doing?
- Hush.

742
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,760
Is this where the scumbag lives?

743
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,059
- I told you no.
- Who are they?

744
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:17,289
- Are they gangs?
- Let's just go.

745
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:18,760
They don't look like office workers.

746
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,730
Hey. There they are. Right there.

747
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,769
- Where did they go?
- What do we do?

748
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,769
Gosh. They're not
the easy ones. Run.

749
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,099
What? Why?

750
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,739
Where did they go?
Where did they go?

751
01:00:44,449 --> 01:00:45,449
What are you doing?

752
01:00:46,179 --> 01:00:48,050
Murderers are usually in the back.

753
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,849
Stop watching weird movies.

754
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:51,019
Why are you being chased?

755
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:52,719
Are you really a drug dealer?

756
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,619
I wouldn't waste my life like that.

757
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:57,289
Then why are they chasing you?

758
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,389
What about you?
Why were they chasing you?

759
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,099
Since you're here,
you should just watch the movie.

760
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,670
I'm going to rest.

761
01:01:27,989 --> 01:01:29,260
What are they saying?

762
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:31,530
That he's not after you.

763
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,489
He's here to check that.

764
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:40,070
To trust you,

765
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,670
he needs to know who you are.

766
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:46,670
You're not sleeping?

767
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:50,139
But...

768
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,380
he met a girl yesterday.

769
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:57,349
That girl's name is Cha Eun Sang.

770
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,619
How do you know my name?

771
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:04,030
He's got a question
for Cha Eun Sang.

772
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:08,159
Do I...

773
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:16,840
like you?

774
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:02,150
It's really Hollywood.

775
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:05,449
I think what I said in the theater
is more amazing than that.

776
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:06,789
Do you want to know
why you always lose?

777
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:09,019
I guess I take after Mom
when I should've taken after you.

778
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,420
- That's cute.
- As long as you know.

779
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,960
Did you think you could come here?

780
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,190
Are you okay?

781
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:14,329
I'll kill you.

782
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,329
Is your goal to make people
think that we're a couple?

783
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:17,400
Don't even think about it.

784
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,500
- Cha Eun Sang.
- Chan Young!

785
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,599
- I was worried about you.
- I'm sure he's not over me yet.

786
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:23,400
Kim Tan wouldn't sue Chan Young
for hitting him, would he?

787
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,539
- Do you know me?
- You know me too.

788
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,210
Stay here. You only need to
borrow money.

789
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:27,679
I don't have a reason to stay here.

790
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:28,909
It's so annoying.

791
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,079
My goodness.
Did you eavesdrop on everything?

792
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:32,480
If we go there,
we might run into her.

793
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,780
Let's see if it's a coincidence
or destiny.

794
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:48,429
(The Heirs)
