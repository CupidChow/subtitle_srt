(The Heirs)

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,829
(Episode 17)

4
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,070
Don't forget about today.

5
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:37,939
The price of wielding your sword...

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,880
is losing her...

7
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,280
today.

8
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,519
The number you are trying to reach
is not registered.

9
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,920
Please check the number
before dialing once again.

10
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,129
Eun Sang is gone.

11
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
I've looked everywhere,
and she's not anywhere.

12
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,199
What have you done?

13
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,810
What have you done to her?

14
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,280
Where did you send Eun Sang off to?

15
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,580
This is all your fault.

16
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,150
You should've never let her think
that she had a chance with you.

17
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,280
I was the one who approached her.

18
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,689
I was the one who tried to get her.

19
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,060
I was the one who begged her
to take courage!

20
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,960
You should've sent me off instead.
Why didn't you fly me off?

21
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,900
Why not?

22
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,199
Is it because I'm
my brother's backup plan?

23
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,639
What right do you have to ruin
someone's life like that?

24
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,840
All I did was to tell her to live
a life that suits her.

25
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,680
She will be recorded to have quit
school in the school's registry.

26
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,009
- Don't do it.
- You make sure...

27
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,879
you don't try to look for her.

28
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,849
The moment you find her,

29
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,060
I will actually crush her life.

30
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,129
Get going now.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,569
Dad, Tan is looking for Eun Sang
like crazy and her number is gone.

32
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,340
Do you know anything
about what happened?

33
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,240
Eun Sang won't be at school
from tomorrow.

34
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,169
She left and I helped her do so.

35
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,639
Leave? Seoul? To where?

36
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,250
I don't know where she's going.
She told me not to ask.

37
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:31,680
All I did was to help her
settle well in the new place.

38
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,719
She told me to wait,
so I said that I will.

39
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,819
Come on. How can Eun Sang leave
without telling me?

40
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,289
Is it because of Tan?

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,159
She didn't move to another country,
did she?

42
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,199
I'm not the one to talk
about Eun Sang.

43
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,759
Ask her yourself later.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,770
She said that she'll contact us
once she settles down.

45
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,300
She'll also contact us
if something comes up.

46
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,439
Let's just wait.

47
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,569
What happened?

48
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,979
- I guess Eun Sang isn't here today.
- I guess so.

49
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,379
Why isn't Eun Sang at school today?

50
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,080
Chan Young would know why, right?

51
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,449
Maybe she's sick.
She's not answering my texts.

52
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,919
Try calling her. You could reach her
faster that way.

53
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,789
I don't want to be that friendly.

54
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,659
I hope she didn't get bullied
behind my back again.

55
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,170
Have you heard back from her?
Did she contact you or not?

56
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,339
I told you to not come to me
for Eun Sang.

57
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:35,180
I really think it's all your fault
that Eun Sang had to leave.

58
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,279
Don't you think so?

59
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,319
Yoon Chan Young.

60
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,759
I don't want you to come to me
for anything as well.

61
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,660
Let's go.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Everyone, I have to talk to Tan.

63
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,540
Could everyone step out
of the classroom?

64
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,310
I haven't done this in a while,
so help me out here.

65
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,250
I'm going to stand by the door.
I'm not letting you off the hook.

66
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,949
Don't you two dare fight!

67
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,560
Eun Sang vanished.

68
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,189
You really made it happen.

69
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,529
She's alive though, right?

70
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,600
I don't feel like quarreling
with you, nor do I have time for it.

71
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,569
I'm going to find her my way,

72
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,180
so you find her your way too.

73
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,540
You must know
where she's sent off to.

74
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,449
Is she in Korea or is she abroad?

75
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,149
I have to look into it.

76
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:45,980
Wherever it is,

77
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:48,850
I'm going to find her.

78
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,100
Your father wants me to process
her papers as her quitting school.

79
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,430
No. Do not do that
under any circumstances.

80
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,339
Eun Sang will be back.

81
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,540
- Are you asking me for a favor?
- I'm suggesting a deal.

82
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,040
It's all give and take.

83
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,350
There will be a time
when you'll need me too.

84
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,360
(JBS New Staff Application)

85
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,870
What permission do you have
to do this?

86
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,110
I'm investigating.

87
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,540
Has Eun Sang left anything
other than that?

88
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,040
What do you mean?
What investigation?

89
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,180
Hey, can you help me out?

90
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,319
Is it some special day today?

91
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,089
Eun Sang didn't come
to school today.

92
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,060
Seems like she won't be back
tomorrow, either.

93
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,589
Did something happen?

94
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,329
Could you look into her
travel history as fast as you can?

95
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,430
Give me a call when you do.

96
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,439
Are you going to stay here
until I push you out the door?

97
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:15,670
How can you treat me so differently
from him? That hurts.

98
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,410
Why don't we take a break?

99
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,920
Use the bathroom if you need to.

100
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,990
Congratulations
on getting married again, Ms. Lee.

101
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,889
Am I too late?

102
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,829
I just haven't been at this meeting
in a while.

103
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,730
There's not much to prepare.

104
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,129
I just have a press conference
next month.

105
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,899
Do you think a press conference
will be okay?

106
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,040
It seems like Hotel Zeus will be
under investigation soon.

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,470
"Under investigation"?

108
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,680
I haven't heard anything.

109
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,850
No way.

110
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,519
Isn't this meeting specifically
to share such information?

111
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,959
How much money do you think I've
spent on this meeting in two years?

112
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,129
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

113
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,100
I'll go with you.
I was going to go anyway.

114
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,480
This is just a small present
from me.

115
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,450
It's a matching nameplate with you.

116
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,090
You're on my side now.

117
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,029
Just so you know,
I don't accept cheating.

118
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,330
I believe you were the one who was
cheating just a while ago.

119
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,399
You saw how
the shareholders' meeting went.

120
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,269
I've been cheated on by too many.

121
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,769
So, just stay on my side.
I'm glad to be working with you.

122
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,710
Thank you, sir. I look forward
to working with you as well.

123
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,490
Give me all the surveillance camera
footage from the last four days.

124
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,120
Anything security-related must be
reported to Chairman Kim.

125
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,519
Go ahead. Report it to him.

126
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,450
(Hyo Shin)

127
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,450
- How is it going?
- She didn't leave the country.

128
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,490
Her passport hasn't been
reported lost, either.

129
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:47,120
That's good.
At least she's in the country.

130
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,029
Did your father help you?

131
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,700
That's confidential.

132
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,169
If I ever get evicted,
you have to take me in.

133
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,730
Thanks, Hyo Shin.

134
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,039
It's me. Eun Sang is in Korea.

135
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,679
You're really good at sharing
even when you're not asked.

136
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,220
Two is better than one.

137
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,889
We have to find her.
Finals are coming up soon.

138
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,090
When are you going to pay me back?

139
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,960
You haven't forgotten, have you?

140
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,830
I took eight guards with me,

141
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,029
and I put on a helmet for you...

142
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,360
Hello?

143
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,690
Come on.

144
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,759
I see, she's in Korea.

145
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,039
Cha Eun Sang.

146
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,710
November 15, 1996.

147
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,250
Young Do Lover.

148
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:19,019
"Take a look if you're the manager."

149
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,850
"I'd like to make a confession
about Choi Young Do of Hotel Zeus."

150
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,320
"Young Do, with his perfect looks
and irresistible charms,"

151
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,960
"tripped me over,"

152
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,460
"threatened me to eat
jjajangmyeon with him,"

153
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
"and has thrown me into the pool
while pretending to save me."

154
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,039
"But he really loved me."

155
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:48,009
"I tried to let it go
because he's so handsome,"

156
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,649
"but I'd like to take
my pure love back."

157
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,149
"However, my heart is already his."

158
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,850
"Would it mean anything
to cancel this transaction, anyway?"

159
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,990
So good!

160
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:08,929
Mr. Choi,

161
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,639
seems like my handsome face has
finally done its part.

162
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,809
(I promise to have janchi guksu
with Young Do. By Cha Eun Sang)

163
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,080
You'll be summoned, all right.

164
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,019
You talk to walls now?

165
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,289
What took you so long?

166
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,690
Hey,

167
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,029
I've heard from the other kids

168
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,960
that Eun Sang isn't
just skipping school.

169
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,299
Apparently, she's gone.

170
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:45,200
Her locker is empty now.

171
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,139
She's actually not rich.
Her father is...

172
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,710
Her father is dead.

173
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,409
- And her mother is...
- Just eat.

174
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:52,409
Okay.

175
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,850
There's my second-oldest brother.

176
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:03,889
What are you doing?

177
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,059
Nice timing.

178
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,559
Where did you park this car
two days ago?

179
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,899
Right in front of my house,
as always. Why do you ask?

180
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,259
Here you go.

181
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,200
Thank you.

182
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,639
Could you give me the SD card
of your car's black box?

183
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,370
Eun Sang is caught
on my car's black box?

184
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,769
She might be. Come on.

185
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,710
Please pass him the SD card.

186
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,990
How do these people know
what I live for so well?

187
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,159
I just got an invite.

188
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,629
Do you want to hit the club?

189
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:42,830
Just give me the SD card!

190
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,259
I'll call you soon.

191
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,570
Get going right now.

192
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:53,899
Where are you going?

193
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,110
Could I make a new account
with this number?

194
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:57,909
It has been unregistered
quite recently.

195
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,139
I'll look into it.

196
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,580
It's in use right now, actually.

197
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,779
It is?

198
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,250
Yes.

199
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,990
Hello? How long have you been
using this number for?

200
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,059
I really need this number.

201
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,659
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'll buy the number off of you.

202
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,970
You just tell me how much you want.

203
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,340
You think I'm kidding?
I'm buying this number!

204
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,639
Just tell me how much you want!

Where are you, Eun Sang? I miss you.

209
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,740
I know the number doesn't exist,
but I just want to talk to you.

210
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,870
(Cha Eun Sang)

211
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:08,549
- Eun Sang?
- You want to die?

212
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,090
You're taking her calls
even when she's not here.

213
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,389
I'm taking this number.
You find another way.

214
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:19,389
That's smart of you.

215
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,789
- Did you get any messages?
- Just one from you.

216
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,730
Did you find out anything?

217
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,029
I'm a detective.
I'm the kind who waits...

218
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:29,570
while confessing my love
to a number that doesn't exist.

219
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:32,200
I'm feeling extra blue right now...

220
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,710
because you crushed my feelings.
Bye.

221
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,820
It's me, Mr. Choi.

222
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,950
Are you still not in touch
with the suspect?

223
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,919
No, not yet.

224
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,320
There are no phones registered
under Eun Sang's name,

225
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,730
and same goes for her guardian,
Park Hee Nam.

226
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,559
She hasn't even registered
for a change in address yet,

227
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,960
so it's impossible to track her.

228
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,899
Please give me a call
when you find anything.

229
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,639
Thank you.

just pay 24 dollars there?

Yes, right now. 24 dollars.

Sorry.

I didn't realize that
it was so late.

Did anyone make a purchase
of 24 dollars?

Yes. At 9:45pm last night.

245
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,230
It was 24 dollars
and it was paid with a card.

246
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:49,309
There was?

247
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,009
Was it a high school student?
Or someone mute?

248
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,150
I think it was
a high school student.

249
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,349
She had long hair
and she was pretty.

250
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,589
I'll be there. Where is your store?

251
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,720
Where? Where did you say she is?

252
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,259
I think Chief Officer Lee got her
out of the airport.

253
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,569
He can't even look after himself.
Why is he meddling with us?

254
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,430
I checked her going
into the departure gate,

255
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:19,269
but I've checked
the surveillance cameras...

256
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:21,309
- and her belongings were...
- Be quiet!

Cheer up, ma'am.

- What?
- Did she run away?

304
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,779
You should go to her house
and get her!

You don't like places without a roof
because it's cold. You should go.

As long as we have the ground.

00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,140
Now that I've seen you safe,
broken up with Tan,

322
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:04,250
I'm more than happy to stroll
along the beach with you,

323
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,849
especially since you've allowed me
to find you the hard way.

324
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,319
I'm feeling awesome.

325
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,950
I was terrified
the moment I saw you.

326
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,160
If you finding me was so easy,

327
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:16,690
then I wonder how many people
would've already come to see me.

328
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm scared.

329
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,400
I'm the least-scariest person...

330
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,529
who'll ever come to see you.

331
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,740
You're right.

332
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:30,009
Are you going to stay here
for good?

333
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:31,769
Are you not coming back to Seoul?

334
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,539
I'll be back once Tan forgets me.

335
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,950
That won't take too long, then.

336
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,549
Don't be a dummy...

337
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,450
and register for a new phone
under your name and all.

338
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,619
You really aren't experienced
in fleeing, are you?

339
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,029
Do you want to run away with me?
I'll teach you how.

340
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,359
Young Do.

341
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:59,200
It hurts every time you call me
like that.

342
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:05,140
- Please don't...
- Don't tell me not to come here.

343
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,480
I risked my father's fury
to find you here.

344
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,220
I'll be back.

345
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,170
Who's Cha Eun Sang?

346
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,970
People are going crazy
over the website.

347
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,970
She's a girl I like.

348
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
The post on the website...

349
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,279
was written by myself, not her.

350
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,420
- What?
- She suddenly disappeared,

351
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,079
and that was the only way for me
to find her.

352
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,359
You're going to be the face
of our hotel soon.

353
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,859
And you went through the trouble
to stir up an issue...

354
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:57,359
that doesn't exist for a girl,

355
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,329
and let the whole world know?

356
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,329
If I didn't find her,

357
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:04,799
I was going to go crazy.

358
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,009
I knew about my consequences.

359
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,210
However,

360
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,109
do not set rules on whether...

361
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,420
I should see her or not.

362
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,319
You can meddle and set rules
on everything in my life,

363
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,920
but not this.

364
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,089
You have no right.

365
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
You're right.

366
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:42,210
- Do you mean that?
- Let's just say that you learned...

367
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,539
that making a deal with me is
more effective...

368
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,410
than going head-to-head with me.

369
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,950
We're having dinner
with CEO Lee's family.

370
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,680
Come with me.

371
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,039
Hotel Zeus is finally taking...

372
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,240
JG Convention Jeju over.

373
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,640
Good things are happening...

374
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:20,210
as our two families come together.

375
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,480
Let's have a toast to celebrate.

376
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:25,579
Sorry.

377
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,519
Talk to me later unless it's urgent.

378
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:31,789
What?

379
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:33,859
What do you mean?

380
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,359
Why is Hotel Zeus...

381
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,900
a target for the seize and search?

382
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,000
We're not like the other
conglomerate companies.

383
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,730
You think meddling
with a hotel business is the same...

384
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,970
as meddling with constructions
and steels businesses?

385
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:48,500
Prosecutor Kim, go home for now.

386
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,480
What kind of a public servant works
so late? See you tomorrow.

387
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
What is it?

388
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
It's nothing.

389
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,990
They want to do a tax investigation
just for the eyes,

390
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,819
but what's the point?

391
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:10,630
I can sort it out tomorrow.
It's no big deal.

392
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,160
We had more important things
to talk about.

393
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,799
I was going to say this
after the toast,

394
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,470
but I'd like to hold our wedding
a little sooner.

395
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,910
You understand, right?

396
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,269
I understand,

397
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,710
but I don't want...

398
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,609
to go through with this wedding.

399
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,220
Seems like we popped
the bottle too soon.

400
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:39,420
That call is just a preview.

401
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,589
I've heard some things. We'll
talk about the details tomorrow,

402
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:45,430
when our kids aren't around.

403
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:48,430
This is my last kind gesture
as your ex-fiancee,

404
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,730
so see you tomorrow.

405
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,369
I'll get going first. Let's go.

406
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,949
No need to make that face.
Even if we get investigated,

407
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:13,360
- it'll just be for formality.
- She's backing out.

408
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,829
Don't worry about it. Hotel Zeus?

409
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm going to pass it onto you
without losing a single penny.

410
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,070
That's not what I'm worried about.

411
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,579
Is Young Do's father going
to get arrested?

412
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,880
Is Hotel Zeus going to go down?

413
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,820
Is that why you're breaking
the engagement off?

414
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,849
It won't go down.
It's a conglomerate corporation.

415
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,119
Laws aren't forever,
but conglomerates are.

416
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:51,730
It's just that I don't need to get
involved in this dirty fight.

417
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
That's why I'm breaking it off.

418
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,769
- That's good.
- That the wedding is off?

419
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,030
That Young Do's family won't be
crumbling down.

420
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,099
You're close with Young Do now?

421
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,510
We're just going through
the same thing.

422
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:06,710
After all, he's the only person
who knows how crushed I felt...

423
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,679
because of you.

424
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:48,150
Only good dreams will
come through the dreamcatcher.

425
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,329
- What?
- I'll do everything you say.

426
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:35,400
I'll go to the US if you tell me to.

427
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,070
I'll give you all my shares
if you want.

428
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,309
I'll disappear forever
if you tell me to.

429
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,480
If you never want to see me again
in your life,

430
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,250
I'll make that happen.

431
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,650
So please,

432
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:57,019
save Eun Sang...

433
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,460
from Father and I.

434
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,659
I have...

435
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,300
ruined Eun Sang's life.

436
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,699
My love for her...

437
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,670
took everything away from her.

438
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:18,869
Her home, school,

439
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,949
friends, and even her future.

440
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,150
I've taken all of that from her.

441
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:32,389
I tried my best to stay by her side,

442
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,659
but why does this have to be
the only way to protect her?

443
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,329
Why is me leaving the only way?

444
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,769
Are you trying to ask for help
or to pick a fight?

445
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,639
I'm giving you the chance to take
everything I have away from me.

446
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,440
So please, make sure that Eun Sang
can come back to where she was.

447
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,150
Are you saying that you'll never
see her again?

448
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,320
Are you okay with that?

449
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,320
I'm going to leave...

450
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,360
after seeing her for one last time.

451
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,789
You can't be here.

452
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,389
What do you want me to do
if you show up like this again?

453
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,559
I'm sorry.

454
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:23,829
If you're sorry, leave.

455
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,940
I left to be away from you,
so why have you found me again?

456
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,210
I'm sorry.

457
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,280
I'll make sure that you get...

458
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,150
everything I've taken away from you.

459
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,420
Your school, your home,

460
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,190
and your friends.

461
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,059
Your life...

462
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:48,789
before you met me.

463
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,360
I'll make sure
you get your life back...

464
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,170
the way it was before you met me.

465
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,239
No need to. I don't want to go back.

466
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,610
I like it here.

467
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:08,010
What you need to do is...

468
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:11,280
to make sure that I don't have
to leave to another city.

469
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,179
So, don't come back.

470
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:17,019
If you come back,

471
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:20,760
I'll have to leave again.

472
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,530
Was I...

473
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:31,630
a nuisance to you
from the moment you met me...

474
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,070
until now?

475
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:42,380
Yes.

476
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,079
I see.

477
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,519
I won't ever come back again.

478
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,590
I'm sorry...

479
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,829
for asking you to hold my hand...

480
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:00,929
and to take courage.

481
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,239
I'm sorry for everything,

482
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,610
Cha Eun Sang.

483
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,730
- You're a mess.
- I found Eun Sang.

484
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:07,260
I went to see her just now.

485
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,059
You're really out of your mind,
aren't you?

486
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,099
But Father,

487
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,639
I won't ever go and see her again.

488
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,579
You win.

489
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,909
I...

490
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
lose.

491
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:30,889
So please, stop messing
with her life.

492
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:33,289
You idiot.

493
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:37,929
Why are you making such a big deal
over just some girl?

494
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,329
Because it hurts!

495
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,000
It's hard and I miss her.

496
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,170
Because life is full of crap!

497
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,250
What have you been doing?
You're drenched.

498
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,389
You have a car and everything.

499
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,329
What if you catch a cold
from all the rain?

500
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,789
Tan!

501
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,199
What's wrong?

502
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,250
Why did he lock the door?

503
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:42,019
Tan, I'm just worried.

504
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:46,860
Tan! Kim Tan!

505
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,900
What's wrong with you?

506
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,900
Tan, open the door.

507
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,170
Tan! Open the door!

508
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:58,440
Tan!

509
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,179
Open the door, Tan!

510
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,210
What should we have for lunch?

511
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:06,739
I'm so hungry. I can't wait.

512
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,590
Did you not hear the bell?
Go back to your seat.

513
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,070
You know Kim Tan, right?

514
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,940
Kids told me
that you're his best friend.

515
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,380
And?

516
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,190
Is something going on
with Tan lately?

517
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,590
Is that what you called me here for?

518
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,190
Do you have anything else
you want to talk about?

519
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,730
Should we talk
about the college entrance exam?

520
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,730
You saw me kiss a girl.

521
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,900
If you called me, that should be
the first thing to talk about.

522
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,670
I did it for you to see.

523
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,239
I see that you like someone.

524
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,969
Maybe you'll be good now, then.

525
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:13,010
I was glad to see it.

526
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,880
Why would you be glad,

527
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,519
when you know who I really like?

528
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:22,179
Can we go back to talking about Tan?

529
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,949
Did you tutor Tan as well?
Why are you so interested?

530
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,489
I know his older brother.

531
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,429
You know Won?

532
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,429
How?

533
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,929
You didn't go to the same school.
You two have nothing in common.

534
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:42,440
Did you two...

535
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,670
date?

536
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,110
No.

537
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:47,980
You did.

538
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,010
Or you two are dating right now.

539
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,280
I told you that that's not true.

540
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:54,920
I must've looked like a joke.

541
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,130
I'm leaving now. You can ask
your boyfriend about Tan.

542
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,050
(Call for Rent Inquiries)

543
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:33,559
(Call for Rent Inquiries)

544
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:13,500
Chairman Kim wanted to
at least know where she was.

545
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:24,440
("Jeguk Group Is Well")

546
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,039
("Jeguk Group's Extravagant Outing")

547
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,119
- Ms. Yang Da Kyung?
- Mr. Kim Won?

548
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:39,090
- You're late.
- Are you here to really marry?

549
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,789
Or are you here
because of Chairman Kim?

550
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:42,789
I don't know.

551
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:45,130
If you're looking for marriage,
you can reach me at this number.

552
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,960
If not, let's just say
that we had a nice dinner.

553
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:48,559
And of course, we had coffee after.

554
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,429
My boyfriend is waiting for me.

555
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:52,230
Why didn't you just come with him?

556
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,840
Let's say that we had a nice dinner,
grabbed coffee, and watched a movie.

557
00:48:56,739 --> 00:48:57,840
I'll get going first.

558
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:01,480
The reason
I'm getting up first is...

559
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,280
because your rude attitude is
exhausting me.

560
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,320
Hello?

561
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,260
The police?

562
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,329
Speeding without a license?

563
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:28,199
- Is this America?
- How long am I supposed to stay?

564
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:31,809
- Can I leave now?
- You're doing this wrong.

565
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,280
What good comes out
of this kind of rebellion?

566
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
Rebellion?

567
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,179
You're funny.

568
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:42,480
Aren't you thankful?

569
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:45,320
I'm living my life the way
you want me to.

570
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,019
There's nobody in the family...

571
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,960
who'll be of threat
to your throne now.

572
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,730
Wait.

573
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,530
We're not family.

574
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,940
You can clear this up for me.

575
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:03,840
Who knows?

576
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,309
Maybe you'll need me
on your side one day.

577
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,050
He drove?

578
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,519
This is getting worse.

579
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,820
What was he thinking?

580
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,889
Can't you see?

581
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:26,659
A boy who had to act like a grownup
is finally crumbling down.

582
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:29,559
Why couldn't he toughen up
before crumbling?

583
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:33,170
During the past 18 years, I've been
looking down and hating him,

584
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:35,269
but he always knocked on my door.

585
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,070
He was honest and friendly.

586
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,639
You have no idea
how tough he is inside.

587
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,539
But that kid is crumbling
to his feet right now.

588
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,750
- Can't you read between the lines?
- I don't want to hear it.

589
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:51,090
How did your blind date
with the VS Telecom girl go?

590
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,920
Did you get rid of the girl
that Tan is in love with?

591
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,590
Plan your wedding to be
in spring next year.

592
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:58,190
We need VS Telecom.

593
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,800
I asked, did you get rid of the girl
that Tan is in love with?

594
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,599
What do you mean, get rid of her?

595
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,329
She's just living her life
and I did what I had to do.

596
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,269
Aren't I enough?

597
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:10,340
I wouldn't have meddled with him
if you were doing fine.

598
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,610
But you're a mess yourself
with Hyun Joo,

599
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:15,840
so how am I just supposed
to let Tan be?

600
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,449
If your mother's side of family is
so lowly and so are your wives,

601
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,380
how will you do any business?

602
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,519
Do you have any plans on
trusting us anytime soon?

603
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,989
Don't you think that maybe
you should leave things to us?

604
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:28,219
Bring Chairman Yang's granddaughter
of VS Telecom...

605
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:32,530
to meet with me.
I'll trust you, then.

606
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,099
How is that trusting me?

607
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:36,260
Get going now. I'm tired.

608
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,039
I've been very tired lately.

609
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,309
The major doesn't matter,
as long as it's an ivy league.

610
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,949
Bye now. I'm in the Nurse's Room.

611
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,289
(Hyo Shin)

612
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:02,860
You have to be quiet
in the Nurse's Room.

613
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:28,019
Why do you look so flustered
every time you see me?

614
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,820
I'm not flustered. I'm dumbfounded.

615
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,920
Why are you dumbfounded, then?

616
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:40,159
Can we just pretend
that nothing happened?

617
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:47,039
The whole school knows, but sure.

618
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,539
What's the point of coming to school
if you're not going to a university?

619
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:54,909
Shouldn't you be preparing
to take next year's exam?

620
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,250
Should I? Prepare for university
next year?

621
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,579
What else would you do if you don't?

622
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:04,550
Did you not see me get
the Gold Award...

623
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,949
at the Asia Youth
Short Film Festival?

624
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,360
That's a free entrance ticket...

625
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:10,760
to any Film Department
of all universities in Korea.

626
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,829
Then why are you so smart?

627
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:14,800
It's nice to be knowledgeable.

628
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:22,039
My head hurts.

629
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,179
The DJ lineup is insane!

630
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:38,349
We have to go, Young Do!
It's tomorrow.

631
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,989
Why are you even pretending
that you're going for the music?

632
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:44,159
You only go clubbing
when there are women.

633
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:45,760
Women are music.

634
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,929
Then what type of music am I
for you, honey?

635
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,099
Christmas carols?

636
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,340
- Punk metal.
- You want to die?

637
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,809
If you dare to take one more step,

638
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:59,980
I'm going to take Chan Young
away from you!

639
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,909
How dare you say such a thing?

640
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,280
Can't believe that he got jealous.

641
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,050
Can't believe that he got used.

642
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,289
Take this. It's good for the heart.

643
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,929
It's concerning that my Bo Na makes
so many men's hearts beat fast.

644
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:18,059
That's what you think.

645
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,659
Can we leave Tan like that?

646
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,760
He went to the police the other day.
He's going all out.

647
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,869
His face looked terrible today too.

648
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:26,800
Tomorrow is Jeguk Constructions'
foundation anniversary.

649
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,769
I hope he shows himself like that
in public and gets bashed.

650
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:31,139
Come on.

651
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:37,250
Thanks to industrialization,
Jeguk Constructions...

652
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:40,750
could take the next step.

653
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,920
Back then, it was us...

654
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,190
who built the tallest building
in the country.

655
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:48,159
It was also us...

656
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,230
that built the biggest
apartment complex.

657
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:55,800
We take pride in being the first
and the best.

658
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,300
63 years have passed
and in 2013, we're still the same.

659
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,739
The JG Convention Center in Jeju,
our next project,

660
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:10,980
will be an amazing project
that'll help Jeguk Constructions...

661
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,519
take another step
toward being the leading figure.

662
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:17,190
(Jeguk Constructions
63rd Anniversary)

663
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:26,730
Where are you? I'm here.

664
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,360
That's so loud.

665
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,329
What?

666
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,900
You saw who?

667
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:35,469
Kim Tan?

668
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,789
Hey! You should apologize
when you bump into someone!

669
00:55:57,559 --> 00:55:59,590
How dare you ignore me?

670
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,670
Are you insane, you punk?

671
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,639
Come here, you loser.

672
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:15,739
It's cold outside.
What are you doing here?

673
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,550
Come here!

674
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,449
Stop it.

675
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:26,119
- You guys should stop too.
- And who are you?

676
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,420
Hey, take care of these guys.

677
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,929
Stop.

678
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,429
Are you serious?

679
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,699
Get your life together!

680
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,909
You idiot.

681
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:23,039
If you miss Eun Sang,

682
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,280
just go and at least see her
from afar.

683
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,980
I'm not going there anymore.

684
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,289
You can have her.

685
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:15,130
I still love Tan.

686
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,400
How can you young kid
be so fearless?

687
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,969
I won't see him
since you told me not to.

688
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:20,969
When do I go to the States?

689
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:23,369
Nothing is going to change
by you acting like this!

690
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:24,369
Save me.

691
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:26,769
Your mother is at school right now.

692
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:29,639
You've abandoned her.
I'm going to take care of her now.

693
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,179
And how are you going to do that?

694
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,980
By not seeing you again.

695
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,550
Bye. Let's not see each other
ever again.

696
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,949
I'm breaking up with you right now.

697
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:40,150
Will we ever be able to forget
how much we were in love?

698
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,619
- Hello, Tan.
- Is that really you?

699
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,699
(The Heirs)
