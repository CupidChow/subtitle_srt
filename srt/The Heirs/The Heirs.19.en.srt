00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,969
(Episode 19)

4
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:37,539
Goodness.

5
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,420
There are still so many people
who want to be on your side.

6
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,450
You must stay healthy.

7
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,649
What's the point?

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,490
My own two sons aren't on my side.

9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,460
I heard Tan's mom left.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,229
She must think the two of you
are still dating.

11
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,229
That's the problem.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,229
How nice would it be if she
just stayed quiet and listened...

13
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,939
so that she could get a cut
of my fortune?

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,709
Yes.

15
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,280
Nam Yoon. It's been a long time.
How have you been?

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,849
Hello, Uncle Nam Yoon.

17
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,519
Everyone was worried you'd collapse
after the news about Tan broke out.

18
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:22,420
Everyone's worrying so much about
my health, so how could I get sick?

19
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,120
Have you been well?

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,659
Ji Sook. I found out about Tan
through the news.

21
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,200
I was so surprised.

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,000
You must've gone through so much
because of Nam Yoon.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,769
No, of course not.
I have two sons whom I adopted,

24
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,469
so I'm reassured.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,040
You should go and eat.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,239
- Of course.
- Okay.

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,250
Goodness, Chairman Yang. Welcome.

28
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,049
Goodness, Chairman Kim.

29
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,719
How is your health?

30
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,290
Yes.

31
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:01,730
Cheese.

32
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,030
Cheese.

33
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,299
- Cheese.
- What are you doing?

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,969
I'm taking selfies.

35
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,129
Cheese.

36
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:15,169
Oh, man.

37
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,680
I think I just said cheese
to Tan's dad.

38
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,039
We just locked eyes.

39
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,319
Oh, my gosh. It's you!

40
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,689
- Bo Na.
- "Oh, my gosh. It's you"?

41
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,599
Isn't this the thing you like?

42
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:39,729
Yes.

43
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,229
- Illicit love.
- When did you get here?

44
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,400
I came yesterday.

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,199
Your skin cleared up.

46
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,469
Come with me.

47
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,210
- Say hello. This is...
- Lee Bo Na.

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,379
I knew this would happen.

49
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,810
What did I say I would do to
your legs if you came to this party?

50
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,349
Take them. They were always yours.

51
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,719
How can you say that while
linking arms with another guy?

52
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,319
- Let go of his arm.
- There will be a problem...

53
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,590
if you yell at my sister like that.

54
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,919
Who's your sister?

55
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,560
Yes. It's my brother.
The one who's studying in New York.

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,830
You're in trouble now.

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,530
I heard a lot about you.

58
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,800
You must be Chan Young.

59
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,939
It's nice to meet you,
Yoon Chan Young.

60
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,240
Since we said our hellos,

61
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,439
shall we talk about what you said
regarding my sister's legs?

62
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,580
No, it's okay.

63
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,539
You're late today.

64
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,409
I guess your boyfriend
didn't come today.

65
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:00,379
My boyfriend is poor, so he can't
come to places like these.

66
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,409
That's why I came with my rich dad.

67
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,449
Do you have a girlfriend?

68
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,990
Yes.

69
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,389
I guess that's why
we look good together.

70
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,259
My dad said we should get married.

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,689
We don't look good together.

72
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,100
It doesn't matter.

73
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,170
I guess the guest of honor
isn't here yet.

74
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,500
I heard you two aren't
biologically related.

75
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,310
Tan. I have a few questions for you.
Please say a word to us.

76
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,610
Can you say something about
today's party? Who is that?

77
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,180
Isn't that his fiancee?

78
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,519
- His fiancee?
- Really?

79
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,759
Are you nervous?

80
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,769
A little?

81
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,699
It's an honor to have you...

82
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,769
by my side today, Cha Eun Sang.

83
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,699
- Can you say a word?
- Please back up.

84
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,560
- Tan, can you tell her who she is?
- Step back.

85
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,300
- Is this your fiancee?
- You can't come in here.

86
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,639
- Tan.
- Tan, please give us a statement.

87
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,970
- Can you look at us?
- Turn around!

88
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,939
- Look here.
- You can't come in here.

89
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,389
Can you tell us who she is?

90
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,259
Please say something.

91
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,800
Can you please give us a statement?

92
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,029
Can you tell us who she is?

93
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,220
We're here, Father.

94
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,120
I'm here too.

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,420
Hello.

96
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,329
Thank you so much for hosting
this splendid birthday party.

97
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,199
The reporters are watching.

98
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,110
Thank you for coming, Uncle.

99
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,339
Thanks for coming.

100
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,310
Hi. It's been a long time.

101
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,420
But who is she?

102
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,089
She's my girlfriend.

103
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,060
They are my uncles and cousin.

104
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,189
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Cha Eun Sang.

105
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,600
Is she the reason why you broke off
your engagement?

106
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,730
I'm Reporter Shin Seok Dong
from Daily Media.

107
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,399
Can you please give us a statement
Chairman Kim?

108
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,569
Please Chairman Kim.
Can you give us a statement?

109
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:14,810
Can you give us
an official statement?

110
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,439
- Can you say something?
- Please give us a statement.

111
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,139
- Please give us a statement.
- Please say something.

112
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:24,819
I think you got enough photographs.
You should stop now.

113
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,089
- Please give us a statement.
- Please say something.

114
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,860
- Please back up.
- Please give us a statement.

115
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,329
Please say something.

116
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,970
Are you out of your mind?

117
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,240
Do you know how many eyes
and mouths there are here?

118
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,139
You must be crazy...

119
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:50,009
to show up here like that!

120
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,040
I wanted to brag about Eun Sang
to the world.

121
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,110
I'm not afraid of what the world
has to say or your scolding.

122
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,379
You think your love is so great?

123
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,449
Do you think your love is
beyond great to cause such a fuss?

124
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,290
I told you I'd give you
a bigger world.

125
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,329
I told you I'd hand it to you
on a silver platter!

126
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,230
I know what kind of world
you're trying to give to me.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,069
But Father, I don't want
the world you can give to me...

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,730
more than her.

129
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,769
So please give us...

130
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,269
your permission, Father.

131
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,029
Fine.
If you like each other so much,

132
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,769
go ahead and date.

133
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,870
- Are you serious?
- If you think this my permission,

134
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,070
you're sorely mistaken.

135
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,679
I believe that you will...

136
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,679
end up regretting this decision.

137
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,850
There will come a day...

138
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,460
when you will also regret
hindering my son.

139
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,669
Your mother...

140
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,799
is in Room 3409
of this building, right?

141
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,610
Don't think...

142
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,779
that I lost to you.

143
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,720
I'm just going easy on you.

144
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,639
Did we get his permission,
or did he threaten us?

145
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,370
It's a permission that can change
into a threat at any time.

146
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,909
Be understanding of his harsh words.

147
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,350
That's his final pride.

148
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,350
Then we...

149
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,690
Yes.

150
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,320
We overcame one obstacle.

151
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,600
Happy birthday, Kim Tan.

152
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:59,399
Let's go have my real birthday party
on the 34th floor.

153
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,570
My mom left the house.

154
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:02,929
Ms. Han did?

155
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,740
She left, but she's still confined.

156
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,039
She can't even come to her son's
birthday party.

157
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,610
Let's go to her.

158
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,629
Ta-da.

159
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:38,799
My son.

160
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,740
- Hello.
- Oh, my. Aren't you Eun Sang?

161
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,539
Were you in Seoul?

162
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,779
How could you leave like that
and not give me a call?

163
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,149
But what's with your outfit?

164
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,289
Did you take her to the party?

165
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:00,159
Mom, wish me a happy birthday first.
The candles are melting.

166
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,659
Let's go inside.

167
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,269
Happy birthday, my son.

168
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,269
Thank you for being born
as my son.

169
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,799
Me too.
I'm going to blow out the candles.

170
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,409
My gosh. You need to make a wish.

171
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,039
And we need to sing you
the birthday song.

172
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,750
I already made my wish,
and it's a secret.

173
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Hold on. Stay still.

174
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,330
What is he doing?

175
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,070
He took out something that's
really shiny and pretty.

176
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,049
Thank you for giving birth to me.

177
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,820
I hope that all the time
you've lived as Kim Tan's mom...

178
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,389
was filled with happiness.

179
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,830
Of course. I was so happy.

180
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,730
I'm happy now too.

181
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,200
Thank you.

182
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,639
How did the two of you
leave that party alive?

183
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,070
Father went easy on us.

184
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,110
Easy on you, my foot. You guys lost.

185
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm not going to lose
to your father either.

186
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,250
I think Father's going easy
on you too.

187
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,950
He knows you're here.

188
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:32,220
What?

189
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,389
Where's your mom?
Where do you live right now?

190
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,240
Ms. Park!

191
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,710
How can you do this?

192
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,279
How can you leave without saying
anything to me? You're so mean.

193
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,389
I know I was mean to you,

194
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,120
but affection can grow from
hatred too.

195
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,429
I don't hate you.
I wrote you a letter.

196
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:16,889
She said she doesn't hate you
and that she wrote you a letter.

197
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,799
I know.
It was only three lines long.

198
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,500
You don't know how depressing those
three lines were to me. I'm so mad.

199
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,769
Why have you lost so much weight?

200
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,909
Despite everything that happened,
working for me was the best, right?

201
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,509
Where's your house? It's cold.

202
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,419
Ms. Park. Be honest.
Did you miss me or not?

203
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,730
You're such a liar.
How could not even send me a text?

204
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,399
Hey, it's me. We just got here.

205
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
They were hugging
and making a scene.

206
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,399
Where is my boyfriend?

207
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,440
I came to see Young Do.
We have something to talk about.

208
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,470
I see.

209
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,710
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
You, your mother, and my mom.

210
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,350
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.

211
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:25,730
What is it? Why are you stalling?

212
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,769
- It's about my mom.
- Don't.

213
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,340
Let's not feel sorry or grateful
to one another.

214
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,779
I'm grateful, and I'm sorry.

215
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,279
Then what does that make me?

216
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,409
You don't have to do anything.
I just feel that way.

217
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,820
I'll get going.

218
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,419
- Hey.
- Don't see me out.

219
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,889
I didn't...

220
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,129
miss my mom because of you.

221
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,330
She just left first.

222
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,169
But I...

223
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,570
needed you to blame,

224
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,580
and...

225
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,149
I did that.

226
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,980
I know. Bye.

227
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,250
Hey.

228
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,190
When did you get here?
Did you eat?

229
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,500
- I already saw everything.
- You did?

230
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,529
What did I tell you?

231
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,900
Didn't I tell you that first loves
never come true?

232
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,170
You should've listened to me
before it was forced to end.

233
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,509
It wasn't forced to end.

234
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,109
- Don't kid yourself.
- What are you talking about?

235
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,980
I prepared this for you,
whose first love is unrequited.

236
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,049
Ta-da.

237
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,079
(Kim Tan, Cha Eun Sang, and dogs
are prohibited from entering.)

238
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,220
- I'll post this on the door.
- Take dogs out.

239
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,480
- What did dogs ever do to you?
- You're right.

240
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,259
We should take Cha Eun Sang out.

241
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:35,259
She is your first love after all.

242
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,089
Do you want to die?

243
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,470
Gosh. Why are you practicing
so hard all of sudden?

244
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,240
I should beat my father,
who's always a step ahead.

245
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,380
You will never beat him
with your skills.

246
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,519
I'll practice harder.

247
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,700
How can you leave your home?

248
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:20,869
You don't have any skills,
nor are you young.

249
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,140
You don't know how scary
the world is.

250
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,680
My gosh!

251
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,680
You wrote
two exclamation points here.

252
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,519
That makes me upset.

253
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,990
My glass has been empty for ages,
but you won't fill my glass too.

254
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,619
You're so mean.

255
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,970
I had no idea my life would
turn out this way either.

256
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,180
Another woman's house.

257
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,710
Another woman's bags.

258
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,150
Another woman's husband.

259
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,529
This is the price I have to pay
for wanting those things.

260
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:23,230
I never had a chance to be...

261
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,509
one man's wife...

262
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,039
or my son's mother.

263
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,849
I need to use the restroom.

264
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,079
How did you know to come here?
I was just calling you.

265
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,480
When did you get here?
I'm not here to see you though.

266
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,349
- Then why are you here?
- To meet some guy.

267
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,589
What? Who?

268
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,119
What kind of guy
are you meeting at this hour?

269
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:06,269
Hey. How does that make sense?
Why would you move there?

270
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,140
Returning to the time before
we moved into the maid's room...

271
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,140
is my beginning as well as my life.

272
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,880
Why don't you just move
into the apartment?

273
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,740
I know that the pain you underwent
and your broken life...

274
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,579
can't be healed with money,

275
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:16,980
but think of it as a compensation.

276
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,519
My mother and I already discussed
about the issue with moving,

277
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,890
and we've decided to move back
to our old neighborhood.

278
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,920
I feel reassured and grateful
for your support alone.

279
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,089
I'm not supporting you.
I'm just trying to right a wrong.

280
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,230
Can't you just live
in the apartment?

281
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,259
If you knew what kind of deal I made
to get that apartment for you...

282
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,930
Forget it. Just move in there.

283
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,039
How can I move in there? Who knows
what will happen to us and when?

284
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,869
If we break up, taking care of
those issues will complicate things.

285
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,869
- What?
- I'm dating you right now...

286
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,180
because I can't live without you,

287
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,039
but let's be real.
Who knows what our future holds?

288
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,809
Hey.
I can't live without you either.

289
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,809
That's our future, you dummy.

290
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,950
- Hey, guys.
- Won. Stay quiet.

291
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,019
I'll take care of it.

292
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,089
- Are you going to be this way?
- There's no guarantee...

293
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,420
that we'll be happy forever.

294
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,759
I could end up dumping you.

295
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,119
Be quiet. This won't do. Follow me.

296
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,329
You can go home first.

297
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,859
Where are you taking me?

298
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,509
I'm sorry for worrying you.

299
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,009
Please forgive me.

300
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,779
I will make sure
this never happens again.

301
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,549
I even got permission
from my father.

302
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:31,289
So I want to get your permission...

303
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,990
and start seeing
Eun Sang officially.

304
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,630
Please give us your permission,
Mother.

305
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,910
Gosh. This is so frustrating.
Why isn't anyone talking?

306
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:56,079
Ms. Park. Are you against my son?

307
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,180
It seems that way.

308
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,519
I'm sorry, but I can't give
these two my permission.

309
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,000
I don't want to be involved
with your family anymore.

310
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:16,430
My daughter was hurt a lot.

311
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,730
Mom.

312
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,640
Is your mother refusing
to give you her permission?

313
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:23,509
My son is handsome, tall, kind,

314
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:26,079
and he puts his life on the line
for Eun Sang.

315
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:28,549
My son is perfect,
so why don't you like him?

316
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,750
My daughter Eun Sang
is pretty, kind,

317
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,619
and she's even a good student.

318
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,220
What did she say?

319
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,190
So she said...

320
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,460
Your curfew is at 9pm from now on.

321
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:46,299
Don't you dare come home late.

322
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:50,369
If you are dragged home again,
I'm going to kill you.

323
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,740
She said to make sure I come home...

324
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,109
and that we're allowed
to hold hands.

325
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,950
Do what you're good at.

326
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:09,250
Oh, my. Did you just hit my son?

327
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,890
Tan. Are you okay?
It must hurt a lot.

328
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,190
I think I'll be okay
if she gives me her permission.

329
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,960
If she doesn't, you should sue her.
Sue her!

330
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,009
Thanks, Mom.

331
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,549
Thank you, Mother.

332
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,490
Why did you come out of there?

333
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,990
Why? Did you think
I only live in fairy tales?

334
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,759
Hurry up and come here.

335
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,769
Walk straight. Is that hard?

336
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,769
I bet you've never had
to walk in the dark, young master.

337
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:35,509
Just trust me and walk.

338
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:38,240
My gosh. Can't I come in normally?

339
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,640
Stop talking back to me.

340
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,509
I told you I would do something
if you kept talking back to me.

341
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:43,009
I know this because I've lived here.

342
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:46,180
My home isn't an ideal place
to hold a surprise event.

343
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,190
What?

344
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,529
What are you doing?

345
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:57,589
Kim Tan is quite handsome.

346
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,930
Hi, Kim Tan.

347
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,970
Do you like it?

348
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,269
When did you find all of this?

349
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,509
I held onto that
and barely made it through.

350
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,809
(It was nice to see you
in my dream too.)

351
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:23,819
Seeing this video makes me think
that I look good on camera.

352
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,160
You're not going to say
that you're moved?

353
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,359
I told you I prefer horror
to romance.

354
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,160
Or this.

355
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,029
Thrillers.

356
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,970
Fine. You can watch
as many thrillers you want at home.

357
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,099
But right now, let's be romantic.

358
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,670
Don't do it.

359
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,680
Don't do what?

360
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,079
I only need to take two and a half
steps to catch you in this house.

361
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,150
My mom's going to be here soon.

362
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,950
It's okay. We can lock the door.

363
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,490
- Stop. Hey.
- See?

364
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,690
- Stop it.
- Come here.

365
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:10,829
Hey. If you bumped into someone,
you should apologize.

366
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,000
Is this how you were raised at home?

367
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:16,940
It makes sense. You and your mom
both broke off your engagements.

368
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,279
I guess you'd need a proper home
to receive a proper upbringing.

369
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,109
What are you looking at?
Everyone already knows.

370
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,049
Your mom and Young Do's dad
called off their wedding.

371
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,319
We thought you were something
because you were Kim Tan's fiancee,

372
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,890
not because we were afraid of you.

373
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,559
Is being Choi Young Do's
younger sister not enough?

374
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,900
I've been too nice these days,
right?

375
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
Everyone's staring.

376
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:58,920
Get up. Let's go out.

377
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:07,559
Let's look like we're friendly.

378
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,829
That way those petty kids
can't act up.

379
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,259
Do you have any plans
to be mean again?

380
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,269
You should put
your hair back up too.

381
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,440
I like how things are now.

382
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,470
It's not working for you.
Reconsider it.

383
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,279
Kids aren't afraid of you
as much anymore.

384
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,650
But it's enough to save you, Sister.

385
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,160
Why am I still your sister?

386
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,160
Because I'm going
to be your brother.

387
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,500
You can lean on me once in a while.

388
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,299
You seem really free these days.

389
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,329
Are things over with Cha Eun Sang?

390
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,710
Was there anything to end with her?

391
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:59,079
I didn't need her permission
or her opinion.

392
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:00,940
I just had to end things alone.

393
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:05,220
Is everything okay
with your dad's company?

394
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,250
- For now.
- I hope I don't end up...

395
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,349
comforting you.

396
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:14,690
I feel like we spent an entire
semester comforting each other.

397
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:16,829
I'm going to class.

398
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,160
I heard our grades have been posted.

399
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,460
- Really?
- Yes.

400
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:53,799
Don't come anywhere near me
from now on. Stay far away.

401
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,900
- Why?
- Our grades have been posted.

402
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:58,170
If Chan Young loses to Yoo Rachel
because you disappeared...

403
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,470
and couldn't study because he
was worried, I'm going to be mean.

404
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:11,009
- Stop playing around and move.
- Get out.

405
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,819
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

406
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:15,079
Go. Go away.

407
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,750
- What is he doing?
- Gosh.

408
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,789
Kim Tan.

409
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,160
- Move.
- Move over.

410
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,029
- Hey!
- Hey!

411
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,160
- Kim Tan!
- Did you come in last again?

412
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:25,900
Kim Tan! Stop right there!

413
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,529
Hey! You said you'd always stand
behind me!

414
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,740
Then go in front of me.

415
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,539
So you keep the promises you make.

416
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,650
You're so cheap!
How can you use your beauty to win!

417
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,150
Where did you hide it?
Give it to me when I'm being nice.

418
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,720
Don't come near me. My mom told me
not to even hold hands with you.

419
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:52,220
Your mom's not here right now.

420
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,190
Do you want to die?
Why did you rip the grades?

421
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,259
I'm not ready to face my grades yet.

422
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,660
The truth will come out eventually.
Why bother hiding it for now?

423
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,430
I have trauma. Give it to me.

424
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:03,900
Are you sure you're in 100th place?

425
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,269
Do you want something to drink?

426
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,279
Hold on.

427
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:22,019
Hey. What are you doing?
Give me back my wallet.

428
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,920
Look at you. You're trying to
use your strength against me again.

429
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,420
How badly did you do on the test
to make this fuss?

430
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,490
- Give it to me.
- I think it's best that...

431
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,259
I don't return it for the sake of
our trust.

432
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,059
I want to date you for a long time.

433
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,269
Goodness, you're unbelievable.

434
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:38,069
You got a text. Check it. They must
be waiting for your response.

435
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,940
(Jeguk High School Group Chat)

436
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,740
I took the initiative to set
an example for Kim Tan,

437
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,980
who took away the students'
rights to know.

438
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,509
Chan Young sent us our grades.
Just wait.

439
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,819
- Gosh, Yoon Chan Young.
- Let's look at it together.

440
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,289
Chan Young, I'm the first
to leave a comment for you too.

441
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:59,289
- Myung Soo.
- Jo Myung Soo!

442
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,420
Jo Myung Soo.

443
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,730
Don't invite me to these things.

444
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,759
What is this? Everyone's laughing.

445
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,900
Myung Soo stole your throne.

446
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,400
- Then...
- Don't scroll down.

447
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,740
What? Kim Tan. You're in 50th place.

448
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:16,670
What? I am?

449
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,269
What happened?

450
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:22,579
I finally found a middle point
in my life.

451
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:25,650
To be honest,
it's just that I didn't try...

452
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,319
Choi Young Do is in 27th place.

453
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,349
I'm sure it's 97th place.

454
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:29,720
He's in 27th place.

455
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,220
Choi Young Do is so cool. He must've
solved the questions this time.

456
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:36,359
Is our final exam the only test
we'll take?

457
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:39,230
Who knows how I'll rank next time.
Why are you saying 27th is cool?

458
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,599
I went from 100th place to 50th, so
how do you think I'll do next time?

459
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,470
It'll be hard because of Chan Young.

460
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,099
Come to think,
Chan Young is really cool too.

461
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,869
If he's so cool,
you should date him instead.

462
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,380
What place did you come in?

463
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,549
Stop right there.
What place did you come in?

464
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,579
You're dead meat if I catch you!

465
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,509
You beat me for the first time.

466
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,140
- Yes.
- What do you want?

467
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,109
Tell me.

468
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,279
My mom.

469
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,190
Tell me where my mom is.

470
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,590
Unfortunately,
I can't fulfill that wish.

471
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,030
I don't know where...

472
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,070
your mom is either.

473
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:28,809
Thank goodness.

474
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,710
(Tan!)

475
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,460
(Choi Young Do)

476
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,989
You're Choi Young Do.

477
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,699
Yes. Do you know me?

478
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:55,230
I know your face.
I just didn't know your name.

479
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,469
Here, take this. Someone left this
with me to give to you.

480
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:05,309
- Who did?
- It was a pretty lady.

481
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,010
I got it a while ago,
but I forgot about it.

482
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,150
Who is it?

483
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:13,849
Have you been well, Young Do?

484
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,920
(Have you been well, Young Do? No.)

485
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,050
No.

486
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,090
What do you want?

487
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,559
Did you wait until Chan Young left
to approach me?

488
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,760
I waited until Cha Eun Sang left
to approach you.

489
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,269
Do you know what Eun Sang likes?

490
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:32,599
I'm not even her friend,
so how would I know what she likes.

491
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:35,199
Are you going to give her a gift?
There's so much she doesn't have.

492
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,539
She always borrows my toe shoes,

493
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,570
and the back of her cellphone case
is cracked.

494
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,639
She said that my owl cushion
was pretty,

495
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,039
and she said
she lost her wallet too.

496
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,409
She said some crazy guy
stole her wallet.

497
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,480
- The crazy guy is me.
- I know. I was talking about you.

498
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,550
I did it on purpose,
so I can buy her a new one.

499
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,590
My gosh.

500
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,860
We have two requests for outside
cooperation this week.

501
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,019
One of them is Seryun High School.

502
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,130
They requested equipment
and a female anchorwoman...

503
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,059
for their broadcasting festival.
What should we do?

504
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:59,860
It's Seryun High School.
Why are you bothering to ask?

505
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,900
We definitely need to help them out.

506
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,159
Why is that definite?

507
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,599
The guys in Seryun High School's
broadcasting club are really cute.

508
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,000
You have a boyfriend.

509
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,110
Hey. Can't they be handsome
even if I have a boyfriend?

510
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,539
Then have a meeting with them
to choose the female anchorwoman.

511
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,940
Eun Sang. Are you going with us?

512
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,710
- I have to work today.
- Did you already get a job?

513
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,880
We can meet them
at the place you work, then.

514
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,250
- Let's go.
- Okay.

515
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,320
- Are they really handsome?
- You know I have high standards.

516
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,159
Be careful, and I'll see you later.

517
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,929
I wonder what Tan is doing.

518
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,400
I wonder if Chan Young is nearby.

519
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:39,940
This is our new producer. Say hello.

520
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,539
This is Seryun High School's
producer and anchor.

521
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:42,840
Hi.

522
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,639
I guess all the girls at your school
are pretty.

523
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,739
Bo Na and I are particularly pretty.

524
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,250
You have a good personality too.
Do you have a boyfriend?

525
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,650
Honey.

526
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:58,719
She's married. Can't you tell?

527
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,519
- You should go.
- We haven't even discussed...

528
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,559
the broadcasting festival.

529
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,860
Let's just go for today.
We'll call you again.

530
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,400
Don't you dare call her again.

531
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,369
What do you have in your hair?

532
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,039
Lee Bo Na. What are you
doing with my girlfriend...

533
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,079
in the middle of the day?

534
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,210
I'm at a loss for words.

535
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,349
Why are you getting angry with her?

536
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,820
Do you think Eun Sang's
Ms. Nightingale or something?

537
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,480
She's obsessed with guys.

538
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,119
Yoon Chan Young.
Why are you making things up?

539
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,090
Cha Eun Sang.
Why are you yelling at Chan Young?

540
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,059
- You didn't do anything right.
- Why are you making a fuss?

541
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:36,059
Am I your girlfriend?

542
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:37,630
So why did you go and meet
other guys?

543
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,829
- Right?
- You should be stopping him.

544
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:41,460
Isn't Kim Tan the type of guy
you get sick of?

545
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,300
Who cares if he's handsome?
Good looks?

546
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,900
That only lasts for three months.

547
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,340
Men should be intellectual.

548
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:53,380
Can't we just end things as two
male students who are jealous?

549
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,110
- What?
- That's what I like. Why?

550
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,679
I like it when you restrict
and obsess over each other.

551
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,789
I want to kill any guy
who even looks at you.

552
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,889
Furthermore, I even hate
to think of them thinking about you.

553
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,090
Gosh, you hate the strangest things.

554
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,059
It's because you don't know men.

555
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,929
All men are the same. Except me.

556
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,159
Why would you take yourself out?

557
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,900
If you take yourself out,
that's not credible.

558
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,900
I like you in an innocent way.
I like you for life.

559
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:20,739
- "Innocent"?
- Hey.

560
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,139
My heart is pure.

561
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:26,110
How can you prove that?
Will you take it out and show me?

562
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,010
Forget it. I'm disappointed in you.

563
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,780
Hey, Kim Tan.
Are you really leaving?

564
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,250
When are you going to give me back
my wallet?

565
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,690
Right now.

566
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,329
- What is this?
- Your wallet.

567
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,800
I'm so happy that we're fighting
over something between us...

568
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,440
and not over our circumstances.

569
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,300
Let's fight like this every day.
I'll get going.

570
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,030
My gosh.

571
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:41,949
(Hamlim)

572
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,059
I heard you became vice president.

573
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,000
I heard you broke off
your engagement with Mr. Choi.

574
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:35,469
I heard that Hotel Zeus will be
investigated by the prosecution.

575
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,969
You're just as smart today
as you were 20 years ago.

576
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,409
How's Rachel doing?

577
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:47,420
About the broken engagement?

578
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,590
Rachel cried.

579
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,130
She doesn't cry often,

580
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,159
but she must've liked Tan a lot.

581
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,500
But...

582
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,570
she doesn't know how to express
how she feels.

583
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:09,440
I couldn't teach her that.

584
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:12,440
I don't know how to do it myself.

585
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,849
Seeing Rachel made me ask myself...

586
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:21,579
why I'm living like this.

587
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,250
How are you living?

588
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:28,090
I living by making a lot of money.

589
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,329
I'm living as a wealthy person.

590
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,800
I'm living without Yoon Jae Ho.

591
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,880
You used to nag at me all the time
to cut down on wine.

592
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,949
What's gotten into you today?

593
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,760
Things that are better than wine
will happen to you now,

594
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:02,860
- so let's drink together.
- Are you trying to sneak a drink?

595
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,829
You're supposed to learn
how to drink from your dad,

596
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,599
and from now on, you're my dad.

597
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:16,809
When should we move? Won said
we can move in when you want to.

598
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:18,039
I'm not going to move.

599
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,480
I don't want a nice house anymore.

600
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,079
I'm just going to travel here
and there.

601
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,050
I'm not going to travel
with bodyguards...

602
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,150
and go back and forth from
department stores and hotels.

603
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:35,360
I'm going to walk around and see
all the skies in the world.

604
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,760
First, I'm going to walk around
the middle of Gangnam.

605
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,630
Let's walk together.
I'll hold your hand.

606
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,699
Okay. Hold my hand tomorrow,

607
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,309
and go back to your father.

608
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,039
Your father is alone.

609
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,010
I'm not going to go.

610
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,719
I told you that you're my dad now.

611
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,320
Don't be like that.

612
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,650
I'm home.

613
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:48,059
Won! Won! Are you back from school?

614
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,530
Did you study too much?

615
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,369
Oh, Father.

616
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:19,289
It's a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

617
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:21,519
We can't perform surgery
on it right now.

618
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,630
If you don't do it now,
do we leave him in coma like that?

619
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,730
Surgery isn't possible because
he's in coma.

620
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,329
The location of the blood vessel
of the bleed is in a bad place too.

621
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,800
We can't even touch it right now
because of the cerebral edema.

622
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,840
We have to do the surgery
when he regains his consciousness.

623
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,840
What if he doesn't wake up?

624
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,340
We have to hope that he does.

625
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,079
What are you doing here?
We have to start moving.

626
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,690
Stop making a fuss.
I'm thinking right now.

627
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,590
You've been thinking for 20 years.
What's there to think about?

628
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,219
We have to attack them
before he wakes up.

629
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,489
You have to call Lawyer Park
and get the voting right.

630
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,630
If we move rashly.
we could end up with nothing,

631
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:38,030
get caught up in lawsuits,
and look like fools.

632
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,139
Do you think there will be
a better opportunity than this?

633
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,340
Won has a lot
on his plate right now.

634
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,369
We need to get rid of him now.
We won't get another chance.

635
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:48,610
Do you think that CEO Kim is
unaware of our plan?

636
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:52,079
What's the reason you endured
everything in that household...

637
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,320
and stayed married to him?

638
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,119
You waited for this day.

639
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,989
You should get compensated
for all the sorrows you've had.

640
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:01,619
Of course.

641
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,760
I'm doing this so that I can get
compensated properly.

642
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,230
Find out what's going on
at the hospital.

643
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,670
I have someone I need to call.

644
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,139
I'm sorry to tell you this
in this situation.

645
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:18,510
We have to talk about it now.

646
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,280
Father played with our lives so that
he can keep this company.

647
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,510
If Chairman Kim's
condition continues like this,

648
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,219
his voting right
will go to Chief Director Jung.

649
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,789
She'll get his voting right...

650
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:32,989
and open a shareholders' meeting
to dismiss Father.

651
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:36,460
That's her position
as his legal spouse.

652
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,659
We can't stop her from
holding a shareholders' meeting.

653
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,760
Do you think that's why
she didn't come here?

654
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,269
Stay by Father's side.

655
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:46,170
I'm going to the office,
and I'll be back tonight.

656
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,940
I'll call a meeting.

657
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,230
Mom.
I'll call you when Father wakes up.

658
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,429
Go wait at the hotel.

659
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,269
Don't worry about me.

660
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,070
What if he wakes up and asks for me?

661
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,210
I'm not worrying about you.
I'm worrying about the company,

662
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,010
and I'm worrying about Father.

663
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,380
I think Chief Director Jung
is up to something.

664
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,579
I don't want you
to bump into her here.

665
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,650
It could put me, Won, and Father...

666
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,550
in a bad position.

667
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:39,389
I didn't think about that.

668
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,690
- Call me.
- Mom.

669
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,960
I understand everything. It's okay.

670
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,199
Take care of your father.

671
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:05,349
I...

672
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,949
don't trust Won or Tan.

673
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,550
I question whether those two
can protect...

674
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:14,659
Jeguk Group,

675
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,260
a company my husband devoted
his entire life into building.

676
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,960
I agree with you.

677
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,500
You'd do better.

678
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,869
You don't have to act like a nice
person when making such a deal.

679
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:29,300
It's a dangerous business
with our lives on the line.

680
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:32,670
Please be honest and direct with us.

681
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,980
Then I will do just that.

682
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:42,280
Chairman Kim's position
didn't always belong to him.

683
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:46,690
He gained this position as the prize
for his victory by fighting...

684
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:50,530
tooth and nail in the war
against everyone in this room.

685
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:54,329
But there's no such thing
as an eternal victory.

686
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,760
A war...

687
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,440
can be started by the side
that is guaranteed to win.

688
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:06,170
As you are aware, I don't have any
children or family to take care of.

689
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:09,010
I believe that I can give you...

690
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:10,679
the chance...

691
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,449
you thought you lost forever
once again.

692
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,849
Does that mean...

693
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,090
- Do you want...
- Side with me.

694
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:22,889
If everything gets divided
between Won and Tan,

695
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,300
you will never get
this opportunity again.

696
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:40,539
(Yoo Kyung Ran, Managing Director)

697
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,329
- I heard there's an inspection.
- What kind of inspection?

698
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:04,530
I don't know exactly.

699
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,070
- Are we going to lose our jobs?
- Is the company in trouble?

700
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,199
- I know.
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

701
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,309
I think it's something serious.

702
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:14,210
Make sure to take all the laptops,
desktops, and files.

703
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,110
Grab that too.

704
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,619
What are you all doing?

705
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,420
- You can't do this here!
- Back up, or you'll get hurt.

706
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,849
What are you doing?

707
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:30,630
What's going on? What is it?

708
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,090
Choi Young Do. Get out.

709
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,929
Why are these people doing this?

710
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:34,929
I told you to leave!

711
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:37,800
- Get out already.
- You can't be in here.

712
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,269
What are you guys doing?
Escort him out.

713
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:41,639
Please leave.
You can't do this here.

714
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:43,570
Please leave.

715
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,170
Did your mom go somewhere?

716
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,250
I heard only his family can come in.
Is that why she's not here?

717
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,349
You're a part of Father's family,

718
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:01,949
but you're here late.

719
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,889
There are a lot of things
that need to be taken care of...

720
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:07,489
since there's no chance of him
waking up again.

721
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:12,230
He'll wake up.

722
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:15,599
I'm here.

723
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,130
You must be happy.

724
00:53:18,769 --> 00:53:21,599
You have kids who are willing
to stay by your side.

725
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:25,070
I think I did a good job
at waiting for this day.

726
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:27,739
Now that you're laying here,

727
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:31,210
I've become Tan's legal guardian.

728
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,619
That's what a family register does.

729
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:42,789
Don't try to lay a hand on
the shares Father gave me.

730
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:45,690
I'm going to change
the legal guardian of my shares...

731
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,030
to Won.

732
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,829
Okay. Do that.

733
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:53,300
I don't mind taking my anger out
on you and your mom...

734
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,570
by kicking you guys out without
a penny to your name.

735
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,809
Give and take. Remember?

736
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,280
Since you're learning anyway, you
might as well learn it the hard way.

737
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,809
Welcome to the world of ambition...

738
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,079
where people take
and get taken from...

739
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,079
and step on and get stepped on.

740
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:25,599
I thought you would be busy,
but you managed to come.

741
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:28,570
I should get going
now that I saw Chairman Kim.

742
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:32,110
I told Tan everything I wanted
to tell Chairman Kim.

743
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,849
Seeing you like this,
the two of you are quite similar.

744
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:53,130
Regardless of what she told you,
don't worry about it.

745
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,030
You're not at that age yet.

746
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:00,400
I'll stay here tonight,
so go home and sleep.

747
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:02,900
Come back tomorrow after school
and bring some of your stuff.

748
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,139
Okay.

749
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,320
Since you're learning anyway, you
might as well learn it the hard way.

750
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,750
Welcome to the world of ambition...

751
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:55,260
where people take
and get taken from...

752
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,130
and step on and get stepped on.

753
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,099
He must meet foreign shareholders
and get their power of attorney.

754
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,500
Did something happen
to their company?

755
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,800
Were you worried?
I'll make sure to overcome it.

756
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,039
I'm going to go voluntarily.

757
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:24,739
Then what will happen?

758
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:26,039
Will you be imprisoned?

759
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:27,679
Are you going to come to
the temporary shareholders' meeting?

760
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:29,480
Are you okay with marrying me?

761
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,409
Let's break up. That's my wish.

762
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:33,079
Thank you for becoming
a warm part...

763
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:35,349
of my brutal high school career.

764
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:37,619
What is it? You sound like
you're going to leave.

765
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:39,920
The shareholders' meeting to dismiss
Father has been approved.

766
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,460
Moms are always the problem,
whether you don't have one or a lot.

767
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:43,519
Help me.

768
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,929
(The Heirs)
