(The Heirs)

3
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,129
(Episode 1)

4
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,840
- All right.
- Yes.

5
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,040
- Great time.
- Yes.

6
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,609
Hey, Jay.
I'm going to take a shower.

7
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,609
Okay.

8
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,579
See you. I'm going to miss you.

9
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,049
I don't know how I'm going to
sleep tonight without you.

10
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,019
- Take care. I'll miss you.
- Yes. See you.

11
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

12
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,009
The day I left to study abroad,

13
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,180
my brother's farewell was...

14
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,819
simple, short and honest.

15
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,919
Study? You don't need to study hard.

16
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,330
English? Don't do it
if it's troublesome.

17
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,430
Just party and have fun.

18
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,060
Don't worry and don't think.

19
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,629
Sons of rich families are supposed
to party and have fun.

20
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,139
Not having a dream.

21
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,599
And if possible,

22
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,340
don't ever come back.

23
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,039
That's when I realized.

24
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,979
The reason I came to the US...

25
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,680
was an exile, not to study abroad.

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,490
Won was taking back...

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,860
what I will steal from him.

28
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,860
You want more?

29
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,000
You don't blame them?

30
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,199
Your brother who hates you,
your mother who gave birth to you,

31
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,639
or your father
who never takes your side.

32
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,050
I'm too lazy...

33
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,520
to blame someone.

34
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,379
My friend, what are you going to do
during the vacation?

35
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:05,020
I'm going to miss you
if I don't get to see you every day.

36
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,080
Right?

37
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,789
What? You won't miss me?

38
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,029
You're so cold to me.

39
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,529
My. Sorry.

40
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:22,769
Are you okay?

41
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,470
Young Do.
You're terrible at pitching.

42
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,040
Be careful.

43
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,339
People will think
you're bullying him.

44
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,980
You think so?

45
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,019
Then why don't you stand there?

46
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,149
- What?
- Stand against the wall.

47
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,029
Hey. What are you doing?

48
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:48,259
Do you want to stand instead?

49
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,930
I will. Fine. I will do it.

50
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,970
Throw it.

51
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,509
I didn't say I will throw.

52
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,879
Friends should be fair.

53
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,879
Hey, you.

54
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,649
It's your turn. Throw.

55
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,529
- Young Do.
- What?

56
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,930
You'll get hit
whether you throw or not.

57
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,769
It's a matter of getting beaten up
by someone strong or less strong.

58
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,209
But the bigger problem is...

59
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,439
this is how your life is going
to be for the rest of your life.

60
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,180
Why?

61
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:42,910
Because we'll be your employer
when we grow up.

62
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,420
Hurry up and choose.

63
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,100
You little...

64
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,670
Are you crazy?

65
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:11,040
You're poor,
but you want to keep your pride?

66
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,910
You should protect your body.

67
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,050
Pull yourself together.

68
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,079
Hey. Staying healthy is the best.

69
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,290
Gosh. I'm scared,
so I'm going to run away.

70
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,089
See you after the break.

71
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,360
Hope you have a great one.

72
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,689
Bye.

73
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:34,800
Muffler. Racing kit. Seat.

74
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,629
Handle. Head Lamp.

75
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:39,439
I tuned it up as you ordered.

76
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,839
All components are high-end,

77
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,709
so they all crossed
the Pacific Ocean.

78
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,110
You'll make that much profit.

79
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,209
You're a regular.

80
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,420
I also replaced the cam chain
and tensioner.

81
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,279
Are you showing off with my money?

82
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,750
Well... That's not what I meant.

83
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,459
- Fried chicken delivery.
- Put it in there.

84
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,189
- Someone pay her.
- Okay.

85
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:05,930
It's 16.1 dollars.

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,230
10 cents? Is that for a snack?

87
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,769
Here's the change. Give me a bill.

88
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,209
Oh, you're smart. High schooler?

89
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,310
The receipt's in the box.

90
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,439
What time are you off? Do you
want to ride the bike with me?

91
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,279
No. Pay me.

92
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,250
Come on, don't be like that.

93
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,610
I'll go pick you up.

94
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,720
Hello. I'm in Grade 11
and working part-time right now.

95
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,529
Hey. Who are you calling?

96
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,459
- The police.
- What?

97
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,800
- Yes. Some guys...
- Hey.

98
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,329
Look. I was only joking.

99
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,399
17 dollars. Count it.

100
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,670
Enjoy.

101
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,290
Here you are.

102
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,259
Hello. May I take your order?

103
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,459
- 2 lemonades.
- 2 lemonades?

104
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:09,829
- I'll make them.
- Okay.

105
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,899
When did you get here?

106
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,269
About 30 minutes ago.

107
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,370
You've been here for 30 minutes
without placing an order?

108
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,840
My boss isn't running the business
for nothing.

109
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,110
I will when Bo Na gets here.
She's almost here.

110
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,610
Seriously.

111
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,279
Is this the only cafe in Seoul?

112
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,450
Why do you keep...

113
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,389
What?

114
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,490
By the time you're off, it'll rain.

115
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,360
If you give this to me,
what about your girlfriend?

116
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,370
Bo Na is always
like a girl in movie.

117
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:25,970
My goodness.

118
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,870
So you should get a boyfriend too.

119
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,879
You sound extravagant.

120
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,710
Spending time without pay
is extravagance.

121
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,210
You have way too many jobs.

122
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,580
What can I do?

123
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,350
The only paradise I have
is the paradise of part-time jobs.

124
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,960
Yoon Chan Young,
stop looking at her.

125
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,559
You're here.

126
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,500
I told you to stop hitting
on my boyfriend.

127
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,899
Do you think I'm that pretty?

128
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,370
I never said that.

129
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,710
Right? But you're very pretty.

130
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,480
So stop wasting
a busy part-timer's time.

131
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,480
Are you going to order or leave?

132
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,779
Unbelievable. How can you
do that to your customers?

133
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,220
What a terrible customer service.

134
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,980
My. You caught me.

135
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,419
Seriously.

136
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,250
Chan Young. Let's go.
You're leaving tomorrow.

137
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,860
Let's not waste our time on her.

138
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,659
Are you going somewhere?

139
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,559
I'm just...

140
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,700
No, don't tell her. Don't tell her.

141
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,399
I want to know alone. Let's go.

142
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,370
By the way, I told you to wear
white and give a point with red.

143
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,240
It's the summer jingle bell theme.

144
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,879
These are red.

145
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,480
Those aren't red. They're dark red.

146
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,009
I can't believe you. Let's go.

147
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,750
Sorry for stealing your time.

148
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,919
There is no customer anyway.

149
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,519
- I'll text you.
- Don't you dare.

150
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,990
Goodness. How extravagant.

151
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,899
I hate Cha Eun Sang. I totally
hate her. I hate her so much.

152
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,700
- Don't be like that.
- That makes me hate her even more.

153
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,929
She always looks down on me,

154
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,500
and doesn't get overwhelmed
in front of me.

155
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,509
She knows everything about
your childhood that I don't know of.

156
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:08,769
She's so annoying.

157
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,240
That will make you age.

158
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,539
I can't help it today.

159
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:13,039
Goodness.

160
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,250
That's cheating.

161
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,480
Eun Sang and I are just friends.

162
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,179
We spent half of our lives
as friends.

163
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,679
Can't you trust me?

164
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,850
Don't be ridiculous. Boys can't be
just friends with girls!

165
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,289
Why not?

166
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:30,259
People like her appear
on "Love and War" when they grow up.

167
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,559
Is it delusional jealousy or what?
I hate it so much.

168
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,830
I hate how she wears
different clothes every day.

169
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,200
I hate how the driver opens
the backdoor for her.

170
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,700
I hate how she's so cheerful.
I hate that part the most.

171
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,039
This is my house.

172
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,340
What do you care what I do
in my house?

173
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,710
Didn't I tell you already?

174
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,950
This is why you're trash.

175
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,919
Witch. Get out of my house.

176
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,190
By the way, do you even check this?

177
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,360
I know you're busy,
but you should call me.

178
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,590
How's school?

179
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,659
Still, I envy you. You're studying
in college in the US.

180
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,100
Anyway, call me. I miss you.

181
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,269
(Sister)

182
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,580
It's really raining.

183
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,879
Why doesn't it open?

184
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,429
It's a dream catcher.

185
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,070
I thought you went to meet Bo Na.
Why didn't you have dinner with her?

186
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,539
To have it with you.

187
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,549
If you eat alone, you'll look
like a single father.

188
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,610
It's raining too.

189
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:33,279
Don't you think you made
my fancy Friday boring?

190
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:35,990
Did you get a girlfriend?

191
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,789
Don't you think you stopped me
from that?

192
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:44,700
Come on. You need to cut carrots
into smaller pieces than potatoes.

193
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
What's the reason?

194
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,370
Potatoes contain more moisture.

195
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,830
They cook faster than carrots.

196
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,039
If you stir-fry them together,
carrots must be smaller,

197
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,269
so they cook at the same time.

198
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,840
Then I can cut them into big pieces
and stir-fry separately.

199
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,710
Then it'll take longer to cook them,
but the texture will be similar.

200
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,519
So stir-frying separately
is uneconomical.

201
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,389
Say that in English.

202
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,289
Fine. I lose. How can I beat you?

203
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,720
Do I wash the dishes?

204
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,759
Do the laundry too. I spent too much
money today because of you.

205
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,759
Did you buy the ticket?

206
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes. Did you tell Bo Na
that you're going to the US?

207
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,330
Of course, I did.
She wants to come with me.

208
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,299
You want to make a family
in the US?

209
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,940
Will you chip in?

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,039
You're not a reliable investment.

211
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,179
Did you tell Eun Sang?

212
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,039
I couldn't tell her.

213
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,480
She's busy working.

214
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,409
I couldn't tell her
that I'm going to study abroad.

215
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,919
How's Eun Sang's mother doing?

216
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,820
She's in the center
of power of Jeguk Group.

217
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,860
She totally seized the madam.

218
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,490
Really?

219
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,190
Second madam wants to have dinner.

220
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,320
She's very hysterical,
so you should be careful.

221
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,090
I think her son in the US isn't
answering her calls.

222
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,039
Come on.

223
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,740
Why aren't you picking up? Why?

224
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,169
The number you have dialed...

225
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,080
What's wrong with the soup?

226
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,950
You can't talk or season it right.

227
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,649
What's your mouth for?

228
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,460
I'll make a new one.

229
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,029
That will take forever.

230
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,029
Take it.

231
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,169
CEO Kim is home.

232
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,269
Already?

233
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,669
What should I do with this?

234
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,440
He went straight to upstairs...

235
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,279
Why do you always say
the most important thing later?

236
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,919
Do you do that on purpose?
So I'd get caught?

237
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,049
Am I not allowed to have dinner...

238
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,519
with Chateau Latour?

239
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,419
Are you insane?

240
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,029
You're home. Did you have dinner?

241
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,269
I had late lunch.

242
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:40,500
That's not good for your health.
From now on...

243
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,240
Who cleaned my room today?

244
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,840
- I did.
- Do it again.

245
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,750
And get me a glass of water
to my study.

246
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,149
Get the same wine
from the basement,

247
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:57,019
and bring it to my room
with a new glass.

248
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,860
(You should eat more.)

249
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,029
You should eat more.

250
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,329
Ms. Park.

251
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,569
If I can eat despite the disregard,
that makes me a concubine.

252
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,240
Madams shouldn't be able to eat
anything in a situation like this.

253
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,839
Throw everything out.

254
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,789
Whether you eat or not,
you're still a concubine.

255
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,920
Which is better between a concubine
who eats and a concubine who drinks?

256
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,200
What?

257
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,430
The madam gave it to me.

258
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,630
Don't complain, and eat.

259
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,299
If it's from the madam,
do I have to eat without a complaint?

260
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,440
Am I a food waste basket?

261
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:48,910
Why does it matter?

262
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,180
What's more important
than eating?

263
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,609
You think
we can afford these dishes?

264
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,509
It's not my fault that we're poor.

265
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,250
Eat it by yourself.

266
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,099
Witch.

267
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,730
She lives in comfort by herself.

268
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,079
I said I'm not eating.

269
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,119
Seriously.

270
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,019
Fine. I won't bring it from now on.

271
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:46,029
What time do you go to work
tomorrow? I need to go to the bank.

272
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:50,630
How many times do I have to tell you
that you can use online banking?

273
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,970
Where and how much?

274
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,210
It's certain in person.

275
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,039
How can money go to the US
by typing in on the computer?

276
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,109
The US? Are you sending money
to Eun Seok?

277
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,779
Send everything in there.

278
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,720
All of it? Everything?

279
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,720
Why? Is something wrong?

280
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:14,930
Tell her to buy a closet.

281
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,730
She's getting married.

282
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,900
What? What's she doing?

283
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:23,400
- Remarriage.
- Remarriage?

284
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,940
It hasn't been that long
since you divorced Dad.

285
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,670
- Long enough to get married again.
- Does Dad know?

286
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,569
So he would congratulate me?

287
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,079
There will be an article.
He'll find out then.

288
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,009
Get a dress for the third reorder.

289
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,049
Size small.

290
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,450
We're going to have lunch.
Get changed.

291
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,089
Your skin looks dull.

292
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:44,450
With whom? Dad?

293
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,519
Your stepdad.

294
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,519
Mom.

295
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,359
And wear other shoes.

296
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,230
No high heels. Wear something low.

297
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,670
He's not that tall.

298
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,039
Who is it?

299
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,910
Who's not that tall but famous
enough to be in an article?

300
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:04,339
Is he rich? How old is he?

301
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:06,309
Is he Korean or American?

302
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:07,980
Did you ask what he does?

303
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,420
Answer me. When's the wedding?

304
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,890
Is she inviting us?
Will she send us tickets?

305
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,619
Of course, we're not going.

306
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,289
I told you to text me
when we're outside.

307
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,569
She goes to university in the US.
I'm sure she picked the right one.

308
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,670
If we go, it'll be bad for her.

309
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,569
Why will it be bad for her?
What's wrong with us?

310
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:39,980
She said he's nice and diligent,

311
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,609
so she doesn't want to lose him.

312
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,480
That's good enough.
What more can we ask for?

313
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,619
Why not?

314
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,549
After she ran away, I...

315
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,019
I'm going to her wedding.
I'm not sending the money.

316
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:56,829
Even if you send it in the bank,
it won't go to the US.

317
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,160
I'll give it to her myself.

318
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,869
I'm late for work. Bye.

319
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,279
Wonderful.

320
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,859
It was worth the effort
to bring the top chef.

321
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:27,519
Yes, the sales increased.

322
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:30,089
The old chef was wonderful too,

323
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:33,359
but when he got an offer,
he betrayed me right away.

324
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,970
In the end,
it turned out to be better.

325
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,799
That's how things go.

326
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:39,440
It happened for a reason.

327
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,099
Right.
If you only look at the result.

328
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,269
It was all necessary steps
for the result.

329
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,579
The past was so painful for today.

330
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,519
I think the relationship of our two
families is very similar to it.

331
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,220
You're right.

332
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,720
We all have our own wounds,

333
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,089
but I think they made us
firmer and stronger...

334
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,789
for today.

335
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,200
The relationship between
siblings is as important...

336
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,960
as the one between a couple.

337
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm glad you already know
each other.

338
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,869
Young Do's birthday is earlier
than Rachel.

339
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,170
Say hello.

340
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,339
She's your sister now.

341
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:24,920
Hi, sister.

342
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,950
Please take good care of Rachel.

343
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,849
You should take care of her
as her brother.

344
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,960
Of course.

345
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,359
But my sister is totally my type.

346
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,799
Excuse me then.

347
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,329
Sit down.

348
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:46,440
I have other plans.

349
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,089
Sit down.

350
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,519
I really can't sit down now.

351
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,190
I'm too ashamed to face my sister.

352
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,230
Enjoy the meal.

353
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,069
Between family members.

354
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,880
That was disrespectful.
I'll apologize on his behalf.

355
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,910
Please don't.
I'll hear that from him.

356
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,859
Rachel takes after you.

357
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,700
Young Do takes after your ex.

358
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,829
Don't ever say that in front of...

359
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,329
Was she that pretty?

360
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,839
This is why I like you.

361
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,769
You know that?

362
00:23:58,779 --> 00:23:59,839
I do.

363
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,720
Hey, brother.

364
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,559
I just noticed
that you ask for a smack.

365
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,089
Why did you follow me when
I threw a rare surprise for you?

366
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,099
If you're here to catch me...

367
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:21,259
I'm here to lose you.

368
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:24,470
So I don't have to go back
to that horrible table.

369
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,470
Then lose me.

370
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:32,579
You know I'm engaged to Tan.

371
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,579
If we become siblings,
Tan and you...

372
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,720
will be brothers-in-law.

373
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,049
So?

374
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,990
It's not just you
who hate this marriage.

375
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,690
But it seems you hate
this marriage...

376
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,059
more than I do.

377
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,990
I thought I should remind you
just in case.

378
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:52,759
Then I'm going to lose you.

379
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,000
I never said I hate this marriage.

380
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
What do you mean?

381
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:04,440
Don't you know what marriage means
in this world?

382
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,039
When you're engaged?

383
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,950
So what do you mean?
Say it clearly.

384
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,819
Marriage for M and A.

385
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,890
In other words,
merger and acquisition.

386
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:18,460
The Jeguk Group shares
your mother has.

387
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,160
Who will have them in the end?

388
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,160
So if you think you can
call it off, try.

389
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:29,599
Before Rachel Yoo becomes
Rachel Choi.

390
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,289
Hurry up.

391
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,000
You need to do that first.

392
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:43,539
Well done.

393
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,549
You're working hard even during
a break. Aren't you going anywhere?

394
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,779
- I am.
- Where?

395
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,950
You need to tell me
when you'll be off in advance.

396
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,049
My sister in the US is getting
married, so I'm going to the US.

397
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,319
Really? Congratulations.

398
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,759
How long are you going for?

399
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,690
- I'm not coming back.
- You're not coming back?

400
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,599
If my sister's getting married,

401
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:09,430
that means she doesn't plan
to come back to Korea.

402
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,970
If she doesn't come back,

403
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,740
that means I have to wash the dishes
for the rest of my life with Mom.

404
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,940
Was my life planned
without a gain from the beginning?

405
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,009
It's so unfair.

406
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,380
You're only 18.
Why do you think that way?

407
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,519
So I'm going to the US.

408
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,130
I've had that thought
since I was eight.

409
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,160
(Savings account)

410
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:42,970
Do you want to exchange?

411
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,670
Yes.

412
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,200
Put your bankbook and ID in here.

413
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,329
I exchanged money today.

414
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,809
Don't worry.
I'll give it to her safely.

415
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,509
Someone from her family should
attend her wedding.

416
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,960
I applied for the passport.

417
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,059
It takes three days.

418
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,900
First madam came by in the morning.

419
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,759
I'm sorry, madam.

420
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,970
What do you want for dinner, madam?

421
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,579
Please don't be angry, madam.

422
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,859
I don't know English well.

423
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,329
I'll memory it soon, madam.

424
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,569
In English, dry is...

425
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,369
Dry Cleaning Only.

426
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:46,619
What are you doing?
Are you making multigrain drink?

427
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:30,130
Sorry, Mom.

428
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,680
I'll succeed
and come back to get you.

429
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,150
Wait just for a bit.

430
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,049
Are you immigrating or what?

431
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,849
Left.

432
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:33,890
I'll stay there if I have to.

433
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,829
Do you have to go?
Can't you tell him to come?

434
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,930
Of course I can.

435
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,230
Make a wedding invitation tomorrow
and give it to me.

436
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,230
It's his future
mother-in-law's wedding.

437
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,869
He wouldn't miss
such an interesting show.

438
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,569
I know that you don't like
our remarriage,

439
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,470
but I don't plan to persuade you.

440
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,509
You just don't feel confident
to persuade me.

441
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,480
You have no ground to persuade me.

442
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,420
If you want, leave the family
and live on your own.

443
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:02,190
Are you threatening me
with inheritance?

444
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,390
It's most effective
and it always works.

445
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,519
What do you like about
Choi Young Do's dad?

446
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,960
You heard the rumors.

447
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,630
He hits people
when things don't go his way.

448
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,230
Or are you really in love?

449
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,230
Rachel Yoo.

450
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,230
Don't you feel sorry for Dad
every time you call me?

451
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,940
You're trying to make me
Rachel Choi.

452
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,970
You have a fiance
to run away to.

453
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,839
You have a pretty nice life.

454
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,710
Say hi to my future son-in-law
for me.

455
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,750
It's so annoying.

456
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:53,170
(The Heirs)

457
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:57,309
In California, after I was almost
chased away,

458
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,910
the first thought I had...

459
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,549
was that,
"I'll have a lot of almonds."

460
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:09,590
And very briefly,
I thought maybe I should rebel...

461
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,760
as an illegitimate child in exile,

462
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,300
but I decided to party and have fun
like my brother said.

463
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,860
As a result,

464
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,070
I have a policeman watching me,

465
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,039
and I always receive
attention at school.

466
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,409
And I got a skill...

467
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,179
to make Mom in Seoul cry every day.

468
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,079
Somebody's calling.
It was in the living room.

469
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,079
Thanks.

470
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,619
(Rachel)

471
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,519
You're not going to answer?
It's been ringing for a while.

472
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,889
No. I already know who's calling.

473
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,789
It's my fiancee. She's either
about to get on the plane...

474
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,599
or could be on the plane
or already here.

475
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,469
It's our engagement
anniversary soon.

476
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,269
You look like
none of that's a good thing.

477
00:34:58,269 --> 00:34:59,340
No.

478
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,039
I always look this good.

479
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,039
Okay.

480
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,340
What are you doing?
Pack up your stuff.

481
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,139
You said it was your anniversary.

482
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,610
- I'm too lazy to celebrate.
- I'm too lazy to celebrate.

483
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,780
Don't be intimidated. My grades were
14th best in the whole school.

484
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,949
Can I get a city map?

485
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,820
Where is the subway station?

486
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,960
Would you like beef or...

487
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,929
Oh, not this.

488
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:53,980
Yes, it's me. I just arrived.

489
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,860
Of course, Tan is here.
You thought I'd be alone.

490
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,630
I'm putting my stuff in the car.

491
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,559
He looks more wonderful than before.

492
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,530
He got taller, and he got tanned.

493
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,869
You know the sun in California.

494
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,019
Tan said I've become prettier.
What a cliche.

495
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,360
I'll call you again when I arrive
at the hotel. Bye.

496
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:37,760
Excuse me.

497
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,170
Did you just laugh at me?

498
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:50,809
Why?

499
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:58,650
What is it? I'm Japanese.

500
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,880
If you wanted to act like Japanese,

501
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,889
you shouldn't have turned around
when I said "excuse me".

502
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,289
Don't you think?

503
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:08,460
I'm sorry.

504
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:10,789
Hey.

505
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:18,469
Why did you sneer at me?

506
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,969
I didn't.

507
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,170
I only looked at you because...

508
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,409
what you said on the phone was
different from what you were doing.

509
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,409
You think I want a debate here?

510
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,639
Let me tell you again.
I wasn't sneering.

511
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:32,349
I was kind of relating to you.

512
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,849
I'm not the only one
not welcomed in here.

513
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,489
That's what I thought.

514
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,530
- What?
- Sorry I pretended to be Japanese.

515
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Bye.

516
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,329
Is there any problem, Miss?

517
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,099
No.

518
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,340
Just open the door.

519
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,030
- Hey.
- Hey.

520
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,570
Party and Tammy!

521
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,369
You know who's going to be there.

522
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:07,980
I guess I am really abroad.

523
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,349
Is it the food?

524
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,059
Tan. That was amazing.

525
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,659
- You're such a great surfer.
- Thanks.

526
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:27,929
Good job. I was watching you.

527
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,199
There are a lot of lucky people.

528
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,170
Let's go.

529
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,949
Tan. There's going to be a crazy
party at Jessie's tonight.

530
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,849
I heard Tammy's coming too.

531
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,690
Hey. When are you going to stop
partying like crazy, man?

532
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,329
Not till you and I fall in love.

533
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:01,260
You know my family. They're never
going to say yes to you.

534
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,099
And you're going to be
in big trouble...

535
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:06,000
if you let Tammy's boyfriend...

536
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:07,670
come over like the last time.

537
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,440
I won't. Look, never again.
So you are coming then?

538
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,880
Sorry.
I'm going to do some thinking.

539
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,309
Later.

540
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,050
Is it here?

541
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,269
Who is it?

542
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,300
Eun Seok?

543
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,500
Eun Seok. It's me, Eun Sang.

544
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Who?

545
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,349
Isn't this Cha Eun Seok's house?

546
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,750
What's that in English?

547
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,550
What are you even talking about?

548
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,820
Chris.

549
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,630
Who on earth is it?

550
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Eun Sang?

551
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:30,519
Just calm down.

552
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,489
How many girls are you seeing
right now?

553
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:33,590
They're coming to the house?

554
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,190
I can't stop them
from coming to the house.

555
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,760
Who is she?
What, are you meeting kids now?

556
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,900
Really? That's Stella's kid sister.

557
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,960
Whatever.

558
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,670
Hey, you. Are you Stella's husband?

559
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:50,909
Husband?

560
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:53,079
We just live together.

561
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:54,239
Live together...

562
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,710
Live together? I thought
you were getting married.

563
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,780
When are you getting married
with Stella?

564
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,820
Married?

565
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,090
Why would I marry Stella?

566
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,030
Where is Stella's university?

567
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,699
University?
She doesn't go to school.

568
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,829
She was lying about school too?

569
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,699
- What?
- So...

570
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,070
Where is that crazy witch right now?

571
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:34,519
What are you writing all the time?

572
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,320
School assignment. It's an essay.

573
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,989
You don't look like
you do your homework.

574
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:41,420
I do it because I look like I don't.

575
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,030
It's a kind of rebellion.

576
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,789
Rebellion against whom?
Your teacher?

577
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,460
Thanks for the coffee.

578
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,500
Tell me if you need more.

579
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:10,150
When I'm writing an essay,

580
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,460
it makes me feel like I'm thinking.

581
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:16,630
The thoughts which my brother...

582
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:19,059
said I shouldn't have.

583
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:29,510
In the current first half of 2013,

584
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,969
the sales of the premium
shopping mall

585
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,780
targeted at the top 10 percent...

586
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:35,610
is lower than expected.

587
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,010
I see that. So?

588
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,650
The residential area near...

589
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,480
the shopping center is
still selling in lots.

590
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,619
To increase the sales, we'd need
a continuous promotion.

591
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,090
Then what we've been doing...

592
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,559
wasn't a continuous promotion,
but intermittent?

593
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,590
So you're saying
we should spend more?

594
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,670
It's not easy to directly contact
the top 10 percent...

595
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
of the customers we want.

596
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,539
The consumption pattern is...

597
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:04,269
Therefore, it's not easy
for this company...

598
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,110
to make money?

599
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,110
We should change the target
from the top 10 percent...

600
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,880
to families before it's too late.

601
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,550
If we target families,
it should've been

602
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,150
an amusement park
from the beginning...

603
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,650
instead of a premium shopping mall.

604
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,090
When did you get the sales report
for the first half?

605
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,190
I got the final report a week ago.

606
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,530
Then I should've fired you
a week ago.

607
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,400
Anyone else got the report
before that?

608
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,000
There's also the chairman.

609
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,539
So...

610
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:44,480
the chairman at home knew
how incompetent I am a week ago.

611
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,219
But I get it now
when I've come to work every day?

612
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,989
Please don't let anyone think
that I'm incompetent.

613
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,690
Can't you at least keep it in
the company, Mr. Yoon?

614
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,829
If I reported it,

615
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,199
the chairman would be
sitting here right now.

616
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,639
It seems he's sitting here now.

617
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:12,110
How many of you are being
his ears and eyes in this room?

618
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,909
"If you want to continue farming,"

619
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,980
"be nicer to the farm supervisor
than the landowner."

620
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,320
That was the chairman's advice.

621
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,289
Senior managing director,
junior managing director,

622
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:29,119
managing director, director,
general manager, assistant manager,

623
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,289
team manager, manager.

624
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,429
Who do you think is the supervisor,
Mr. Yoon?

625
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,630
What do you think as a landowner?

626
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:12,400
Hey, Stella. How's it going?

627
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,539
Always looking good.

628
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:18,210
Thanks.

629
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,050
Yes.

630
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,250
Yes? What are you doing tonight?

631
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,389
How about you come work
for me tonight?

632
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:32,820
- Work?
- Work.

633
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,960
Of course. You definitely
look your best when you're working.

634
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:41,030
How about you come work
for me tonight?

635
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,659
In your dreams.

636
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:47,940
You're going to make me beg,
aren't you?

637
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:00,880
You want more coffee?

638
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,880
Cha Eun Sang.

639
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,590
What happened? Why are you here?

640
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,500
What about Mom? Where is she?

641
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,170
"What about Mom?" Seriously?

642
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:53,139
How can you talk about Mom?

643
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,409
When did you get here?

644
00:48:57,239 --> 00:48:58,309
You should've called me.

645
00:48:58,309 --> 00:48:59,440
If I did,

646
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,280
would you have showed me
something else?

647
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,739
Is this a university?

648
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,510
Who told you that I work here?

649
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,849
Who else? Your wonderful boyfriend.

650
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,219
- Did you go to my house?
- Yes, I did.

651
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,619
Have you been paying for that jerk's
drink in the US?

652
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,460
How much is a lie
and how much is the truth?

653
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:18,159
Wedding? The right one?

654
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,190
University?

655
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,800
You should've met a nice guy,
not a guy you like. You crazy witch.

656
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:36,010
What about money? Did you bring it?

657
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,820
You really reached rock bottom,
didn't you?

658
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,949
I'm getting punished for
trying to abandon Mom...

659
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:46,019
and live off you.

660
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,519
Where is it?

661
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,889
Stop it.

662
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,500
I said stop!

663
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,170
What a pathetic life.

664
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,010
You were my dream.

665
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,110
You were my last hope.

666
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:11,010
Since the fate of my life is set
from the start,

667
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,619
I was going to go to college
regardless of my dream...

668
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,679
and get an office job
that pays 2,000 dollars...

669
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,190
to make peace
with this darned world.

670
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,090
Why?

671
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:22,489
Because I had to make a living
with Mom until you come back.

672
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,500
Sorry. Just this once.

673
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,329
Let it go this once.

674
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,139
- Don't touch it.
- Go back to Korea.

675
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:39,440
I'll call Mom.

676
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:42,139
Don't. Don't do this.

677
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,110
Mom went through so much
to make this money.

678
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:45,880
Leave.

679
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,579
Eun Seok. Eun Seok!

680
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:52,519
Eun Seok, don't go.

681
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,320
Eun Seok.

682
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,760
Eun Seok.

683
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:58,690
Eun Seok...

684
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,030
Seriously.

685
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:11,869
Eun Seok...

686
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,710
Wait for me.

687
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,019
Eun Seok.

688
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,889
Eun Seok.

689
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:34,900
No, Eun Seok...

690
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,800
This party's going to be amazing.

691
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,769
Let's go. Jessie said you should.

692
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,070
What?

693
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,269
Oh, jeez. Who is that girl?

694
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:45,969
Talk about a fallen angel?

695
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,510
You are always one step
ahead of me.

696
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,079
I'll take care of the rest. You...

697
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,079
You don't think she has a gun,
right?

698
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,119
That idiot.

699
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,889
Are you all right?

700
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,829
I'm okay. Thank you.

701
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:11,300
I've decided I believe in God
because I've met you.

702
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,469
Thank God.

703
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,500
- What?
- Thank you.

704
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,070
What? Did I just meet a thief?
Now, of all times?

705
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:22,010
Hey, stop right there. Stop.

706
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,010
Hey.

707
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:27,880
Hey, Jay.

708
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:32,820
That's not a drug.

709
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,230
Hey. Hey!

710
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,400
Give it back, you thief.

711
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,329
You know how much effort
my mom put into this?

712
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:48,039
Give it back. It's for my sister.

713
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,400
Give it back to me!

714
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,920
Hey. Jay. Jay?

715
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,389
Wake up. Wake up. Jay.

716
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,900
You loony.

717
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:18,929
You have a cellphone? Call 911.

718
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:21,039
I don't have a cellphone.

719
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Are you Korean?

720
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,139
Does that matter right now?

721
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:27,239
Jay. Jay!

722
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:28,809
Jay.

723
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,780
The patient is in shock caused
by an allergy.

724
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,849
I guess it was a reaction
to the powder.

725
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,219
Oh, yes. Beans.

726
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,889
Yes, it's beans.
It was the multigrain drink.

727
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:39,960
I know.

728
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,889
When is he going to wake up?

729
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,289
Well, we gave him the medicine,
so let's see.

730
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,460
He'll be okay.

731
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,500
Please follow me.
You have to fill out some papers.

732
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:50,730
Yes.

733
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:53,739
Is your friend okay?

734
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,769
Why do you bring that with you?

735
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,469
Are you getting mad at me now?

736
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,510
It was your friend who stole it.
And he was even high...

737
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:03,909
He was only drunk.

738
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,579
If he really did drugs,
he would've known it was not a drug.

739
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:10,989
So you're saying this is my fault?

740
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,219
I'm the one taken aback.

741
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:14,659
I'm the one in trouble.

742
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,400
Is this yours?

743
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,510
This is multigrain drink.

744
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:38,579
So... Oh, bean powder. You know?

745
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:39,980
Just food.

746
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:43,050
My point is, it's not a drug.

747
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,789
We need to look into that.

748
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:48,489
People don't normally eat food
through their nose, do they?

749
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,889
What's your address?

750
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,590
- What?
- Your address.

751
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,960
Oh, address.

752
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:57,329
I'm from Korea. I'm Korean.

753
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,500
Korea? Let me see your passport.

754
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,440
You look young. Are you underage?

755
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,710
- Pardon?
- Passport.

756
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,210
Oh, passport.

757
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,449
Where are you staying in the US?

758
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:16,349
You're not here illegally, are you?

759
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:20,260
What's he saying? I'm going crazy.

760
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,190
Slower, please.

761
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:28,300
It's okay, baby.
She's my girlfriend.

762
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,829
Just here for a bit.

763
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:32,929
Hey, Tan. Long time no see.

764
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,269
Of course, you're involved.

765
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,739
Whatever. That's not a drug anyway.
You know that.

766
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:45,250
Even if I thought that it wasn't,
now that you're involved,

767
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:48,219
I can't think that way anymore.
Don't you think?

768
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:53,090
What's he saying? Is it bad?

769
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,789
Look. Until we get the results,

770
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:57,889
I'm keeping
your girlfriend's passport.

771
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,730
You better not run away.

772
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:04,869
Hey...

773
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:06,329
What's going on?

774
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:08,769
Why is he taking my passport?
When will he give it back?

775
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:10,639
- When it's time.
- When is that?

776
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:12,010
When time is right.

777
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:13,940
When is it right?

778
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,539
Why did he take my passport?

779
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:20,949
By the way, why are you talking
casually?

780
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:26,050
Well, isn't that how you talk
in the US?

781
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,420
That's if you speak in English.

782
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,420
Then imagine I'm speaking English.

783
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:33,960
By the way, I saw the age
in your friend's chart.

784
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,260
He's my age.

785
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,929
Then you're my age too.

786
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,869
Are you going to stay here?

787
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:44,769
Where are you staying?

788
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,340
I need to know that to tell you
when the police call me.

789
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,440
You said you don't have a phone.

790
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,449
Speaking of which,

791
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:53,619
can I borrow your phone
for a minute?

792
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:54,849
I'll pay for the call.

793
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:58,050
My sister lives nearby.

794
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,489
You think she'd answer your call...

795
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:01,289
after that fight?

796
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,260
- Did you see it?
- You're not calling her...

797
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,329
to let you sleep at her house,
are you?

798
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:11,900
That's none of your business.

799
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:16,269
Once again, it's not all my fault,

800
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:18,610
so give me a ride when you go home.

801
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,239
I'll pay for the ride.

802
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,650
You keep trying to solve
everything with money.

803
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,349
Are you rich?

804
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,389
I was just afraid you'd just leave.

805
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:33,559
Please.

806
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,579
8am. 12pm. 3pm.

807
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,449
I'll call you three times a day.

808
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,179
If you've gotten my passport,
answer it, if not, don't.

809
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,820
Please.

810
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,320
I can't believe you.

811
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,090
Thanks for the ride.

812
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,880
Eun Seok.

813
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:02,110
Are you sure someone's home?

814
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:09,119
She'll be home.

815
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,619
You're going to wait
until she comes?

816
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:12,250
She might be nearby.

817
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,789
Haven't you heard of
the streets in the US at night?

818
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:16,559
- You're scaring me.
- You think...

819
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,429
the woman who ran away
with money would be home?

820
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,059
She'll come home.

821
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:27,070
Fine then. Wait for her as you wish.

822
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,170
- Hey.
- What's up?

823
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,909
Come party with me.

824
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:10,280
Hey. I didn't know Asians live
around here.

825
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,780
You got one living right next
door to you, stupid.

826
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,679
You don't think she's cute?

827
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:17,619
Just know what we'd do with that
face looking like that.

828
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:19,849
Get out of here, man. Come on.

829
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:21,159
Get out of here.

830
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,789
Party time!

831
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,590
I love you.

832
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:24,050
You want to go to my house?

833
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:05,659
Are you a drug dealer or something?

834
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:07,099
Do you still have two kidneys?

835
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,530
I have no mother in this house.

836
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,670
The woman. The woman who raised you.

837
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:11,869
Then goodbye.

838
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:13,530
Where are you going?
You can just stay here.

839
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,099
Just break up with him
and date Myung Soo.

840
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,170
Are you crazy? Insane? I'm not high.

841
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,539
Why would you reject three times?

842
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:20,980
Hey. I wouldn't reject you.

843
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,010
I should know.
They'll be my in-laws after all.

844
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,510
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What?

845
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:26,309
As long as I'm alive,
you're just my husband's...

846
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:27,650
girlfriend until the moment you die.

847
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:28,650
Who are you?

848
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,920
I'm the fiancee of the owner
of this place.

849
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,420
I slept here last night
for some reason.

850
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,550
You slept here?

851
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,559
Are you crying?

852
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,559
There's never a turnaround
in my life.

853
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:37,989
Stop paying attention to me,
will you?

854
01:02:37,989 --> 01:02:40,260
I can't help it
because you're pretty.

855
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,900
- This is for the stay.
- What's this?

856
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:42,900
A dream catcher.

857
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,800
Only good dreams will come
through that hole.

858
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,130
What about a pretty woman?

859
01:03:24,269 --> 01:03:29,739
