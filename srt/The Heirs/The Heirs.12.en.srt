4
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:42,649
Cha Eun Sang.

5
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,619
I can't do this anymore.

6
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,390
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,920
I know this is tough for you.

8
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:52,859
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,159
I can't promise it will be better.

10
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,069
Still, I want you to hold my hand...

11
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,370
and come with me.

12
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,040
Don't hold his hand.

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,620
Don't go.

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,870
We came far enough already.

15
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,500
- Let's stop here.
- I said don't do that!

16
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,760
See you around. I'll go first.

17
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,580
You still make people leave.

18
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,050
Move aside.

19
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,889
Hey, people might think I kidnapped
you if they see you.

20
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,560
What about Tan?

21
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,629
Is he gone?

22
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,500
Are you two over with each other?
Why?

23
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,639
Hey, I feel like throwing
a party now. Why are you crying?

24
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,080
Your first period is PE, right?

25
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,610
Want to ditch the class and throw
a party on a good day like today?

26
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,949
I don't think someone who is
ranked 98 at school should say that.

27
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,400
You wouldn't let me hold you,
would you?

28
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,029
How was class?

29
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,930
It wasn't good
because you weren't there.

30
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,629
You're lying.

31
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,540
Just a second. Cha Eun Sang!

32
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,079
I was surprised you disappeared.
You left without having breakfast.

33
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,949
Thank you for yesterday.

34
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,620
You called me last night.
What was it about?

35
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,850
Why didn't you pick it up?

36
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,819
- I'm not your secretary.
- I needed you that much.

37
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,459
Did you let Cha Eun Sang sleep
at your place last night?

38
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,759
What are you talking about?
Did she sleep outside?

39
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,800
Forget it if you don't know.

40
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,569
Anyway, so you didn't.

41
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,810
Right. When are you going to give me
Chan Young's pictures?

42
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,069
I'll give them to you soon.

43
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,610
Did you go to Young Do's hotel?

44
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,339
That hotel belonged
to Choi Young Do's family?

45
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,629
Did she cry a lot?

46
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,899
In the morning.

47
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:01,829
Cha Eun Sang.

48
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,870
You're so straightforward.

49
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,170
Just in case you might think
you have a chance.

50
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,709
You'd better quit that thought.

51
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:13,980
Because it's not your chance.

52
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,449
This is my chance.

53
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,930
(Cha Eun Sang, Search)

54
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,129
Why are there so many?

55
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,839
What did you do to the picture?

56
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,410
Am I this chubby?

57
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,639
Cameras don't lie.

58
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,209
That's why I'm telling you to give
me a picture that isn't lying!

59
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,180
Hey, you should actually
gain more weight.

60
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,379
Try to gain 5kg.

61
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,850
Do you think I'll look chubby
even if I gain 5kg?

62
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,259
You already know it then.
Why are you whining?

63
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,689
The answer is set.
You just need to say it!

64
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,189
Is it that hard to say
"You're slim, Bo Na"?

65
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,470
- What?
- Why?

66
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,939
This is crazy.

67
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:29,649
- Hey, Choi Young Do.
- Do you really like Cha Eun Sang?

68
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,920
- Says who?
- Everyone at school knows...

69
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,660
that Kim Tan and Cha Eun Sang
have feelings for each other.

70
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,860
And you played the biggest part
in making that happen.

71
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,800
Hey, the world is big and half
of all the people are women.

72
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,540
Why are you looking for
your first love at school?

73
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,500
My gosh. Is she your first love?

74
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,379
So this is how I look...

75
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,250
at Cha Eun Sang.

76
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
I'm leaving first.

77
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,220
Where are you going?
First loves fail.

78
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:03,449
That's the law!

79
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,019
Right. Look at Tan and me.

80
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,189
Hey, it wasn't even a first love.
It was a one-sided love.

81
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,389
Objectively speaking, you were
just chasing him around.

82
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,829
Chasing or being chased,

83
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:15,670
who are you to objectify
my first love?

84
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,000
Did you see Eun Sang at school?

85
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,139
You haven't talked to her
in private, have you?

86
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,009
Did you promise to meet secretly?

87
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,810
I'm right here.

88
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,750
I know. And that's why I'm anxious.

89
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,620
From what I saw yesterday, you
didn't look like you'd come today.

90
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,259
- Can I do that?
- You still didn't get it together.

91
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,460
If your father finds out,
he'll send you off to the US again!

92
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Mom.

93
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,100
Are you happy to be in this house?

94
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,370
- What?
- What about you?

95
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:52,139
Are you okay with the fact
that I can't tell the world...

96
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,370
that you're my mom?

97
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,240
Of course, I'm not.

98
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,710
When I brought you to this house
and took over the master bedroom,

99
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,110
I thought I'd be listed
on the family register,

100
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,350
living happily with your father.

101
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,149
I never thought
things would end up like this.

102
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,919
And you still want me to be
with Rachel?

103
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,460
If I marry Rachel,

104
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,490
I probably can never introduce you
as my mom for the rest of my life.

105
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,659
Are you okay with that?

106
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,000
It is sad.

107
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,059
But for me,

108
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,100
your success
compensates for everything.

109
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,340
I'm only waiting
for that day to come.

110
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:28,870
Don't make that face.

111
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,279
You have two mothers.
Stop acting like you have none.

112
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,450
Mom number one,
take off those socks. They're mine.

113
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:40,549
These?

Hello, I'm calling about the house
on the leaflet.

118
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,309
Call that number during the daytime,

119
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,509
and call the cell phone number
during the night.

120
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,350
Okay. Thank you for showing
around the house.

121
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,149
I'll call you
after talking about it with my mom.

122
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:11,220
No problem.

123

Mom, meet me at five.

124

Please bring my clothes too.

125
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,139
You just called out a senior before
his CSAT, but you're not even sorry,

126
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,980
let alone giving me a glance.

127
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,509
Do you want to die?

- Hyo Shin.
- Why?

129
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,149
I'm not actually
the Chief Director's son.

130
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,490
I have another mom.

131
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,789
- Is it a new joke?
- No, it's true.

132
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:54,889
- What is true?
- The thing I just said.

133
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,029
I've been fooling you
all this while.

134
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,029
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,470
Let's say it's true.

136
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,500
You completely fooled me,
so why are you telling me now?

137
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,700
I was testing myself to see
if I get nervous or not.

138
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,840
But I am nervous.

139
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,409
- A test?
- I'm already scared...

140
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,679
sharing it to you.

141
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:18,580
Is it really true?

142
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,919
I told you it is.

143
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,250
I'll go run for one more round.

144
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,769
I heard you have something to say.

145
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,809
I'm thinking about
what kind of a conversation...

146
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,710
we could have.

147
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,980
"Did you check the list of
stockholders with borrowed names?"

148
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,480
This was the original question
I wanted to ask.

149
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:55,720
But I'm not certain to ask.

150
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Because I don't know
whose side you are on.

151
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,220
Perhaps...

152
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,659
- Did you poison this?
- I wish I could do it.

153
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,659
Take a seat.

154
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,899

156

for managing the stocks owned
under borrowed names?

157

If it were other companies,

158
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,980
I could be the president
of an affiliate.

159
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,580
Do you think I'm asking you
because I don't know that?

160
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,990
I think this is all I can help...

161
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,220

Jeguk Group To be Teacher")

163
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,169
Did you meet Hyun Joo
because of this?

164
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,409
It's a part of running a foundation.

165
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:52,580
Are you out of your mind?

166
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,379
How can you let this happen?
You should've told me!

167
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,720
Did you think it was okay
to reveal her life struggles...

168
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,519
to the world
if it's part of a business?

169
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,690
I believe that's how the Chairman
perceives the matter.

170
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,559
It was his special order.

171
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,500
Father is at home, right?

172
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,659
We were talking about you. Come in.

173
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,909
What are you doing?
Why are you here?

174
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,940
I called her. There was something
I wanted to ask.

175
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,409
You should've called me first.

176
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,080
You could've heard it from me.

177
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,519
But you two would've
answered differently.

178
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:09,950
Don't you think so?

179
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:16,389
Father.

180
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,360
Please don't do this.

181
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,169
You're the pride
of my charity foundation.

182
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,399
You've grown up well
even in a difficult environment.

183
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,799
I'm so proud of you.

184
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,639
You ordered that
because you were proud of her?

185
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,509
Today, every employee will know it
from the company newsletter,

186
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,009
tomorrow, the whole nation will know
it through a PR news article.

187
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,450
What people would remember...

188
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,080
is not a person of talent,
but a teenage breadwinner.

189
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:43,549
How can she survive at Jeguk High
School if you reveal everything?

190
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,720
What did you do?

191
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,659
Why didn't you tell me
and made me a fool?

192
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,929
Why do you keep making me
an incompetent person?

193
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,070
That's exactly why I decided
to become a bad guy.

194
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,570
I couldn't stand seeing you
being an incompetent person.

195
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,639
You can't even control your feelings
for a woman.

196
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,909
How much longer would you let
yourself be dragged around by it?

197
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,750
- Please don't do this.
- Don't bet your life...

198
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,110
over one eye-contact
or over a pounding heart.

199
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,820
It's the same for you, Hyun Joo.

200
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,519
You're so shameless.

201
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:19,259
After all the support and help
I gave to you,

202
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,860
how dare you date my son?

203
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,929
Father!

204
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,700
You must feel like dying
if you don't see him for now.

205
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,500
You will miss him
and it will be heart-aching, but...

206
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,799
I said stop!

207
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,870
Why are you confessing my love
for me?

208
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,710
I didn't even get to do that yet.

209
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,879
I'll keep your words in mind,
Chairman.

210
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,950
Please excuse me.

211
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,909
I've never disobeyed you.

212
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,940
I tried my best to climb faster
and higher than anyone.

213
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,080
- That's why I could come this far.
- It's...

214
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,279
not what you earned.
I let you take it.

215
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,250
Do you think you would've taken
the position if I were healthy?

216
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,360
The sole reason you're there
is because you're my son.

217
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,190
But how can you tell me
to not act up over such matter?

218
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,299
Where is that groundless thought
coming from?

219
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,730
You should end things with her soon.

220
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,269
You need to get married now too.

221
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,940
Right. I do think
I should end things soon.

222
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,159
Are you okay?

223
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,759
You're Tan.

224
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,430
Do you know me?

225
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,839
We'll meet again soon.

226
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,470
Did you walk here?

227
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,339
The main road is far from here.
Do you want me to call a taxi?

228
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,079
Just be there for your brother.

229
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,180
Please.

230
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,400
The woman who just came out...

231
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,539
went this way.

232
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,109
She told me to be there for you.

233
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:54,039
I wasn't going to follow her.

234
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,789
Won, you don't look well.

235
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,549
What's the matter?

236
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,119
You keep crossing the line.

237
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,359
I can't take you seriously
when you're clearly upset.

238
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,230
Why? What's the matter?

239
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,059
I think Father has placed someone
on our tail.

240
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,529
You should be careful too. Don't do
anything you can get blamed for.

241
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,710
He's not coming.

242
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,049
He just left.

243
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,519
I wasn't waiting for him.

244
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,119
By the way, who are you?

245
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,619
Are you his girlfriend?

246
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,420
How did you recognize me earlier?

247
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,789
Did he...

248
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,529
tell you about me?

249
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,200
Yes.

250
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,470
He said his younger brother
was kind,

251
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,869
honest,

252
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,579
very tall,

253
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,410
and had the same eyes as his.

254
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,619
I can tell he was right.

255
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,130
I'm going now.

256
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,140
I'll work until the end
of this month.

257
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,910
I think you should hire
a new person.

258
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,180
Okay, then.

259
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,220
Are you going out now?

260
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,890
How can you leave
right after you said it?

261
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,059
This isn't right!

262
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,230
That paper bag is ours too.

263
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,869
Are you not leaving the house
for good?

264
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,569
Never mind, then.

265
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,539
You may go.

266
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,619
- Where are you?
- I'm busy now.

267
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,230
- I'm so thankful.
- For what?

268
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,930
For picking up my phone
when you're busy.

269
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,900
I get anxious if I don't.

270
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:37,130
I'm afraid I'll miss an opportunity
to negotiate a deal and get fooled.

271
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,069
- Why did you call me?
- I'm near your neighborhood.

272
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,569
Do you want to go eat
janchi guksu with...

273
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,509
Her phone manners are so bad.

274
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,960
(Choi Young Do)

275
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,259
- If you don't like janchi guksu...
- I like it.

276
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,160
I like janchi guksu very much.

277
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,170
I'm at the intersection. Come here.

278
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,420
I told Ms. Han that we were leaving.

279
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,119
I did some house hunting too.

280
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,359
The cheapest one costs 350 dollars
with a 10,000 dollars deposit.

281
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,559
It has one bedroom.

282
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,329
I'll text you after looking
for some more.

283
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,430
Where are you sleeping?

284
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,769
At my school friend's house.

285
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,069
She's pretty both in and out.

286
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,210
I'm so thankful.

287
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:52,140
I should've made some side dishes
for her.

288
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,809
Later. I should go now. I'm running
late for my part-time work.

289
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,250
I'll text you later, Mom.

290
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,029
You wanted to meet
at the intersection.

291
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,359
Why are you coming
from the convenience store?

292
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,529
I was right in front of it.

293
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,900
Really? I didn't know.

294
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,809
It can happen. It's not like
you're a GPS.

295
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,789
But I have somewhere to stop by.
Wait here for a moment.

296
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,490
10 minutes? 15 minutes?

297
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,690
- I'm not waiting for you.
- Please wait.

298
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,990
Please wait for me!

299
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,019
Hello, Mother.

300
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,359
Is Eun Sang at home?

301
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,529
You're her mother, right?

302
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,609
I was supposed to meet her,
but I can't reach her.

303
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,609
What time is she coming back?

304
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,789
(Eun Sang...)

305
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,359
Eun Sang went to her part-time job.

306
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,160
Why are you coming from that way?

307
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,099
So many people I want to see
are living in this neighborhood.

308
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,930
- Maybe I should just move in.
- Don't joke around with me.

309
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,000
I asked why you were
coming from that way.

310
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,069
Why do you care?

311
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:34,099
I don't care where you're
coming from,

312
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,539
but if it's my house, I'm not
confident about letting you go.

313
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:40,640
You're very upset that Eun Sang
didn't hold your hand, aren't you?

314
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,680
Do you want to see me
fly off the handle?

315
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,250
I'd love to see that,

316
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,650
but I have a heart-fluttering date,
so I don't have time for you.

317
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,690
I'm leaving first.

318
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,339
We'll be playing golf tomorrow.

319
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,039
With Mr. Choi Dong Wook
and Young Do. Be prepared.

320
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,109
A friend came over just now.

321
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,079
On a motorcycle. It was a boy.

322
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,519
How can you let him
come to this house?

323
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,779
Call him.

324
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:07,259
Number six, a daughter
of a housekeeper.

325
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:09,769
Note.

326
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,269
Speech-impaired.

327
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,180
- Why did you come back?
- The same reason why you waited.

328
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,450
I don't think so.
Waiting is just my old habit.

329
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,890
You found out about everything.
You met my mom.

330
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,920
You could've waited a bit longer.
I'm leaving soon.

331
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,730
You already found out.

332
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,660
I should just get rid
of all these darn cell phones.

333
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,200
If you want to tell other kids,
do it.

334
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,700
If you want to bully me, do it.

335
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:47,740
But don't ever visit me and my mom
at that place until we leave.

336
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,410
It's also my mom's workplace.

337
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:52,579
Who said anything?

338
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,809
If you're done with your speech,
let's go eat.

339
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:57,779
Don't beat around the bush. Just
tell me so that I can be prepared.

340
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,250
- What are you going to do about me?
- What can I do about it?

341
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,019
I don't even know how to deal
with my own wounds.

342
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,390
What am I supposed to do
with yours?

343
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,890
I was just lonely because you left.

344
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,529
And I'm happy because you're back.

345
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,099
And your secret is heavy.

346
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,599
That's all.

347
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:20,869
Did I say I would do
something about it?

348
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,670
I saw you doing many things.

349
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,910
You did it to me as well.

350
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,009
That's why I can't do anything
to you now!

351
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:30,980
All I can do is to call you
for janchi guksu.

352
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:36,220
I can't hang out with you now.

353
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,690
Let's eat another time.

354
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,880
Sometime this year, I'll have
an opportunity to work with Jeguk.

355
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,549
So don't keep Tan as your enemy.
Make him work for you.

356
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,589
Are there any rules
for today's game?

357
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:12,460
I'm going to lose to Mr. Kim today.

358
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:14,619
But you should win against Tan.

359
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,160
That's the rule.

360
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,869
There's no other option for us
other than Hotel Zeus.

361
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,599
But they don't know.

362
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,869
So don't be considerate for them.

363
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,539
You shouldn't let them win easily...

364
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,509
so they can think they're doing
proper business with Jeguk Group.

365
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,740
Mr. Kim.

366
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,140
You should talk
with your brother too.

367
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,480
It shows that you're not
blood-related.

368
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:08,140
Don't talk to me.

369
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,680
My brother is about to hit the ball.

370
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:13,450
What a wonderful world
we're living in.

371
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,750
A son of a mistress can call them
Father and Brother.

372
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,019
Don't mess with me.

373
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,230
I have a golf club in my hand.

374
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,900
And do you think I'm empty-handed?

375
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,700
Will it be okay
when your father is here?

376
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,869
You can only see the golf club
in my hand, right?

377
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,250
I wonder which one
will shock the crowd more.

378
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,809
Kim Tan being illegitimate,

379
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:48,849
or Cha Eun Sang being your
family's housekeeper's daughter?

380
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,890
I guess an illegitimate son,
Kim Tan dating...

381
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,059
a daughter of a housekeeper
would be most shocking.

382
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,799
You figured it out.

383
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,640
- Do we look good together?
- Your voice is shaking now.

384
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:08,769
I can see you tried.

385
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:11,940
But don't ever think
about threatening her with that.

386
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:14,809
You're not that trashy.

387
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,450
You're almost there though.

388
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,380
Why would I threaten her?

389
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,319
I'm threatening you right now.

390
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,690
So...

391
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,890
don't try to protect Cha Eun Sang
recklessly.

392
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,130
If you try, I have no other choice
but to reveal her identity.

393
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,099
If you give up on protecting her,

394
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,470
I will protect everyone.

395
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,450
Listen carefully
to what I'm going to say now.

396
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,920
To win against you in this fight,

397
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,589
I should be the bad guy I was
in the past again.

398
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,759
But I don't want to do that.

399
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,319
Because I now do something
that is called "thinking".

400
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:05,829
But if you keep acting like this,
I might change my mind.

401
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:07,299
You can't win against me
even if you do that.

402
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:08,630
If I!

403
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,740
Go back to my old self
just to beat you,

404
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:16,910
you're going to die for sure.

405
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,680
Because I'll try to win against you,
and you only.

406
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:30,690
You,

407
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:32,960
your father,

408
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:35,660
your father's company,

409
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:39,430
your minions, Son Hyo Joon
and Lee Sang Woo,

410
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,859
their fathers' companies,

411
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,470
and the lives of everyone
around you.

412
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,670
I'll tear all of that apart.

413
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:56,049
How?
You're just an illegitimate son.

414
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:00,849
You said the same thing
three years ago.

415
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,019
If the woman we saw yesterday
and my father have a child...

416
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,529
That would be a guy like you.

417
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,470
It's true
that I'm an illegitimate son.

418
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,539
But it doesn't change the fact that
I'm the second son of Jeguk Group.

419
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,039
With my father behind my back,

420
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:29,009
do you think a guy like you
can be my match?

421
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Three years ago, you said this.

422
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,730
You'll regret this moment...

423
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,200
"For the rest of your life,
Choi Young Do."

424
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,900
You should've run to me
faster than you did then.

425
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,200
Before I...

426
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,509
lost my mom.

427
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,039
I was very angry,

428
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,989
and the time I gave you as a
punishment was only five minutes.

429
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,380
Do you remember that?

430
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,550
The two forks...

431
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,380
on the table.

432
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:46,920
You missed the last meal with your
mom just to win against me.

433
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,230
I don't care what you do to me.

434
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,260
But,

435
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,530
not to Cha Eun Sang.
Don't touch her.

436
00:34:58,269 --> 00:34:59,340
And...

437
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,510
let's just be a nobody
to each other and move on.

438
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,510
I don't have time to fight with you.

439
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,409
A bigger fight is waiting for me.

440
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,139
What's all this?

441
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,880
The female junior's gifts.

442
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,849
The title says "Congratulations
on the Gold Award".

443
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,019
Hyo Shin won an award at the
Asia Youth Short Film Festival.

444
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,949
Really? That's awesome.

445
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,059
Right. There's big news.

446
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:02,260
Don't get surprised
no matter what I tell you.

447
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,929
What is it?

448
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:05,260
I think Choi Young Do likes you.

449
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,530
Does he?

450
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,000
Be quiet. Only I and Myung Soo know.

451
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,869
Don't ever tell Choi Young Do
that you know it.

452
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,269
I'm just telling you because
I think you should know it.

453
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,710
It's really a secret.

454
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,670
Okay.

455
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,449
Did you talk behind my back?

456
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,179
It seems like you became closer
while talking behind my back.

457
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,789
I'm not close with her.

458
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,389
Authorized people only.

459
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,559
I know everyone here.

460
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,099
I'm going crazy.

461
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,329
He's saying it because of me.

462
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,469
Lee Bo Na. I can hear everything.

463
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,539
I saw the board. You won an award.

464
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,909
I didn't win it so you can come in
to the broadcast room.

465
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:52,840
Do you even know what you're doing
with it? What genre was it?

466
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,710
Horror? Scary films?

467
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,380
Something like "Friday the 13th"?

468
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,050
It's always about passionate
love affairs for me.

469
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,750
Doesn't Cha Eun Sang like
that kind of stuff?

470
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,590
- Sorry?
- Do you like that kind of stuff?

471
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,690
Yes, scary films, horror, thriller,

472
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,289
occult, splatter.

473
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:11,730
Do you even watch splatter movies?

474
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,570
My dream is to make a horror film
full of dreams and hopes.

475
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:19,469
But...

476
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:22,440
why are you guys not even looking
at each other?

477
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,940
Hey, you don't have act like that
because of me.

478
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,679
I guess I'm caught. I should leave.
Bye.

479
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,280
Why did you even come by the way?

480
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:37,219
I just wanted to see someone.

481
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,989
Who? Me?

482
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,590
He's talking about me.

483
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,000
What brought you here?

484
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:52,800
I'm sorry about last time.
I ruined the dinner.

485
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,269
- You know you did.
- That's why I have a favor to ask.

486
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,710
I want to invite Rachel to dinner.

487
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,739
But I don't think she'll come
if I tell her.

488
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,880
And it's also a little difficult
to ask Father.

489
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,949
With Rachel's mother too.

490
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,280
You only come to me when you need
me to act like your mother.

491
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,920
- I'm sorry.
- What should I do?

492
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,989
- I'm busy these days.
- Wait.

493
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,119
I'll show you clearly...

494
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,630
how low you are soon.

495
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,630
This type of thing should be
dealt by women.

496
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,199
Don't worry.

497
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:25,869
I'll leave it to you then.
Thank you.

498
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,050
Trunk shows originated
from showing items...

499
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,750
to select nobles,
by opening a trunk.

500
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:43,789
You all who were invited today
are the nobles of our times.

501
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,889
Beauty is created
by a woman's ambition.

502
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:52,059
That's why we upgraded
the functionality...

503
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,460
and even the style
of this FW season's...

504
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,099
clothing line.

505
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,880
It's Rachel.

506
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,280
Are you helping your mother
with work?

507
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,920
Yes. It's something I would have
to do by myself someday.

508
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:16,590
She's not a person who would hand
over the company unconditionally.

509
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,690
You're pretty like your mother,
and you know how to speak too.

510
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:22,420
Looking at Rachel,
I think Bo Na is still a baby.

511
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,059
Bo Na is popular at school too.

512
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:26,130
Please enjoy.

513
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,530
Please enjoy. Yes.

514
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,269
You said it'd be over in an hour.
We're going to be late.

515
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,239
Out of all days...

516
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,179
- Why?
- She's Ye Sol's mother, right?

517
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,050
- Yes, Ms. Han?
- So?

518
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,880
How did she get invited?

519
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,949
Do you know what her family
does for a living?

520
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,019
A bottled-water business?

521
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,960
It's a different kind of water.

522
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:58,530
She's the owner of the biggest
escort bar in Gangnam.

523
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,500
What? An escort bar?

524
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,670
Is that how it happened?

525
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,139
Ms. Han, you were like
a mother to her,

526
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:09,769
paid for her camping expenses,
but she took your Tan?

527
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:11,969
You've been backstabbed properly.

528
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,809
Seeing how it's going,

529
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,380
it seems like Tan was the one who
has been chasing around her.

530
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,150
This kid, I should just...

531
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,079
It's too late now,
what are you going to do?

532
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,420
What did Eun Sang's mother say?

533
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,019
She said she's leaving.

534
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:29,860
I just told her to do so.

535
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,960
What?

536
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,699
You're just letting the woman...

537
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:36,630
who knows everything
about your house leave like that?

538
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,670
You're right.

539
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:40,500
I didn't think that far.

540
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,110
I'll get back to you later.

541
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:49,610
- What's the matter?
- Ms. Jung is coming.

542
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:52,349
With your second son's fiance
and her family.

543
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:55,989
What? Rachel's family is coming?
To our house?

544
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:05,760
What are you doing now?

545
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,460
Why is Rachel's family coming here
out of the blue?

546
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,369
Don't make a fuss and be quiet.

547
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,340
It's just a dine out with in-laws.

548
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,340
"A dine out"?

549
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,610
There are tons of restaurants
and hotels out there.

550
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,909
You invited them to here
just to have dinner with them?

551
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,010
- When I'm here?
- You're scared now?

552
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,449
This isn't something you can
just enjoy watching,

553
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,250
like it's none of your business.

554
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,650
Stop making me nervous.
Tell me what you're up to!

555
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,260
Hang that on the wall over there.

556
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,719
Hang what now?

557
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,230
Don't hang it there!

558
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:40,730
You can't do this without discussing
it with the owner of this house.

559
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:43,530
"The owner"? How dare you act like
you own the house?

560
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,230
You're only a mistress
living off us!

561
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,469
Right. Thanks for mentioning that.

562
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,610
A mistress taking over
the master bedroom in this house.

563
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,179
Rachel's family would be so happy
to hear that, right?

564
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:57,809
How dare you do this without even
asking permission to the Chairman?

565
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,750
Of course, he knows.

566
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,179
Didn't you hear anything from Tan?

567
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:05,019
Does he know about this too?

568
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,920
I guess the American water
did help him grow up.

569
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,860
He now knows how to act like
his ignorant mother doesn't exist.

570
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,760
How dare you!

571
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,500
Tan is the one who arranged
it today.

572
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,199
You didn't know?

573
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,429
Where is he now?

574
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:00,980
Do you see me now?

575
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:02,679
Have you been doing well?

576
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:06,920
Are you happy outside of home?

577
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,050
Are you happy to not see me around?

578
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,360
Are you happy that you let go
of my hand?

579
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,900
It was nice seeing you
in my dream...

580
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:23,699
last night.

581
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:28,599
It's too late for me.

582
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,809
I'll go now. You should go too.
If you're late...

583
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,889
Do you think I will listen to you
if you tell me to go?

584
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,119
You left me alone
at the dangerous crosswalk.

585
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,360
You didn't even call me once
or send me a text.

586
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,559
How could you easily
tell me to leave...

587
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,659
when you've been missing me
as much as I have.

588
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:55,960
I didn't miss you.

589
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:01,869
- Hey, Kim Tan!
- Don't you lie again.

590
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:07,380
Don't come home tonight.
I came to tell you this.

591
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,610
I'm staying out anyway.

592
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,980
My mom might call you.

593
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,219
No matter what,
don't come home tonight.

594
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,320
What are you talking about?

595
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,619
Go in.

596
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:20,489
Bye.

597
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,739
The guests are here.

598
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,579
They're in front of the door.

599
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,309
Fine. If you want to stay,
keep staying like that.

600
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,150
Open the door for them.

601
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:51,389
Are you really going to do this?

602
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,590
Are you...

603
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,090
taking revenge on me?

604
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:58,829
I told you.

605
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,960
I'll show you where you belong,
and what you are.

606
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,500
If you got it, go off to your room.

607
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,570
Before I open the door.

608
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,550
Open the door.

609
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:09,500
They exchanged greetings just now
and are going to eat.

610
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,099
What about Tan?

611
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,000
Thank you.

612
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:25,550
I should've invited you earlier.
We were inconsiderate.

613
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,250
I only saw you at the general
meetings of stockholders,

614
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,519
so it feels different to see you
in your house as a family.

615
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:32,019
Please visit us often.

616
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:34,659
Tan called me
that he'll be home soon.

617
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,090
Don't be too upset.

618
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,130
I'm okay. It's rush hour.

619
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:41,500
She put on a fashion show all night
to find the right outfit for this.

620
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,369
Mom.

621
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,940
How nice is it that she put so much
effort in meeting the elders?

622
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,170
I thought of it as a family
occasion, so I prepared moderately.

623
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,010
I'm not sure
if it suits your taste.

624
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,349
I can see each dish was prepared
with such care and it's all good.

625
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,380
Same for me too.

626
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,349
Can you pass me over
the salad plate please?

627
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,949
We have an almond farm
in California.

628
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:05,320
These are from there. Please enjoy.

629
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,960
I actually love almonds.

630
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:14,199
I heard you can play go.

631
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:17,030
Yes. To be one step ahead
of the opponent,

632
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,900
you need to fight with all your
might in silence. It's fascinating.

633
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,239
That's right.

634
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,969
How can she so smart and pretty?

635
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,449
I'm sorry for being late.

636
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:34,280
Why are you so late?
You can't make your guests wait.

637
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,920
I was worried I might not be able
to see you tonight as well.

638
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,019
I'm sorry.

639
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:41,559
It's okay. I didn't wait that long.

640
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,300
If you're done eating, can I give
you a tour of my room?

641
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,829
Really?

642
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,530
Can I go to Tan's room?

643
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,070
I'll get someone to bring you
some fruits. Go on.

644
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:55,670
Please excuse me, then.

645
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,070
It won't be long. Let's go.

646
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,409
Tan looks so elegant.

647
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,380
That's why he met a princess
like Rachel, I guess.

648
00:49:18,429 --> 00:49:20,760
- What?
- I was thinking about...

649
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,099
the amazing thing Choi Young Do
said he saw in your house a little.

650
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:27,000
But I'm a "generous fiancee" today.
I'll give you a chance to hide it.

651
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:28,800
There's nothing to hide.

652
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:32,010
Just don't get surprised
when I reveal everything to you.

653
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:33,809
What could it be?

654
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,010
- My weakness.
- Knowing someone's weakness...

655
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,110
surely makes your
understanding about them grow.

656
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,550
That's why today is a jackpot
for you.

657
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:44,849
What are you talking about?

658
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,250
Can you elaborate
so I can understand...

659
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:51,530
Isn't that from your house
in the US?

660
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,559
That's right.

661
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:55,900
I really don't get your taste.

662
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,900
Why would you bring a cheap souvenir
with you on a first-class seat?

663
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,070
Have a seat for a minute.

664
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:08,380
Isn't it so ironic?

665
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,809
I couldn't come to your house
at the engagement day.

666
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:12,849
But now I'm here after threatening
to break off the engagement.

667
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,349
I'm sorry.

668
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,750
You don't have to be that sorry.

669
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,159
I'm apologizing in advance.

670
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:22,019
In advance?

671
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:24,159
Are you going to do something wrong?

672
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:25,329
Yes.

673
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,699
You said you were curious about
what Young was talking about.

674
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,170
I'll show it to you now.

675
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,440
It's been a while to see you
looking like this.

676
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:41,880
It's been 18 years, right?

677
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,510
When I first found out
about everything.

678
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:48,750
You would've not known back then.

679
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,159
That your status wouldn't be
much better even after 18 years.

680
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,630
The only space
where you can feel free...

681
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:01,300
in this big house is just here,
your room.

682
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,170
The guests are here.

683
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:05,929
Please get out!

684
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:12,170
Be quiet.

685
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,840
How dare you tell me to get out?

686
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,320
Close the door and get out.

687
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,750
Why did you come in?

688
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:57,690
What if your father looks for you?

689
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,260
I guess this is why everyone
wants to have a child.

690
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:14,239
Mom.

691
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:16,000
Yes.

692
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:19,110
Don't let go of my hand.

693
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:22,340
What?

694
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,280
Let's go out.

695
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:28,280
Are you insane? Where do you think
we're going?

696
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:29,679
Why are you doing this, Tan?

697
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:33,019
Why are you being like this?
Let go of me!

698
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:50,670
Aren't you Cha Eun Sang's mother?

699
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:52,440
What?

700
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:59,980
What in the world are you...

701
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,019
No.

702
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,079
You're mistaken.

703
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,219
The woman next to me...

704
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,059
is my mother.

705
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,940
My biological mother...

706
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,809
who gave birth to me.

707
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,750
And I'm...

708
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:40,190
the second son of the chairman
of Jeguk Group, Kim Nam Yoon,

709
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,760
and his illegitimate son.

710
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,260
I know what this confession
about my birth means...

711
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,940
to Father, Chief Director, Ms. Lee,

712
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,670
and my friend...

713
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,110
very well.

714
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,010
That's why we should break off...

715
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,750
this engagement.

716
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:17,929
What in the world...

717
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,559
I'm too baffled to speak.

718
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,630
I will...

719
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,940
set a proper date
and call you later.

720
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:33,309
I'll set a date.

721
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:35,380
And I'll be the one calling you.

722
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,150
Let's go.

723
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:41,280
Ms. Lee, please wait.

724
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,780
Ms. Lee.

725
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:45,250
Rachael, can we talk for a minute?

726
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,289
Chairman Kim.

727
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,559
I did wrong. Please forgive him.

728
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,360
It's all my fault.

729
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,460
What are you doing? Say you did
wrong to your father right now.

730
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,670
Chairman!

731
00:54:58,699 --> 00:54:59,730
Please stop!

732
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,000
Tan did nothing wrong.

733
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:04,309
I made him do it.

734
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,239
I told him it's so hard
living like this.

735
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:13,420
I told him he should do something
about it since he's all grown up.

736
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,550
- I was out of my mind for a moment.
- Mom, please!

737
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:18,550
Beg him. Beg him to forgive you
right now, Tan.

738
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:21,159
I don't want to do it. Not now.

739
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,530
I will try living on my own.

740
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,929
If I get to regret my decision
today, I'll beg you then.

741
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,530
Because I'm confident
I won't regret it.

742
00:55:32,469 --> 00:55:34,170
How foolish you are.

743
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:37,469
How pathetic you are.

744
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:40,239
How stupid you are!

745
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,940
If you want to kick me out,
do as you want.

746
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,150
But Mom is your woman.

747
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,019
So you should take care of her.

748
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,099
How can you do this? How?

749
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,099
How can you be so cruel?
How could you do this? How?

750
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,869
How could you do this?

751
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:12,409
How...

752
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:29,320
Stop crying, Mom.

753
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,789
I'm afraid you'll fall ill.

754
00:56:32,829 --> 00:56:35,800
Unless you're trying
to punish me, don't fall ill.

755
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,530
Why did you do that? Why?

756
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,139
Do you think this is good for me?

757
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:45,610
During the three years
when you were in America,

758
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,579
I couldn't even breathe properly,

759
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,909
caught between Won and your father.

760
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,949
I couldn't wait for you
to come back.

761
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:56,179
So how can you do this to me?

762
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,420
I'm sorry, Mom.

763
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,590
For having a different way
to get it through than you.

764
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,900
I'm really sorry.

765
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,730
How...

766
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:17,170
What do we do now?

767
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,480
What do we do?

768
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,409
What do we do now?

769
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,829
Eun Sang.

770
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,659
How many boxes of fruits
did you order earlier?

771
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,000
I forgot to do it.
I'll order it right now.

772
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Hey! How can you forget that?
What are we supposed to do tomorrow?

773
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,570
I'm sorry.

774
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:52,710
I told you to throw away that trash
as soon as you came today.

775
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,210
I'm sorry.

776
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:58,610
You also made mistakes on orders
and calculations earlier.

777
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,380
What's up with you today?

778
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:33,679
(The Heirs)
