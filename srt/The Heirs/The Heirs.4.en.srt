(The Heirs)

00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:29,100
(Episode 4)

4
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,429
Cha Eun Sang. Stop right there.

5
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,459
Have a safe trip.
Call me when you arrive.

6
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,439
Why didn't you call me?
Didn't your friend tell you?

7
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,739
- He did.
- Then you should've called me.

8
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,040
Are you going to Korea now?

9
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,780
What did you want to say?

10
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,250
Give me your number.

11
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,519
What are you waiting for?

12
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:00,930
"Thank you for everything."

13
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,129
I thanked you.

14
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,129
"Bye." I said goodbye.

15
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,670
I did all I should do.

16
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,569
So don't leave your fiancee alone
to ask something trivial like that.

17
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,960
Here's the declaration form.

18
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,539
(Customs Declaration)

19
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,590
What are you doing?

20
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm waiting for you
to finish writing.

21
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,400
Finish it first.

22
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,560
What's the matter?

23
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,000
I've thought about it.

24
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,370
I got a sad premonition
that we'll meet again.

25
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,770
That won't happen.

26
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:58,139
You say that because
you don't know Kim Tan well.

27
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,479
If that sad premonition comes true,
I think I'll want to see you first.

28
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,349
But I don't know anything about you.

29
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,219
That's why.

30
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,349
What do you mean?

31
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,689
Let's say this is
how we introduced ourselves.

32
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Hey.

33
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,759
I'm sorry, but you cannot enter
unless you're in first class.

34
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,769
No, the girl who just walked in
took my declaration form.

35
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:25,300
If you wait here, I'll check.

36
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,250
I'm sorry, but she said she didn't.

37
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:40,850
What...

38
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,709
(Welcome back, my stepsister!)

39
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,509
If you're bored, go wash the dishes.

40
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,540
You said you weren't coming.
Why did you come and bother me?

41
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,740
Did you help me not to?

42
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,879
You told your mom that you changed
the flight.

43
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,879
Couldn't you just come back quietly?

44
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,949
You shouldn't have lost to your dad.

45
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:52,089
Unless you want to walk home,
let's go quietly. Without talking.

46
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,329
I'll tell Mom that you came
to pick me up,

47
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,060
so push it.

48
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,370
Gosh.

49
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,310
You must be dying to know
how Tan's doing. He's doing well.

50
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,050
Tan asked me how you are doing.

51
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,189
I said you're still mean
and living very well.

52
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,490
The fox is playing
because the tiger's away.

53
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,930
- Stop the car.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,810
Have you ever thought about this?

55
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,509
Why is the tiger away?

56
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,750
Maybe he just pretended
to be a tiger.

57
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,879
Maybe he ran away...

58
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,189
before people find out.

59
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,959
- What do you...
- Goodbye.

60
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,860
What? Where did everything go?

61
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,309
Hey, Eun Sang.

62
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,279
Ma'am. What happened?

63
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,519
Where is my mom?

64
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,350
Your mom moved out.
She's working as a resident maid.

65
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,789
What?

66
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,559
I'm sorry,
but can I borrow your phone?

67
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,500
The chairman is ill.
The mood in the house is down.

68
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,340
Sleep in the sauna tonight
and come tomorrow morning.

69
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:29,429
I saw that you wore jeans
without socks last week.

70
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,840
I know it's summer,
but I didn't like it.

71
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,110
It won't happen again.

72
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,809
But you're wearing a skirt today.

73
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,220
You wore shorts the week before.

74
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,620
Let me ask you again.

75
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:52,789
While you're tutoring, please
avoid clothes that show your skin.

76
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,960
No V-neck either.

77
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,029
Refrain from wearing perfume
or manicuring your nails too.

78
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,769
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,299
(High school math)

80
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,009
You scared me.

81
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,080
When did you get here?
You were so quiet.

82
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,450
Isn't my family annoying?

83
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,320
It is.

84
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,049
How come you don't quit then?

85
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,720
Your mom pays me a lot.

86
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,190
And I need that money.

87
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:28,759
Open your book.

88
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,330
I like it.

89
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,860
Like what?

90
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,759
Everything my mom told you
not to do.

91
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,470
I like it too, but I won't do it.

92
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,309
To me, one who pays me
is always right.

93
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,279
So your taste doesn't
help me make a living.

94
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,809
Do you get it?

95
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,779
It's page 16.

96
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,629
(Kim Won)

97
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,799
Page 15?

98
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,370
Why aren't you answering?

99
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,509
We're in class. Look at the book.

100
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,639
Is it your boyfriend?

101
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,139
It's integration by substitution.

102
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,279
Not rings. A necklace, please.

103
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,549
Necklace? Absolutely, sir.

104
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:29,990
Please take a look right here.

105
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,429
- The wishbone?
- Absolutely, sir.

106
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,730
Please show our guest.

107
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,700
Sir. If I may say, this necklace
will make your dreams come true.

108
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,570
What? That was the house deposit?

109
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,909
Then where else would I
get such big money?

110
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:53,539
I can't believe you.
Are you insane, Mom?

111
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,480
How could you give it all to her?

112
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,379
She was lying about the wedding.

113
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,980
I heard it. She called me.

114
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,519
Crazy witch. How dare she call her?

115
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,419
What did she say?
Did she say it was all a lie?

116
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,990
She said sorry
and asked if you're back safely.

117
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,799
Is that all? Did you let it go?

118
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,600
What if I don't?

119
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,129
What else can I do other than
hitting the phone?

120
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,970
So why did you give
all that money to her?

121
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,799
That witch betrayed her mom
and sister to live well by herself.

122
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,070
Don't you get mad?

123
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,279
Don't call your sister a witch.

124
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,250
What are we going to do now?

125
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,980
Are we going to live on streets?

126
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,350
Wait here.

127
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,120
Why? For how long?

128
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,320
How many minutes?

129
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,850
It's me.

130
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:17,159
Ms. Park. What's wrong with you?

131
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,029
Is spying on the first madam
going well?

132
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,629
It was just the other day.

133
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,370
What do you think?

134
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,169
Do you trust me?

135
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:29,639
What does that mean?

136
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,340
My goodness. Am I being threatened?

137
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,850
Yes. It hurts me too.

138
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,450
Seriously.

139
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,549
Who threatens with affection?

140
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,220
What do you want?

141
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,559
Madam. The first madam is here.

142
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,759
What? Why all of a sudden?

143
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,700
Did you tell her?

144
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,070
Not yet, but since she's here...

145
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Wait.

146
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,750
What is it? Tell me what you want.

147
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,909
You have to tell...

148
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,580
Write it.

149
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,320
Put on something clean and neat.

150
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,929
When did you change your socks?
Put on new socks.

151
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,230
What are you doing?

152
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,629
This is where we're going to live
from now on.

153
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,710
What?

154
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,360
What do you do
aside from wasting food?

155
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,759
Why didn't you tell me
that the chairman is ill?

156
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,230
He's sick every other day.

157
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,539
How can I report it to you
every time?

158
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:07,340
Do you want him to die or live?

159
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,740
What? What did you just say?

160
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,639
You shouldn't be doing this
in someone else's house...

161
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,639
so early in the morning.

162
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,750
- You're so energetic.
- What? Someone else's house?

163
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:18,679
One who doesn't belong here is you.

164
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:21,450
You're not even on the family
register. Watch your mouth.

165
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,049
That stupid family register.

166
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,259
You can't even give birth.

167
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,529
You never disappoint me.

168
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,190
"That stupid family register"?

169
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,399
So is the child you gave birth to
with you right now?

170
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,399
- What?
- That's what family register is.

171
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,669
You and I both don't have a child.

172
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,539
Life is long.

173
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,110
Just because he's not with me now,

174
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,669
doesn't mean he won't be
with me tomorrow.

175
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,039
The blood is thicker than water
for a reason.

176
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,340
- You...
- So, first madam.

177
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,409
You need to manage your vigor well.

178
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,779
Don't get dragged out when you get
kicked out of the family register.

179
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,049
You should at least walk out on...

180
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,019
I can't take it anymore.

181
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,289
Keep going. Say some more.

182
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:02,889
Did you slap me?

183
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,660
Did you just slap me?

184
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,829
Can't you believe it?

185
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,529
You want me to slap you again?

186
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,299
Mr. Kim is coming.

187
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,849
- You're home.
- You should go see your father.

188
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,380
How was your business trip
to the US?

189
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,519
You went to the US?

190
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,619
I'm home.

191
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,450
I'll let you guys chat.

192
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,920
- Put the carry on in my room.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:40,900
He wasn't home?

194
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:45,599
Yes, life is long.

195
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,640
And blood is thicker than water.

196
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,309
What are you talking about?

197
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:54,910
Then did the chairman and Won
share water?

198
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,680
Let's see how well Tan will protect
his mom...

199
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,519
against his brother.

200
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:15,599
That witch.

201
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,799
She doesn't intimidate me at all.

202
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,910
Ms. Park. Ice.

203
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,480
Follow me. Bring medicine
to the chairman's room.

204
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:32,849
Me?

205
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,319
Hello.

206
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,529
Mom went to do Madam's errand.

207
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,430
Are you Ms. Park Hee Nam's daughter?

208
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,470
Pardon?

209
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,769
Yes.

210
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,710
Why are you standing there
like that?

211
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Sit down.

212
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,019
I have to go to work soon.

213
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:41,420
What a lame excuse.

214
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,390
I met Tan.

215
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,029
I know people who went to the party
better than you do.

216
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,559
But...

217
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,500
no one talked about Tan.

218
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,170
You should rescind
your brother's exile now.

219
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,240
Or I will.

220
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,369
I understand your pain.

221
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,839
So, to be fair,

222
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,279
I turned a blind eye
to you hurting Tan.

223
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,079
But...

224
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,349
you're taking it way too far.

225
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,559
That's not fair.

226
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,759
Is making the weight of pain
the same...

227
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,529
your idea of fairness?

228
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,000
I have...

229
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:32,500
never hugged Tan
because you might hate it.

230
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:35,640
I think...

231
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,109
I'd end up regretting.

232
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,380
That sounds like...

233
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,210
you raised me with love.

234
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,880
Are you sure you wouldn't
regret anything about me?

235
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,950
Do you think...

236
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,289
I'm asking for your opinion?

237
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,920
I'll get going.

238
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:05,039
She's ridiculous.

239
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,869
Neither of us is a good wife.

240
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,750
I know. There's even a book
about it.

241
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,579
"You're a Concubine
Because It Hurts".

242
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,750
What?

243
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,589
Doesn't this family look ridiculous,
even to you?

244
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:29,390
You must be happy since you're poor.

245
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,089
You wouldn't have to deal with this.

246
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,630
Well, that can't be the reason.

247
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,740
Hold on.

248
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,640
If Won went to the US,
he must've met Tan.

249
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:48,980
I'm going in.

250
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,049
If you're going to the US,
you should've...

251
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,849
Ask Father if it's about Tan.

252
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,289
Did you meet Tan?

253
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,789
What did he say? Is he doing well?

254
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,500
Is he all right? Did he ask you
about me?

255
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,059
Don't you know his phone number?

256
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,529
You want me to give it to you?

257
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,470
He never picks up.

258
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,000
Right. Let me ask you
since we're on the topic.

259
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:16,509
Until when will you stop Tan
from coming to Korea?

260
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,680
Do you have to be this mean?

261
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,380
What did an 18-year-old do so...

262
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,509
I was an heir to Jeguk Group
at that age.

263
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,319
I was a major stockholder
with eight percent of voting right.

264
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:29,319
Fine. Then I take it back.

265
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,559
But Won,

266
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm too ashamed to see Tan.

267
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm still his mom,
but that lonely boy...

268
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,670
This isn't church.

269
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,470
Go make a confession somewhere else.

270
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,240
I'm a Buddhist.

271
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,900
It's been three years.

272
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,569
I've gotten a lot taller.

273
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,769
Is that all?
All you've done in the US.

274
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,269
Stop there.

275
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,509
Coming here took more courage
than you deserve.

276
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,130
Who's stronger?

277
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,529
Between the ladies fighting earlier.
Who should I worry about more?

278
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,569
They were obviously a wife
and a concubine.

279
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:51,940
Who's more influential?

280
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,670
No, they are a second wife
and a concubine.

281
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,740
Really?

282
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,380
The chairman looked like a nice
person, but I guess not.

283
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,650
Where's the first wife?

284
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,680
She passed away.

285
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:07,950
The mother of the president you saw
was the first wife.

286
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,990
So did Chan Young's dad
help you move in?

287
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,390
You must be her daughter.

288
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,559
Hello. I'm Cha Eun Sang.

289
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,789
What grade are you in?

290
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:19,759
I'm in Grade 11.

291
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,269
As you saw,

292
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,369
this family isn't exactly elegant.

293
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:29,710
Don't let what you see and hear here
get out of the fence.

294
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,079
You're in Grade 11.
You understand what I mean, right?

295
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,440
- Yes.
- Right.

296
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,880
I trust your mom because she
can't do it even if she wants to.

297
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,259
Thank you for being considerate
of me and my mom like this.

298
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,490
We'll move out as soon as possible.

299
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,400
While I'm here,
I'll stay quiet as if I'm not here.

300
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,329
If there's still anything you feel
uncomfortable about, please tell me.

301
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,529
I'll fix it.

302
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,670
Okay. I see.

303
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,809
Give her something delicious.

304
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,240
I'll do the dishes. Go rest.

305
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,210
Then can you get me a bottle
of wine from the cellar?

306
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,309
One from 2000.

307
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:14,849
Be nice.

308
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,390
What did she say?

309
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:22,990
That you're a nice lady.

310
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,430
Don't lie.

311
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,029
I'm not that nice to your mom.

312
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,500
Even her daughter is smart.

313
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,119
Don't wake up. Just go to sleep.

314
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,049
I'll finish it.

315
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,369
Thank you.

316
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:20,509
Here.

317
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:23,609
A gift from the US.

318
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,390
A snack to eat with a drink
when I think of your sister?

319
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,089
That's the best for a diet.

320
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,519
I'll get a part-time job.

321
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:37,990
You eat this, lose weight,
and seduce a rich man.

322
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,930
That's the fastest way
for us to get out of here.

323
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,930
Sure. Let's do that.

324
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,410
I'm sorry, Mom.

325
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:01,319
That I left you.

326
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,650
Forgive me.

327
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,690
I'm really sorry.

328
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,480
I'm sorry, Mom.

329
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,289
I'm so sorry.

330
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,569
Here's your drink.

331
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,490
For delivery.

332
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,990
(Inspection hour)

333
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,759
Take-out, please.

334
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,529
Okay.

335
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,180
Here's your fried chicken.

336
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,799
(Check the deposit)

337
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,640
(Cha Eun Sang)

338
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,579
Chan Young. It's your debtor.

339
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:47,319
Yes. Give me your account number.
I can send it tomorrow morning.

340
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,650
You're coming to Korea? When?

341
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,630
Right. The break is over
soon already.

342
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,740
Did you sleep well?

343
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:16,480
No, I didn't.

344
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,119
I'm worried about Tan.

345
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,819
I stayed up all night.

346
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:25,690
But you were snoring.

347
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:26,920
Snoring?

348
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,700
Nam Yoon. The room is dry.

349
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:46,539
Does Tan even want to come back?

350
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,380
He didn't leave
because he wanted to.

351
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,980
I'll make him come back
even if he doesn't want to.

352
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,180
We cared enough about Won
for three years.

353
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,319
Do you even miss Tan?

354
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,960
Of course I do.

355
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,960
You only need Won.

356
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,500
Even better with both of them.

357
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,900
Really? Do you mean it?

358
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,609
You're allowing it then.
You take care of Won.

359
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:18,470
If he's too scared to be back
because of his brother,

360
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,839
he shouldn't at all.

361
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,910
Why do you keep changing your mind?

362
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,450
Whatever. I'm calling him.

363
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,730
He's not picking up again.

364
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,630
That punk. Goodness.

365
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,069
(Mom)

366
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:51,809
I always imagine...

367
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,750
those who were lonely
because I was with them...

368
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:03,650
would be lonely at least for once...

369
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,759
because I'm not with them.

370
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:15,200
I want to come home.

371
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,200
Father.

372
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,579
I miss you.

373
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,250
Mom.

374
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,019
After being so mean to me,

375
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,730
I'll believe it hurt you
at least once.

376
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,779
Mr. Yoon. It's me.

377
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,940
Now you have a mind to turn it in?

378
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,599
Yes.

379
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,210
Thanks for everything.

380
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,519
"One who wants to wear the crown,"

381
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,489
"bear the crown."

382
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,260
One who wants to wear the crown,
bear the crown.

383
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,019
Welcome back.

384
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,730
Did you like the food in the US?

385
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,400
You've grown so much
since the engagement.

386
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,400
Yes. How are you?

387
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,369
How Jeguk Group is doing
is how I'm doing.

388
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,099
The chairman will be happy.

389
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,539
Your mother called me four times.
You should call her on the way.

390
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,440
I'll call my brother first.

391
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,079
Who? Who's here?

392
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:58,659
I'm back.

393
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,260
For how long?

394
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,269
I'm going to stay.

395
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:05,429
For how long?

396
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:09,440
Don't you remember what I said
when you went to the US?

397
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:11,110
Or did you not understand?

398
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,679
I know what you're worried about.

399
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,739
But you still came back?

400
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:15,679
I missed my family so much.

401
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,179
- And I missed home.
- To whine?

402
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,690
You can say whatever you want.
But I'm not going back.

403
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,059
I'll just party and have fun here.
Let me stay.

404
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,190
What you're worried about...

405
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,559
won't happen.

406
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,530
What?

407
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,099
The illegitimate son can't
do anything...

408
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,530
about what I'm worried about.

409
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:39,800
Stop acting up and listen.

410
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:41,840
One thing's for sure.

411
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,510
You missed the chance I gave you.

412
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,579
A chance for stepbrothers
to be a little nice to each other.

413
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,079
That's what it means
for you to come home.

414
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:53,550
You don't want to go back?

415
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,250
Then stay.

416
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,489
What can I do to you?

417
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,760
Everyone's on your side.

418
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,099
The chairman's waiting.

419
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,269
But I can't take you to your house.
Take care.

420
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,659
You went to the airport yourself...

421
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,900
without telling me.

422
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,500
I assumed you'd heard it
from the chairman.

423
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,699
When did Father ever...

424
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,070
Find a hotel for me to stay
for a while.

425
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,210
One close to work.

426
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,280
What should I tell the chairman?

427
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,409
Leave it. He'll assume.

428
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,659
Son.

429
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,619
Let me see you.

430
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,829
Let me see your face.

431
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,469
I'm back, Father.

432
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,469
Yes. Have a seat.

433
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:28,409
How could you ignore
your mom's calls like that?

434
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:29,780
Why did you call me so much?

435
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,409
Isn't Father nice to you?

436
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,579
Your father?

437
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,480
He was mean to me since I snored.

438
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,150
Recently, I got slapped...

439
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,690
Anyway, I've been very sad.

440
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,289
She hasn't changed.

441
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,489
Your mom always makes a fuss.

442
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,199
How was the house?

443
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,460
Was it nice to stay?

444
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,099
I told them to put extra care.

445
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:56,670
It was too big.

446
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,809
It was too bright in the day,
and pitch dark at night.

447
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,179
It was dark?

448
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,650
Why did you get him a dark...

449
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,179
When it's dark,
you can see the stars well.

450
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,420
And how was the school?

451
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,860
Did you learn anything?

452
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,760
I just had fun.

453
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:27,199
Go rest. You look tired.

454
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,039
Okay.

455
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,920
Look how tall you've grown.

456
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:50,630
If you grow so well without me,
I'm disappointed.

457
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,559
Did you make a lot of
American friends? Blonds?

458
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,730
With big boobs.

459
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,070
You didn't do drugs, did you?

460
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,170
It's expensive.

461
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,840
My son. You grew up so well.

462
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,780
Oh, that's right.
Rachel went to visit you.

463
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,349
Mom. I'm going to take a shower.

464
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,849
You can question me later.

465
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,280
Oh, right. Sorry.

466
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,280
You should hurry up and leave.

467
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,550
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,840
I can't prove
I was in my dream last night,

469
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,940
and that place feels the same.

470
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:45,809
Was I really there?

471
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,079
The second son?

472
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,099
What time is it?

473
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:51,869
You have to go out now
and come home late.

474
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,070
The mood in the house is bad now.

475
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:57,670
Since the 2nd son is back, the 1st
son hasn't come home for days.

476
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:00,510
Then just tell him to come home.
Why do you bother me?

477
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,340
I only slept for three hours.

478
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,079
Because the chairman is
in a bad mood,

479
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,789
the second madam is
being extremely hysterical.

480
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:13,920
Don't get in their sight
and get hurt for no reason. Hurry.

481
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,429
Where do I go at this hour?

482
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,000
I'll go after saying hi to my dad
when he goes to work.

483
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:30,840
I can just wait here.

484
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,710
You can, but not my dad.

485
00:44:32,909 --> 00:44:34,510
My dad hates you so much.

486
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:37,380
If there's any misunderstanding,
we should clear it up.

487
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:40,880
I wish there was.
He just hates you for who you are.

488
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,619
There's a convenience store
down the street. Go eat something.

489
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,210
My goodness.

490
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,880
What? Do you live here?

491
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:20,659
Who is she?

492
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,559
Did Tan's family move?

493
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,309
Catch me.

494
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:52,050
Let me play.

495
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,820
Why? This is mine.

496
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,889
Let me play.

497
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,250
Why? Get yours from home.

498
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,860
Hey. Kids.

499
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,199
You shouldn't make a scene
in public places

500
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,599
She's sleeping here.

501
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,139
Mom.

502
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:19,210
- Mom.
- Mom.

503
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,610
- Mom.
- Mom.

504
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,780
- Mom.
- Mom.

505
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:37,190
- Mom.
- Mom.

506
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,260
Look at them.

507
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:42,159
Are you bragging
that you have a mom?

508
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,900
I had Mom when I was your age.

509
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,170
Choi Young Do. What are you doing?

510
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,840
Hey. They're picking a fight.

511
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,880
They're making fun of me
for having no mom.

512
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,250
Mom.

513
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,250
- Mom.
- Mom.

514
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,849
Kids these days are scary.

515
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,250
Are you hurt anywhere?

516
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,519
Mom.

517
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:09,519
My heart.

518
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,300
- Be quiet!
- Mom.

519
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,739
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

520
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:21,739
You got prettier.

521
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,679
Guys. Hello.

522
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:30,880
Have you seen my dad?

523
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,980
- I think he's on the stage.
- He wasn't there.

524
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,750
Oh, your new soundtrack is awesome.

525
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,320
♪I only see you♪

526
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,320
Right?

527
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,519
That's Lee Hong Gi.

528
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,260
- Bye.
- Where are you going?

529
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,559
She doesn't know our songs.

530
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:45,389
- Bye.
- Guys.

531
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,559
The rehearsal was awesome.

532
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:47,659
We haven't done it yet.

533
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,960
Bye.

534
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:54,139
- 3, 4. Thank you.
- Thank you.

535
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:56,170
- 3, 4. Hello.
- Hello.

536
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,309
How's life treating you?

537
00:48:58,309 --> 00:48:59,340
How about you?

538
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,809
I'm the universal star.

539
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:02,210
So is it going well?

540
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,179
In Taiwan, China, we're... Gosh.

541
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:06,110
Have you been to Taiwan, China?

542
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,650
- Hee Chul.
- Oh, Bo Na.

543
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,389
- Bye.
- Bye.

544
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:11,920
What are you doing here?
Are you the host?

545
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,389
Of course I'm the host.

546
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,960
You picked... Hey. Who do you
like more? Kyu Hyun or me?

547
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,090
It's... Chan Young.

548
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,260
Oh, Chan Young?

549
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,429
- Do you know him?
- Of course not.

550
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,199
Is he your boyfriend?

551
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:27,139
Is he your boyfriend or hostage?

552
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,269
You're so annoying.
Seriously, this old man.

553
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,409
Excuse me, old man.
Have you seen my dad?

554
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:34,980
Old man?

555
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,409
I topped the chart for 60
continuous weeks and I totally...

556
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:42,579
I thrived at the time.
I'm still doing well.

557
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,250
- What?
- Who am I talking to?

558
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:46,150
Bo Na.

559
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:48,760
Look at me, Bo Na. Lee Bo Na?

560
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:50,360
Where are you looking at? Bo Na.

561
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,730
Bo Na. Lee Bo Na.

562
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,800
Bo Na. Look here.

563
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,730
- Chan Young.
- Bo Na.

564
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:58,699
You'll hurt yourself.

565
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,039
When did you come back?
How did you get in here?

566
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,369
I met your father by the entrance.

567
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:06,579
It's been three hours
since I landed.

568
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:09,780
What? You didn't say anything when
we talked on the phone yesterday.

569
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,280
That's why it's more touching.

570
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,750
Hey, hostage.

571
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,820
Tell me if you're in danger.

572
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,219
Still, how could you not call me?

573
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:20,460
- I totally missed you.
- I missed you too.

574
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,059
- I missed you more.
- I won't lose this time.

575
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:24,530
I missed you.

576
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,630
Don't go anywhere.

577
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,469
- Let's go everywhere together.
- Sure. Let's do that.

578
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:36,170
Oh, now you want to go with me
instead of Cha Eun Sang?

579
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,869
I thought you were living with her.

580
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:40,510
Why would I do that with a friend
when I have a pretty girlfriend?

581
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,440
What do you want to eat?

582
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,809
Korean food? It's on me. Let's go.

583
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:45,050
But you were looking
for your father.

584
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,449
That's not important now.

585
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:49,989
I'm not going to have a daughter.

586
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:52,050
My goodness. Who said I will?

587
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,159
What a perv.

588
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,889
- Here.
- My. Thank you.

589
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:25,889
Is this why you wanted to eat
at home?

590
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:29,590
Enjoy. It's Chan Young's favorite.

591
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,159
I thought your favorite was sushi.

592
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,400
You're good at relationships.

593
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,429
He doesn't usually eat fish
unless it's cooked.

594
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,670
Is that true?

595
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,369
Come on. Don't be so hot
in front of Father.

596
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,210
This is what you should do
to get a girlfriend.

597
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:47,710
Do you want me to get a girlfriend?

598
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,980
I'm against it, Father.
Until Chan Young goes to college,

599
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,550
you must focus on Chan Young only.

600
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:52,710
Sure.

601
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,820
Since he needs to go to college,
you should break up with him.

602
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:58,489
That sounds like a father-in-law.

603
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,460
It's so good, Father.

604
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,059
Leave a lot of tip.

605
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,630
I could never get used
to giving tips in LA.

606
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,230
I got nervous every time I paid.

607
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,000
Oh, you met Tan in LA, didn't you?

608
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,699
Yes. It was the first time
since we were kids.

609
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:15,099
I almost didn't recognize him.

610
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,869
You mean Kim Tan?

611
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,070
You know him too?

612
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,179
Of course I don't.
How would I know him?

613
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:22,610
It sounds like you do.

614
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,480
With that reaction,
I'm sure she does.

615
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,380
No, I don't. I don't know him.

616
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:28,380
Then you know him very well.

617
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,559
What's wrong? What is it?

618
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,159
I think I got dumped.

619
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:42,500
Is Yoon Chan Young not coming back?

620
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,329
What a smart boy.

621
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:47,070
That's not it.

622
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:49,599
Then what is it?

623
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:53,679
Chan Young might have found out
that I dated Kim Tan.

624
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:56,239
What do you mean he might
have found out?

625
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,750
They met in the US.
Kim Tan and Chan Young.

626
00:52:58,849 --> 00:52:59,880
What?

627
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,780
They fell in love and dumped you?

628
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:03,179
Come here. You need a smack.

629
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:05,449
So does Chan Young know or not?

630
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,320
I don't know if he knows.

631
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,260
- You said you got dumped.
- Yes. Soon.

632
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,429
I wonder what Kim Tan said about me.

633
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,429
I'm sure he's not over me yet.

634
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,269
It looks like they wailed
on each other.

635
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,699
Kim Tan wouldn't sue Chan Young
for hitting him, would he?

636
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,940
Hey. If they had a fight,
Tan would've beaten him.

637
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,210
Hey. Chan Young's good at fighting.

638
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,679
And don't take Kim Tan's side.

639
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:30,409
Don't take Rachel's
boyfriend's side!

640
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:52,199
I can't prove
I was in my dream last night,

641
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,239
and that place feels the same.

642
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:58,210
Was I really there?

643
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:06,079
You were there. I can prove it.

644
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,119
(New comment)

645
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,460
(Eun Sang:
You were there. I can prove it.)

646
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,059
Hey. Log out already.

647
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,769
Do you want to log out of your life?

648
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:28,000
No, I won't.

649
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,469
Did you think
I was that conscientious?

650
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:31,469
I'm a drug dealer after all.

651
00:54:32,139 --> 00:54:33,170
Where are you?

652
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,340
Are you kidneys still healthy?

653
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,980
(No, I won't. Did you think
I was that conscientious?)

654
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,650
They are.

655
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:41,420
Come get them if you need them.

656
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:43,420
Be honest with me.

657
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,090
You want me to appear
in front of you, don't you?

658
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:26,530
I bought cheese.

659
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,199
Leave it there.

660
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,900
Why isn't she replying?

661
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:01,360
"Sleeping Beauty".

662
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,139
"Once upon a time,"

663
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,079
"there lived..."

664
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,480
I bought cheese.

665
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,480
Thank you.

666
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,880
I didn't tell you do it.
Your mom did, okay?

667
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:24,150
Okay.

668
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,360
"There lived..."

669
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,030
No, not this.

670
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:38,199
How many times do I need to tell
you? The one that says 2005.

671
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,369
Even if you can't read French,
you can still read the numbers.

672
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:43,340
Have you gone blind now?

673
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,610
I'll go.

674
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,849
Give it to me, Mom.

675
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,420
Let me get the wine from now on.

676
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:58,889
Will you? Right. That's better.

677
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,260
You're eating for free.
You should earn your keep.

678
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,559
Why are you doing this?

679
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,469
You should go study.

680
00:57:12,769 --> 00:57:15,570
How can I study
when I can't even earn my keep?

681
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,610
"Everything together."

682
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:23,110
"Everything together."

683
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,219
Even the wines are living in luxury.

684
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,570
Come on. Why isn't she replying?

685
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,010
Gosh.

686
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:56,340
- Mom.
- Yes?

687
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,039
Have you ever had a nightmare
in this house?

688
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,909
A nightmare? Why?
Do you have nightmares?

689
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,510
I keep seeing a girl's back.

690
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,550
With long hair.

691
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,050
The maid's daughter. She lives here.

692
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:13,820
She's your age.
What was her name again?

693
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:16,559
Cha Eun Sang?

694
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,800
I told her to stay as if she were
not here, not like a ghost.

695
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,429
Why does she live here?

696
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,099
Her sister in the US was
getting married,

697
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:28,670
so they sent her
all their house deposit.

698
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:29,900
So they have no other option.

699
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:57,429
Don't. Don't do this.

700
00:59:57,429 --> 00:59:59,369
Mom went through so much
to make this money.

701
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,099
Leave.

702
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,670
Eun Seok.

703
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,050
(Cha Eun Sang)

704
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:18,690
I hate how my mom is suffering.

705
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,619
I hope Jeguk Group goes broke.

706
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:31,630
What are you doing right now?
Answer me now.

707
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:49,420
Gosh. Hurry up.

708
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,030
I'm drinking water.

709
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,150
You're all grown up now.

710
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,250
You kicked your brother out
as soon as you arrived.

711
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,250
Don't move.

712
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,889
What did you just do?
Are you insane?

713
01:03:07,889 --> 01:03:09,219
But I'm taking only your name.

714
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,489
Call me if you want it back.

715
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:11,829
- Is this your number?
- What?

716
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,159
I can't believe I'm spending money
to get a girl's number.

717
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,829
- I got interested in him.
- So why?

718
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:16,960
Because he's pretty.

719
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,230
I can't get him out of my head.

720
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,230
Forget about school.

721
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,340
Let's stop hiding here
like a criminal and leave.

722
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,409
I forgot to introduce yourself.
You're mine from today.

723
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,039
Lucifer appeared in the school
of Satans.

724
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,510
I missed you, buddy.

725
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,550
Welcome.

726
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:44,489
(The Heirs)
