00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:05,639
(The Heirs)

2
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,300
(The Heirs)

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,899
(Episode 3)

4
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,340
What are they saying?

5
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,280
That he's not after you.
He's here to check that.

6
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,119
To trust you,

7
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,619
he needs to know who you are.

8
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,259
You're not sleeping?

9
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,200
But...

10
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,500
he met a girl yesterday.

11
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:03,469
That girl's name is Cha Eun Sang.

12
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:07,340
How do you know my name?

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,709
He's got a question
for Cha Eun Sang.

14
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,810
Do I...

15
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,590
like you?

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Probably not.

17
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,109
Why?

18
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:52,819
Because you're engaged.

19
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,950
Despite that.

20
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,129
But that sounds like something
from a movie.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,060
This is Hollywood.

22
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,199
Things like that really happen.

23
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,770
Really?

24
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,479
Is this Hollywood?

25
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,479
What?

26
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,180
It's really Hollywood.

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,819
It's so amazing.

28
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,819
I've seen that in a movie.

29
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,520
I think what I said in the theater
is more amazing than that.

30
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,699
I've always wanted to go there
when I come to the US.

31
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,860
Am I talking to myself?

32
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,000
It looks close,
but it's actually far away, right?

33
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,740
It looks far at a glance.

34
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,780
Take a shower at home,
and let's go in my car.

35
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:56,979
You can't walk there.

36
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,319
I'm not going there.

37
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,819
Why not? I'll take you there.

38
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,930
No.

39
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,189
You've been very nice to me.

40
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,300
I don't want to bother you anymore.

41
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,240
Let's go to your house.
My luggage is there.

42
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,169
Which way is it?

43
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,319
Sorry for bothering you,

44
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,860
but can you check if there's
the reply for the last time?

45
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,740
Thank you for everything.

46
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,370
Bye now.

47
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,550
The US? Where in the US?

48
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,350
I'm in the US too. What's going on?

49
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:45,519
I can go there right now.
Call me as soon as you see this.

50
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,459
This is my number.
Call me immediately.

51
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:01,209
Where is my luggage?

52
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,339
It's all broken. What happened?

53
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,410
Where is it?

54
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,149
Upstairs in my room.

55
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,550
I'm going to shower.
Come and get it if you want.

56
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,930
Stay until you hear
from your friend.

57
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,959
Problem solved, right?

58
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:26,899
I'm going to shower.

59
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,009
I had lunch alone.

60
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,610
Let's have dinner together.

61
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,560
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

62
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,990
There's a family party with
American stockholders...

63
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,259
in the summer house in the farm.

64
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,300
The chairman wants you to attend it.

65
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,230
Be there by lunch tomorrow.

66
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,139
Mr. Kim's probably
arrived there by now.

67
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,569
Does he know that I'm coming?

68
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,480
The chairman wants you to go.

69
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,579
But not my brother?

70
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,420
If you want to know how he thinks,
you should go.

71
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,379
You should ask him yourself
in person.

72
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,990
That's all I need to say. Good luck.

73
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,389
Thank you.

74
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,139
Father.

75
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,279
It's Mr. Yoon.

76
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,550
What are you doing at school
during a break?

77
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,750
I'm working on a short film
festival. What about you, Father?

78
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,490
I have something to do
at the foundation.

79
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,819
And it's Mr. Yoon.

80
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,990
It seems Chan Young's been
enlightened in the US.

81
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,860
He doesn't call me first,
and he talks to American girls.

82
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,199
I think he's cheating on me.

83
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,199
Really?

84
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,829
I gave birth to such a jerk.

85
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,000
How could you say that
to my boyfriend?

86
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,470
Keep your eye on Chan Young.

87
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,339
He likes girls so much.

88
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,709
No, it's the girls who like him.

89
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,410
That girl named Cha Eun Sang.

90
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,579
You know her.

91
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,779
I hate her, so don't be nice to her.

92
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,680
Take care, Father.

93
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,079
It's Mr. Yoon.

94
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:28,490
I won't call you that.

95
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
You're here.

96
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,629
Look at you. Say hi to me properly.

97
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,470
What's all this?

99
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,470
Hyo Shin. Have some.

100
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,040
We got up early in the morning
and made it with love.

101
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,509
The rolls are from Cheongdam-dong.
The rib is from Bangbae-dong.

102
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,810
Assorted jeon from Jongno.
Salad and dessert from Itaewon.

103
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,449
What did you make?

104
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,519
Did you get up early to make spoons
and chopsticks with love?

105
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,649
And how come you brought so little
when he has so many people with him?

106
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,860
Seriously.

107
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,790
I should open a broadcasting
station for her or something.

108
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,529
Just over some broadcasting club.

109
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,730
What? Some broadcasting club?

110
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,399
My dad is the president of SBC.

111
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,269
My dad is the president
of Mega Hand.

112
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,839
Should I take out
all the celebrities from SBC?

113
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,069
And see if you can still afford
to open a broadcasting station?

114
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,110
What's wrong with her?

115
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,810
Let's go.

116
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,439
I like everything about you.

117
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,610
Especially this.

118
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,480
What's today's gift for?

119
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,580
- It's my 100th day.
- What?

120
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
With whom?

121
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,059
- With the college entrance exam.
- You scared me.

122
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,330
Sit down for a second.

123
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,129
The producer in Grade 10
wants to leave the club.

124
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,340
His family found out
he's in the broadcasting club.

125
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,740
I knew he seemed nervous.

126
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,580
That reminds me, you've hidden it
well for three years.

127
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,480
I don't know...

128
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,049
if I hid it well
or my parents hid it well.

129
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,179
I feel gloomy.

130
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,220
What kind of medicine is that?

131
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,090
Vitamin.

132
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,820
You'll know next year.

133
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,159
My body doesn't feel like 18.

134
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,690
Oh, my gosh.

135
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,429
What's the bag for?

136
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,669
Let's go to Hollywood next time.

137
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,299
I have to go somewhere now.

138
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,840
What is it? Is it bad?

139
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,710
Don't go anywhere, and stay here.

140
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,340
No, I should go.
I've caused enough trouble.

141
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,039
You always say you'll go.
You don't have a place to go.

142
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,450
Say that one more time, and
I'm going to sell you to someone.

143
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,279
Hey, guys.

144
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,980
Hey. Jay.

145
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,590
My sweet angel's in this house?

146
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
This afternoon, she...

147
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,299
Tammy and her boyfriend were here.
They came to the hospital.

148
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,830
So don't worry about it.
I got it taken care of.

149
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,799
Anyway, where are you going?

150
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,710
Is my sweet angel staying with me?

151
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,480
Do you get car sick?

152
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,129
Where are we going right now?

153
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,929
Sleep if you're tired.
It will take a while.

154
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,519
Did she say she can't divorce him?

155
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,990
Lower your voice.

156
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,289
Are you trying to
tell everyone here?

157
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:27,529
Just listen to me.

158
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:31,100
There's nothing better than
an affair for a reason to divorce.

159
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,700
I know people who take
good dirty pictures.

160
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:37,940
I'll give you the number.
Get them on her right away.

161
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,600
But if you think about it,

162
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,669
I had an affair too.

163
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,809
But you gave birth to a son.

164
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,409
Oh, is that right?

165
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,019
Do I call this number?

166
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,259
Yes. Her name is Jung Ji Sook.

167
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,759
She's usually in the gallery
in Apgujeong during the day.

168
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,100
Right? An affair.

169
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,299
You know what I'm talking about.

170
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,799
Yes. I need pictures of her...

171
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,570
My goodness.

172
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:25,649
I'll call you back.

173
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,490
Since when were you there?

174
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,360
Did you eavesdrop on everything?

175
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,659
I didn't. I could just hear it.

176
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,899
If you heard I was on the phone,

177
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,429
you should've given a sign.

178
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:43,000
I was talking secretly.

179
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,110
I was holding it after writing this.

180
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,509
If you're lucky,
you won't get caught, but...

181
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:58,720
you should've used a burner
for such a thing.

182
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,179
A burner?

183
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,519
Why do you say that now?

184
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,889
Don't write. I said don't write.

185
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:12,700
Don't you dare write,
"You didn't ask."

186
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,220
Are we there?

187
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,789
I'll be back.

188
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,360
How long does it take?

189
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,429
I don't know.

190
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,100
I could get kicked out in five
minute or it could take more.

191
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,940
If you get bored,
take a look around.

192
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,610
Watch out for one person.

193
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,440
- Who?
- The coldest looking person here.

194
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,639
The coldest looking person?

195
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,629
So we can play around for wagers.

196
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,830
I will definitely win next time.

197
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,399
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

198
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,820
Excuse me. Who is that?

199
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,769
Excuse me.

200
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,580
- Won.
- Follow me.

201
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,279
Long time no see, Won.

202
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,480
Who called you?

203
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,090
Was it Mr. Yoon?

204
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,419
How...

205
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:51,389
have you been doing?

206
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:52,720
He just had to call you.

207
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,059
Did you think you could come here?

208
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,799
How can I not come when you're here?

209
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Whatever you say,
now that I saw you...

210
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,940
This is why I hate kids.

211
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,070
How could you come here
just because you missed me?

212
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,539
You don't even know what it means
to come here.

213
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,480
It's been three years.

214
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,450
I've gotten a lot taller.

215
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,049
Is that all?

216
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,960
All you've done in the US.

217
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,259
Stop there.

218
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,399
Coming here took more courage
than you deserve.

219
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,470
Leave.

220
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,799
Are you okay?

221
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,730
No, I'm not.

222
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,670
You'll get wet.

223
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Why did you eavesdrop?

224
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,369
If you were in danger,

225
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,779
I was going to grab your wrist
and run on the count of three.

226
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,180
Why didn't you then?

227
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,119
I was in danger the whole time.

228
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,099
What?

229
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,539
Nothing. It's just too quiet.

230
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:26,970
Shall we turn the radio on?

231
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,079
Forget...

232
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,180
what you saw.

233
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,079
I'm going to forget about it anyway.

234
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,549
Because it's all a dream.

235
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:46,720
A midsummer night's dream
that ends when I wake up.

236
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,619
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

237
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,380
What was that?

238
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
A rockslide.

239
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,319
It happens often here.

240
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,160
Is the car broken?

241
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,430
Stay in the car.

242
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:29,769
It'll get dark soon.
We'll be in trouble.

243
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:40,579
What's this? It's like the first
scene of a horror movie.

244
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,690
What do we do?

245
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,059
I get no signal here.

246
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,869
You can't drive, can you?

247
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,670
What?

248
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:11,779
Push harder.

249
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,410
- Hurry up.
- I am.

250
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,190
Let's do it one more time. Hurry up.

251
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,420
1, 2, 3.

252
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,809
What do we do?

253
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:52,950
This won't do.

254
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,849
Let's give up on the car.

255
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,890
Get anything important in the bag.
Like your passport.

256
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,660
That's all in here, but why?

257
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,990
We should look for a light
around here before it gets dark.

258
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,230
Then I can call a body shop
or something.

259
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,700
Can't we just stay here?

260
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,000
In movies,
people die while venturing out.

261
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,369
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".

262
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,039
"Friday the 13th". "Scream".

263
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:17,210
"Hello, Sidney." Don't you know?

264
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,079
Then you stay here.

265
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,980
What? Wait for me.
I'll die if I stay alone.

266
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,519
So you already concluded we'll die?

267
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,490
One person has to live
for Season Two.

268
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,410
I'm hungry. Do you know the way?

269
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,549
There's no other way.

270
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,250
It could be the other direction.

271
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,049
I saw a roadhouse on the way.

272
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,930
I forgot that I bought it.

273
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,000
- Did you buy only 1?
- No, 2.

274
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:15,769
One is for my mom.

275
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,470
Will you stop wasting money?

276
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,140
Here.

277
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:27,440
It's not that I want it.
That farm was...

278
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,309
Never mind.

279
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,349
The punk you asked for help.

280
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:34,619
Did he reply?

281
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,250
I haven't finished my sentence yet.

282
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,990
Go ahead.

283
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,690
What will you do
if you get a hold of him?

284
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,660
I have to borrow money first.

285
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,029
My sister took all the money,

286
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:45,730
so I can't buy the ticket to Korea.

287
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,230
I can lend you money too.

288
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,769
How? With my kidney as security?

289
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,299
I don't have courage
to cause that much trouble.

290
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,369
You should.

291
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,869
Do I look reliable to you?

292
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,910
He replied.

293
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,910
Really? When?

294
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,980
Why do you tell me now?

295
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,150
Let me see your phone.
Do you get an internet signal?

296
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,349
I doubt it. I can't even
make a call.

297
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:07,579
Then what now?

298
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,890
Wait. Over there.

299
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,099
We're closed for tonight.
Maybe tomorrow morning.

300
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,069
Other places will be the same.

301
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,569
If you decide to stay here tonight,
I'll book for tow.

302
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,369
- Just a minute.
- Okay.

303
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:49,329
What's this?

304
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,529
I bought it in the souvenir shop.
Put it on.

305
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:53,230
We can't sleep in these.

306
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,769
Is your goal to make people
think that we're a couple?

307
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,940
Don't even think about it.

308
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,750
Come out after you get changed.

309
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,950
Let's get something to eat.

310
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,799
What a shame. I should've seen it.

311
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,309
- That looks good.
- Yes. Thanks.

312
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,880
This is the best
since they're closing.

313
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:41,210
This is more than enough. Thank you.

314
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,619
They even have drinks.

315
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,380
Do you drink?

316
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,950
Didn't you see my hands trembling?

317
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,759
- That's cute.
- As long as you know.

318
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,539
Stop looking at me, or I'm going...

319
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,710
to ask you questions
you don't want to answer.

320
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,210
Like what?

321
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,779
Like, "Who is that person
you met in the farm?"

322
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,650
Yes.

323
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,019
My favorite person in the world.

324
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,789
Any more questions?

325
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:34,160
Are you...

326
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,099
Never mind.

327
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,970
You may insult me,
but not my big brother.

328
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:45,680
Oh, it was your brother.
Then do you...

329
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,779
- Hey.
- My gosh.

330
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,359
You idiot.

331
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,359
- What?
- You almost hurt yourself.

332
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,099
It's your fault. I was only joking.

333
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,509
Why did you turn red?

334
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
You're naughty.

335
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,109
My face isn't red.

336
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,910
It's just that I'm upset.

337
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,450
I came all the way to the US,
but I haven't even had a pancake.

338
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,980
What pancake?

339
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,980
In American movies,
they pour syrup on pancakes...

340
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,150
and have them with orange juice.

341
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,420
That looks totally American.

342
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,859
At least to me.

343
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,430
How tacky.

344
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,730
There's a good pancake place
in Melrose.

345
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,130
Let's go together when we go to LA.

346
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,259
Seriously.

347
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,339
Stop making a promise. If you do,
you won't keep it and will die.

348
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:48,440
No, if I keep thinking about it,
it'll get scarier.

349
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,039
I should focus on the sausage.

350
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,539
You're scarier.

351
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,319
I'm using the bed.

352
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:03,519
Of course. I'm grateful
that you let me sleep here.

353
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,890
Why are you so positive?

354
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,019
You're going through this
because of me.

355
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,289
Why is that because of you?
It's the rock slide.

356
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,359
Good night.

357
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,569
Are you sleeping?

358
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,839
Are you really sleeping?

359
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,529
Your acting is terrible. Get up.
I have a question for you.

360
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,269
- If you don't get up...
- What? What is it?

361
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,609
Why do you want Jeguk Group
to go broke?

362
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:58,640
What?

363
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,109
Did you look at my social media?

364
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:03,109
Of course I did. It's logged in.

365
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,150
Why did you look at it?

366
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,819
You better log out.

367
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:07,849
I guess you really want it
to go broke.

368
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,250
But why?

369
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,750
Why does that matter to you?

370
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,519
Do you have Jeguk Group shares?

371
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,259
Never mind. Watch me
until I fall asleep.

372
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,259
What?

373
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,359
Because you kept talking
about murderers,

374
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,500
I'm scared now.

375
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,440
Go to sleep after I fall asleep.
That's for the room charge.

376
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,500
The room charge?

377
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,569
You said I'm going through this
because of you with your own mouth.

378
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,809
That's because of the rock slide.

379
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:33,809
My goodness.

380
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,349
You can only watch.

381
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:38,210
Don't think about anything naughty.

382
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,349
Hey. You're totally not my type.

383
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,950
No way.

384
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,319
It takes a while
for me to fall asleep.

385
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,589
So I'm going to...

386
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:48,359
I have a lot of thoughts.

387
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,329
I sleep a lot.

388
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,299
If you reach that punk,

389
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,940
when are you going to Korea?

390
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:06,039
As soon as possible.

391
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,349
What if...

392
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,519
I...

393
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:19,710
I got the address.
Thank you for contacting me.

394
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,609
If you're thankful,
get rid of her already.

395
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,529
- Hop off.
- Can I just borrow your phone?

396
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,089
If I reach my friend...

397
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:39,230
Even if you do,
you have to meet him somewhere.

398
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,759
Are you going to stand
in the street?

399
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
Cha Eun Sang.

400
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,839
Chan Young!

401
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,710
Yoon Chan Young!

402
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:59,250
What happened?
What are you doing here?

403
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,319
You said you were going somewhere.
Was it the US?

404
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:03,450
What happened to you?
Why didn't you call me?

405
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,720
Didn't you see the reply?
I was worried about you.

406
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,160
- Gosh.
- Sorry. I'll tell you later.

407
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:10,230
I'm relieved now.

408
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,130
I can't believe it, Chan Young.

409
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,759
Look...

410
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,569
What? If you have something
to say, do that inside.

411
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,940
Who is it?

412
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,000
What's up with that shirt?
Where is this place?

413
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,769
Let's go in and say bye first.

414
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,259
Thank you for everything.

415
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,730
I'm going to my friend's house now.

416
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:52,029
- Why?
- What?

417
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,170
Stay here. You only need to
borrow money.

418
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:56,470
Why do you have to go?

419
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,039
I don't have a reason to stay here.

420
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,009
Then how about this for a reason?

421
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,380
You went to the police station
because of my friend.

422
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,279
Because of a policeman
who's watching me,

423
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,050
you were suspected
and your passport was taken.

424
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,349
Because you didn't have a passport,
you couldn't book a hotel or flight.

425
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,420
Really?

426
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,019
You staying here...

427
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,590
isn't troublesome.
It's compensation I must pay you.

428
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,099
So you don't need to go.

429
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,829
Is there a problem?

430
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,170
What if there is?

431
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,670
No. There's no problem.

432
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,909
Even if everything you said is true,
I'm still very grateful to you.

433
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,309
And now I got my passport back.

434
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:39,949
Are you...

435
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,690
Kim Tan?

436
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,590
- Do you know me?
- You know me too.

437
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,590
Who are you?

438
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,329
Did I bully you in middle school?

439
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,260
It's not that simple.

440
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,530
Let's go. The cab is here.

441
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,099
Okay.

442
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,309
Then I'll get going.

443
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:10,380
Bye.

444
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,019
So you've stayed at his house
since then?

445
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,289
What else could I do?

446
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,119
I had no money or passport.

447
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,659
There's no one at Eun Seok's house.

448
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,260
- By the way, is his name Kim Tan?
- Didn't you know?

449
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,699
I didn't ask him.
I didn't want to tell him about me.

450
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:03,030
Is he a bad guy?

451
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,199
Did he bully you?

452
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,139
I just happen to know his name.

453
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,510
He's not a nice guy, though.
Let's go in.

454
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:25,250
So where's Eun Seok?

455
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,690
I don't know where she went.

456
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:30,829
That witch.

457
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,500
What should I tell Mom?

458
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,329
Don't worry about the plane ticket.

459
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,869
Thank you. I'll pay you back
when I go back...

460
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:40,000
Take your time.

461
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:42,369
Thank you.

462
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,369
What time does
the travel agency open?

463
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:46,710
Take your time for that too.

464
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,050
There's only one thing
you must rush now.

465
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:50,349
Choosing the menu.

466
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:52,619
What do you want for dinner?

467
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:56,150
There's something
I want really badly.

468
00:36:58,289 --> 00:36:59,320
Tteokbokki.

469
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:04,460
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's so good.

470
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,360
That's really pretty.

471
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,969
- Let's take a picture.
- Sure.

472
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,500
1, 2, 3.

473
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,739
(Chan Young added 1 new picture.)

474
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,639
Done.

475
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,769
Did you post it on social media?

476
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,940
Yes. To show you something funny.

477
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,679
What is it?

478
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Count to 10.

479
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,780
1, 2, 3...

480
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,050
(Bo Na)

481
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,690
See? Isn't that cute?

482
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,860
Do you want to die?
You really want to see...

483
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,289
Lee Bo Na pulling my hair?

484
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,090
- That will be funny.
- I'll kill you.

485
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,260
Wait. Hello?

486
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,530
Hey. Are you crazy?

487
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,269
Why is Cha Eun Sang there?
What are you doing with her?

488
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,400
I met Cha Eun Sang
and thought about you. What else?

489
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,610
Good times.

490
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,789
Gosh.

491
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,969
It's so annoying.

492
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,489
It's tomorrow.

493
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:22,030
This way, please.

494
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,340
(Tan)

495
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,679
- What?
- Where are you?

496
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,750
Why do you care?

497
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,619
By now, you might've gotten mad...

498
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,349
and packed up to go to Korea.

499
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,989
You're wrong. I'm already in Korea.

500
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
Really?

501
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,860
Then come back to the States.

502
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,110
Take back the luggage again.

503
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,280
And change the flight for tomorrow.

504
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Tomorrow?

505
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:13,519
I don't think he's going to see me
the day after tomorrow.

506
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,059
Just a second.

508
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,630
(Mom)

509
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,099
- Yes. It's me.
- Are you with Tan?

510
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:28,199
Yes, I am.

511
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,400
He got all dressed up to see me.

512
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,610
Then just listen.

513
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,239
I'm going to say
you went to the States...

514
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,110
because Tan wanted you there,
not because you were desperate.

515
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,349
Why do you have to do that?

516
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,550
Bye. Your mother-in-law's coming.

517
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,260
Hello.

518
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,090
I asked you to see me too early
in the morning. You must be tired.

519
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,960
The busy person wanted to see me
at this time. What can I do?

520
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,730
I'm quite tired though.

521
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:06,400
I'm only available at this hour.

522
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:08,199
My.

523
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,110
Every time I see you, you embarrass
me even though I work in fashion.

524
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,179
You gave birth to Tan quite late.

525
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,480
How do you still manage your body
like that?

526
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,079
I was born with it,

527
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,920
and I spend a lot of time
and money for it.

528
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:22,619
I heard Rachel went to the States.

529
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:24,889
She crossed the ocean to see
her fiance...

530
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:26,289
as soon as the break began.

531
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,190
I like that about Rachel.

532
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:32,699
I wanted to see you today because,

533
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,969
as you probably heard,
I'm getting remarried.

534
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:40,139
I thought I should tell you first.

535
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:41,239
I've heard.

536
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,969
It's CEO Choi Dong Wook
of Hotel Zeus, isn't it?

537
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,239
Congratulations.

538
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,280
Thank you.

539
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,440
His son goes to my school too.

540
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,780
Yes, Young Do.

541
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:52,880
I actually wanted to ask you.

542
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:56,590
Did something happen
between Tan and Young Do?

543
00:41:56,989 --> 00:42:00,889
Rachel said they're probably
not friends anymore.

544
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,530
They were best friends...

545
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,829
when Tan went to the States.

546
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:18,010
You opened the door at the important
moment and ruined everything.

547
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,139
It got light in it.

548
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,309
What a waste.

549
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,349
It could've been the next Bresson.

550
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:29,519
"There is nothing in this world..."

551
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:36,559
"that does not have..."

552
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,099
"a decisive moment."

553
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,329
What are you saying? You crazy.

554
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:48,440
That's what your mentor
Henri Cartier Bresson said.

555
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,940
You should at least know who it is.

556
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,250
I'll kill you.

557
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,389
(Father)

558
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:11,829
Yes.

559
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:21,400
It wasn't even the hotel manager.

560
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:23,969
You couldn't even soften up
the kitchen manager...

561
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:25,070
and made him complain?

562
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:28,469
Get up.

563
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,280
Do you want to know
why you always lose?

564
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,050
First, because you've never
beaten me before.

565
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,289
I guess I take after Mom
when I should've taken after you.

566
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:51,829
Second.

567
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,460
You attack unnecessarily a lot.

568
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:58,030
Both in the mat and off the mat.

569
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:02,170
Rachel's coming
the day after tomorrow.

570
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,210
Go pick her up at the airport.

571
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,320
Thank you. I've always wanted it.

572
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,519
Try harder to look like you mean it.

573
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:23,829
You know things that can be bought
with money don't touch us.

574
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:27,659
The gift you gave me today
isn't the clothes, but your time.

575
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:29,829
The time we spent on shopping.

576
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,599
I know you hate shopping.
Thank you for today.

577
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,739
Don't thank me.

578
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,739
I like going shopping with you.

579
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,739
If we do something else,
it will look like a real date.

580
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,710
Did she leave?

581
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,079
Yes, yesterday afternoon.

582
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,250
Did she leave or did you send her?

583
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,650
It went as your scenario.

584
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,489
I know you gave her friend
the address.

585
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:55,889
Stop talking about her.

586
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:57,090
You brought it up.

587
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,199
Hello?

588
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,269
Choi Young Do?

589
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,909
Are you a kid? Can't you come alone?

590
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:19,210
Either change the flight
or live in the US.

591
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,679
Don't make me go pick you up.

592
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,949
And don't make me call you again...

593
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:28,019
for the same problem. Got it?

594
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,969
What a crazy jerk.

595
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,070
Have you heard?

596
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,809
That this scumbag is going
to be my brother.

597
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:45,670
I have.

598
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:49,309
How's Young Do doing?

599
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,309
He's doing well.

600
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,449
Now he's doing what you two
used to do together all alone.

601
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:58,320
It's annoying.

602
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,019
It's our engagement anniversary,
but Choi Young Do ruined it.

603
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:02,929
Let's go eat sweets.

604
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,230
How about your favorite
Melrose pancake place?

605
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:08,929
In American movies,
they pour syrup on pancakes...

606
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:10,730
and have them with orange juice.

607
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,940
That looks totally American.

608
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,969
How tacky.

609
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,510
There's a good pancake place
in Melrose.

610
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,809
Let's go together when we go to LA.

611
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,480
Let's go somewhere else.

612
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,539
Why?

613
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,679
If we go there,
we might run into her.

614
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:25,679
Who?

615
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:29,250
- That witch?
- Yes.

616
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,320
Is it some kind of a fateful hunch?

617
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,590
Do you know how big LA is,
compared to Seoul?

618
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,159
But you're saying
you might run into her there...

619
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:40,300
of all places in this vast LA?

620
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,059
It's just a hunch.

621
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:44,869
Besides, you can't get a table
without a reservation at this hour.

622
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:45,869
Let's go somewhere else.

623
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,599
Let's go and see if she's there.

624
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,610
Now that you've said that,
I want to confirm it.

625
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:17,769
I never thought
she'd really be here.

626
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,969
Chan Young. You're like
an American now.

627
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:22,199
When did you make a reservation?

628
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,210
It's the basic.

629
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:26,280
How do you know this place? Did
you look up good restaurants in LA?

630
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,179
What? Well, yes.

631
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,329
Did you two promise to meet here?

632
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:48,929
Let's go somewhere else.

633
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:50,769
Let's just eat here.

634
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:53,300
I'm trying to keep the least
of common courtesy for you.

635
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,000
You're getting really annoying.

636
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,769
Why is not running into her
common courtesy for me?

637
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,909
Let's go. I want to eat it.

638
00:48:59,909 --> 00:49:01,079
There's no seat.

639
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:05,849
We can always make a seat.

640
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,920
Let's see if it's a coincidence
or destiny.

641
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:16,989
Did you make a reservation?

642
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:18,260
I have someone waiting.

643
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:28,500
You must be White Hacker Yoon.
Let's share the table.

644
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:29,909
We'll pay.

645
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:37,280
Do you know each other?

646
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,550
She's from our school.
As you can see, we're not close.

647
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,119
It's my first time talking to him.

648
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,889
He's an underprivileged student.
I never had to talk to him.

649
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:47,989
Get up.

650
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,429
It's our engagement
anniversary today.

651
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,960
So, Tan.

652
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,599
You may want pancakes.

653
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,699
Sure. Let's eat.

654
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,809
I want it too.

655
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:14,849
What's your relationship?

656
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:16,849
Friends since we were kids.

657
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,650
Is that so? By the way,
how did you come here?

658
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,690
Did you bring her here
since it's famous?

659
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:24,559
No. She wanted to come here.

660
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,730
Gosh. What an amazing coincidence.

661
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,969
It seems like my fiance and she
believe they're meant to be.

662
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,269
What do you think, Chan Young?

663
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:38,739
You said you wanted pancakes.

664
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,010
- Just stop it.
- No one's talking.

665
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,079
Oh, then how about this?

666
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:48,280
You once dated Lee Bo Na. Say hi.

667
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,150
This is Lee Bo Na's
current boyfriend.

668
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,150
This is her ex.

669
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,360
Do you have to talk about
someone who's not even here?

670
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,360
So why are you with her
instead of Lee Bo Na?

671
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,730
It's your fault in the first place.

672
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:03,429
No, maybe it's your fault for seeing
a man who's engaged...

673
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,500
and a man who has a girlfriend,
isn't it?

674
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,309
- Rachel.
- We'll get going first.

675
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,579
Let's go.

676
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,250
What do you want me to do?

677
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,750
Interfere? Or ignore it?

678
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,889
Order. We have to buy
the plane ticket after this.

679
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,429
Stay for a few more days.
You came all the way here anyway.

680
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,300
I should go back.
I'm worried about Mom.

681
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,969
I should go back and work
to pay you back.

682
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:43,440
I told you. You can take time.

683
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,940
Don't give me that look.
We're still in the US.

684
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:54,949
Let this go.

685
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:57,349
You looked pretty cool
in front of her.

686
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,920
- Rachel.
- What?

687
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:02,820
We first met when we were 10.

688
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,690
I thought you were a genius.

689
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:09,869
A 10-year-old talked on the phone
in English and murmured in Japanese.

690
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,599
You had a crush on my brother
when you were 14.

691
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:16,369
You said I was too young for you.

692
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,940
What are you trying to say?

693
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,880
When they were talking about
our engagement, you said...

694
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,150
we obviously wouldn't find
anyone better.

695
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,980
At the time,

696
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:29,280
I realized how clueless I was.

697
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,789
And?

698
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:33,960
For eight years, in my memory,
you were always smart,

699
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,860
pretty and mature. But...

700
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,429
you're terrible right now.

701
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,400
Don't do that.
Especially if it's because of me.

702
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:48,599
It's not worth it
for you to fall for me...

703
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,539
by harming you.

704
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,780
You said you're leaving tomorrow.

705
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:00,320
I'll go to the hotel on time.
See you tomorrow.

706
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:21,940
- Won?
- Rachel?

707
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,369
What are you doing here?

708
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:25,340
I thought you were staying
at Young Do's hotel.

709
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,210
Why would I do anything to owe them?

710
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:30,110
It seems you came here
to avoid them.

711
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:33,949
Yes. I didn't expect to see
you here. It's been a while.

712
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,050
- How have you been?
- Same old same old.

713
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,920
Did you meet Tan?

714
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:43,590
I kind of did. How about you?

715
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,960
I kind of did too.

716
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,360
Are you going somewhere?

717
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,369
Yes. I have some place to go.

718
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:53,639
If it's not an important meeting
or a date,

719
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,139
can I go with you?

720
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,639
You wouldn't like it though.

721
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:58,710
I don't care.

722
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:02,679
It'd be better than wasting my time
on my phone in the room alone.

723
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:05,780
The day is too long here.

724
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:07,949
It makes one without a plan lonely.

725
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:10,320
It's quite far. Will you be okay?

726
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:12,889
That's even better.

727
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,199
Who is it?

728
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:25,829
My mom.

729
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,369
Before she met Father,

730
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:34,110
she was a country girl
who made wine and picked oranges.

731
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,510
Suffocating rich in-laws
and pretentious parties.

732
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,420
Korea was too much for an American
country girl to handle.

733
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,320
And this is how she returned
in the end.

734
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,289
She made wine herself?

735
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,829
In the wine cellar at my house,
there's wine called Won in English.

736
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,099
My mom made it
in the year I was born.

737
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,699
That's wonderful.

738
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,239
Have you ever brought Tan here?

739
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,610
No.

740
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:09,079
You're the first one to come here.
Why do you ask?

741
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:10,650
Tan will be jealous.

742
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:12,949
Of whom? Me?

743
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:14,449
No, me.

744
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,349
I'm glad I followed you.

745
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,320
I'm glad I don't have to
talk alone here, thanks to you.

746
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,429
It's like you just read
someone's diary secretly.

747
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:42,710
Yes.

748
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,210
I'll stay here for a few more days.

749
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,679
Tell the chairman that I'm stopping
over in Singapore.

750
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,289
By the way, I met Tan thanks to you.

751
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,690
And again, tell Tan
about my schedule kindly.

752
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,159
You don't have to worry about it.

753
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:59,289
Private schedule is not my job.

754
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:05,730
Then I will see you at the airport.

755
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,519
Is Young Do picking her up
at the airport?

756
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:24,750
I told him to.

757
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:26,389
He probably hates it.

758
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,119
What can he do about it?

759
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,130
He can't come at me yet.

760
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,630
Don't be so confident.
Kids grow up fast.

761
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:39,900
- Call me.
- Okay.

762
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:46,340
Long time no see.

763
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,940
Yes.

764
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,380
How are you doing?

765
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,809
As good as you.

766
00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:52,650
That's pretty hard.

767
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,780
I heard you're getting engaged.
With that guy?

768
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,780
Yes.

769
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:58,650
20 years ago or now,

770
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:59,820
it's not you.

771
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:02,159
Congratulations on your engagement.

772
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,730
It's strange.

773
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
My heart still races
whenever I see you.

774
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:15,769
I hope it'll be the same
even after remarriage.

775
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:17,239
Take care.

776
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,119
Yes.

777
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,190
Mr. Yoon.

778
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:36,960
Did Won go back to Korea?

779
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,630
He's probably on the way back.

780
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,829
I see. Okay.

781
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:42,599
I heard you met my son.

782
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:45,369
I did?

783
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,670
Who's your son...

784
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:53,010
Oh, I think I did.

785
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:55,840
His name is Chan Young, right?

786
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:58,710
You are Mr. Yoon's son?

787
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:01,579
You remembered.
How did you get my number?

788
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:04,250
You left it in the comment.
Put Eun Sang on the phone.

789
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,420
I'm not with her right now.

790
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,059
Where did she go?

791
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,159
Tell me your business.
I'll tell her.

792
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,360
Are you her lawyer?

793
00:58:10,489 --> 00:58:13,599
I'm going to tell her myself.
Tell her to call me.

794
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:16,969
What's his problem?

795
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,139
What did they say? Nothing?

796
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:24,639
I told them to call me
if they hear from her...

797
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,809
as you taught me.

798
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:27,139
Right. Let's wait.

799
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:28,909
She must have her reasons.

800
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,550
Well...

801
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:36,119
He just called me.
He wants you to call him.

802
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:37,619
He has something to say.

803
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,590
No, I won't.

804
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,699
I won't have to see him again
after tomorrow.

805
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:50,900
What time is the flight tomorrow?

806
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,500
Don't even think about it.

807
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,670
You know how much I wanted
to study abroad?

808
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,110
But if you skip school
in front of me, you're insulting me.

809
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,039
I'm going to the airport alone.

810
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:03,179
Hey. I asked
because I didn't want to go.

811
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:05,179
What? You're so dead.

812
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,550
I'm busy too.

813
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:42,639
It's been like
a midsummer night's dream.

814
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:45,079
I'm going to disappear now.

815
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,949
Like last night's dream. Bye.

816
01:00:55,889 --> 01:00:56,889
Thank you, sir.

817
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:03,559
Let's go.

818
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:06,530
You don't have much time
if you want to shop at duty free.

819
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,340
It's uncomfortable to go with you.

820
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,239
Just bear it. Since I'm hot.

821
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,949
You should go.
Text me when you arrive.

822
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,579
Don't you plan on coming to Korea?

823
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,420
I always do.
I just don't have the courage.

824
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:29,489
You need courage to come to Korea?

825
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:30,789
Yes.

826
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,190
Hasty courage.

827
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:36,130
That's what I need.

828
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:37,929
You should go.

829
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:48,280
I haven't forgiven you yet.

830
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:50,780
I hate you.

831
01:01:58,789 --> 01:01:59,849
I know.

832
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,320
Cha Eun Sang. Stop right there.

833
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,090
Let's say this is
how we introduced ourselves.

834
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,289
You're not even
on the family register.

835
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,329
You can't even give birth.

836
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:16,230
Let's see how well Tan will protect
his mom...

837
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,400
against his brother.

838
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,000
I said you're still mean
and living very well.

839
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,900
Why is the tiger away?

840
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,670
Rescind your brother's exile now.

841
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:26,440
I'm back. What you're worried about
won't happen.

842
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,679
The illegitimate son can't
do anything about it.

843
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:30,309
This is where we're going to live.

844
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:31,550
Are you insane, Mom?

845
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,280
Do you live here?
Did Tan's family move?

846
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,679
Have you gone blind now?

847
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:35,679
I'll go.

848
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,050
Will you? You should earn your keep.

849
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:39,090
I keep seeing a girl's back.

850
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,260
The maid's daughter. She lives here.

851
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:53,099
