00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,679
(The Heirs)

2
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,359
(The Heirs)

3
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,469
What are you doing right now?
Answer me now.

4
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,269
I'm drinking water.

5
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,969
(Episode 5)

6
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,700
What's the fuss about?

7
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,030
I hate how my mom is suffering.

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,270
I hope Jeguk Group goes broke.

9
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,520
It's really her.

10
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:05,960
Cha Eun Sang.

11
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm going to the store.

12
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:53,909
Ms. Park. Coffee.

13
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,810
My goodness.

14
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,810
- What are you doing here?
- I was thirsty.

15
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,750
I guess Ms. Park went to the store.

16
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,379
Why does she always go
in the morning instead of night?

17
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,250
I haven't seen Won for a while.

18
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
What?

19
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,460
He's probably on a business trip.

20
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,759
He spends half of a month
on a business trip.

21
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,930
I thought I'd get to see him
every day in Korea.

22
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:19,230
Gosh. You're such a pushover.

23
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,129
He hates you so much.

24
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,430
But I like him.

25
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,199
I'm going to shower.

26
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,870
What are you doing today?
Shall we go shopping together?

27
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,139
I have a place to go.

28
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,769
Where?

29
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,110
I finished your transfer procedure.

30
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,350
Don't even think about

31
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,779
being a scumbag
like when you were in middle school.

32
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,649
- I don't give a break.
- Yes.

33
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,389
Whose decision was it
to bring you back to Korea?

34
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,889
Was it the chairman or your mom?

35
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,360
- It was my own decision.
- Is that so?

36
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,889
You're all grown up now.

37
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,829
You kicked your brother out
as soon as you arrived.

38
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:53,930
Your brother left the house.

39
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,769
Let's eat.

40
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,810
I'm busy from now.

41
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,980
You have 20 minutes.

42
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,110
Gosh.

43
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,689
I found something interesting while
I was on a business trip to the US.

44
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,430
What's this?

45
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,089
The wishbone.

46
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,000
Americans like it.

47
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,930
Two people hold each end
and pull it.

48
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,829
The person's wish with a longer
side will come true.

49
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,899
It's like Ssangssangba.

50
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,339
What's that?

51
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,970
Ice cream you can get at a store.

52
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,879
Hold the other side for me
when I have a wish, okay?

53
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,310
You don't have one now?

54
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:41,680
No.

55
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,910
How can you not have a wish?

56
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,350
I graduated from college.
I have my own room.

57
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,790
I'm also saving up.

58
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,990
Instead of a wish,
let's go with a luck.

59
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
A real gift.

60
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,600
Wear it for luck.

61
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,399
I grew up my entire life
with your family's support.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,839
Now I have my own job
and make enough to support myself.

63
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,240
- So...
- Support?

64
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,579
Why can't something from me...

65
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,610
just be a gift?

66
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,079
I should go. I'll get fired
if I'm late for tutoring.

67
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,250
Then should I throw this out?

68
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:25,959
Okay. I'll take it. Thank you.

69
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,430
You're not going to wear it,
are you?

70
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,160
Then I'll put it on for you.

71
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,160
- Do I look good?
- Yes.

72
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,329
Why is it so hard to put
a necklace on you?

73
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,750
You have a guest in your room.

74
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:35,589
It's me. What time
did Father get here?

75
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,930
What do you mean?

76
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,329
Didn't my father come
to the hotel I'm staying at?

77
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,569
He's at home.

78
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,170
I just left there after seeing him.

79
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,209
I'll call you back.

80
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,509
Who's my guest?

81
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:55,949
He said he's your brother.

82
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,420
Does this hotel let strangers
in the room without permission?

83
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,920
But Chairman Kim called us himself.

84
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:03,920
Did he call you himself...

85
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,889
to unlock the door to my room?

86
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,430
Yes.

87
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,610
Who did you meet
that you haven't had dinner?

88
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,210
Look at the time.

89
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,009
It's good. Did you make all this?

90
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,480
I asked her to make all this.

91
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,250
How did you ask her to
make only the good dishes?

92
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,549
I'll ask her to cook every day.

93
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,259
Is the girl who lives here
her daughter?

94
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,000
Who? Eun Sang?

95
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,129
Yes. Poor girl.

96
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,899
So I'm nice to her.

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,340
When did she start living here?

98
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,100
She's been working here
for three years,

99
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,809
and they've moved in
not that long ago.

100
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,679
Luckily, her daughter can speak.

101
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,009
I don't know if she's home.

102
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:35,850
Eun Sang.

103
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
Yes.

104
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,179
You need to fetch some wine.

105
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,120
Where are you? Come here.

106
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,730
Yes. Did you call me?

107
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,500
Yes. In the cellar...

108
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,230
Where did he go?

109
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,070
Who?

110
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,169
Never mind. Go get wine
from the cellar. Anything's fine.

111
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,240
Yes.

112
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,279
Where did he go?

113
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,049
It's strange.

114
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,519
My heart still races
whenever I see you.

115
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,389
One more, please.

116
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,259
Make that two.

117
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,070
I'm going to sit here.
Think of it as working overtime.

118
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,299
I guess the person waiting for you
in the hotel was Tan.

119
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,379
You're close to Tan.

120
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,620
When Tan grows up and starts
working, you'll be working with him.

121
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,389
Are you going to leave the company
to him when he grows up?

122
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,129
You never fall for it
when you're sober or drunk.

123
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,940
Mr. Kim.

124
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,509
- Mr. Choi.
- I've called you so many times.

125
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,220
My business trip to the US
was very long.

126
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,279
Speaking of which.

127
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:28,250
I asked you to stay in my hotel,
but you rejected it.

128
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,190
The farm was in the countryside
near Modesto.

129
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,919
It was too far from the hotel.

130
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,389
Long time no see.
I met Rachel in the US.

131
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,000
I heard.

132
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,730
Are my in-laws doing well?

133
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,299
Thanks to you.

134
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,029
Who's your company?

135
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,639
He's the Chief Secretary
of my company.

136
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,309
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Jae Ho.

137
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:52,009
It seems you two were
just drinking casually.

138
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:55,009
Why don't we have a drink together?

139
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,720
Because Europe economy collapsed,

140
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,789
the Indian market is bad.

141
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,889
Which region have you
been considering lately?

142
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:11,460
I think I can have hope
in the south of Sahara in Africa.

143
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,500
But Chief Secretary Yoon here is
constantly against it.

144
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,730
Like the precedent
of BRICS countries,

145
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,700
those areas have a high possibility
of bubbles...

146
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,299
"No. It's dangerous."

147
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,340
That's what inferiors always say.

148
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,740
They're not ambitious.
They don't want adventures.

149
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,809
None of them is positive.

150
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,120
"No. It's dangerous."

151
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,120
For employees, saying that means
being ambitious and adventurous.

152
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,960
I'm sorry, but if you excuse me,
I have to make a call.

153
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,230
My son is waiting.

154
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,639
It's Chief Secretary Yoon, right?
Anyways.

155
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,070
What exactly is his position
in the company?

156
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,909
If you're going to talk about
the rank, excuse me.

157
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,639
Animal Kingdom is no fun.

158
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,909
Who does he think he is?

159
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,820
He upsets me and makes me angry.

160
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,919
Sometimes he even hurts me.

161
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,090
He's more than capable
of doing that to you.

162
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,919
He's a Chief Secretary.

163
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,389
How can he do that?

164
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:18,559
I don't know how.

165
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,769
Stop nagging. I won't be late.

166
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,200
Okay. Bye.

167
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:30,769
As you saw, CEO Choi
isn't a gentleman.

168
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,379
Sorry.

169
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:33,909
Me too.

170
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,509
About what?

171
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,169
Next is number 13.

172
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:03,070
The world's most famous sidewalk
is also in Hollywood.

173
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,779
It's about Hollywood.

174
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,279
What's the answer?

175
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,750
- Number 3.
- Number 3.

176
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,809
That's right.

177
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,379
In this question,

178
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,149
both "was" and "placed" are
in the past tense.

179
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:19,889
Can Cha Eun Sang
who's spacing out...

180
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,159
answer it?

181
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,690
Past passive.

182
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,460
I was going to scold her.

183
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,070
That's it for today.

184
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,370
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

185
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,299
Good job.

186
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,409
Are you not feeling well?

187
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,210
I moved, so it takes two hours
to school from home.

188
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,210
Wake me up when the teacher is here.

189
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,649
My goodness.

190
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,549
My.

191
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,019
What's going on?

192
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,889
He's so cool.

193
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,159
What is it?

194
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,889
He's really hot.

195
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,980
Gosh, he's so hot!

196
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,049
Will you push the girl
who looks like...

197
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,759
she has healthy kidneys?

198
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,400
You look pretty glad to see me.

199
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,839
Did you think about me a lot?

200
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,140
I'm not glad. I'm surprised.

201
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,279
What are you doing here?
Did you come to Korea?

202
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
As you can see.

203
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,009
I know someone in this school.
I'm here to see her.

204
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,779
I'm looking at her right now.

205
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,789
What's your business?

206
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,990
I have a question.

207
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,390
Why do you have so many...

208
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,759
It's not about you.

209
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,390
Then?

210
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,029
Give me Yoon Chan Young's
number in Korea.

211
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:38,630
- Why Chan Young?
- I got interested in him.

212
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,059
- So why?
- Why do you think I'm interested?

213
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,529
Because he's pretty.

214
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,839
I can't get him out of my head.

215
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,009
What the...
Give up. He has a girlfriend.

216
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:50,910
You know her. Your ex Lee Bo Na.

217
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,039
I'll get going first.
I'm quite busy.

218
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,049
You better stop.

219
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,349
I told you to stop.

220
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,319
Stop, will you?

221
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,539
Enjoy.

222
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,369
(Chan Young)

223
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,579
I'm working.

224
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,750
You have time for social media
when you're working?

225
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,910
- What's that picture?
- Picture?

226
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,779
Hang up.

227
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,690
Kim Tan is very handsome.

228
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,529
Seriously.

229
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,099
What? This is here.

230
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,039
You still haven't logged out yet?

231
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,079
You think you would?

232
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,440
- You punk.
- What?

233
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,680
Whatever. Don't.

234
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,980
I'll just delete the account.

235
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,849
I'll order.

236
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,690
You have to order
in the front counter.

237
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,230
Please do it for me.

238
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,930
I'll have Yoon Chan Young's number.

239
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,029
Make it ice.

240
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,900
Fine. I'll just tell you
and get rid of you.

241
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,339
Here. Take it and leave.

242
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,609
Didn't you say in the US you didn't
remember his new number?

243
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,779
You memorized it already?

244
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,309
What are you doing?

245
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,750
Yoon Chan Young?

246
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,220
Yes. It's Kim Tan.
I need to ask you something.

247
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,650
- Hey.
- What's Cha Eun Sang's number?

248
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,660
If I could ask her myself,
I wouldn't be calling you.

249
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,059
Why can't you tell me?

250
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,660
Eun Sang just gave me your number...

251
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,200
Chan Young. Sorry.
I'll call you back.

252
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,599
What do you think you're doing?

253
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:02,769
You thanked me every time in the US,
but you changed in Korea.

254
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,009
I thought I should know.
I might have to call you someday.

255
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,079
Why would we call each other?

256
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,220
Who knows?

257
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,789
Like, "Look upstairs"
or "Turn around".

258
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,759
What are you talking about?

259
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,759
Are you curious?

260
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,130
Hey.

261
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,000
What are you doing?

262
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:35,410
To tell you what I just said later.

263
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,309
I'm logging out
of your social media.

264
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,009
Now we're even.

265
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:43,950
- Bye.
- How does that make us even?

266
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,450
You better stop.

267
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,049
I told you to stop.

268
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,319
Stop, will you?

269
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,059
I'll call you later.
I need to go meet someone now.

270
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,970
How long are you staying in Korea?

271
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,700
Why? Do you want me to stay?

272
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,940
I want to take you out
before you go back.

273
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:10,069
It's like you're stopping me.

274
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,750
That little...

275
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,089
You go grocery shopping yourself?

276
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,460
It's the single daddy's
schedule at 7:30pm.

277
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,529
I went to the hotel,

278
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,630
but I couldn't meet Won.

279
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,940
Maybe he knew I was there.

280
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,069
Mr. Kim isn't an easy man.

281
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,680
I'm sorry. It must be troublesome
for you between us.

282
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,180
It's not.

283
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,980
I'm not exactly an obedient man
either.

284
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,819
I don't know what I should do.

285
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,720
Of course, you don't.
Since it's not your fault.

286
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,319
It's not his fault either.

287
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,230
Right. It's the chairman's fault.

288
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,230
Dad should've heard it.

289
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,000
Please don't.
Chan Young's still in high school.

290
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:17,569
I'm jealous that
he has you as his dad.

291
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:21,140
I bet Chan Young's jealous that
you have the chairman as your dad.

292
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:23,849
You think so?

293
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,490
I'm home.

294
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:35,589
Right.

295
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,799
You should continue.

296
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,069
- Show me what you brought.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,849
I have only two children,

298
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,920
but what's wrong with them?

299
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,589
What does she do these days?

300
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,059
She tutors in Gangnam area.

301
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,230
Gosh.

302
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:20,599
This needs an explanation.

303
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,470
It didn't seem like
an intentional approach.

304
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,369
It was a coincidence in the US.

305
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,079
Cha Eun Sang stayed
at your son's house for a few days.

306
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,250
Stayed?

307
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:31,210
Just the two of them?

308
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,220
Yes.

309
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,049
That's from today in the afternoon.

310
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,089
Gosh.

311
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,289
I'm ashamed to see you.

312
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,829
I didn't raise my children well.

It is you. Hey, Kim Tan.

Do you know me?

Did I bully you by any chance?

You don't remember me?

00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,829
Of course I do.
It's my way of saying hi.

How have you been doing,

323
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,440
You scared me.

324

I know I got hot after puberty,

325

if you didn't recognize me.

Yes. As you can see, I'm jetlagged.

- Are you going to school?
- School?

329
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,789
Gosh.

330
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:52,019
As you can see, I'm getting
used to going back to school.

331
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:53,089
You didn't move, did you?

332
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,190
- Move?
- Some kid was...

333
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:58,359
Never mind. As long as
you didn't move.

334
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,730
Talk to you later.

335
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,200
I'll be busy.

336
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,180
What?

337
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:16,880
What are you doing here?

338
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,420
Oh, Cha Eun Sang.

339
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,490
I didn't expect to see you here.

340
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,390
Did you have a good dream
last night?

341
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,759
What are you doing here?

342
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,559
How did you know I live here?

343
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,430
Oh, you live here?

344
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,730
You shouldn't be here. Follow me.

345
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,799
There are surveillance cameras
by the door.

346
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,809
Why are you running away?

347
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,240
It's a bad time.

348
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,539
I might run into the second son
of this family.

349
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,309
He comes home at this hour.

350
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,450
Oh, the very handsome second son?

351
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,589
You can keep dragging me.

352
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,630
Do you...

353
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:06,259
live around here?
Your house in Korea.

354
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,599
Yes.

355
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,769
Which one?

356
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,630
Why? Do you want to know
where I live?

357
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,170
You'll be surprised.

358
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,369
Forget it.

359
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,710
I was wondering
if the word got out.

360
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,769
What word?

361
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,410
I'm telling you
before you take it wrong.

362
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,279
Since you saw everything in the US,

363
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,920
you're probably wondering
why I walked out of that house.

364
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,980
I'm not.

365
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,619
I'm curious about something else.

366
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,650
What else?

367
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,920
When are you going to take me out?

368
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,529
- When it's time.
- When is that time?

369
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,900
Don't you say when it's appropriate.

370
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,069
You said you'd call me,

371
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
but you didn't.

372
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,710
You were waiting for my call?

373
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,640
Bye. I'm late.

374
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:08,589
Hey.

375
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,089
Lee Bo Na.

376
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,130
What's wrong with him?

377
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,000
- Don't be surprised.
- Don't block the way.

378
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,170
Kim Tan's in Korea.

379
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:20,900
A decisive moment.

380
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:23,670
You better be nervous.

381
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,680
What are you doing?

382
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:31,920
What? Oh, I was singing in my mind.

383
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,049
What did he say?

384
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:34,250
Kim Tan's in Korea.

385
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,319
Who?

386
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,019
Oh, the boy you met in LA?

387
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,859
What was the song I was singing
in my mind?

388
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,990
I'm frustrated
because I can't remember it.

389
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,859
I'll go ask Ye Sol. Okay?

390
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,299
What is it?

391
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,000
"Lie" by g.o.d? "Lie" by BigBang?

392
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:50,400
"Lie" by T-ARA?

393
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,339
Lee Bo Na.

394
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:00,109
Hey, Rachel.

395
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,579
- What?
- Is Kim Tan in Korea?

396
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,819
Myung Soo said he saw him.

397
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,759
What if he is?

398
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,890
Stop minding my fiance
and focus on Yoon Chan Young.

399
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:18,759
He was playing
with some other girl in the US.

400
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,500
It's not some other girl.
It's a friend.

401
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,799
My boyfriend always calls me
and tells me everything.

402
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,200
I know everything about him.
Unlike your fiance.

403
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,769
You know so well about Kim Tan.

404
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,369
Is that how he was like
when he dated you?

405
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:30,210
Why do you bring up the past?

406
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,079
So is he in Korea or what?

407
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,440
What do you care?

408
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,980
It doesn't hurt you to tell me.

409
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,079
I'm worried
he'll push Chan Young out.

410
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,420
If I get dumped, I'm going to
use all my money...

411
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,519
to take revenge on you.

412
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,069
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the beep.

413
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,710
Move.

414
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,480
Is it true that Kim Tan's back?

415
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,589
Why is everyone asking me?
It's so annoying.

416
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:17,920
Get out of my way.

417
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,400
I see.
My sister doesn't know either.

418
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,859
That's why you're annoyed.

419
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,599
Seeing you're sarcastic,
I guess his coming back bugs you.

420
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,369
What? Are you afraid
that your place will be taken?

421
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:36,940
I'm worried I might not get to see
him when I miss him.

422
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,410
That my friend might avoid me.

423
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,220
(Tan)

424
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,819
The friend you miss...

425
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,750
is in Korea.

426
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,289
Yes, it's me.

427
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:55,859
Did you call?

428
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:58,700
- Where are you?
- I'm back in Korea.

429
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,359
If that's why you called,
now you know. I'm hanging up.

430
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,440
What time? Okay. See you later.

431
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,809
I'm going to see him after school.
Do you have any word for him?

432
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,380
I don't think you will see him.

433
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,849
But if you do, ask him for me...

434
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:21,750
if his mother is doing well.

435
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,859
Ms. Park.

436
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,329
How long have you been
working in my house?

437
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,769
Sit down for a second.

438
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:56,150
Nam Yoon. It's a misunderstanding.

439
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,720
She misunderstood it.

440
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,519
I can explain. Listen to me.

441
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,960
Sure. Go ahead.

442
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,970
He asked me how long
I've been working here.

443
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,470
3 years. It's 3 years.

444
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,900
She's very good at her job.

445
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,410
But she keeps saying two years.
How can you be mistaken?

446
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,039
- Why do you ask?
- What else?

447
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,450
The madams in this house
have a bad temper...

448
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,509
that people quit before one year.

449
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,720
I'm grateful Ms. Park is
working for a long time. That's why.

450
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:30,849
That's true.

451
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,529
How old is your daughter?

452
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,160
Grade 11.

453
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:42,470
She must've been lonely
without her father.

454
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,470
I wonder if she's smart.

455
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,200
I don't know about that.

456
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,470
Write it down.

457
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,039
She always ranks within fifth
in her class...

458
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,079
Really?

459
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,349
You have a smart daughter.

460
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,990
Despite the poor environment,
she does her job and helps her mom.

461
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,490
As you know,

462
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:11,130
my foundation has a few schools.

463
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,099
How about transferring
your daughter to Jeguk High School?

464
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,599
Pardon?

465
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:21,869
Take it as a gift for my gratitude.

466
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:26,880
When the situation is difficult,
kids need to have a dream.

467
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,109
Nam Yoon.

468
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,029
What? Transfer?

469
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:45,329
Look at you.

470
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,730
You said it was hard to come to
school since you moved.

471
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,430
Still, how could you do that?

472
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,970
How can you notify
the transfer all of a sudden?

473
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,910
Your mother just came by
and got the transfer documents.

474
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,109
My mom?

475
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:59,680
Isn't it hard to transfer to Jeguk
High School without connection?

476
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,980
How did you get a chance?

477
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,049
Jeguk High School? Me?

478
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:07,079
I'm transferring?
To Jeguk High School?

479
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,889
What on earth is going on?

480
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,849
The chairman is being considerate.

481
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,059
We would never get a chance
like this again.

482
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:15,219
Mom. Are you crazy?

483
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,929
How can you make such a decision
without discussing with me?

484
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,260
Don't you know how much
that school costs?

485
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,800
You don't only pay for lunch
and school supporting fee.

486
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,769
We can't even afford to buy
the uniform. How can I transfer?

487
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,670
Find out how much the uniform is.

488
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,369
I'll manage to pay for it
no matter what.

489
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,340
What can you do?

490
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,280
You can't even get
a deposit anymore.

491
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,380
I'm sick and tired.

492
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,409
Let's stop wasting our energy
on a nonsense.

493
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,780
I'm not going to transfer.
Give me the documents.

494
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,550
That hurts.

495
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,059
Why not go there?

496
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,230
Other people are desperate
to go there.

497
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:54,300
You can't go to college
with what we have.

498
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,030
If you're going to have
high school education only,

499
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,630
get Jeguk High School diploma,

500
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,099
and say you used to be rich,
but Dad's business went broke.

501
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,940
That way, people will
look down on you less.

502
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
Mom.

503
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,449
The chairman is asking for you.

504
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,820
Let's talk about it later.

505
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,690
No, he wants to talk to Eun Sang.

506
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,719
Me?

507
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:26,260
Did your mother tell you?

508
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,460
Yes.

509
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,170
Thank you so much for your offer,

510
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,869
but it's beyond my means...

511
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:36,739
Don't decide your means
indiscreetly.

512
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,579
While others are
flying high and far,

513
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:44,349
are you going to spend your youth...

514
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:48,619
in the small and dark maid room
according to the means you decided?

515
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:52,989
Jeguk High School even selects
scholarship students...

516
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,889
and sends them abroad to study.

517
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,329
Study abroad?

518
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:03,130
The selection criteria are
not always about the grades.

519
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,170
Important criteria are usually
things that are unseen.

520
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,369
It's an adult's job,

521
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:14,739
who has a little more fortune,
to protect a young's dream.

522
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,010
You may leave it to me.

523
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,530
Come here.

524
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,369
Did you eat?

525
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,639
Why aren't you answering?

526
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:46,079
When will you start talking?

527
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,539
You're home.

528
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:50,880
I didn't prepare dinner
because I heard you have a plan.

529
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:53,449
A plan?

530
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,519
The car is ready.
Come out when you are.

531
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,989
I don't know my own plan.

532
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,099
Am I having dinner with you?

533
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:13,170
Stop playing smart and come on time.
I hate waiting.

534
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:20,380
I'll go on my own. You may go home.

535
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,650
He said no bike...

536
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,449
If I tell him to bite, he bites.

537
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,750
Yes, sir.

538
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,619
See you later.

539
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:39,360
My father treats you better than me.

540
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,130
Should I act like you then?

541
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,969
Your dad is unusually very late.

542
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,710
He's always sharp on time.

543
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:51,440
I don't know which dad
she's talking about.

544
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,679
I guess your real dad is
sharp on time.

545
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,460
I bought it when I went to the pet
store in the department store.

546
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:09,429
I noticed that you have a dog
when I went to your house.

547
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,730
I heard you adore him.

548
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:19,840
Do you like it?

549
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,739
When did you come to my house?

550
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,380
For a short moment
to pick your dad up.

551
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,550
Do you like dogs?

552
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:34,619
I do.

553
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:35,889
Have you kept him for a long time?

554
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,150
Yes.

555
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:40,760
Since I was in middle school
when my mom left,

556
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,360
and my dad dated those women.

557
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Women?

558
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,860
I bought that dog with the money
the women my dad was dating gave me.

559
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,230
Since he was a smart pedigree dog,

560
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,539
I tried to train him to bite them
whenever they came to my house,

561
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:55,710
and he really did.

562
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:57,369
How can I not like him?

563
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:58,909
That's enough.

564
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,909
He doesn't bite one with no shares.

565
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:03,849
You may add some if you're sad.

566
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:04,980
Stop it.

567
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,820
Sorry I'm late. Anything I say
would be an excuse.

568
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,119
So let's just eat.

569
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,059
Too bad.

570
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,760
Young Do has a plan,
so he can't eat with us.

571
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,329
What plan?

572
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,170
Don't you know what comes first?

573
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,400
It's something we can't postpone.
I have to go there too.

574
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,710
What are you doing?
We're going to be late.

575
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,610
Excuse me.

576
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,590
I like it so much.

577
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,760
What do you know?
It's turned into a date.

578
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:56,929
Then instead of a mom,

579
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,730
I'll be a woman.

580
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
Wine?

581
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:11,449
You can't just leave.

582
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,119
- Then?
- Since I saved you, give me a ride.

583
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,380
I don't have a car.
I came with my mom.

584
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,349
- Where are you going?
- To get a new uniform.

585
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,760
Because I've been growing fast.

586
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,530
- Do you really want a ride?
- Give me a helmet already.

587
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,269
You're always beyond my expectation.

588
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,480
Don't tell me to hold on tight
because I'm not going to.

589
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,750
It's expensive
because it's all handmade.

590
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,989
That school is on another level.

591
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,389
Still, how can a school uniform
cost 1,000 dollars?

592
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:53,659
It's 998 dollars.

593
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,590
Summer uniform is cheaper.
488 dollars.

594
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,590
I see.

595
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:32,699
- You don't avoid me?
- I have no reason to.

596
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,630
You must be insane.
No reason to avoid me?

597
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:38,570
Even though Kim Tan's in Korea
as I predicted?

598
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:45,440
It seems you knew he's in Korea.

599
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,909
This is why I warned you
in the States.

600
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:50,449
What don't you get?

601
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:55,449
Are you done? Then it's my turn.

602
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,590
Don't move.

603
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:57,789
What?

604
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,130
What did you just do?
Are you insane?

605
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,829
Don't you remember
what happened in the plane?

606
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,059
You took my name, address,
phone number and everything.

607
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,369
But I'm taking only your name.

608
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,199
Call me if you want it back.
You know my number.

609
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,170
Hey.

610
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,380
Stop right there.

611
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,449
Who are you?
Her supporter or something?

612
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,019
Why did you just let her go?

613
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,190
It seems you lost.

614
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,420
- Move.
- Just admit defeat...

615
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,460
and go buy the uniform, will you?

616
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,960
Go home on your own.
I think I've got another plan.

617
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,289
- What?
- Let me ask you a few things.

618
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,960
What's your relationship
with Kim Tan?

619
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,289
Nothing.

620
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,130
What about with Yoo Rachel?

621
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:16,099
Nothing at all.

622
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:17,670
Then why did you take that from her?

623
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:20,469
Why did she take your name,
address and phone number?

624
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:22,099
What's that got to do with you?

625
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,570
There seems to be
a misunderstanding.

626
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,909
You think I'm asking nicely?

627
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,980
Is that part of your question?

628
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:34,619
Answer at least one
of them properly.

629
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,690
It seems we're on the same side.

630
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,320
We only met a few minutes ago.

631
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,829
Are you sure? I've seen you before.

632
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:44,389
Where?

633
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,460
If I tell you,
will you see me again?

634
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,460
- No.
- Why not?

635
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,460
What?

636
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,329
The person who can upset
Yoo Rachel in such a short time.

637
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,000
I've never met anyone other than me.

638
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:54,539
That's a very rare talent, so...

639
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:55,599
I'm sorry,

640
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,309
but I don't want to get involved
with you guys. Will you move?

641
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,610
You couldn't go because of me?

642
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,809
You sure you just didn't go?

643
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,980
Gosh. Am I blocking this wide road
all alone?

644
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:09,820
Gosh. Amazing.

645
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:14,719
Should I get your number
from Rachel?

646
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:37,409
Yes, it's me. Can you see me
after school tomorrow?

647
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:39,750
Give me your account number.

648
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,949
I feel anxious to have
a lot of money in my account.

649
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:44,420
Goodness. I'll text you later.

650
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,760
What happened to your social media?

651
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,820
Did it get hacked?
You want me to resolve it?

652
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,530
Not that. Resolve something else.

653
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,590
Give me information
on Jeguk High School.

654
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,730
My school? What information?

655
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,829
What if I go to Jeguk High School?

656
00:44:58,199 --> 00:44:59,329
What are you talking about?

657
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:02,769
The chairman of the house my mom
works at will transfer me there.

658
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,809
My mom was so excited that she
transferred me without telling me.

659
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,380
Really?

660
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,679
What's that reaction?
It's your school.

661
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,750
What about you?
Do you want to go there?

662
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,619
Honestly, I was jealous of you
going to that school.

663
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,159
Its name explains everything.

664
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:28,360
He wants to send me there and help
me become more than what I am now.

665
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,699
There's no reason not to go.

666
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,710
Do you think I'm not allowed
to desire it?

667
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,510
Who says you can't?

668
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,440
You really think so?

669
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,010
A lot of things might fall apart
or change.

670
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,690
Of course, I can't deny
that it's a bigger world.

671
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,519
Welcome, Eun Sang.

672
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,190
It sounds like a permission.

673
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,159
Thanks, Chan Young.

674
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,780
(Kim Tan)

675
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:39,739
("The Great Gatsby")

676
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:43,110
To celebrate
Tan and Bo Na's 22nd day.

677
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,739
Love, Bo Na.

678
00:46:56,849 --> 00:47:00,059
Yes, it's me. I just sent you
the plane ticket price.

679
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,260
I couldn't give you interest. Sorry.

680
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,860
Now it's really goodbye to the US.

681
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,670
It's been like
a midsummer night's dream.

682
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,039
I'm going to disappear now.

683
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,880
Like last night's dream. Bye.

684
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,320
(I'm going to disappear now.
Like last night's dream. Bye.)

685
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,389
Again? How can I go again?

686
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,119
The US is too far
from the maid room.

687
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:42,530
I'll hang up now.
I'll call you again.

688
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,400
Is this family not worried
about the electricity bill?

689
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:23,340
They left all the lights on again.

690
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:29,179
(Kim Tan)

691
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,320
- Hello?
- Hello, Sidney.

692
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:42,119
Is this why you got my number?
It's not scary at all.

693
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:44,090
Look upstairs.

694
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,260
What upstairs? Where?

695
00:48:57,909 --> 00:48:58,940
Turn around.

696
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,900
What are you doing here?

697
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:56,630
Think.

698
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,949
Are you...

699
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:20,320
the second son?

700
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:22,789
Yes.

701
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:26,900
Are you...

702
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,400
the second son of Jeguk Group?

703
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:33,030
Yes.

704
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:40,610
Then when I ran into you
by the entrance, did you know...

705
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,309
I was living here?

706
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:46,719
Yes.

707
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,849
Did you know...

708
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:56,190
I was living in the maid room...

709
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:58,690
in this house?

710
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:05,099
Yes.

711
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,110
Cha Eun Sang.

712
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,719
Did I...

713
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:25,320
miss you?

714
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:24,250
I'm going in.

715
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,420
What's that?

716
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,050
Jeguk High School uniform.

717
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,519
Father told you to go to school
from tomorrow.

718
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:34,920
You must do well at school.

719
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,530
You should take over the school.

720
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,690
- You want me to be a bully?
- In terms of studying.

721
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:43,670
The maid's daughter always ranks
within fifth.

722
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,030
She's transferring
to your school too.

723
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,800
Are you going to lose to her?
You're the landlord's son.

724
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,440
- What?
- Eun Sang.

725
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,610
Your father was being nosy
to do a good deed.

726
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,449
If you see her at school,
ignore her.

727
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,420
Don't even say hi to anyone
who's not in the same league as you.

728
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,579
Cha Eun Sang...

729
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,090
is transferring
to Jeguk High School?

730
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:28,440
As the prosecutors work
on the investigation,

731
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,539
my stocks are worthless.

732
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,679
- How much is the loss?
- Two million?

733
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:34,320
- Two million?
- Yours hit the ceiling yesterday.

734
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:36,250
I think it will stay like that
until today.

735
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:38,019
But I'll have to see
when the market is closed.

736
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,039
How poor, you man?

737
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,550
Can you shut up?

738
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:09,050
How can you compare minor 27 and 23?

739
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,119
How dare you speak to me like that?

740
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,519
Wait for a month.

741
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:15,320
When the new car comes out next
month, I'm going to kick your ass.

742
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,690
That's funny.

743
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,460
Oh, my gosh.

744
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,730
Why is she not wearing
our school uniform?

745
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,329
- She wasn't here.
- Isn't she?

746
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:26,699
Who cares?

747
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:31,239
Hey. What are you doing here?

748
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:32,340
Are you on a field trip?

749
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,340
I transferred.

750
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,880
What? Transfer?

751
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:37,250
No way.
How can you come to my school...

752
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:40,380
Transfer? Aren't you here
to give back my name tag?

753
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,989
- What does your family do?
- What does your family do?

754
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:48,219
- Who's she?
- A transfer student.

755
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,389
I can't believe it.

756
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,559
Who is this new face?

757
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,059
A transfer student.
I still can't believe it.

758
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,469
Oh, a transfer student? Hi.

759
00:54:57,469 --> 00:55:00,099
I'm the clear water of
Jeguk High School, Jo Myung Soo.

760
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:02,039
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm...

761
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:03,469
What? Is he back in Korea?

762
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:04,670
Is he really back?

763
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,309
He's in uniform.
Maybe he's coming to school.

764
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,880
He's really back.

765
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:10,949
What is it?

766
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,320
Is it... No way.

767
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,389
I guess it is.

768
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:18,920
He came to school?

769
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,719
I should go look for Young Do.

770
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:23,460
What's wrong?
Who are you talking about?

771
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:45,750
Long time no see.

772
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,860
You don't need to stare at me like
that. Everyone knows we're engaged.

773
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:58,489
My ex's current boyfriend.
What's your deal?

774
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,130
Employee benefit?

775
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,530
Right. That's who he is.

776
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:17,309
Lucifer appeared in the school
of Satans.

777
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,650
It's going to be fun.

778
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,389
Hey. Move.

779
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:22,710
Choi Young Do. Listen...

780
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,309
You met already.

781
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,750
I missed you, buddy.

782
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:33,559
Welcome.

783
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:34,789
Relax.

784
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:36,420
I won't do anything right now.

785
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,590
Let's only say hi.

786
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,630
They'll be scared.

787
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,309
Chan Young. Where are you?

788
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,880
I'm at school...

789
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:55,340
There's a strict class system here.

790
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,940
- Class?
- Which one are you?

791
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,440
- Sit elsewhere.
- Now I finally feel like eating.

792
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,639
Eat a lot, transfer student.

793
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,139
Transfer back to your old school.

794
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,150
Arrogant witch.

795
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,679
Don't make people talk
about you and Tan together.

796
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,579
You wouldn't believe it,
but that's what I want.

797
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:09,619
Did you cry?

798
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:10,619
Can you act like you don't know me?

799
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:11,619
Stay next to me.

800
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:13,519
- This is my second son.
- I didn't come on purpose.

801
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:16,460
Look what happens when you move
without knowing better.

802
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,860
Don't you know that we must not
be seen together?

803
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,989
Am I Rapunzel?

804
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,500
A chance to leave
before I tell everyone...

805
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,530
you're a concubine's child.

806
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,000
I guess we can't be friends.

807
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:36,079
(The Heirs)
