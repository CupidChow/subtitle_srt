00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,300
(The Heirs)

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,300
(Episode 14)

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,619
Open the door.

5
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,649
Before I kill you, open it!

6
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,090
Open the door, Choi Young Do.

7
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,119
Open it.

8
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,520
You're going to die in my hands
if I open the door myself.

9
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:53,689
Open it!

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,390
When I said I was going to bother
everyone but you,

11
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,500
it included Kim Tan,

12
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,239
and myself, of course.

13
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,019
Cha Eun Sang, get out.

14
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,260
Please don't.

15
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:53,590
Don't come in.

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,590
Where do you dare put your hands,
you crazy punk?

17
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,730
How far are you going to go?

18
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:05,200
How much do I have to hold it in?

19
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,099
I told you not to bother
Cha Eun Sang out of all people.

20
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,669
You should let go of her. That's
the only way I won't bother her.

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,870
I warned you.

22
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:17,909
To not protect Cha Eun Sang.

23
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,479
Why do you not listen to people?

24
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,449
I'm so sick of this.

25
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:31,960
So what? Do you want to go
until the end?

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,430
I should. I came this far.

27
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,030
Just to win against a guy like you,

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,870
I lost my chance to have my last
meal with my mom.

29
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,000
That's why I want to kill myself
whenever I see you.

30
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,669
So how can I end this fight?

31
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,180
Stop whining.

32
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,610
How many more chances
do I have to give you?

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,479
Don't act like you're a grownup.

34
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,520
It makes me want to throw up.

35
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,060
Even when you hurt me,

36
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,490
when you humiliated my mom,

37
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,629
and even when your mom left,

38
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,860
I tried my best.

39
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,830
You still don't know that's exactly
what makes me angry.

40
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,400
You never change.

41
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:20,409
You always make yourself suffer
in order to hurt others.

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,009
And you do your best at it too.

43
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,840
How do you never change, punk?

44
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,210
How about you?

45
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,250
Are you happy that you're
the only one who changed?

46
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,550
A bigger fight?

47
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,849
Stop with your nonsense.

48
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,090
Breaking off the engagement?

49
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,990
You'll be kneeling in front of your
father in the end.

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,560
Why don't you just go kneel now?

51
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,860
Or...

52
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,870
are you going to make Cha Eun Sang
kneel again?

53
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,400
What you're doing...

54
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,439
is not a bigger fight,
but a reckless one.

55
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,909
Have you even been
in a reckless fight?

56
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,840
If I have to kneel, I will kneel.

57
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,009
But I can pick myself up.

58
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,979
If I keep picking myself up,

59
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,189
a day when I won't fall will come.

60
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,289
So stay where you are,
Choi Young Do.

61
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,730
I'm not there anymore.

62
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,839
Are you the reason of this fight?

63
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,730
If you were going to do this, why
did you make me keep it a secret?

64
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,259
You said you would never reveal it.
Why did you change your mind?

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,399
I didn't.

66
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,500
Then why did you broadcast
for everyone to hear?

67
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,040
To see someone for a brief moment.

68
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,079
I'm sorry about the fight,

69
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,420
but it wasn't my fault.

70
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,949
You're not hurt?

71
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
No.

72
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,220
Why do you guys always fight?

73
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,589
It's because of you.

74
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,089
Can't you see we're in
a love triangle right now?

75
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,589
But it's not all because of me.

76
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,230
You didn't fall for it.

77
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,899
I'm still regretting it,

78
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:30,769
and Young Do...

79
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,509
is still resenting himself.

80
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,180
I can't fight myself.

81
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,410
- What about you?
- What about me?

82
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,519
You know it.

83
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,889
Kim Tan did nothing wrong to you.

84
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,860
From what I know, Kim Tan never...

85
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,589
gave you hope.

86
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:56,959
It's you who broke the rules
of an arranged marriage.

87
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,769
Obsessing over and hanging onto
an arranged marriage partner...

88
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,870
is cheating.

89
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,899
But can you forgive Kim Tan
even if it was true?

90
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,540
Can you admit that what you did
was worse than what he did?

91
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,750
It's the same for me.

92
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm just insisting.

93
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,259
It seems like the ones dating
are you and Choi Young Do.

94
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,430
True, nobody plays push-and-pull
like us.

95
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,629
You wore the uniform.

96
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,470
- Did you wash this?
- If not me, who?

97
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,709
The fabric seemed quite damaged.

98
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,540
Don't tell me you hand-washed it.

99
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,540
Take it off.

100
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,509
Now? Here?

101
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,879
How much? Everything?

102
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,079
- Hey!
- All of them?

103
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,189
Hello. I just came back
from the broadcast room.

104
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,490
The door is completely damaged.
When are you finished?

105
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,689
I'll call you again.

106
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey, Yoon Chan Young!
How can you never call...

107
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,199
Yoon Chan Young, are you really
going to act like this?

108
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:13,100
How can you do this to me?
Hey! Yoon Chan Young!

109
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:20,750
I think my leg is broken!
It's bleeding so much!

110
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,610
It hurts!

111
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,079
It hurts! It's bleeding!

112
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,860
I have a favor to ask.

113
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,490
I have a drama audition tomorrow.

114
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,600
I left my script
at Myung Soo's studio.

115
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,029
I don't think I can go
there anymore.

116
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,600
Can you bring that for me, please?

117
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,639
I will. But are you okay?

118
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,839
You're laughing at me too, right?

119
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,240
You're doing it in your mind,
aren't you?

120
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,610
Why do people in this school...

121
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,350
always assume what others
are thinking?

122
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,879
You guys all didn't learn properly
growing up.

123
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,550
You don't know
how to apologize properly.

124
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,660
I'll call you if I find it.

125
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,360
- Do you know my number?
- Yes, I know.

126
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm sorry for what I did.

127
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,569
I'll call you.

128
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,559
I heard Ye Sol had left her stuff
here, so I came to pick it up.

129
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,230
Choi Young Do.

130
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,669
This...

131
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,759
Why are you here?

132
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,529
Someone asked me for something.

133
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:21,700
Is that so?

134
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,100
- What are you looking for?
- A script.

135
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,470
It was definitely here.

136
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,070
I got it.

137
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:28,740
Do you want to give it to her?

138
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,169
No, it's okay. Just make sure...

139
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,509
to give it to her. She needs it
for tomorrow's audition.

140
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,549
She's so nice.

141
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,129
Give it to me.

142
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:53,659
The band-aid.

143
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,960
So you should
just forgive her already.

144
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,090
She came to find Ye Sol's script
by herself.

145
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,590
It's my Bo Na as expected.

146
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,330
She was putting on a show earlier,
and it was so cute.

147
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,470
I wanted to turn around so bad.
I could barely hold myself together.

148
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,669
Is that something to be proud of?
You're the one putting on a show.

149
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:34,240
Just make up already. Or someone
will take pretty Bo Na away.

150
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Bye.

151
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,350
(Jeil Meat, Hanlim Fish,
Chairman eats his food bland.)

152
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,629
(Ms. Han doesn't like
vegetables with strong smell.)

153
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,299
Mrs. Park. What are you doing now?

154
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,299
Are you writing a note
for your replacement?

155
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,370
How can you do things
as fast as LTE?

156
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,799
You won't lose to anyone
when it comes to being fast.

157
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:10,980
I haven't even found a replacement
yet. Do you want to leave that bad?

158
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,679
Ms. Han. You have a guest.

159
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,450
It's the fiance of your second son.

160
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,549
Who? Rachel?

161
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,690
Mom, I'm going to my part-time...

162
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,620
Go inside your room.

163
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,659
Don't come out. Rachel is here.

164
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,960
Go quickly!

165
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,730
Don't go
to your part-time job either.

166
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,659
You can't run into her
walking around the garden.

167
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,600
If she founds out you're in this
house too, it's over for Tan.

168
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,970
Got it?

169
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,779
I didn't want to go to work anyway.
Nice.

170
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,490
Hello, Mother.

171
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,360
You came?

172
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,629
The Chairman isn't at home.

173
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,159
And Tan is not home either.

174
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,399
I came to see you, Mother.

175
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:07,929
Me?

176
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,240
- To see me?
- Please speak casually.

177
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,210
I'm so glad to finally
get to meet you.

178
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,909
If I knew earlier, I would've come
to see you sooner. It's too bad.

179
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:22,809
Do you like flowers?

180
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,789
It must've been a difficult
decision. Tan is amazing.

181
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,899
He must hold you dear.

182
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,700
Do you really think so?

183
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,830
Thank you.

184
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,299
But...

185
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:48,440
your mother is in deep distress,
isn't she?

186
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,240
I think she's a little taken aback.

187
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,649
Especially because she thought
you were Eun Sang's mother.

188
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,019
Right. She must've been
very surprised.

189
00:12:58,149 --> 00:12:59,519
But Mother,

190
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,289
why did you come to the parent
meeting as Eun Sang's mother?

191
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,529
That's because... Eun Sang's mom
had a situation that day.

192
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,929
So I went for her.

193
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,200
Are you close to Eun Sang's family?

194
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,830
Quite much.

195
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,970
I feel bad because I think Tan
likes Eun Sang.

196
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,840
What? He's just being nice
to her because I know her family.

197
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,009
Don't be mistaken.

198
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:26,440
Of course.

199
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,080
Mother, I don't want to break off
the engagement.

200
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,480
I don't know what my mother thinks,

201
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,789
but that's how I feel.

202
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,990
Really?

203
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,190
Thank you, Rachel.
Thank you so much.

204
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,929
If you can be supportive of Tan,

205
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,360
I would be so happy.

206
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,860
Sure.

207
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,120
(Cha Eun Sang)

208
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,909
Mother, it's me, Rachel.

209
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,779
Yes. I wanted to ask you something.

210
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:36,580
A girl called Eun Sang...

211
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,419
Why does she live in Tan's house?

212
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,970
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

213
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,029
Where is my uniform?

214
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,029
- You don't have your uniform?
- Where is it?

215
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,139
I threw it away. In the dumpster.

216
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,740
I think it'd be burning by now.

217
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,470
Mom bought it for me.

218
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,220
Does your heart hurt?

219
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,490
Does it feel like your heart
is ripped apart?

220
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,419
What do you think I felt
when I found it at Tan's house?

221
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,220
Do you feel better
seeing me like this?

222
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,059
Do you feel good seeing me
rummaging in the trash?

223
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,399
What are you talking about?
Do you not know me?

224
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,769
This is only the beginning.

225
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,600
It's driving me nuts to find out
that a housekeeper's daughter...

226
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,299
pretended to be an upstart
at school.

227
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,110
That fearless crazy girl is even
dating my fiance.

228
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:45,039
Do you think doing this
will make me feel any better?

229
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,710
Would you feel better
if you were me?

230
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,620
What? A housekeeper's daughter?

231
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,090
I found it so ridiculous that
I couldn't even sleep last night.

232
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,059
- Did you sleep well in the house?
- Do you think I did?

233
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,789
You came and my uniform was gone.

234
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,630
So what are you going to do?

235
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,900
What should I do to make you
feel better?

236
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's see.

237
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,599
Clean up this place.

238
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,809
You must've learned something
by watching your mom.

239
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,210
What...

240
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,680
what did you just do?

241
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,150
How dare you!

242
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,390
Let go of this. Let go!

243
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,630
I don't care what you say about me.

244
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,799
But insulting my mom?

245
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,799
How great is your mom
to raise you like this?

246
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:46,240
Get lost when I'm telling
you nicely.

247
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,869
- Transfer.
- What are you to say to me that?

248
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,970
I'm giving you a chance to leave
as an upstart...

249
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,839
before I reveal everything!

250
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,150
Do it. I'm not scared.

251
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,950
Do you think I wasn't prepared?

252
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,319
Do you think I'll reveal
your secrets only?

253
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:03,349
I'm going to reveal that Kim Tan
is illegitimate too!

254
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,920
Choi Young Do couldn't do it, right?

255
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,390
Do you know why?

256
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,529
Because he had no intention
to reveal that from the start.

257
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,099
But do you think
I have a reason not to?

258
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,000
Why are you involving Kim Tan
in my situation?

259
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,769
Only that will make you transfer.

260
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,940
If I can't have him,
I'm going to make...

261
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,779
both of you fall.

262
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,380
So stop talking and choose.

263
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:32,819
You think that I'm capable
of doing it, right?

264
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:36,089
I think so too.

265
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,289
I'll think about it.

266
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,329
Transferring.

267
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,960
Think about what?

268
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,839
Can you excuse us?

269
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,309
How long were you listening to us?

270
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,710
I said to leave us.
Can't you hear me?

271
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,019
Don't get mad.

272
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,720
I was really hurt by your truth
as well.

273
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,289
- I wish this wouldn't work...
- Be quiet.

274
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,730
How did you find out about
Cha Eun Sang living in my home?

275
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,529
I went to your house yesterday
to see your mother.

276
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:20,599
Which mother?

277
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,230
The one you looked at
like an insect that day?

278
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,740
I wanted to maintain
our friendship at least.

279
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:28,569
But I don't think I can.

280
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,710
I will just lose another friend.

281
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,980
I can't hit a girl.

282
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,319
But I already did in my mind.

283
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,269
What are you?

284
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,769
Am I a joke to you?

285
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,940
Am I nothing to you?
Why can't you rely on me?

286
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,410
Am I not even someone dependable?

287
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,950
If Rachel came to our house,
you should've called me yesterday!

288
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,119
Because you're already having
a hard time with your own problems.

289
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,750
I've been having a hard time
ever since I was born.

290
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,819
My mother who can't be revealed,
my brother who hates me,

291
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,390
my father's wife who insults me,

292
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,029
and my father who allowed
all of this to happen.

293
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,529
Also, a friend who is angry
about knowing the secret,

294
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,470
and spending three years,
abandoned in an unfamiliar place.

295
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,440
I'm saying, the situation I'm in
did not happen because of you.

296
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
- So...
- It's not because of you either.

297
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:44,009
It's not your fault, Kim Tan.

298
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,859
Should we just run away?

299
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,700
Do you want to go to the States
with me?

300
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,069
It's tempting.

301
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,900
I will have to abandon my mom again,

302
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,339
and you will have to leave your mom
alone in that big house again.

303
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,009
Should we go?

304
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,369
A fist fighting wasn't enough?
You destroyed school property,

305
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,039
and even used the broadcast room
without permission.

306
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,710
- I'm sorry.
- I'm tired of hearing those words!

307
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,180
I'm going to handle it
according to the rules.

308
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,809
Community service for 30 hours.
100 pages of letter of apology.

309
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,079
It seems like you'll see the end of
this term cleaning up Jeguk High.

310
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,150
You gave up on studying anyway,
right?

311
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,160
I won't talk just with you
to work this out anymore.

312
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,660
Choi Young Do! Bring your father.

313
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,700
I beg for your pardon.

314
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,829
Do you think you're the exception?
Bring your brother!

315
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,240
Aren't you two going to answer me?

316
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,779
You fighting students.

317
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,150
I heard you fought
in the broadcast room.

318
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,950
The other teachers didn't
want to take it,

319
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,690
so I, as a newbie, ended up being
the one who will take care of you.

320
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,190
100 pages of letter of apology.

321
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:36,930
I'll keep calling you
until you fill them all in.

322
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:38,660
Can't you just call only him?

323
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,859
He's always the one at fault.

324
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,470
If he acts like this, I can't not
respond to him.

325
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,839
So you're blaming each other?

326
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,539
Write what the other did wrong
instead of what you did wrong then.

327
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,710
The main character of this story...

328
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:26,480
is the great Jeguk Group's
second son, Kim Tan.

329
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,279
The Kim Tan that you know
is actually...

330
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,630
Hi, Tan.

331
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,539
Cha Eun Sang, get out.

332
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,670
I hit Young Do.

333
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,180
It was a mistake,
and I'm reflecting on it.

334
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,119
I forgot. Your mom ran away, right?

335
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,019
Tan, have you seen Young Do?

336
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,059
I need to find him urgently.

337
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,960
I don't hang out
with him these days.

338
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:20,230
What do I do then?
I don't have a phone right now.

339
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,369
Can you call Young Do?

340
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,839
He wouldn't pick up my call.

341
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,769
But what's the matter?

342
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,910
It's because...

343
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,880
I have no time.

344
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,980
Can you look for Young Do for me?

345
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,349
I'll be at the restaurant
over there.

346
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,349
Please.

347
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,529
Choi Young Do!

348
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,960
Stop!
In front of the school...

349
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,759
Are you crazy? Let go of it!

350
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,000
I should've taken you there,
I shouldn't have given up.

351
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,000
If I knew it was the last chance.

352
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,009
I should've followed you
no matter what.

353
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:08,849
If I knew it was a chance
I would never have again.

354
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,759
Why aren't you writing? You did
nothing wrong to each other?

355
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,089
So you fought like that for nothing?

356
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,910
Do you think I'll reveal
your secrets only?

357
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,349
I'm going to reveal that Kim Tan
is illegitimate!

358
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,809
Get lost when I'm telling
you nicely.

359
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,420
Transfer.

360
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,890
Did you tell Chan Young
that I've been reflecting?

361
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,890
2 minutes and 40 seconds
until broadcast.

362
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
You said you wouldn't accept
my directions last time.

363
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,930
Hey, you said you guys were friends.
Didn't he say anything about me?

364
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,569
That's Yoon Chan Young's
manly and nice side.

365
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:06,039
Do you really want us to break up?

366
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
I do. No more chatting.

367
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,539
2 minutes and 10 seconds
until broadcast.

368
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,079
Hyo Shin!

369
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,450
Hey, Cha Eun Sang,
tell Yoon Chan Young...

370
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,710
that I've been really
reflecting on it.

371
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,849
It's been suffocating for me
these days.

372
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:22,650
Chan Young is my oxygen. How can
I breathe without him next to me?

373
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,890
I feel like I'm in space right now!

374
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,789
Wait, the broadcast...

375
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,059
- The light is on!
- Yoon Chan Young!

376
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:32,029
- My gosh! Hyo Shin, no!
- What was that?

377
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,240
Hey, Lee Bo Na! Where are you going?

378
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,970
I have something to say.

379
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,579
Don't say it. I won't listen.
You're going to break up with me!

380
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,210
I'm not. Stop there for a minute.

381
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,009
Don't chase me. I won't listen!

382
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,619
I didn't do the broadcast for them
to act like that.

383
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:01,119
I know.

384
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,500
Hello.

385
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,900
She's the new literature teacher.
She's beautiful, isn't she?

386
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,140
Is she that pretty?

387
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,180
You can't even say a word, and
you can't take your eyes off her.

388
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,509
Can you excuse us?

389
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,279
Okay.

390
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:33,319
- What happened?
- I moved to a better position.

391
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,230
As a school teacher,
not a private tutor.

392
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,099
Won't you congratulate me?

393
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:44,130
Not really. My first love got
an inch further away.

394
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,250
Have you been eating well?

395
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,750
It's so cold outside,
why a motorcycle?

396
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,289
Would you like to drink
something warm?

397
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,619
- Do you have alcohol?
- You must be out of your mind.

398
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:08,859
Why? Is your first love or one-sided
love not going well?

399
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,900
Is Cha Eun Sang
really my first love?

400
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,059
Unless Kim Tan is, she is.

401
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,930
Hey, why don't you just find
another girl?

402
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,700
I bet everything I own and my wrist
that they won't break up!

403
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,339
Why are you doing your best
to stop me? It's annoying.

404
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:24,069
How much do you like Cha Eun Sang?

405
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,140
How would I know?

406
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,380
Can I measure it with a ruler?
Can I weigh it on a scale?

407
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,450
Cha Eun Sang and I fell into water.

408
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,349
Who would you save?

409
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,150
I won't send her near the water
with you.

410
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,559
Okay. Cha Eun Sang and you fell
into water.

411
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,329
As in "Titanic", there's only one
board you can hang onto.

412
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,589
There's no other way to survive!

413
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,160
What would you do?

414
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,599
Were Cha Eun Sang and I together
just the two of us?

415
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,599
You were with everyone,
but just the two of you fell.

416
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,900
Kim Tan isn't there.
I won't save you either.

417
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:59,680
Then I should save her
and let her live without me.

418
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,509
I think that's the best way...

419
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,609
to get embedded
in Cha Eun Sang's heart.

420
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,220
I can save Cha Eun Sang,
and she can't go to Kim Tan either.

421
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,589
You're always like this.

422
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,019
Out of all the options,
you choose the sad ending.

423
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,259
By the way, what are you going to do
with your father?

424
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,799
Will you bring him?

425
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,150
Go in. It's cold.

426
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,750
You're walking me to your own house.

427
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,480
I know.

428
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,589
Are you really not coming in?

429
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,259
Let's go in. Ms. Han goes to bed
late these days.

430
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:46,819
If I go in, she won't be
able to sleep.

431
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,529
- Still.
- It's not time to go back yet.

432
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:53,099
When I come back,
I'll come with my brother.

433
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:55,329
But before that,

434
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,000
going to school with him
is my first plan.

435
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,039
I don't think you can even
move on to the second plan.

436
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,170
Seriously...

437
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,069
Hey, Won. Did you just come?

438
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,170
I thought you were sleeping already.

439
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,539
What are you doing here?
You don't have the key?

440
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,869
I do. I was just thinking.

441
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,970
We're really funny.

442
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,240
Why are we doing this when we
have a proper house?

443
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,700
Because we left the house.

444
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
Hey.

445
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:18,079
Why do you hate me so much?

446
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,019
Why would I like you?
A brother from a different mother.

447
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:24,190
I guess you're right.
I'll be nice to you.

448
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,819
Don't be. It makes me uncomfortable.

449
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,660
You can come. It's on the same day
of the college entrance exam.

450
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,000
What is it?

451
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:38,940
Is this a challenge to a duel?

452
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,799
It's an invitation to our
getting-back-together party.

453
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,309
- Is Yoon Chan Young coming?
- Hey!

454
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,509
I'm telling this for your sake,

455
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:49,309
guys don't like this kind of party.

456
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,049
It's like gathering everyone...

457
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,680
and saying, "I'm an idiot."

458
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,720
Don't come.

459
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,819
Hey, Kang Ye Sol!

460
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,359
Why are you walking away
when someone is calling you?

461
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:07,430
I was just standing.

462
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,269
Wouldn't it be nice if you can run
to me when I'm running to you?

463
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,140
I'm having a getting-back-together
party with Chan Young.

464
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,170
You must come. You played
the biggest role in our break up.

465
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,009
I'm sorry for what I did.

466
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,279
- I'm sorry too.
- I'm more sorry.

467
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,750
- I'm even more sorry.
- I'm even more more sorry.

468
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,619
I'm more more more sorry.

469
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,190
I said I'm more sorry!

470
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,720
I'm more sorry!

471
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:45,200
How are you feeling?

472
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,170
What's that? Are you also going
to Bo Na's party?

473
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,240
You should worry about the CSAT.
A party is a luxury for you.

474
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,880
If you get more than five wrong,
your family will make you retake it.

475
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:58,450
Isn't a life where you're
in the same grade as me scary?

476
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,849
Be quiet.

477
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,519
What are you going to do about that?

478
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,920
How dare you break the door of my
broadcast room?

479
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,289
Don't worry about little things
like that.

480
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:08,890
Just worry about your exam!

481
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,500
You're going to do well, right?

482
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,960
Of course.

(Seoul Education Office,

- Go!
- Way to go!

485
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,700
Would you like some coffee?

486
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,210
Okay.

487
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,109
- Good luck on your exam!
- Way to go!

488
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:28,680
- Good luck on your exam!
- Cheer up!

- Good luck on your exam!
- Go!

Don't feel burdened. Take it easy.

491
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:36,220
It's cold. You should go back.

492
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,759
I'm going to a temple. I'll be
praying for you until the end.

493
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,789
The prayer... You really
don't have to do that.

494
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:46,930
I'll go in.

on an assumption...

504
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,769
that the stocks owned under
your name will be handed to Tan.

505
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:12,010
Mr. Yoon, it's me.

506
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:13,619
I have something to ask.

(Jeguk Holdings Philippines Branch,
Jeguk Group Busan Branch)

512
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,610
I saw the announcement
regarding the change of positions.

513
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,380
You started a war.

514
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,519
Your name is not on the list.

515
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:52,289
Make your mind.

516
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,219
Should I put your name
on the last line of the list?

517
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,329
What? A change of positions
all of a sudden?

518
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,929
Did he fire you guys all? Won did?

519
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,639
Yes! I think he has sharpened
his sword to get us.

520
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,170
I'm sent to the Philippines!

What should I do?

522
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,510
- I got it for now. I'm hanging up.
- Come on!

523
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,250
What's the use of talking
on the phone?

524
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:18,409
You should go if you're reassigned!
I'm hanging up!

525
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,489
I arrived. Where are you?

526
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:28,960
To your right.

527
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,000
You wouldn't move
unless I take hostages.

528
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,409
Raising children is useless.

529
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,940
You've done many part-time jobs,
and you're now working as a hostage?

530
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,780
If I gave you a phone, you should've
answered your calls.

531

Why aren't you picking up?

532
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,119
I thought you might cry again
if you hear my voice.

533
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,920
Didn't you bring anything?

534
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:01,289
Wear these. The temperature is
going to be below zero tomorrow.

535
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:04,590
Anything else?

536
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,659
Not clothes, but things like cash.

537
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:10,269
You're ridiculous. You should suffer
more to come back home.

538
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,539
I'm not coming back. Once you
leave your house, you never go back.

539
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,610
Rachel dropped by.

540
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,769
I think she found out
about your relationship.

541
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,639
I made up an excuse,

542
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
but what are you really going to do?

543
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,579
We're going to be happy.

544
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,389
- Hey.
- How? How can you be happy?

545
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,190
Rachel doesn't want to break off
the engagement.

546
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,889
Before she changes her mind,
you should go and apologize.

547
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,690
And you two, stop dating.

548
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,960
Mom. You should say this with cash
in an envelope on the table.

549
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,530
How can you say that
without giving us anything?

550
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,969
How many days do you think your
father will be patient with you?

551
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,170
Do you want to be dragged
into the house?

552
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,840
That's why I don't have time
for this now, Mom.

553
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:50,409
Let's go.

554
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,110
We're leaving. Get home safe.

555
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,079
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere.

556
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,380
That brat! Don't even think
of coming back!

557
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,360
Did it hurt a lot?

558
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:11,659
No. It was just fascinating.

559
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,800
"You two, stop dating." Hearing
something like this.

560
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,170
You're supposed to be scared,
but you're fascinated.

561
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:19,670
So should we just keep walking
like this?

562
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,840
Do you want to go in somewhere?

563
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,409
I want to hold your hand, idiot.

564
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:24,469
Why are you smiling?

565
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:28,739
You should be the happiest girl out
of everyone within a 100km radius.

566
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,750
- Why?
- Because you'll be holding my hand.

567
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,349
Fine. Let's see if that's true.

568
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,119
What?

569
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,889
You said you wanted to hold hands.

570
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,389
And you believed that?

571
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,630
Why are you looking at me like that
as if you did nothing wrong.

572
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,900
You'd better stop playing
Mom's hostage again, okay?

573
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,230
It's not true. Ms. Han
was my hostage today.

574
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:53,500
- I wanted to see you.
- You did?

575
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:56,539
Where should we go? Shall
we go eat something delicious?

576
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:57,940
You don't even have money.

577
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,840
I don't have it just now.
Just for a while.

578
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,250
What did I tell you I would do
if you talked back?

579
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:05,510
You're not even embarrassed to say
that in the middle of a busy street!

580
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,750
I'm going to work now.

581
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,449
How can you do that? What about me?

582
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,519
I'll call you.

583
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,000
What are you doing?

584
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,070
I'm stopping you from leaving
for your part-time job.

585
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:25,230
This is how you stopped me
in the broadcast room.

586
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,570
Do you think it's the same?

587
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,469
How many times have you stopped
someone?

588
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,239
Did you stop other guys
like this too?

589
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:35,510
Seriously, you're so childish.

590
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:39,820
Next time,
can you stop me like this?

591
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,219
Hey!

592
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,789
I'm not hugging you, I'm just
telling you to stop me like this.

593
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,260
What on earth are you thinking...

594
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,789
What? Here is...

595
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:51,960
I'm not falling for it.

596
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
There's cash!

597
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,500
What? It's 50 dollars!

598
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:59,030
Did you let go of me
just for 50 dollars?

599
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:02,739
Hey, you get fooled by love
and cry over money in life.

600
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,539
I have a call. Just a minute.

601
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,809
- Hello, Mr. Yoon.
- Can we meet now?

602
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,690
Okay. Just a second, please.

603
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:21,219
I don't think I can't walk you
there. Sorry.

604
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:23,730
Where are you?

605
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,730
You mean the stocks under
the borrowed names I saw...

606
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,429
- are my birthday gifts?
- Yes.

607
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,510
Chairman Kim stopped the process
because he's mad at you right now,

608
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,380
but it will eventually happen.

609
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,280
I heard you caused trouble.

610
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,150
If your secret is revealed,

611
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,619
he'll try even harder to make you
a major shareholder...

612
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,719
in order to get you up again.

613
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,920
Then you'll have almost the same
amount of shares as CEO Kim.

614
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:59,329
He must be very angry.

615
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:02,199
It seems like he started a war
with Chairman Kim.

616
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,940
He got rid of all the people
on the Chairman's side today.

617
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,139
Everyone you saw on the list.

618
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:12,409
Everyone who has lined up after you.
Everyone.

619
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,710
Regardless of my will,

620
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,820
I was put in a boxing ring.

621
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,849
You're the second son
of Jeguk Group.

622
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,360
You were gifted with many things
upon birth,

623
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,920
but you have as many things
to give up.

624
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,389
For example,

625
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,829
your will.

626
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,130
I know that.

627
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,230
I also know why they put me
in the ring.

628
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,130
If I'm not put in the ring,

629
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,110
I would chase a different dream.

630
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:47,480
If Won wins against Father,

631
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,780
will I be the next player?

632
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,179
I guess so.

633
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,690
Do you have any plans to change
your hair salon?

634
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,260
No. Do you know how many years
I've been coming here?

635
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,900
How far did your invitation reach?

636
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:11,929
Is Cha Eun Sang coming as well?

637
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,769
She can't come
because of her part-time job.

638
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,539
Right.

639
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,480
She should make money to survive.

640
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,110
- Where does she work at?
- How would I know?

641
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,179
I bet you do.

642
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,579
It's her parents' rules.

643
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:28,050
They're upstarts. I guess they're
not used to being rich.

644
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,920
They might be afraid
of losing everything,

645
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,489
wanting to make even more money,
I guess.

646
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,360
- What time is the party today?
- Why would you ask that?

647
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,230
You're being really suspicious.

648
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,460
Don't come to my party. Never!

649
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,840
I'm in front of where Cha Eun Sang
works at.

650
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:50,739
Aren't you curious
about what's going to happen?

651
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,360
Please follow that motorcycle.

652
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,039
Where are you?
Where did you say you were?

653
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,239
Behind you.

654
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:32,820
So it's here. Where Cha Eun Sang
works at.

655
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:34,650
Did you follow me?

656
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,019
Are you messing with me?

657
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,389
You hit women now too?

658
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:43,030
When it comes to Cha Eun Sang,
I'm not afraid to be a jerk.

659
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:51,829
You should. Because it seems like
you liking Cha Eun Sang...

660
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:53,969
is toxic for her.

661
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,070
How can you run crazy like this
just hearing her name?

662
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,769
Gosh. Aren't you being too much?

663
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,570
Play exciting songs for us.

664
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,050
- Hey.
- Congratulations, Bo Na.

665
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,119
Help yourself.

666
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,420
- Have fun.
- You look so pretty today.

667
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,349
Take a picture for them.

668
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:47,119
1, 2, 3.

669
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:49,590
- It turned out well.
- Let's take a photo too.

670
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,030
Us too? Okay.

671
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,699
1, 2, 3.

672
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,829
What was that?

673
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,940
My Bo Na looks so pretty.

674
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,610
- Did you invite Rachel too?
- No?

675
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,320
It's so annoying. Why did you come?

676
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,389
Is this how you welcome your guests?

677
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:18,920
I came because it seemed like a nice
place to have some coffee.

678
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,389
I ordered the coffee for you,
so don't refuse it.

679
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:23,090
Really? Is it on you?

680
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,739
Why are you here? It's cold,
you should come inside.

681
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:46,320
Yoo Rachel found out
that you work here.

682
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,989
It was my mistake. I'm sorry.

683
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,489
We hid it for a long time.

684
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:56,530
She knows about worse things.
Knowing my part-time job is nothing.

685
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:57,989
It's okay.

686
00:45:58,429 --> 00:46:00,829
If Rachel comes later,
you should call me...

687
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:02,599
You know I have a lot
of "dark knights" to protect me.

688
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,199
Don't worry.

689
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:09,099
Why does our new student
have so many "dark knights"?

690
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,070
It makes me competitive.

691
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,909
I think that's when it began.

692
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,150
I started liking you
around that time.

693
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,329
You may have many "dark knights",
but I'm still worried.

694
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,260
Call me.

695
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,010
- Hello.
- It's a catering service.

696
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,610
You can leave work after this today.

697
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:52,650
Okay.

698
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:05,860
Chan Young. What's the address
of your party place?

699
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:06,960
You want to come?

700
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,829
Gangnam-gu, Cheongdam-dong,
79-15, 5th floor.

701
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:11,730
Come quickly. We just started.

702
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,940
I'll call you later.

703
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:35,360
Where are you? Did you go
to Chan Young's party?

704
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,699
I'm about to go now. Why?

705
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,599
I'm on the way.

706
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,739
Don't get surprised
when you see me there.

707
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,070
Aren't you working now?

708
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,670
Why are you going there?

709
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:00,179
(Eun Sang)

710
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,550
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

711
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,949
Please leave a message...

712
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,480
- Welcome to Yoon Chan Young...
- And Lee Bo Na's...

713
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,239
getting-back-together party.

714
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,280
The ones who bet on whether
we would break up or not...

715
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,650
when we were apart, I know
who you are! Watch out at night!

716
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:40,690
All the cocktails are non-alcoholic,

717
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,860
so drinking a lot to get drunk will
make you go to the bathroom more.

718
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,789
Whatever he says, he sounds
like a class president.

719
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:46,829
Especially you.

720
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,400
Don't mix alcohol in it secretly.

721
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,329
Catering service is here.

722
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,539
What?

723
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,579
What is it, Cha Eun Sang?
You work part-time?

724
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:12,190
Yes. Are you enjoying the party?

725
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:13,659
Why do you work part-time?

726
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:15,920
To make money, of course.

727
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:20,230
Yoon Chan Young, Lee Bo Na,
congratulations on making up.

728
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,400
What's going on?

729
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:27,800
What?

730
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,469
What happened?

731
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,280
It's Yoo Rachel, isn't it?

732
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,380
Yes. I knew before coming.

733
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,780
If you want drinks,
line up in front of here.

734
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,349
Juice is on the right,
coffee is on the left.

735
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:43,619
Cha Eun Sang.

736
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,989
Upstart! Why do you work part-time?

737
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,730
Is it your family's business
like Young Do's?

738
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:02,070
Actually...

739
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,139
I'm actually...

740
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,539
Kim Tan.

741
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,719
- Get out.
- Not now.

742
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,889
I'm here for the catering service.

743
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,190
I ordered it. It seemed like
we didn't have enough drinks here.

744
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:25,690
I'll have coffee.

745
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,300
- Okay.
- When are you finished?

746
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:32,829
When all the drinks here are served.

747
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:39,880
- What was that?
- What is he doing?

748
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,909
Gosh.

749
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,679
They're all served now, right?
Get out.

750
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,320
I'm sorry, Yoo Rachael.
I'll bring you another one.

751
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:54,820
This party is ruined.

752
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,760
Hey, Yoo Rachel, did you come here
to do this?

753
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,300
Yes. Go and enjoy your party.

754
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,500
- She said she's coming back.
- This crazy...

755
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,869
Come here. Let's see which of us
survives tonight!

756
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:08,269
I said come here! Come here!

757
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:09,400
- Hey, hey.
- Bo Na.

758
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,610
Why are you using my party?

759
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,980
Young Do, where are you?
Come here quickly!

760
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,909
The party is a mess,

761
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,409
but it's the most amusing thing
I've ever seen.

762
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:25,150
Why on earth are you making
me upset?

763
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,119
You knew about everything.
Why did you come?

764
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,590
You knew Yoo Rachel made you
come to screw you. Why did you come?

765
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:33,630
How could I not come
when I'm paid for it?

766
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,230
Choi Young Do can do it,
but I can't?

767
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,630
Choi Young Do working is okay,
but me doing it is embarrassing?

768
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:41,000
Why?

769
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:43,170
Because I'm not a daughter
of the owner of a coffee chain?

770
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,840
That's not what I mean.

771
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,679
I hate seeing you
being treated like that here.

772
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,239
What I was really embarrassed
about...

773
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,579
was myself who couldn't
say anything...

774
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:56,989
when I was being called "upstart".

775
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:00,190
I was not embarrassed
at my poverty,

776
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:01,960
but at me being fake!

777
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,230
Do you think I don't know that?

778
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:05,530
Can't you just take an easier path?

779
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,260
I came here to tell everyone.

780
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:11,369
That I'm not an upstart, and I've
been lying to them all this while.

781
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Are you crazy?

782
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,940
I never once slept comfortably,

783
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:17,070
being worried sick about
the secrets that might be spilled.

784
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:20,510
"Will I be okay today?" "Will they
find out about it tomorrow?"

785
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:21,840
"What if they find out about this?"

786
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,809
But...

787
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,650
you were the same.

788
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,650
You hid your secret from birth
up until a few days ago.

789
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,750
And you revealed it!

790
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,260
I did it, but can you not?

791
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:35,820
I know because I did it.
Please don't do that.

792
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,289
Revealing it doesn't make you
any happier.

793
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,530
- But still...
- You're going to get hurt!

794
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:43,429
Why are you so stubborn?

795
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,369
That's what I learned from you.

796
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:49,400
Going straight, despite knowing
you're going to get hurt.

797
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,039
I'll be back.

798
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,320
You and Cha Eun Sang
are so melodramatic.

799
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,360
If Cha Eun Sang was an upstart,
things could've been more civil.

800
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,070
But her level is way too low.

801
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:19,869
So there's nothing to steal,
or compete with.

802
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,400
- This is the only way.
- Don't talk to me.

803
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,340
If possible, in the future too.

804
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,889
Don't stop me.
Even if you stop me...

805
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:18,789
I made you suffer
because I made you an upstart.

806
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,969
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

807
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,500
If you can't do it,

808
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,510
you can give up
and fall into my arms.

809
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:42,780
Shall we go in then?

810
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:46,349
What? Say that again.

811
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,289
The reason I'm working
is because I have to make money.

812
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,000
And I have to make money...

813
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,869
because of my family's
financial situation.

814
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,099
You said you were an upstart.
What are you talking about?

815
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,539
I'm sorry I've deceived you all.

816
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,309
I'm not an upstart.

817
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,179
I'm...

818
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,780
a transfer student
on the welfare scholarship.

819
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,880
- What?
- The welfare scholarship?

820
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:15,949
- Really?
- Is that how it happened?

821
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:17,889
- Gosh.
- I knew something was weird.

822
00:55:17,889 --> 00:55:19,690
- It's big news.
- I can't believe this.

823
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,019
- The welfare...
- Seriously?

824
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,590
- What is this?
- It's ridiculous.

825
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:35,599
So you've been acting like
an upstart the whole time.

826
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,840
I'm speechless.

827
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,769
What a reality check.
I'm dumbfounded.

828
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,780
You're a welfare student and dared
to date Kim Tan, who has a fiancee?

829
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,550
I don't think Kim Tan knew about it.

830
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,750
Kim Tan. Did you know she
was on the welfare scholarship?

831
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:53,559
Did she fool you too?

832
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:56,860
Yes. I was fooled.

833
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,630
What? She even fooled Kim Tan?

834
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,760
- She's completely...
- My goodness.

835
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:17,110
She acted all tough so I thought
she's okay,

836
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,679
but she's shaking.

837
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,420
- Unbelievable.
- He must be serious.

838
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,460
- What is Yoo Rachel going to do?
- What about Yoo Rachel then?

839
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,769
There's no music at the party,
Myung Soo.

840
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:40,030
What are you talking about?
Of course, there is.

841
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:44,670
Coffee is self-served. It's time
to leave work for Cha Eun Sang.

842
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:08,360
I did it.

843
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,670
Nice to meet you.

844
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,139
Welfare student, Cha Eun Sang.

845
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,039
I'm an illegitimate son,

846
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,179
Kim Tan.

847
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,429
Now,

848
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,630
let's enjoy the party.

849
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,789
(We'd like to thank Choi Ji Na
for the special appearance.)

850
00:59:30,769 --> 00:59:34,980
(The Heirs)
