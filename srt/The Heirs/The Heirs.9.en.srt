(The Heirs)

3
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,500
(Episode 9)

4
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,109
Are you okay?

5
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:40,979
Let me take a look.

6
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,810
Don't. You will ruin your uniform.

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,380
Stay still. Let me take a look.

8
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,219
- I said I was okay.
- I told you to stay still.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,530
(Choi Young Do)

10
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,130
Don't do that. I need to answer it.

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,570
Don't answer it.

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,569
You saw it earlier. Ignoring
and avoiding won't work on him.

13
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,069
He knows that I'm not an upstart.
He knows everything.

14
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,040
It'll be okay.
Don't answer it anyway.

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,510
How will it be okay? Choi Young Do
figured everything out.

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,579
Don't answer it!

17
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,409
Hello...

18
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,980
(Choi Young Do)

19
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,610
Are you listening?

20
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,180
Hello?

21
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,780
I told you not to answer it.
Answer it...

22
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,080
if you want to see me go crazy.

23
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,789
I'll really kill him.

24
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,889
There is no in-between with me.

25
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,280
Where are you?

26
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,120
Why are you answering this phone?

27
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,490
Where are you?

28
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,229
You must be on the rooftop.

29
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,129
What did you two do on the rooftop?

30
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,669
Cha Eun Sang is coming down
from the rooftop right now.

31
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,969
Stay right there.

32
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,740
I'm going to hang up because
I have something urgent to do.

33
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,259
What happened to her uniform?
It's a complete mess.

34
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,930
Because I tripped her over.

35
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,000
Why?

36
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,069
By mistake? On purpose?

37
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,579
I thought you don't bully girls.

38
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:07,649
Why are you becoming...

39
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,009
I am not, you punk.

40
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,949
I deserve to be criticized
for the other things,

41
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:14,949
but I didn't deserve it this time.

42
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,189
What was it then?

43
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:21,430
I was curious about...

44
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:26,060
how I would feel if I tripped
Cha Eun Sang over.

45
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Do you think it's different,
you psycho?

46
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,269
If you're interested in her,
confess your feelings.

47
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,540
Why would you bully her?

48
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,139
That's why people say
you're like an 8-year-old.

49
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:36,339
- Be quiet.
- You should be quiet.

50
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,779
Stop there!

51
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,360
I looked everywhere for you.

52
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,430
- Why?
- Why?

53
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,740
Change into this.
It's from your cabinet.

54
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,069
Thank you.

55
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,110
Don't thank me.

56
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,240
I did it because Chan Young
might do it if I don't.

57
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,029
Oh, my.

58
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,639
What are you guys doing?

59
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,470
How could you look so bad
in whatever you wear?

60
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,500
Did you get caught by Choi Young Do?

61
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,670
I'm not sure.

62
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,639
Why did you come to a school
that is out of your league...

63
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,639
in the first place?

64
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,850
You won't believe it.
It's a mess right now.

65
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,209
In the hallway,
Kim Tan and Choi Young Do are...

66
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,480
What about Tan and Young Do?

67
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,819
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

68
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,889
- You should just shut your mouth.
- How dare you?

69
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,519
You should talk with me.
Let this go.

70
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,089
What happened?

71
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,329
It must be something huge
if you grabbed my hair.

72
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:15,300
Do you know how the school
ended up because of you?

73
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,100
Kim Tan and Choi Young Do are
fighting and it's a mess.

74
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,170
What are you going to do?

75
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,709
- Really?
- What?

76
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,709
- What is happening?
- What is happening?

77
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:27,709
Hey.

78
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,680
Tan and Young Do,
both of you should stop.

79
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,779
I told you to stop.

80
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,220
You're bleeding.

81
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,019
What is wrong with you two?

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,529
This is bad.
It's the chief director.

83
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,240
Again? Is it the two of you again?

84
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,210
You fought better than last time.

85
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,250
Were you showing off?

86
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,720
Follow me. Both of you.

87
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,169
What is it? What made you
fight like this?

88
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,399
What is the reason?

89
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,600
Aren't you going to tell me?

90
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,039
I was taught to never make
a statement without a lawyer. Ma'am.

91
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,110
Weren't you taught to keep your
public and private life separate?

92
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,720
I'm saying this
as the chief director right now,

93
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,250
not as Tan's mom.

94
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,220
Kim Tan, how could you keep
disappointing me like this?

95
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,990
Choi Young Do, I thought
I made myself clear last time.

96
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,389
How dare you make the
academic atmosphere like this?

97
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,700
Don't you know what school
Jeguk High School is?

98
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,669
You'll be punished this time.

99
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,639
I'm going to check the CCTV
and hold a disciplinary committee.

100
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,169
If necessary, I'm going to
bring your parents here.

101
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:03,470
- Please forgive us.
- It's too late.

102
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,909
I don't care what you do
outside school.

103
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,110
I won't interfere with that.

104
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,950
But you have to behave at school.

105
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,450
It will be over for you
if you graduate,

106
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,519
but Jeguk High School is
my career and workplace.

107
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:19,419
So don't cause flaws to my school.

108
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:21,429
Do you understand?

109
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,059
You can go now.

110
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,399
Check the surveillance cameras.

111
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,769
Shouldn't "Aren't you hurt anywhere"
come first?

112
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,080
Since she's not your real mother,
she's more worried...

113
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,710
about her job than her son.

114
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,149
You don't know how reassured I am
because I still have a mother.

115
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,019
Aren't you looking forward...

116
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,360
to finding out when I will use...

117
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:58,029
the fact that Kim Tan of Jeguk Group
is a bastard, and how impactfully?

118
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,830
You can't use that card.

119
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,639
Because you're nothing without that.

120
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,710
Because you can't do anything
to me without it.

121
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,519
Are you sure about that?

122
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,980
Use it if you want to know.

123
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,250
You will regret it.

124
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,490
Try to make me regret.

125
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,460
I'm ready to become a mess.

126
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,450
How did you end up fighting?

127
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,049
I'm really upset because of you.

128
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,019
Are you going home
without even changing clothes?

129
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,720
I'm going to shower at home
since it was the last class.

130
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,789
Did Young Do and Tan come
to the golf class?

131
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,200
No, they were dragged
to the chief director's office.

132
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,700
Anyway, what's going on
between them?

133
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,000
You said they used to be close.

134
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,870
Exactly. Do you know
what happened between them?

135
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,129
I also don't know in detail.

136
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,909
I just thought it was odd Young Do
didn't come to the airport...

137
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,610
when Tan was leaving for the US.

138
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,809
I didn't know that they fell out
like this.

139
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,649
Isn't it kind of strange?

140
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,049
Doesn't it seem like
Kim Tan likes Cha Eun Sang?

141
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,149
If not, why would he shield
her so actively?

142
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:31,759
Are you saying that after watching
what Young Do did in the cafeteria?

143
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,289
Why do you always take
Kim Tan's side?

144
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:36,330
Kang Ye Sol, are you
arguing with me?

145
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,529
Sisters, why are you
about to fight too?

146
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,029
I can't stand two fights a day.

147
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,200
Why isn't Yoon Chan Young coming?

148
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,509
Seeing that he made me sit
in that seat,

149
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,110
Young Do must have figured out
that I'm on a welfare scholarship.

150
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,950
That may or may not be the case.

151
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,519
What kind of answer is that?

152
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,649
I'm telling you not to worry
in advance.

153
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,620
Worry about tomorrow's
affairs tomorrow.

154
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,190
Let's fight when we have to.

155
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,190
Don't be afraid.
I'll fight with you.

156
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,090
Stop talking about fighting
in front of me.

157
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:12,629
Why? Did Kim Tan come by
your heart?

158
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,659
Hey.

159
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,929
Kim Tan likes you, right?

160
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,769
What?

161
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,769
I'm more worried about people
finding out that...

162
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,610
Kim Tan likes you than the fact that
you're on a welfare scholarship.

163
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Why are you more worried about that?

164
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,679
Do you know how many kids want
to see Kim Tan crash at school?

165
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,379
They can't pick up a fight
with the son of Jeguk Group,

166
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,090
but they want to see him get angry.

167
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,419
If they find out
that Kim Tan likes you,

168
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,320
they will attack you.

169
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,759
It seems that Choi Young Do
already started.

170
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,919
Why did you leave it so clumsily?

171
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,419
You said you still had
installments left to pay.

172
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,629
Can't you see this?

173
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm hurt.

174
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:25,840
I was also scolded
by the chief director.

175
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,269
She said I'd be punished.

176
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,539
I won't get expelled, will I?

177
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,139
A man's final education
can't stop at middle school.

178
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,480
I'll go in first.

179
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,549
You can't do that. Do you know
how long I waited for you?

180
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,759
Don't hold me, and don't stop me.

181
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,320
Don't even wait for me from now on.

182
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,759
- Hey.
- Please don't.

183
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,330
I don't want to argue with you here.

184
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,309
Who cares about
those darn surveillance cameras?

185
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:04,879
You told me about them.

186
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,350
Did you ever listen to...

187
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,620
what I told and warned you about?

188
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:40,480
Won.

189
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,690
Step aside.
You're blocking the door.

190
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,230
Are you still staying at the hotel?

191
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,289
Are you a guard or what?

192
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,899
Why are you blocking the door
and asking pointless questions?

193
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,330
Isn't it time you came back?

194
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,929
Will you go stay at a hotel then?

195
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,169
Won, I really...

196
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,309
have no intention to take
what you have.

197
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:11,639
Do I have to explain it again?

198
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,509
You don't have the right
to decide your intentions.

199
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,820
You only have the intentions
that Jeguk Group decides for you.

200
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,250
So your existence itself is
a misunderstanding,

201
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,149
cause, and source of trouble for me.

202
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,190
That's what a bastard is like.

203
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,759
Don't tell the others that I came.

204
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:33,100
I just came to bring
what I left here.

205
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,369
Don't go to the wine cellar
even if Mom asks you.

206
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,430
You might run into Won.

207
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,839
(To Eun Sang)

208
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,720
The second madam told
me to bring this to her.

209
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,589
You can bring all of the wine,

210
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,319
but not that one.

211
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,529
Because this is mine.

212
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,960
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,130
I wasn't scolding you.

214
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:53,210
Do you go to Jeguk High School?

215
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:55,509
Yes.

216
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,579
And do you live here?

217
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,119
Yes.

218
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,349
It was nice to meet you.

219
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:02,849
Me too.

220
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,490
I'll get going now then.

221
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,420
Won.

222
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,460
What are you doing here?

223
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,500
I came to meet Choi Young Do,
but I think he stood me up.

224
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,099
I run into you
whenever I get stood up.

225
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,730
Both in the US and Korea.

226
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,539
Just think that you came to meet me.

227
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I can't take you anywhere today,
so how about a cup of tea here?

228
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,109
I'd like that.

229
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,859
You're staying at this hotel?

230
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Yes. I ran away from home.

231
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,799
What? Are you going
through puberty again?

232
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,529
Yes, again.

233
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,200
You go through puberty because of
the situation, not your age.

234
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,339
Tan must also be going through
puberty if that's what it means.

235
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,910
You must have seen Tan
if you dropped by home.

236
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,079
His face is a mess, right?

237
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,049
You're right. Did he fight
with someone?

238
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,619
He fought because of some girl.

239
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,990
I think Tan wants to date
another girl.

240
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,230
Who? Is she prettier than you?

241
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,500
I guess you're just like other men.

242
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,769
Is Tan's face swollen a lot?

243
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,769
I guess
you're just like other girls.

244
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,809
Where did this happen?

245
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,750
I fell while playing soccer.
I'm telling you the truth.

246
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,119
Do you expect me to believe that?

247
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,819
It should be plausible
for me to be fooled.

248
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,190
Did you play soccer with your face?

249
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,589
Mom, I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep.

250
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,890
Do you want to see me
die from frustration?

251
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,490
Good night. I love you.

252
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,140
I'm sorry for calling you so early.

253
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,069
No, it's okay.
Did something happen at school?

254
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:41,869
No. That...

255
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:46,680
You know the daughter of the lady
who works at our house, right?

256
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:48,180
I'm going to give her a ride.

257
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,079
She will come out
about five minutes later.

258
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,349
Okay.

259
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,119
What time did she go?

260
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:42,970
Born into a poor family and
not receiving proper education,

261
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,269
Gatsby repeatedly imagines
his splendid future...

262
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,210
and finally believes
that it is his reality.

263
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,779
He doesn't stop there,

264
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:54,279
and he falls in love
with a high-class woman, Daisy.

265
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,250
To make that love come true,

266
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,980
he makes money by all means...

267
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,619
and becomes very rich
at a young age.

268
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,960
But she is just a subject
of suspicion and jealousy to him.

269
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,789
His embellished past is
nothing more than mockery.

270
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,599
Nevertheless, he doesn't give in,
and change all of his past, present,

271
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,569
and future to fit his dreams.

272
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,960
You will turn in reports
for this performance assessment.

273
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,299
Until next class...

274
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,990
(Eun Sang's School)

275
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,609
Hello? Are you
Cha Eun Sang's mother?

276
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,339
Hello?

277
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,880
Hello? Can't you hear me?

278
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,849
What is happening? She didn't even
call me when her kid was absent.

279
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,559
Absent?

280
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,279
The person
you're calling cannot...

281
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,579
It's me, but call Cha Eun Sang.
She won't answer my calls.

282
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,150
I just called her, but she is also
not answering my calls.

283
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,890
Are you sure she's not at home?

284
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,660
No. She wouldn't have gone to work
at this hour.

285
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,089
Don't you know any places
she would go?

286
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,990
You said you spent
half of your lives together.

287
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,099
Where?

288
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,799
You're not even sure
if she'd be there?

289
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:34,240
She kills time
by watching movies there.

290
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,369
Go check there just in case.

291
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,569
What's this?

292
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:20,109
A dream catcher.
It will block nightmares.

293
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,410
Only good dreams will come
through that hole.

294
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,880
What about a pretty woman?

295
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,349
Forget it. Give it back.

296
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,200
Why are you here?

297
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,410
Was the movie fun?

298
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:51,569
Did you follow me
from the movie theater?

299
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,839
Why didn't you come to school?

300
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,549
Is school a place you can go
whenever you want to...

301
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,180
and not go
whenever you don't want to?

302
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,150
Why did you come out? You're
about to get disciplinary action.

303
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,519
Just worry about yourself.

304
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,490
You will die in my hands today.

305
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,440
You're becoming
more of a mess because of me.

306
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,940
- It's not because of you.
- Of course, it is.

307
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:29,910
I still won't let go of your hand.
I will keep going like this.

308
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,049
If I keep going,

309
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,779
you will be at the end
of the road, right?

310
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,019
I won't be there.

311
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,539
I already ran away,
so I'm not there.

312
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:57,170
It's okay. I can find you.

313
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:58,309
Don't do that.

314
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,710
I have nowhere else to go.

315
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,049
What do you want me to do then?

316
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,779
I like you. What do you
want me to do about it?

317
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,619
I also like you.

318
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,450
But what about that?

319
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:12,859
"Let's graduate without any events."

320
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,559
"Let's live confidently
even if I live off you."

321
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,289
Even these small plans are all going
wrong, so who cares if I like you?

322
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,160
It doesn't mean anything.

323
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,670
Kids don't know about your
complicated family history, right?

324
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:31,670
You can't protect me.

325
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,980
Just protect yourself.

326
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,730
The route guidance is over.

327
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,740
(Arrived)

328
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,150
35...

329
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,359
(Room for rent)

330
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,160
(Customs Declaration
Cha Eun Sang)

331
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,529
Sure, she's an upstart.

332
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:06,740
Are you looking for a room?

333
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:11,769
No, I'm here to visit my friend.
Her name's Cha Eun Sang.

334
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,109
Eun Sang moved to Pyeongchang-dong.

335
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,250
Okay, I guess that's it
for our friendship.

336
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,279
Do you know Pyeongchang-dong where?

337
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,420
I wouldn't know that.

338
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:25,119
Are you really her friend?

339
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,490
I think so.

340
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,200
I'm back.

341
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,529
Your private tutor came.

342
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,529
It's a new teacher.

343
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,170
Jeon Hyun Joo says she will quit.

344
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,480
You didn't tell her
to quit, did you?

345
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,049
Fortunately, she said it first
before I did.

346
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:51,579
Go inside.

347
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:57,089
If N plus 1 and N minus 1 are
bigger than 1,000...

348
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,130
What are you doing
in the middle of class?

349
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,990
When will you solve
all of those questions like that?

350
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,359
What?

351
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,230
Solve them for me.

352
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:11,299
I'm taking this lesson so I can
make my national ranking higher,

353
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:12,869
not to become the top of my class.

354
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,470
You can get the answer
of this problem quickly...

355
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,240
by using numeric value substitution
than using the standard method.

356
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:21,109
The intention of this problem is...

357
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:23,279
to see if the testee understands
the meaning of it.

358
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,190
See?
Numeric value substitution it is.

359
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:36,630
Just give me five minutes.

360
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,559
How could you quit without
even saying goodbye?

361
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,339
I e-mailed the text
that we couldn't cover.

362
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:54,880
Ask me if you have
any questions like today.

363
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,190
I'm a little late, right?

364
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:06,089
No, I came early.

365
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,029
Excuse me for a minute.

366
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,730
So I'm always your student to you.

367
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,000
What kind of tea would you like?

368
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,109
Have you thought about it?

369
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:28,309
If I start teaching
at Jeguk High School,

370
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:30,410
will promotional articles
be released in a few days?

371
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,450
Probably.

372
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,650
"Jeguk Group also takes care
of a job for..."

373
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,950
"a child breadwinner who grew up
with its support."

374
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,019
Articles with that title...

375
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,789
will be plastered on websites
if you just search for my name.

376
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,089
You can reject the offer.

377
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,599
I also thought I could.

378
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,470
I know the chairman well.

379
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:52,569
I have no choice
when it comes to things like this.

380
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,940
The president doesn't know
about this plan yet.

381
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,210
That's a relief.

382
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,109
Please don't tell him for now.

383
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,049
I will tell him myself later.

384
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,429
Throw me the salt.

385
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,900
- Dad?
- Get it yourself.

386
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:27,199
You're feeling really down today.
Did something happen?

387
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,539
Do you want to have a drink?

388
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,440
How is Eun Sang doing at school?

389
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,179
You're asking me
about Eun Sang a lot.

390
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,980
What about you?

391
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:36,610
What about me?

392
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,849
I sent you to Jeguk High School
hoping you see a better world...

393
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:41,250
and have better connections.

394
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,920
But I'm a little worried today.

395
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,360
That's why we should have a drink.

396
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,630
You punk!

397
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,230
We're only going
to have one drink, okay?

398
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,530
Of course, I'm only going
to have one drink.

399
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:00,500
But 1 drink will lead to 2 drinks.

400
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,010
Yes, Boss. I will close
the cafe before I go home.

401
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,679
Yes.

402
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,980
Excuse me? There's a strand
of hair in the drink.

403
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:11,210
That's not possible. Let me see.

404
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:16,320
- Isn't it in there?
- No.

405
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,590
It clearly was there.

406
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,219
Can you give me
your phone number then?

407
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,130
It's time to close.

408
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,130
Come on, you can give us
your number.

409
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,360
We come here really often.

410
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,570
- You're done drinking, right?
- Wait a minute.

411
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:32,269
If you don't want to give it to me,
should I give you mine?

412
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:33,869
We have surveillance cameras here.

413
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,639
If you don't stop,
I'll call the police.

414
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,639
Gosh.

415
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,239
I'm the police.

416
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,750
What the...

417
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,920
What? It's been a long time.

418
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:50,050
It's our first time seeing each
other after middle school, right?

419
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:52,920
Choi Young Do?

420
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,989
I treated you so well,
but you grew up to be a bully?

421
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,940
If you're going to be bullied,
it should be by me.

422
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,739
Not by losers like them.

423
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,940
I can't take your order.
It's time to close the cafe.

424
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,079
You should thank me.
I just saved you.

425
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,550
You're worse than them.

426
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,079
Do you know
why I didn't go to school?

427
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,920
What did I ever do to you?

428
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,480
Why are you bullying me?

429
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:24,949
I wasn't bullying you.

430
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,590
Maybe this will look like bullying.

431
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,599
I went to the house
you used to live today.

432
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
What?

433
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:37,929
Just listen. Number one,

434
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,639
you used to live
in that run-down house.

435
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,610
Number two, you live in
Pyeongchang-dong now.

436
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,280
So we ran into each other
in front of that convenience store.

437
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,380
Number three, I'm sure you're
on a welfare scholarship, though.

438
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,150
- So number four...
- You're right. I'm not an upstart.

439
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,389
I'm on a welfare scholarship.

440
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,519
That's right. I told you so.

441
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:02,929
So what will you do about that?

442
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,159
Will I also be kicked out
of Jeguk High School now?

443
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,230
I like you now, so I can't do that.

444
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:12,840
What?

445
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,269
But you hate me, don't you?

446
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:27,480
Mom.

447
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:32,750
Did you go somewhere?

448
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:36,150
I went to throw away food waste.

449
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,920
Didn't you get a call from school?

450
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,860
I didn't go to school today.

451
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:45,429
I got a call.

452
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,159
Why aren't you saying
anything about it?

453
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,300
I'm sure it was because
you were having a hard time.

454
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,539
And it'll be harder for you
if I scold you.

455
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,119
Don't worry.
I had a hard time, but I'm okay now.

456
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,860
I'll go to school tomorrow.

457
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,590
The uniform costs 1,000 dollars,
so I must make the most out of it.

458
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,039
The night air is so nice.

My gosh!

(PTA President)

465
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,119
Are you bragging that
you know the PTA president?

466
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:31,960
Is it the call about
the parent meeting?

467
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:34,300
Do you want me to answer it for you?

468
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:40,840
Hello?

469
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,469
I finally got you on the phone.

470
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,840
Is this Eun Sang's mother? It's
wrong to notify that you can't...

471
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,909
come to the parent meeting
by text message.

472
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:50,909
I know that it's clearly wrong.

473
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,050
But I have my reasons.

474
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:56,719
Everyone has their reasons.

475
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,619
Everyone's busy with something.

476
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:02,860
I'm not saying you're not busy.
I have an unspeakable situation.

477
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,530
An unspeakable situation!

478
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,369
Ma'am.

Your daughter transferred
this semester, right?

480
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,739
Then you should attend it even more
this time.

481
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,110
I will hang up thinking
that you will come.

482
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,840
Hello?

483
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,340
Oh, my. I'm speechless.

484
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:24,150
How dare this wishy-washy woman...

485
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,150
I should clean them up once.

486
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,489
Wait a minute.

487
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:32,619
Should I really use this chance
to clean up there?

488
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
What do you think?

489
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:40,460
What if people find out
that you're a concubine...

490
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,269
I caught you.
I saw you write "concubine".

491
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:51,909
I'm just worried.

492
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,340
Everything will be revealed
if you go to places like that.

493
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,110
Who said I'll go there as Tan's mom?

494
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,659
I thought you were quitting school.
I guess I was wrong.

495
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:08,989
There's no reason for me to quit.

496
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,929
Really? Will you quit
if I make you a reason?

497
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:15,059
Let's hear what you have to say.
How will you make me quit?

498
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,630
We must determine our ranking
properly first.

499
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,230
What does your family do?

500
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,800
If you're an upstart,
how rich are you?

501
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:22,769
I have to know that now.

502
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:24,710
You're really childish.

503
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,280
You're really annoying.

504
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,639
Kim Tan and I are engaged.

505
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,309
Do you know what that means?

506
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:31,480
What is your point?

507
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,619
It doesn't mean that
he and I are dating.

508
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,119
It means the two companies
made a promise.

509
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,949
It means they will share
their stock and technology...

510
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,420
and try to create added value
that's worth billions of dollars.

511
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:44,389
Is that childish?

512
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:50,230
You just got in the middle
of this giant promise.

513
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,300
But is it childish?

514
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,500
Answer me now.

515
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:57,940
I also asked you in the US, right?

516
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,610
Who are you?

517
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:04,079
You will find out who I am soon...

518
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,650
since Young Do already knows.

519
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,280
Choi Young Do knows?

520
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,610
Did you come? We just started now.

521
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,710
Who...

522
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,250
It's our first time
meeting like this.

523
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:17,949
I'm the mom of Cha Eun Sang...

524
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,460
who transferred this semester.

525
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,139
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

526
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:46,449
We also have quite a schedule today.

527
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,989
For last year's leadership camp,

528
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:53,760
Myung Soo's mother
sponsored the flight tickets.

529
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,460
Rachel's mother sponsored
the children's outdoor outfits.

530
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,960
Please give them a big hand.

531
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:10,710
For this year's leadership camp...
He couldn't attend this meeting,

532
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,010
but Young Do's father sponsored
the hotel...

533
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,110
where the children will stay
this time.

534
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,550
We still haven't taken care of...

535
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,889
I will take care of it.

536
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:29,690
What will you take care of?

537
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:32,059
Whatever it is,
I'll take care of all the rest.

538
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,099
We still have the flight tickets,
car rides,

539
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,730
group outfit, meals left.

540
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,139
There are many left.

541
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,969
I don't care if there are
200 things left.

542
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:44,940
I will take care of everything.

543
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,409
All right. Please do so.

544
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,849
Please give her a big hand.

545
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:58,250
The chief director just arrived.

546
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,190
Who?

547
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,420
What are you going to do?

548
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,269
It's nice to see you.
Please sit down.

549
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,199
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

550
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:20,840
There's someone
I haven't seen before.

551
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,050
She's Cha Eun Sang's mother who
transferred in the second semester.

552
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,650
Is that so?

553
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:31,989
Do you have something to say?

554
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,860
I heard a lot about you,
Chief Director.

555
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,360
I heard you're Tan's mother.

556
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,300
Tan is so handsome.

557
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,670
He's tall, and he has
a straightforward personality.

558
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,670
You must know Tan well.

559
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,869
That's because...

560
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,739
Eun Sang always talks about Tan.

561
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,380
Maybe it's because I always hear
about him, it feels like I saw him.

562
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:02,519
If I had a daughter, I would want
to make him my son-in-law.

563
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:04,090
You have a daughter.

564
00:48:05,389 --> 00:48:06,489
Of course, I have a daughter.

565
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:08,590
I'll go to the bathroom
for a minute.

566
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,449
Are you crazy?
You can't be in your right mind.

567
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,949
I took a pill because I wasn't
in my right mind.

568
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,449
I don't care.
Nothing's going to stop me now.

569
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,789
And I'm feeling really uplifted
because it's my first time...

570
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:40,159
coming to a parent meeting.

571
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,789
So take it easy, Chief Director.

572
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:44,389
Focus on your son instead.

573
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,800
Fistfights shouldn't happen
at Jeguk High.

574
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:49,530
You didn't know that your son
was tarnishing...

575
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,869
the name of Jeguk, did you?

576
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,099
You only say that he's my son
in occasions like this.

577
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,900
Kids fight while they grow up.

578
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,409
Well, you wouldn't know.

579
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:58,340
Do you even know whose son
he fought with?

580
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,480
Whose son did he fight with?

581
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,210
Is it one of them?

582
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,780
Is it the woman
who looks like a red fox?

583
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,250
You know, the woman with short hair
and jawbreaker necklace.

584
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,219
That woman who looks like
a red fox is your in-law.

585
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,789
Tan's future mother-in-law.

586
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:15,059
Is she Rachel's mom?

587
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:16,219
Want me to introduce you to her?

588
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,730
Do you want to go say hello?

589
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,130
- That's crazy.
- Go back to the house right now...

590
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:22,429
if you don't want to break off
Tan's engagement.

591
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,300
So what does
Cha Eun Sang's family do?

592
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,329
What are her grades like?

593
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:59,969
Come on. Just tell us a name
of your mom or dad.

594
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,500
Is it that hard?

595
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:05,739
An upstart must have articles
about it on websites at least.

596
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,039
Nothing will pop up.
There isn't anything like that.

597
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:10,250
You're not an upstart
if that's the case.

598
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,119
Do you know how sensitive Korea is
when it comes to money?

599
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,079
How could there be no articles about
a company that got rich overnight?

600
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:17,489
Come to think of it,

601
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:20,159
I never saw you ride a car
to school.

602
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:22,519
If you don't want to say
your parents' names,

603
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,329
tell us the name of your company.

604
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,929
Is it a listed company?
What's the item?

605
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:28,500
Why are you curious about that?

606
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,269
Why are you only curious about mine?

607
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,199
How dare you talk back?

608
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,840
Just answer what we're asking.
Tell us.

609
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,110
- Kang Ye Sol.
- Yes?

610
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,210
You shouldn't touch her.

611
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:55,789
This is amazing news.

612
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:59,630
Upstart, what does your family
really do?

613
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,260
I just got a call from my mom,
she said Eun Sang's mom is amazing.

614
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:04,869
What's amazing?

615
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,400
There was a parent meeting today.

616
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:08,800
What her mom wore from head to toe
was worth a foreign car.

617
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,940
She even rode the best car,
so all of the moms were intimidated.

618
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:18,949
Are you sure?

619
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,250
Does your family do something
regarding private loans, I mean...

620
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:24,349
Cash business?

621
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,389
Cha Eun Sang's mom will
pay everything for our camp...

622
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:28,889
except for accommodations.

623
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:38,500
Did my mom actually "say" that
she would pay for everything?

624
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,670
The concept of this FW season is...

625
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,269
to appeal comfortable beauty
when you wear our clothes.

626
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:45,840
You don't have to
try to look pretty.

627
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,710
Pose as naturally as possible.

628
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,150
We're not trying to shoot
a boring styling photo shoot.

629
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,380
(CEO Choi Dong Wook)

630
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,300
Why didn't you answer my call
and make me come here?

631
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:10,030
I couldn't answer any calls.

632
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,829
I can't see the lines properly.

633
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,500
That isn't for style.

634
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,239
It is to maintain the body shape
when you wear it.

635
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,440
Try posing again.

636
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,079
Mom, did you go
to the parent meeting today?

637
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,079
Of course.

638
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,909
I've spent so much on that meeting.

639
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,349
- Is the next outfit ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

640
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,650
- You saw Cha Eun Sang's mom, right?
- I did.

641
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,650
She was carrying a handbag
that even I couldn't get.

642
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:34,159
There are only 20 of those
in the world.

643
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:36,219
Is that true?

644
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,559
Is she really Cha Eun Sang's mom?

645
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,969
Isn't your mom mistaken?

646
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:48,440
Hey. My mom is the most famous
lawyer in Korea after my dad.

647
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:50,409
I blocked it.

648
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:53,710
That's impossible.
That can't happen.

649
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,750
I was embarrassed in front of
Young Do. It's so embarrassing.

650
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:01,719
Young Do won't come today, will he?

651
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:04,019
I think he went to do
volunteer work with Tan.

652
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,960
Anyway, we should try to have
Tan and Young Do make up now.

653
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:09,719
Locking them up in a warehouse
would be the best.

654
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,730
If we do that to them now,

655
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,130
they might fight to death
and only one of them...

656
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,199
will come out alive.

657
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:19,300
What?

658
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:23,869
You can do it by yourself, right?

659
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,139
Go home after you've done my share.

660
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,110
I'm sick of cleaning.

661
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,820
I always clean up hotel rooms.

662
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,550
Please do it for me.

663
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:44,190
Are you going home?

664
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,199
Why? Do you miss your real mom?

665
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,670
Did your mom come
to the parent meeting today?

666
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:02,539
I forgot.

667
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:04,650
Your mom ran away, right?

668
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,349
Why are you responding like this?
You're making me excited.

669
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:11,349
You started it first,
three years ago and now.

670
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,099
What on earth is going on?

671
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,900
Mom, did you go to
the parent meeting today?

672
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,500
Please reply to me quickly.

673
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,539
Mom, did you really go?

674
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:34,639
Yes. I made
all of the women there...

675
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,239
look like squids today.

676
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:37,809
I totally squashed them.

677
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:40,250
How could you do such a thing?

678
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:43,420
- What?
- How could you think like that?

679
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:45,619
Are you angry?

680
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,460
I'm sorry, son. I was thoughtless.

681
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,400
I was just curious about...

682
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:57,030
what kind of kids
you go to school with,

683
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:59,730
how your friend's moms look like,

684
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,510
how you do parent meetings,

685
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,510
and what you do there.

686
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:08,710
Mom.

687
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,380
Yes?

688
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,750
Cut down the wine. I'm worried.

689
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,750
I will.

690
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,090
You have a guest.

691
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:23,590
He says he's Tan's friend.

692
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:26,289
Friend?

693
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:42,309
Hello, Tan.

694
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,190
The chief director, no,

695
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,860
where is your mother? I should say
hello before we hang out.

696
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:11,710
I'm sorry,

697
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,940
but could you please give me
a glass of water?

698
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,050
Oh... Sure.

699
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,460
Mom.

700
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,530
Say hello.

701
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,130
He's my friend.

702
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,969
What are you doing?

703
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,739
I didn't know since your mom I knew
is a different person.

704
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,539
She must be your real mother.

705
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,280
I'll talk outside, Mom.

706
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,420
Come out before I kill you.

707
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,250
I'm sorry I looked down on you.

708
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,349
I didn't know you were
such a scumbag.

709
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,949
Now that you know, why don't you
go on your knees?

710
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,320
I tried not to do this
before your mom.

711
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,289
If that's what you wanted,

712
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,400
you made the wrong plan,
Choi Young Do.

713
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,039
What?

714
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,010
I think I made a proper plan.

715
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,429
Are you so close that
she even comes to your house?

716
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,130
Well, this isn't
what I came here for.

717
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:23,809
It's like I hit the jackpot.

718
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,380
We shouldn't involve our families
in our fights anymore.

719
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,920
We only have one thing left.

720
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,050
Poor Cha Eun Sang.

721
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,349
Midterms are soon.

722
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:12,420
- How are you so good at studying?
- This is unbelievable.

723
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,460
What do I have to do
to break off my engagement with Tan?

724
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,320
What do you want to achieve
from doing this?

725
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,030
I want to see if you can exchange
everything you enjoy...

726
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,260
with Cha Eun Sang or not.

727
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,159
But coming out of Tan's house
early in the morning?

728
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:23,429
What's your deal, really?

729
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:25,769
Let's start dating from today.

730
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:37,679
(The Heirs)
