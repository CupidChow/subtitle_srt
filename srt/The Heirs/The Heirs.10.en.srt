(The Heirs)

3
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,829
(Episode 10)

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,969
I'm sorry I looked down on you.

5
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,340
I didn't know you were
such a scumbag.

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,880
Now that you know, why don't you
go on your knees?

7
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,549
I tried not to do this
before your mom.

8
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,079
If that's what you wanted,

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,890
you made the wrong plan,
Choi Young Do.

10
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,560
What?

11
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,500
I think I made a proper plan.

12
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,709
Are you so close that
she even comes to your house?

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,750
Well, this isn't
what I came here for.

14
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:25,260
It's like I hit the jackpot.

15
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,510
I made plans with Eun Sang.

16
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,310
I'm so sorry about this. Let's take
a rain check on the performance.

17
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,879
As you can see,

18
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,420
I don't think I can't keep
the promise.

19
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:57,019
Don't mind me.

20
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,659
I'll go home. Text me later.

21
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,790
- Cha Eun Sang.
- Just go.

22
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,560
Go straight.

23
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,139
What are you doing?

24
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,879
What do you think I'm doing?

25
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,780
This family has so many secrets,
but she's coming in and out freely.

26
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,520
That means only one thing.

27
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,719
Is she your sister?

28
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,650
We're brothers, you jerk.

29
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,560
I mean, why don't you make
an excuse at least?

30
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,389
How could she come in and out
so openly?

31
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,659
Does your fiancee know about this?

32
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm dating Cha Eun Sang.

33
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,569
It's not an excuse.
It's an explanation.

34
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,740
And Rachel already knows.

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,569
Do you want to stay longer?

36
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,569
I have business to take care of.

37
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,139
Are you running away?

38
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,139
No, I'm on my way
to taking revenge on you.

39
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,680
You must have come...

40
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:58,080
to my house prepared, right?

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,819
What are you talking about?

42
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,250
Follow me if you're curious.

43
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,759
You'll also have to follow me
if you don't want to regret it.

44
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,169
Tan?

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,139
Yes, how have you been?

46
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,110
I heard you came back from the US.

47
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:25,240
I wouldn't have recognized you
if I saw you on the street.

48
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,509
You look like quite a man now.

49
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,879
Chairman Kim must feel reassured.

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,949
What are you doing right now?

51
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,849
I told you that
you would be curious.

52
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,060
Actually, I came here to apologize
for something.

53
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,490
- Apologize?
- Don't.

54
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,860
You be quiet.

55
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:45,729
Go on.

56
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,099
We had a minor quarrel.

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,370
I hit Young Do.

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,169
I hit him twice.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,569
It was a mistake,
and I'm reflecting on my mistake.

60
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,639
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,849
Is that so? Well, boys fight
while growing up.

62
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,280
It's better
than just holding a grudge.

63
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,819
I think it's healthier that way.

64
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,219
You even came to apologize.

65
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:14,389
I can see you grew up very well.

66
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,600
I feel easier
now that I apologized to you.

67
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,470
Thank you for accepting my apology.

68
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,300
See you at school, Young Do.

69
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,259
You let him beat you up twice?

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,699
How could you get beaten up?

71
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,230
You should have won!

72
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,100
You should have won in the end
at all costs.

73
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,939
I should be the only one
you can't beat.

74
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:03,540
Don't you think so?

75
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,310
Father, you're really healthy.

76
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,579
You don't hold anything in, and vent
it out immediately like this.

77
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,120
Don't be sarcastic.

78
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,660
Just go. I don't want to see you.

79
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:30,439
Young Do. Hello.

80
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,120
Were you also like this
when Mom was around?

81
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,149
Or...

82
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,560
did my mom also use to be like this?

83
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,449
Give it to me.

84
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,550
Gosh.

85
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,120
- Wait a minute.
- What is wrong with you?

86
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,610
We shouldn't involve our families
in our fights anymore.

87
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,410
We already went through it before.

88
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,819
This is my last warning.

89
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,949
If you say so,

90
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,589
we only have one thing left.

91
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,660
Poor Cha Eun Sang.

92
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,600
Don't you dare touch her.

93
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,129
Don't cheer for me.

94
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,800
Or you'll make me want
to do my best.

95
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,009
I also warned you.

96
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,160
I came because I was worried.

97
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:13,029
I heard you fought with Tan
at school. Are you okay?

98
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't worry about me.
I'll take care of it.

99
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,339
I'll go complain to the chief
director. I just can't let it slide.

100
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,410
Your handsome face
is a mess right now.

101
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,779
You're still swollen.

102
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,179
Just take care of your son-in-law.

103
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,250
Neither of us is related to you.

104
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,289
Stand in the line
that will benefit you.

105
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,929
I thought it was this line.

106
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,830
Didn't you see "Authorized Personnel
Only" at the entrance?

107
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:51,139
Do I have to express my opinions
in bad ways?

108
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,169
Stop it. I understood.

109
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,470
See you next time.

110
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,299
It's been a long time.

111
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,690
Where are you?

112
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,720
Let's meet for a moment
if you're at the hotel.

113
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,029
I can see you now.

114
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,269
Since when were you there?

115
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,080
Since the moment
you took your lipstick out.

116
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,379
This also happened to us
in the past.

117
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,250
It's already been over 20 years.

118
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,490
It was in front of Haklim Cafe
in Daehak-ro.

119
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,529
Do you think I'm still
someone's first love?

120
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,200
You're not that pretty.

121
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,750
You two seem to have
gotten a lot closer.

122
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,879
We went to the same college.

123
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,950
Didn't I tell you that?

124
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,179
I guess you must have wanted
to hide it.

125
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,820
Tell me about how Esther was
during college sometime.

126
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,889
Sure. Whenever you want.

127
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,899
How is the Jeju Convention
Center going?

128
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,299
I'm waiting for...

129
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:02,629
CEO Kim's calls,
but he hasn't called me yet.

130
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,269
He's carefully deliberating it.

131
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,970
I'll leave the two of you to talk.

132
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,779
He's constantly arrogant.
He's also rude.

133
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,210
Are you being jealous right now?

134
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,149
Don't you care about
the eyes of people passing by?

135
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,559
What are you two doing?

136
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,320
Should I have met him
in my office...

137
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,929
just like you did?

138
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:33,700
What does she mean?

139
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,870
What should I do about dinner?

140
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,870
Hasn't Tan come home yet?

141
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,379
Where did he go?

142
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:07,100
You look so unwell.

143
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,399
Do I look unwell?

144
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,940
Thank you.

145
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,649
Is it Tan?

146
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:29,720
Where have you been?
What about him? Did he leave?

147
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,919
He left earlier.

148
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,419
Why did you do that?

149
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,159
Why did you tell him that?

150
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:38,059
He's Young Do, the friend
you always hung out with, right?

151
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,070
I heard his father was remarrying
Rachel's mother.

152
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,169
What are you going to do
if the in-laws find out?

153
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,470
Can't we just tell everyone
the truth?

154
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,409
What did we do that's wrong?

155
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:50,980
What's gotten into you?

156
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,840
You didn't do anything wrong,
but I did.

157
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,950
- So you should never...
- I'm sorry.

158
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,350
Why are you sorry?

159
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,919
What are you sorry for?

160
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,590
I'm just sorry for everything, Mom.

161
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,700
Just hurry up and eat dinner.

162
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,269
Ms. Park, please set dinner for him.

163
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,139
Excuse me...

164
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,950
Did Eun Sang come home?

165
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,519
The person you're calling cannot...

166
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,730
Choi Young Do left.
Why aren't you coming home?

167
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,169
Thank you for texting me.

168
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:54,269
Darn it.

169
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,419
Aren't you even curious about
what I said to Choi Young Do?

170
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
We need to get our stories straight.

171
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,029
What did you say?

172
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,960
I told him that I was dating you.

173
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,769
- What?
- Do you have a better idea?

174
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,039
How could you say such a lie?

175
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,240
Who said it was a lie?

176
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,470
I'm going to date you.

177
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,779
Let's start dating from today.

178
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,909
- Kim Tan.
- So you do know my name.

179
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,850
Do you know it's your first
time calling me by my name?

180
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,320
Are you a fool?
Or are you narcissistic?

181
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,419
Do you not understand
what I've been saying until now?

182
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:44,460
Let's say that I'm a fool.

183
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,690
I like you
whether you get angry or smile.

184
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,190
I really am a fool then.

185
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,730
You're so spoiled, you don't
even know how scary the world is.

186
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
What?

187
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,830
Let's date then.

188
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,340
Break off your engagement
with Rachel...

189
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,769
and get kicked out of the house.

190
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,840
Let's see if you'll still like me
when that happens.

191
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:07,309
We will break up in the end
and I'll be the only one hurt.

192
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,350
But let's still give it a try.

193
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,850
So you decided that we will break up
after dating?

194
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,950
Didn't you know?

195
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,889
If your mother finds out about this,
my mom and I...

196
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,120
will be out in the streets.

197
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,559
So stop sounding so spoiled,
Young Master.

198
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,370
Do you really...

199
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,269
think my feelings are a joke?

200
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,909
How I feel about is a joke to you?

201
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,440
Do you think my effort is a joke?

202
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,049
Do you really think
I'm a good match for you?

203
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,250
Okay.

204
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,320
I think you're right.

205
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,090
You're not a good match for me.

206
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,820
You don't deserve me.

207
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:55,789
Do you know why?

208
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,600
It's not because
you hurt my pride,

209
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:02,070
or hurt my feelings
trying to protect yourself...

210
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,399
by mentioning my family history,

211
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,370
I plucked up courage for you,

212
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,309
but you didn't do
anything at all for me.

213
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,279
Okay.

214
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,580
If you wish it that much,
I'll leave you alone.

215
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:23,889
I thought it was a pretty dream,

216
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,460
but it was a bad dream,
Cha Eun Sang.

217
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,799
I think it's Eun Sang.
Do you also want me to pick her up?

218
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,700
Do you think it's right...

219
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,740
for her and me
to get in the same car?

220
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,809
Stop being unnecessarily diligent.

221
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,799
We were sorry about last time.
There was a misunderstanding.

222
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,140
You're not holding
a grudge, are you?

223
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,009
Don't you want to study
at my house together?

224
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,740
My mom wants to invite you.

225
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,650
What brand is your mom's handbag
she held at the parent's meeting?

226
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,650
My mom said...

227
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,549
I'm sorry, but let's not resolve
that misunderstanding.

228
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,079
I'll go first.

229
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,049
What?

230
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,670
Rachel.

231
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,640
How many times have you gone
to your fiance's house?

232
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,980
Did you eat something
wrong for breakfast?

233
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,640
I guess you have never.

234
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,779
Just cut to the chase.

235
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,920
I went to my friend's house
unannounced yesterday.

236
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,589
I saw something amazing there.

237
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,890
But I think I wasn't
supposed to see that.

238
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,589
My friend was really angry.

239
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:45,599
What did you see?

240
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,130
Cut it out.

241
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,400
It looks like it will be hard to
talk since your cheek is swollen.

242
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:00,779
Choi Young Do and Kim Tan,
come out.

243
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,740
Aren't you going to behave?

244
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,380
Riding a snow board
can be difficult.

245
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,849
Falling down is all part of
the learning experience,

246
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,250
even for snowboarders.

247
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,619
So how do you keep
from hurting yourself...

248
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,420
while you're still
in the stage of training?

249
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,289
Snowboarders' bundle.

250
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,730
This handy device is
more like a vest,

251
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,930
but it's bigger. Much bigger.

252
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,440
When you start to fall down,
snowboarders fall down...

253
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,670
and recover their balance
quickly and easily.

254
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,339
What happened
at the parent meeting?

255
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,880
It would be fast.

256
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,740
Someone we know
went instead of Mom.

257
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,579
They'll be fast right off.

258
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:14,849
Please don't forget the rules
before attempting...

259
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,450
You keep making secrets from me.

260
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,559
Flapping. This is a move
that is called "flapping".

261
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:26,059
Once you're away, you will get
away in time.

262
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,400
That way...

263
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,700
Did you fight with Kim Tan?

264
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,809
I'm running away.

265
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,309
Did you enjoy the performance?

266
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,380
What performance?

267
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,910
The performance you were going
to watch with Tan.

268
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,380
Didn't you go to Tan's house
because of that?

269
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,720
We couldn't watch it because of you.
You already know that.

270
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,990
I'm sorry.

271
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,990
I wasn't being considerate.

272
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,660
When you even said you were
on a welfare scholarship yourself.

273
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,460
Okay, then.

274
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,730
I have a question at this point.

275
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,869
Who was your mom that appeared
at the parent meeting?

276
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,440
The daughter is on a welfare
scholarship and...

277
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,940
does several part-time jobs.

278
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,250
But the mom pays a lot of money
at once for a camp?

279
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,920
Who is your mom?

280
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,089
She's someone unimaginable to you.

281
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,019
And the standard hourly wage is
5.21 dollars.

282
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,930
Can you just go now?
Midterms are soon.

283
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,529

That's embarrassing.

I'll check the list of people
who didn't sign up for the camp.

The five of you aren't going, right?

312

Students who aren't going to camp
can come to school as usual.

Kim Tan, aren't you going? Why?

00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,789
Dinner courses are too long
when we have nothing to talk about.

326
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,490
Okay.

327
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,430
I don't care who you like or date.

328
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,369
You know our engagement has nothing
to do with that genre, right?

329
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,470
- I don't know.
- It's your loss if you don't know.

330
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:42,309
It's also the loss of your family
and Jeguk Group.

331
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,740
Why aren't you going to camp?

332
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,279
What will you do if I bully
Cha Eun Sang at camp?

333
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:49,250
Are you already tired of each other?

334
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,049
Or did you get dumped?

335
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,049
You seem to be avoiding each other.

336
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,619
I'm thinking about it.

337
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:57,019
About what?

338
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,859
The way to protect myself...

339
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,960
from everyone including you.

340
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,829
The way to protect her.

341
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,759
Okay, then.

342
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,329
Think hard about it.
I'll root for you.

343
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,470
If you're done talking,
I'll get going.

344
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,710
What was Choi Young Do
talking about last time?

345
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,640
What did he see at your house?

346
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,910
If my engagement is that
kind of genre as you said,

347
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,420
you have no reason to know, right?

348
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,690
What are you here for again?

349
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,930
How did you know it was me?

350
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,869
From the smell of red ginseng.

351
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,269
I really think you shouldn't
be clinging to Tan.

352
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,640
Was I clinging to him?

353
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,410
Yes, whenever I saw you.

354
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:57,380
Stop pretending you know everything.

355
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,250
It's because I'm jealous.

356
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,549
I couldn't even try to cling.

357
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,890
We've met before, right?

358
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,829
Union Hotel isn't budging with their
terms of the contract change.

359
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:21,599
They still must be friendly
with their Chinese boyfriend.

360
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,230
What about Zeus?

361
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,299
I saw CEO Choi Dong Wook
a few days ago,

362
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,200
and he seemed to be
waiting desperately.

363
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,809
And he contacted to ask if you'd
like to play golf with him today.

364
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,240
Golf?

365
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,839
So he wants us
to be partners openly?

366
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,509
He says you should go rounding all
together with Young Do and Tan.

367
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:40,019
He thinks we're a family.

368
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,150
Let's talk about it again tomorrow.
I need to go out now.

369
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,519
Are you going to meet Jeon Hyun Joo?

370
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:54,400
I think you said it yourself that
it was none of your business.

371
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,670
How about not meeting her
for a while?

372
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,299
- Are you...
- I think the chairman...

373
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,769
put a tail on you.

374
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,539
The chairman already knows
about your relationship...

375
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,380
with Jeon Hyun Joo.

376
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,170
Why are you telling me this?

377
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,539
You're one of my father's people.

378
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,240
When I worked with the chairman
and when I'm working with you now,

379
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,009
I'm just one of your employees.

380
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,549
I think you should make a choice.

381
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,190
The chairman isn't patient.

382
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:54,920
He will ask me whether I will have
Jeguk Group or one woman.

383
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:57,789
What will you do?

384
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,380
I can't go today. Don't wait for me.

385
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:18,720
Is today the day?

386
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,519
I guess we're breaking up today.

387
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,230
Hyun Joo.

388
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,170
How did you know I'm here?

389
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:46,509
I went through my mom's drawer
to look for your resume.

390
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,910
My dad is a prosecutor,
so I'm scrupulous.

391
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,380
What is this car?
Is it illegal by any chance?

392
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,049
My birthday was in early summer,
so I'm past 18 years old.

393
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,759
I'm sure you didn't know.

394
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,289
Why did you come here?

395
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,529
The college entrance exam is soon.
You should be studying.

396
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,200
You're right. But my private tutor
quit without telling me.

397
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,799
Heartlessly.

398
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,140
Since you quit teaching me,

399
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,069
I'm not your student anymore, right?

400
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,039
What?

401
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,319
Good night.

402
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,279
They look like characters
from a movie together like this.

403
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:59,380
Rachel looks like a flower that
just bloomed early in the morning.

404
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,819
She keeps getting prettier.

405
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,250
Rachel must not look pretty
in Tan's eyes.

406
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,990
That's not possible.

407
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:12,599
Tan is just not good at expressing
his feelings.

408
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,730
Girls might be frustrated with him.

409
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,130
Is that so?

410
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,170
But who is...

411
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,000
Cha Eun Sang?

412
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,140
Her mom said that she always
talks about you.

413
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,210
Tan and she are close.

414
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,980
- Are they?
- Well, everyone wants Tan...

415
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,980
as their son-in-law.

416
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,279
Rachel, you must guard him well.

417
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,190
I'm sorry, but...

418
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,789
what do I have to do
to break off my engagement with Tan?

419
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,230
I don't want to be
Kim Tan's fiancee anymore.

420
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,170
Can I just take my engagement
ring off and give it back?

421
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,269
- Did you fight?
- What's the problem?

422
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:54,670
Did you talk this through?

423
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,970
Let's talk about it without them.

424
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,039
Let's do that.

425
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,940
You can go first.

426
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,929
I said what you wanted to say.
How could you treat me like this?

427
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,960
What do you want to achieve
from doing this?

428
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,730
Seeing you be in despair, get hurt,

429
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,860
and collapse
after realizing the reality.

430
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,829
I still won't date you.

431
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,329
You also can't date Cha Eun Sang.

432
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,940
Do you really think I'm doing this
to break off our engagement?

433
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,340
Just see what will happen
from now on.

434
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,239
See how your family and
my family will respond.

435
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,179
You're becoming the worst.

436
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,519
While my affection turned
into anger,

437
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,019
what did you do?

438
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,789
(Father)

439
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,659
It already started. Let's see.

440
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,070
I want to see if you can exchange
everything you enjoy...

441
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,469
with Cha Eun Sang or not.

442
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:14,519
Explain what happened.

443
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,730
Why is Rachel saying she wants to
break off the engagement?

444
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,329
You know why, don't you?

445
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:30,469
She wants to break off
the engagement?

446
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,099
What in the world is happening?

447
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:37,440
Eun Sang!

448
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,579
Cha Eun Sang!

449
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,349
Why is she saying that?

450
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,380
I don't like Rachel.

451
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:51,150
Do you think that can be a reason?

452
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,860
I keep thinking that
your brother was right.

453
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:02,030
I think it was better
when you were in the US...

454
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,769
for you and Rachel, you and me,

455
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,210
me and your brother,
and your brother and you.

456
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,039
You're different from Won.

457
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,309
Yes, because I'm a bastard.

458
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,119
That's why you need Rachel.

459
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,690
We're doing this for your sake.

460
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:26,289
You need insurance to obtain power.

461
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,630
Rachel is the best insurance
among everything.

462
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,630
I don't need that kind of insurance.

463
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:37,929
This house...

464
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,739
becomes lonelier when I'm here.

465
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,550
You know Young Do, right?

466
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,219
Didn't he say anything about Tan
to the other kids by any chance?

467
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:01,659
Things like "Tan's real mom
is a different person."

468
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,159
No, not that I heard of.

469
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,699
Why did Rachel say she wants to
break off the engagement then?

470
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:13,900
Are Rachel and Tan
on bad terms at school?

471
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,210
I'm not sure.

472
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,110
We sent you to the school.
You should know things like that.

473
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:21,409
I'm sorry.

474
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:23,849
Mom, I...

475
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:31,190
Will you keep having her
spying on me?

476
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,320
You're making me do that!

477
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,360
You should go to the camp
and be good to Rachel.

478
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,230
Be good to her in front of everyone.

479
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,730
Girls are weak for that, okay?

480
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,929
But I'm not going to camp.

481
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:46,000
What kind of nonsense is this?

482
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,039
Why won't you go when I spent
so much money?

483
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,170
I didn't ask you to do that.

484
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,039
That punk!

485
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,949
I'm so upset.

486
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Hey.

487
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,690
We need to talk.

488
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,659
Why aren't you going to camp?

489
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,099
Because I hate seeing you.

490
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:16,030
Still, you not going to camp is...

491
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,139
Wait a minute.
I just need one minute.

492
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,510
I don't want to.

493
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:25,570
What are you doing
in front of my room?

494
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,570
Come in
if you have something to say.

495
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,010
I guess you don't have any.

496
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,039
I do.

497
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,110
Say it. What about the camp?

498
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,210
You should go to the camp.
How could I go?

499
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,349
Think about
how your mother will feel.

500
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,920
She spent money generously
for her son and his friends.

501
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,179
How could you not go?

502
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,650
You must have been together
with Young Do in a room like this.

503
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,460
What?

504
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,420
When he called you to his hotel.

505
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,329
What did you talk about?

506
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,789
Why are you bringing that up...

507
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,159
Tan.

508
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,039
- Why?
- Why are you blocking the door?

509
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,739
Why do you keep trying to come into
your grown-up son's room?

510
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,440
I took my clothes off to shower.

511
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:38,840
I'm sorry.

512
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,909
What did your father say earlier?

513
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,949
He said that I need Rachel
because I'm a bastard.

514
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,119
How could he say things
in such a cruel manner?

515
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,389
Good night, then.
I'll go to him and...

516
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,929
You can breathe.

517
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,239
What? Okay.

518
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,880
Think about going to camp again.

519
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,079
I'm not going.

520
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:20,949
If I go, only one person between
Young Do and me will survive.

521
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:21,949
Should I still go?

522
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,789
Good night.

523
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,860
You might run into Mom
if you leave now.

524
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:31,230
I'll avoid her.

525
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:34,230
You won't. I'm going to scream
as soon as you leave.

526
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,239
- Scream.
- You told me to do it.

527
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,670
Mom!

528
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,239
Are you serious?

529
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,349
Wait a minute.
I just need one minute.

530
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,619
It's your first time
coming to my room.

531
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,150
I can't come here.

532
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,460
The room you live and the room
I live are different worlds.

533
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,329
There are thresholds in the world
that I can't cross.

534
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:06,400
This room is...

535
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,960
one of those thresholds.

536
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:31,449
Why don't you listen to what I say?

537
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,619
Just wait for a little longer.

538
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:36,690
I'll let you cross
all the thresholds in the world.

539
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,659
I'm thinking about the way.

540
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:46,539
Have fun at the camp.

541
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:49,610
I will miss you.

542
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,969
Lee Bo Na is so romantic.

543
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,739
What is this?

544
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:26,909
They're matching items for
Yoon Chan Young and Lee Bo Na.

545
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,139
It's perfect for me.

546
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:30,079
Right? It'd be perfect
for you to be slapped by it.

547
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,650
Move your pig feet away from this.

548
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:33,679
Did you just see me?

549
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,719
I didn't even blink an eye.

550
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,789
It's hard to be not intimidated
in moments like this.

551
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:40,460
Come to think of it,
I think I grew up well.

552
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,159
To be honest, I could've gotten hit
by Lee Bo Na in that situation.

553
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:46,800
Girls think that it won't hurt
when they hit people.

554
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,199
Why do they do that?

555
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,670
(2 Jungle, Mid One Deal,
Bot AP Meta for Season 4)

556
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,000
(Position, Advantages of the Meta)

557
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,940
This is why you always lose.

558
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,510
Let's wear these matching items
when we go to the camp.

559
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:06,980
Okay. Let's go buy them tomorrow.

560
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:10,690
I already bought them.

561
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,119
Buy me something else instead.

562
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:16,030
What else do you want?

563
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,500
Hug me, carry me on your back,
hold my hand, and just look at me.

564
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,829
See you tomorrow.

565
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:28,340
90 percent is physical contact.

566
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,309
Now I think
I shouldn't have held myself back.

567
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,079
Have you been holding back
until now?

568
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,409
Why would you hold that back?
What a pervert.

569
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,449
Pervert?

570
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,559
What will you be when you grow up?

571
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,860
Gosh.

572
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,230
Aren't you going to
put up your tent?

573
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:31,730
She will put it up.

574
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,440
That's what you think.

575
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,869
They're so spiteful.

576
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,670
I'll put it up for you.

577
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,079
Just put up half of it.
Don't do it for Rachel.

578
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,239
Put both of them up.

579
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,849
Won't you join me?

580
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,090
No, I won't.

581
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,389
Why won't you?

582
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:54,719
Just do it with me.

583
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,530
It will collapse
if you connect it with this.

584
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:07,440
Are you trying to build your grave?

585
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:11,469
Hold this.

586
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,739
That's a nice picture.

587
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:17,809
Look here.

588
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,119
Why are you taking photos
without telling me?

589
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,750
I'll get hurt
if you're too serious like that.

590
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,389
I remembered...

591
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,260
where I saw you.

592
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,000
What are you talking about?

593
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,900
It was early in the morning one day.

594
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,710
You came out of Tan's house,
in gym clothes. Right?

595
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,269
It was you, right?

596
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:47,039
- Early in the morning?
- Yes.

597
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,210
It was you.

598
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,579
I remember it clearly.

599
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,380
You were half-awake.

600
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,789
Why would I come out of his house?
You're mistaken.

601
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,940
The kids must be
having fun right now.

602
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,039
I'm jealous. Camp is fun.
You even do survivals.

603
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,010
The college entrance exam is soon.
How could you say that?

604
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,909
Why didn't you go?
It's your last camp.

605
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,820
Eun Sang went there.

606
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:29,119
So that she will miss me.

607
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,849
Why are you calling "Eun Sang"
so sweetly?

608
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,019
Are you that close?

609
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:37,429
I'm calling Eun Sang Eun Sang.
What do I call her then?

610
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:39,360
Don't call her like that.

611
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,460
Who are you to say that?

612
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:44,269
I'll let you off since you look
human at the least.

613
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,639
If I think of how you were
in the US last year...

614
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:50,139
What? When I tried to
commit suicide?

615
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,369
Are you smiling?

616
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,610
Are you still going to the hospital?

617
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:56,039
Of course. I'm also taking
my medicine on time.

618
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,510
My mom checks the numbers
every day.

619
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,119
Did anything change at home?

620
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,250
Not at all.

621
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:07,090
So I'm planning a big event.

622
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:10,659
I'm not sure whether I will
put it into action.

623
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,929
Don't do anything
that will threaten your life.

624
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,139
Hospital meals taste bad.
I won't do it ever again.

625
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,139
Gather around!

626
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:26,880
As you know, it's a team game
where the team...

627
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:28,980
of the final survivor wins.

628
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,610
The game rules are simple.

629
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:34,550
Hit your opponent's body with
a paint ball to make them out.

630
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:37,690
Like this?

631
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,360
You're good at shooting.

632
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,159
Throw your gun away.

633
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,670
Just let me off this once.

634
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:28,969
Say that on your last journey
to death.

635
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,539
Goodbye, my friend.

636
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:54,860
I won't be lonely since we'll be on
the last journey to death together.

637
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:11,250
Why are you hesitating?
Come on and shoot me!

638
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:30,329
Did you get shot?

639
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,599
You should live.

640
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:37,309
The world is a gift I give to you.

641
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:40,440
Why did you do that?

642
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:42,309
Why did you do that, you fool?

643
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:43,710
You're so pathetic.

644
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,380
- You little...
- Out!

645
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:02,400
Should I kill you or let you live?

646
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:07,369
I'll let you live if you tell me why
you came out of Tan's house...

647
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:08,369
early in the morning.

648
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:10,909
- It wasn't me.
- It was you.

649
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:12,070
No, it wasn't.

650
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,739
Let's say it's understandable
during the day.

651
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,710
Let's also say
it's understandable at night.

652
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,880
But coming out of Tan's house...

653
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,920
early in the morning?

654
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,750
What's your deal, really?

655
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:29,159
Are you adopted?

656
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,239
It looks delicious.

657
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,480
Do it properly.

658
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:00,960
No one is watching.

659
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,389
Follow me.

660
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,539
Bring your dishes here
if you're done eating.

661
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:53,940
Cha Eun Sang says she will wash
them for you.

662
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,579
Do you want me to help you?

663
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,360
You said you would help.
Why aren't you helping?

664
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,400
I'm helping you.

665
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,300
My existence itself will be helpful.

666
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,739
Why are there
so many dishes to wash?

667
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:28,539
Why are you doing this
all by yourself?

668
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,619
Is it because of you?

669
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,659
How old were you when you started
being friends with her?

670
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:42,659
I'm asking if you made her wash
the dishes by herself.

671
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,960
Let me change the question then.

672
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,599
You know that Cha Eun Sang is
on a welfare scholarship, right?

673
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:51,630
Yoon Chan Young, are you dirtying
your hands because of Cha Eun Sang?

674
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:53,570
- Lee Bo Na.
- What?

675
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,840
Do you know Eun Sang
is on a welfare scholarship too?

676
00:53:57,909 --> 00:53:58,969
Be quiet.

677
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:03,449
I was the only one who didn't know.

678
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,619
Why did everyone become quiet
as soon as I came?

679
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,219
Were you talking behind my back?

680
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:14,719
Myung Soo, do you also...

681
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,059
Choi Young Do,
I need to talk to you.

682
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,699
Why? What is it?

683
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,650
- I have a favor.
- Are you crazy?

684
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:40,179
I have an opinion.

685
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,449
I can only get your attention
when I do bad things, right?

686
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:47,820
That's really infuriating.

687
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,190
What kind of relationship
do you have with Kim Tan?

688
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,360
What's it to you?

689
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:56,099
What will you do about it?
Who do you think you are?

690
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,539
Just bully me as always.
Do what you've always been doing.

691
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:02,969
I'm not scared of you anymore.

692
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,050
(Kim Tan)

693
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,980
(Recent Call History,
Kim Tan)

694
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:27,719
Does it hurt?

695
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,559
How painful has it been for me
that I hit you?

696
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,199
You know how long I've put up
with you until now, right?

697
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,400
I'm not going to talk anymore.
It's past beyond that stage.

698
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,539
I don't care right now even if
you're the President's daughter.

699
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:46,139
- Rachel.
- Shut it.

700
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,409
You might want to apologize,
but you don't have the right.

701
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,909
And you can't say it's a
misunderstanding since I caught you.

702
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:55,250
Just be quiet if you're not going to
turn your other cheek for me.

703
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,920
Since I got hit today,

704
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,019
I'll do something worth getting hit
for the day.

705
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,789
- What?
- I can make a call, right?

706
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,090
Give me back my phone.

707
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:13,869
Let go of me.

708
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,269
I didn't introduce her to you.

709
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:20,480
Cha Eun Sang is mine from now on.

710
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:22,539
I'm the only one
who can bully her.

711
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,559
You've made a good decision.
This is more like you.

712
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,800
Don't jump to conclusions.

713
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,369
You didn't see half of
what I'm really like.

714
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,590
I'll show you from now on.

715
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:06,610
(The Heirs)
