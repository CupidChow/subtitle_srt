1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,679
(The Heirs)

2
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,329
(The Heirs)

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,129
(The Final Episode)

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,549
It's cold...

5
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,950
today.

6
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,219
It's cold...

7
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,630
and dark.

8
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,680
You want to change
your legal guardian?

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
Yes, Father...

10
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,790
is in the hospital right now.

11
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,590
I guess his voting right has been
entrusted to Chief Director Jang.

12
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,290
Is this a fight for control
over the company?

13
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,560
It's to protect it.

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,090
Who do you want to change it to?

15
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,959
- My brother.
- There isn't a single person...

16
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,060
in the Jeguk Group legal team
that doesn't know me.

17
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,700
I know, but please do this for me.

18
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,670
As of right now, there isn't
a single person I can trust there.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,569
I need to change my legal guardian
before the shareholders' meeting.

20
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,109
Please be...

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,680
my lawyer.

22
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,079
Chairman Kim has 13.6 percent,
and Chief Director Jung has 4.7.

23
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,719
Chairman Kim's brothers have 5.2,
so the total is 23.5 percent.

24
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:00,189
You and Tan have a total
of 23.1 percent,

25
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,890
and if you add 5.37 percent from
Jeguk Holdings,

26
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,959
it's about 28.5 percent.

27
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,430
The biggest issues are...

28
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,599
the four percent under borrowed
names that Father's people handle,

29
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,270
and the 19 percent
that foreign shareholders have.

30
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,639
I guess it will all depend on how
the domestic shares of 25 percent...

31
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,710
will get divided up.

32
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,139
What do you think is the percentage
of those who will support you?

33
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,750
Let's meet Father's people first.

34
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,490
You said they were all
on Father's side.

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,360
But why isn't anyone here?

36
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,370
I guess they all chose
practical interest...

37
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,430
over morality.

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,530
Thank you for coming.

39
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,060
I've been with Chairman Kim
for 20 years.

40
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,930
- Of course, I should be here.
- I guess...

41
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,199
the others feel differently.

42
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,610
Thank you for coming.

43
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,610
I will work hard
so that you won't have regrets.

44
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,810
I feel much better since CEO Lee...

45
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,620
of RS International is here too.

46
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,719
I haven't decided on
which side I will stand on.

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,889
I want to stand on the side
that's against Chairman Kim,

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,819
but I'm not sure...

49
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,030
if this is the opposing side...

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
or if it's CEO Kim's side.

51
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,770
Chairman Kim collapsed?

52
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,669
Yes. Yesterday.

53
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,099
I heard he's unconscious.

54
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,039
That must be why he hasn't
been in contact.

55
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,039
Where is he hospitalized?

56
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,879
Tan isn't at the hospital.
He's on a business trip with my dad.

57
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,750
- A business trip?
- For ten days.

58
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,819
He must meet foreign shareholders
and get their power of attorney.

59
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,250
Did something happen
to their company?

60
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,319
It seems that way.

61
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,349
My dad said he's going to war,
not on a business trip.

62
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,419
They should be on the plane
right about now.

63
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,839
Are you nervous?

64
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,069
A bit.

65
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,170
You know why...

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,180
- you have to go too, right?
- Yes.

67
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,879
I am a young boy
who might lose his father,

68
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:42,589
and the chairman's young son...

69
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:44,860
whom he loved especially.

70
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:46,220
Right.

71
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,189
When it comes to business,

72
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,959
you have to move people's hearts
to get their signatures.

73
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,500
How did Father manage...

74
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,139
to fight this war for 20 years?

75
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,339
I know.

76
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,879
Get some sleep.
We have a busy schedule.

77
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,509
I'm sorry I left
without calling you first.

78
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,819
This is the owl that you wanted,
right?

79
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,620
I got him for you, so forgive me.

80
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,689
I might not be able to call because
I'm going on a business trip.

81
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,459
You're dead meat if you cheat on me
just because I'm gone.

82
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,689
I'll be back.

83
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,660
I'll miss you a lot, Cha Eun Sang.

84
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,339
Father, by any chance...

85
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,810
The investigation for my arrest
will start soon.

86
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,439
That's why I'm going
to go voluntarily.

87
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,779
Then what will happen?

88
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,949
Will you be imprisoned?

89
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,089
Listen to me carefully.

90
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,259
Don't trust anyone.

91
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,160
When it comes to running the hotel,

92
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,629
you just need to trust
the vice president.

93
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,399
If you need to tell me something
or if someone asks for your opinion,

94
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,670
make sure...

95
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,800
to do it through Lawyer Choi.
Do you understand?

96
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,209
If I can't come out soon,

97
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,379
go stay with your aunt.

98
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,579
Don't stay home alone.

99
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,550
Okay?

100
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,379
Don't neglect your kitchen duties...

101
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,689
just because I'm not here.

102
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,560
I'll try to get out
as soon as possible.

103
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Eat up.

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,569
Next up, the prosecution filed
a preliminary arrest warrant...

105
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,610
for Choi Dong Wook,
the CEO of Hotel Zeus, on the 24th.

106
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,410
Detectives have requested
a preliminary arrest warrant...

107
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,720
with the Seoul District
Prosecutor's office...

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,579
for additional punishment
regarding...

109
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,620
specific economic crimes
and legal malpractice.

110
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:05,529
What's going on with Father?

111
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:07,629
Have a seat.

112
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:09,930
Lawyer Park and Lawyer Lee couldn't
be here as they are needed in court.

113
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,000
What happened?

114
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,839
Do you know why your father
hired seven lawyers?

115
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,810
So we can worry about him,
not you.

116
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,879
You just need to continue
living your life,

117
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,310
and go to school.

118
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,680
The vice president will take care
of the hotel for the time being,

119
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,220
so you don't need to worry about
the hotel either.

120
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,120
Okay.

121
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,790
Oh, right. Your father asked me
to tell you this.

122
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,560
He said there has to be rules.
That you can't cheat.

123
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,670
Are you kidding?

124
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:45,439
- Do you think that makes sense?
- It does.

125
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,610
What's wrong?

126
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
Who is it?

127
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,519
It's Choi...

128
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,819
Young Do.

129
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:04,189
Choi Young Do?

130
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,660
The guy who bullied you?

131
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,660
Is that him?
The son of the hotel owner?

132
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:21,040
Why are you here?

133
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,639
Do you still want to torture me?

134
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,740
That's not why I'm here.

135
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,190
I came here because
I wanted to apologize.

136
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,620
I'm sorry about everything.
I'm serious.

137
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,389
I apologize.

138
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,899
I'm really sorry.

139
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,470
I'm surprised that
you know how to apologize,

140
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,580
but if you really feel sorry,

141
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,019
live the rest of your life
feeling guilty.

142
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,419
Okay. I'll do that.

143
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,059
I won't accept your apology...

144
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,230
ever.

145
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,799
Don't ever come back here.

146
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,860
Let's go.

147
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,720
A new life was born.

148
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,080
(Tan and Eun Sang)

149
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,090
Patients are dying due
to lack of medical facilities and...

150
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,389
Seoul seems colder than usual
without you in it.

151
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,429
Next up, the prosecution filed
a preliminary arrest warrant...

152
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:53,460
for Choi Dong Wook,
the CEO of Hotel Zeus, on the 24th.

153
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,470
Detectives have requested
a preliminary arrest warrant...

154
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,639
with the Seoul District
Prosecutor's office...

155
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,240
I just saw Young Do's father
on the news.

156
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,139
Nice to see you again, Steve.

157
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,549
Same here.

158
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,509
So this is Chairman Kim's second son
you told me about?

159
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,120
Yes.

160
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,820
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

161
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,289
How heavy must it be
to see your family...

162
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,360
go on the news
watched by the entire country?

163
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,039
I can just sign here?

164
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,570
Yes. Chairman Kim will be pleased.

165
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:44,879
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

166
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,519
- I wish you the best of luck.
- Thank you.

167
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,690
I wonder how much pain you,
Young Do, and the other kids...

168
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,460
had to endure for being
a part of the world...

169
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,929
that everyone longs to be a part of.

170
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,529
When you arrive first to school
every morning,

171
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,669
you sometimes see the person
who draws the chalk outline.

172
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,980
I was really surprised.

173
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,159
It wasn't just one person.

174
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,259
If we look at the next part...

175
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,259
One day it was Hyo Shin,

176
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,730
on another day it was Ye Sol,

177
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,830
and on another day...

178
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,539
it was Myung Soo, whom I
never expected as he's so bright.

179
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,740
And on another it was Rachel.

180
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,389
And today...

181
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,389
it was Young Do.

182
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:08,669
Maybe it was because
I found out that everyone did it,

183
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,940
but I couldn't continue being
envious or hating...

184
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,169
the other students.

185
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,159
(Tan and Eun Sang)

186
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,860
Tan, have you ever come early...

187
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,570
to draw the chalk outline?

188
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:17,740
Thank you.

189
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,399
Even if it's too heavy, too cruel,

190
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,940
or too sad,

191
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:59,409
I hope that getting hurt
isn't the only option.

192
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,590
Mr. Chang. The choice is yours,

193
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,230
but come join us. Please.

194
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,299
I hope that weight...

195
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,899
won't be a reason for you
to break down.

196
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,409
I miss you, Kim Tan.

197
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,820
(Daehan Hospital)

198
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,649
I'm back, Father.

199
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,250
He's gotten a lot better.

200
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,590
The doctors said the cerebral edema
has started to go down.

201
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,389
How did everything turn out?

202
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,929
Some couldn't decide,
and some refused to take sides.

203
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,899
But a lot of shareholders signed
the power of attorney.

204
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,940
Tan played a big role.

205
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,840
Thanks for going all that way.

206
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:02,970
How were things in Korea?

207
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
As expected,

208
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,779
the shareholders' meeting to dismiss
Father has been approved.

209
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,110
If the motion passes,

210
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,080
the owner of Jeguk Group
will change,

211
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,549
and an endless trial will start.

212
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,259
Regardless of what may happen,

213
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,059
I'll start preparing myself.

214
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,559
Let's not leave the house empty.

215
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,899
If Father's not home,
we have to be there instead.

216
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:28,730
Let's move in together.

217
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:49,990
I have something to tell you.

218
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:51,960
You need to meet with Young Do.

219
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,990
You guys aren't on completely
bad terms, right?

220
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,029
CEO Choi is getting investigated
by the prosecution.

221
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:01,870
He won't be able to come
to the shareholders' meeting,

222
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,639
but I think it would be okay
if Young Do got his voting right.

223
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,639
I'll meet him.

224
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,409
But promise me one thing.

225
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,409
What is it?

226
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,110
Even if CEO Choi gets imprisoned,

227
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:18,350
make sure you continue the business
you had planned with Hotel Zeus.

228
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,220
As long as I'm CEO,
I'll be sure to do it.

229
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,570
You're working hard, Cha Eun Sang.

230
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,130
Is Chairman Kim still unconscious?

231
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,599
- Yes.
- And the shareholders' meeting?

232
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,970
Is that happening?

233
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:13,799
Yes.

234
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Did your business trip end well?

235
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,880
Yes.

236
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,049
I didn't cheat on you.

237
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,890
You're so kind to me because
I'm so pitiful right now.

238
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,519
While we're on that topic,

239
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:34,430
can you hold my hand?

240
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,730
Why are you holding my hand
with your strength?

241
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,269
You should hold it
with your feelings.

242
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,440
My feelings are strong too.

243
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:47,940
Stay still.

244
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,240
Were you worried?

245
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,109
I'm sorry.

246
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,579
I'll try to overcome it well.

247
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:01,349
I missed you.

248
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,259
Be strong, Kim Tan.

249
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,460
I will.

250
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,329
I'm sorry for coming here with
my problems at this time.

251
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,769
It's about
the shareholders' meeting.

252
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:25,180
Has the motion for your father's
dismissal been submitted?

253
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
- Yes.
- Was it Chief Director Jung?

254
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,410
Yes.

255
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,079
Moms are always the problem,
whether you don't have one or a lot.

256
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:36,890
Help me.

257
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,519
Even if we can't be friends,

258
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,490
I'll repay you for this.

259
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,690
Repay me right now.

260
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,660
Think of this...

261
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,369
as the compensation
for everything bad...

262
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,569
I ever said about your mom.

263
00:18:58,339 --> 00:18:59,609
You don't have to come.

264
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,009
You can just send me your power
of attorney through your lawyer.

265
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,779
Okay.

266
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,450
How's your father? Is he okay?

267
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,619
Worry about yourself.

268
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,549
You're being a jerk
even when I'm worrying about you.

269
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,259
Thanks.

270
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:16,490
Go. I need to go wash dishes.

271
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,130
Wash dishes?

272
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,640
The only thing that
I can do right now...

273
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,809
is to wash some dishes.

274
00:19:58,539 --> 00:19:59,700
What are you doing here?

275
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,410
I'm here as the vice president
of Jeguk Constructions.

276
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
I see.

277
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,180
- Have a seat.
- Just stay there.

278
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,049
I'm here to ask you a favor,

279
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,109
and I need to get your word.

280
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,589
So I'm going to stand here and be
as polite and pitiful as possible.

281
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,359
This is about
the shareholders' meeting, right?

282
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,130
This happened as soon as
I became vice president.

283
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,099
I wonder if I'm a disaster
to Jeguk Group.

284
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,259
Are you using sympathy
for today's talk?

285
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,299
If it works,
I'm willing to do anything.

286
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,869
If you're here to do business,

287
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,309
you have to offer something else
than your charms.

288
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,009
I'm glad my charms work on you.

289
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,549
Give me the power of attorney.
I'll sign it.

290
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,519
I can't go there personally
because I'm busy.

291
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,160
Thank you.

292
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:04,940
Make sure...

293
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,440
to be well.

294
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:10,609
You too.

295
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,119
I guess my father's vote
became really important.

296
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,319
Yes.

297
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,329
Are you aware that it could sound
like you're willing to marry me?

298
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,700
Yes.

299
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:36,900
Are you going to come to
the temporary shareholders' meeting?

300
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,200
Are you okay with marrying me?

301
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,680
(The 2nd Temporary
Shareholders' Meeting)

302
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,670
(The 2nd Temporary
Shareholders' Meeting)

303
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,140
As of this moment, we will start the
temporary shareholders' meeting...

304
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,940
regarding the dismissal of
Jeguk Group's Chairman Kim Nam Yoon.

305
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,910
Can anyone who is outside
come in and take their seats?

306
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:54,809
(Ballot Box)

307
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,150
(The 2nd Temporary
Shareholders' Meeting)

308
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,380
(Ballot Box)

309
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,230
I will announce the results
of the ballots.

310
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,740
The dismissal of Chairman
Kim Nam Yoon of Jeguk Holdings is...

311
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,609
(The 2013 2nd Temporary
Shareholders' Meeting)

312
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,880
52 percent are against it,

313
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,319
44 percent agree with it,

314
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,619
and four percent have abstained.

315
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:43,230
As a result, the terms of
the resolution have not been met,

316
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,859
so the motion to dismiss
Chairman Kim Nam Yoon...

317
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,700
has been rejected.

318
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,000
This concludes the meeting.

319
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,579
Don't be too happy
that you won,

320
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,710
and don't feel relieved either.

321
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,349
You may have beat me today,

322
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,220
but this is only the start
of the war.

323
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:16,859
Thank you for giving us
a chance to find out...

324
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,529
- who our allies and enemies are.
- Don't be arrogant.

325
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,000
You'll see me again soon.

326
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:25,670
Who knows if it will be
a year from now,

327
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:29,339
a month from now,
or two weeks from now.

328
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,380
Chairman Kim is awake.

329
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,619
They're scheduling the surgery
right away.

330
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,730
(Central Operation Center)

331
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:06,880
(Central Operation Center)

332
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,490
How did it go?

333
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,359
We were worried because
there was still some swelling,

334
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,200
but the surgery itself went well.

335
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,970
Let's see how he recovers
when he wakes up.

336
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:30,799
Thank you.

337
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,039
What's so great about a man
who kicked you out?

338
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,250
Don't cry.

339
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,799
Welcome.

340
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,549
Young Do.

341
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,319
Hello.

342
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:35,400
Have you...

343
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,240
been well?

344
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,769
No.

345
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,740
You've gotten...

346
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:18,140
so tall.

347
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,480
My son.

348
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,109
You've become so handsome.

349
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Mom.

350
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,119
Yes?

351
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,720
Mom.

352
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,759
I'm so sorry.

353
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,829
I'm sorry I couldn't wait long.

354
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,039
I was planning on returning
quickly to see you.

355
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:51,839
I'm sorry I couldn't go.

356
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,859
Among the books that I studied from,
I brought you the better ones.

357
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,529
All the questions that come out
a lot have been marked,

358
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,769
and I cherish them
for various reasons.

359
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:19,500
I'm so lucky. Thank you, Hyo Shin.

360
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,769
I'm thankful to you.

361
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,279
Thank you for becoming
a warm part...

362
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,180
of my brutal high school career.

363
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:29,880
What is it? You sound like
you're going to leave.

364
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,180
Study hard.

365
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,079
I hope that your relationship
with Tan...

366
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,450
a lovey dovey but boring
romance movie.

367
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,920
Are you really going somewhere?

368
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,430
The outfits that you're looking at
right now...

369
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,589
received the best responses...

370
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,299
among our new FW line.

371
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,470
It has been showing a steady
increase in sales...

372
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,230
among not only our VVIPs,
but also our regular customers.

373
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,809
Did you listen? Functionality
must be supported with style.

374
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,740
Slimness with thermal function,
slimness with heating function,

375
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,210
and slimness with mobility.

376
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,319
In other words,
something that makes you look thin.

377
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,430
I like this season's
overall collection.

378
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:18,630
But is it okay to reflect
the preference of a teenager?

379
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
You're talented, and you have sense.

380
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,869
I just want you to look
at the overall feel.

381
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,339
They all look nice and warm.

382
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,710
I really hate the cold.

383
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,339
Should we take a trip to someplace
warm? What about The Maldives?

384
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,980
You want to go to a honeymoon spot
with me? Forget it.

385
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,890
Can't it be a trip with two single
women who don't have fiances?

386
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,390
Why did you tell me to come here?

387
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,460
And why are you suddenly
talking about going on a trip?

388
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,960
Have you been taking
my sleeping pills?

389
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,460
Just when I can't sleep.

390
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,829
It's not habitual. Don't worry.

391
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,740
I understand.

392
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:02,339
I call Dr. Han for an appointment.

393
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,970
Go and get a prescription.

394
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,339
Okay.

395
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,809
Yoo Rachel.

396
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,849
Can you have a seat
and wait a moment?

397
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:14,049
(Department of Neuropsychiatry)

398
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,250
(Department of Neuropsychiatry,
Hyun Hwa Jung)

399
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,390
Do you come here?

400
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:23,130
It's my first time.

401
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,140
I come here.

402
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:34,400
Why do you come here?

403
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,569
I come here to live.

404
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,539
Why are you here for the first time?

405
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,880
Because I can't sleep.

406
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,150
Gosh. This is a problem.

407
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,819
- What?
- I keep sharing secrets with you.

408
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,690
I don't think the two of us make
a good fit for a teen movie.

409
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,089
You should focus on studying.
You're retaking the entrance exam.

410
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,460
I'm enlisting into the Army.

411
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,559
- What?
- This is a secret too.

412
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,230
The others don't know yet.

413
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,430
Do you have a girl
who's going to wait for you?

414
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,839
I'm not sure.

415
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,390
Hey, Lee Hyo Shin!

416
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,269
Gosh, how did you know to come?

417
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,829
I didn't know you'd be faster
than my mom.

418
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,539
How can you do this
out of nowhere?

419
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,269
What do you mean the Army?
You haven't even graduated yet.

420
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,779
Stop making a scene.
You have to go too, you know.

421
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,480
Even if you're going,
how can you go like this?

422
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,980
Did your parents really
give you permission?

423
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,680
I've never gotten their permission
for anything in my 19 years.

424
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:57,119
I'm enlisting in secret.
To earn some time to think.

425
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,660
She would've probably found
my letter by now.

426
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,859
You're insane.

427
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,630
Going to the Army was a sure way
to stop my mom.

428
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,460
Hey, you lunatic.

429
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,569
I can't deny that.

430
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:14,569
Don't get hurt,

431
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,740
you crazy jerk.

432
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,279
Okay.

433
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:37,890
I'll be back.

434
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,599
What are you doing?
Are you making bean powder?

435
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,670
You should've told me to do it.

436
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,210
Isn't this too much
for the two of us?

437
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,349
I'm going to send some
to your sister.

438
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:02,619
Did she contact you?

439
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,990
She texted me.

440
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,619
She got a job
and a new cellphone.

441
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,430
Is that it? Did she mention
the money she ran off with?

442
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,160
What's her number? Give it to me.

443
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,430
Why?
What are you going to say to her?

444
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,630
What would I say?

445
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:19,470
I'm going to tell her that you're
very healthy and I'm healthier,

446
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,039
and that we miss her a lot.

447
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,809
That the two of us
are living happily,

448
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,039
so she should worry about herself.

449
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,180
Are you really happy?

450
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:38,049
You went through so much
because you met a mom like me.

451
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:41,190
What are you talking about?

452
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,529
I'm so happy because
I'm your daughter.

453
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,059
I'll grow up quickly
and let you live in luxury.

454
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:50,670
I love you, Mom.

455
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:04,250
It's my boyfriend.

456
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:08,849
Hey, it's me.

457
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,190
Where? The hospital?

458
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,920
The hospital where Chairman Kim is?

459
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,389
Ms. Jung Ji Sook.

460
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:23,969
I heard you did something
while I was unconscious.

461
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,500
I didn't gain anything out of it.

462
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,340
You should've just waited
a bit longer.

463
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:35,280
You've endured everything in
an elegant manner for a long time.

464
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,250
Why did you...

465
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,949
knock out your chance to be
compensated on your own?

466
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,420
I wanted more.

467
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,719
It was something I've been planning
for a very long time.

468
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,420
I also have...

469
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,829
a plan like that.

470
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,699
That's why I called you here.

471
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,730
Ms. Jung Ji Sook.

472
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,300
Let's get a divorce.

473
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,739
Let's do that.

474
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,940
I should...

475
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:09,550
prepare properly for it this time.

476
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,909
I might not be able to take
all of Jeguk Group,

477
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,579
but I can take half of it.

478
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,219
That's what a family register does.

479
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,760
Did you hear that?

480
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,760
Prepare a divorce lawsuit.

481
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:28,329
Yes, sir.

482
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:39,480
Father, Eun Sang is here.

483
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,150
I'm glad you regained your health.

484
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,420
("The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty
from Tula and the Steel Flea")

485
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:51,389
I thought they would be good
for you to read when you got bored.

486
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,230
You don't have
to try to win my favor.

487
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,199
But still...

488
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,429
I want to win your favor.

489
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,469
She mustered up her courage to come
here. Look at her with kindness.

490
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,869
I will slowly repay my debts.

491
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:11,610
You have to be healthy
until I repay it all.

492
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,110
I guess I need to live
for a long time...

493
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,579
to get paid back for all your debt.

494
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,119
What debt?

495
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,019
I'll get going now.

496
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:25,820
You don't need to come again.

497
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:30,760
Thank you for the books.

498
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,369
How do you feel, Mom?

499
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,579
Good. I feel really good.

500
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:47,809
Is there any place you want to go?

501
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,679
Next time.

502
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,250
I can't feel my legs.
I think I overdid it.

503
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,150
It's not easy to enjoy freedom.

504
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,619
I know.
Why did you wear such high heels?

505
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:02,260
You should wear comfortable shoes
next time.

506
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,730
That won't do, Son.

507
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,630
My dream was to become Miss Korea.

508
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,400
I can't give up on wearing heels.

509
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,070
My goodness.

510
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,340
When was the last time
we enjoyed nature?

511
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,710
It's because you were so busy.

512
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,050
I need to be busy,
so you can live and eat.

513
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,480
Are you sure you're not pretending
to be busy?

514
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:45,969
Dad, smile.

515
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:48,570
1, 2, 3.

516
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,210
Are you sending it to Bo Na?

517
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,380
She said she can't breathe
if she doesn't see me every hour.

518
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,750
I think you're going to lose the
upper hand when you go to college.

519
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,150
I'm excited about that too.

520
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,389
What about you? Do you want to get
remarried? Are you seeing anyone?

521
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:09,530
I'm already overwhelmed with work,
so how could I date?

522
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,530
Don't you have any plans
to work in my place?

523
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,500
Why do you want to play
all the time?

524
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,530
You didn't seem to hate it
when you got fired last time.

525
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,869
Wait until you grow up.

526
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Having a career isn't easy.

527
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:22,469
At times it's hotter, more painful,
and more exhausting...

528
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:24,469
than dating.

529
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,940
Are you talking about me?

530
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,849
CEO Kim.

531
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,789
When you fish,
you're trying to catch time.

532
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,949
Have you heard of Kang Tae Gong
from Zhou Dynasty?

533
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,059
Be quiet, you punk.

534
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,159
I didn't know you'd come here
when I mentioned I wanted coffee.

535
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,699
I can be endlessly considerate
and obsessive when I want to.

536
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,599
Do you go fishing often?

537
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:58,010
It's a ritual where a father and son
confirm their love for each other,

538
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,940
and we wanted to get some fresh air
since their final exams are over.

539
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,949
Right.

540
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,150
How did you do on your final exam?

541
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,320
Did you get the same rank again?

542
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,719
You'll be surprised
when you find out.

543
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,989
Ask Chan Young.

544
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,389
Kim Tan came in 50th place.

545
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,590
- Really?
- 50th place?

546
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:19,099
He did really well.

547
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:22,500
Did he do well?

548
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,070
I didn't know you could come in
50th place at Jeguk High School.

549
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,469
How did Chan Young do?

550
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,579
Chan Young always comes
in first place.

551
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:35,809
There's no drama in his report card,

552
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:38,780
so it's not fun or impressive.

553
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,050
I don't even bother checking.

554
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,059
What are you going to do about this?

555
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,659
Yoon Chan Young, follow me.

556
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:01,400
It would be so nice
if every day was like this.

557
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,940
Tan doesn't know yet, right?

558
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,480
What good is it
to find out in advance?

559
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,050
The article will go out tomorrow.

560
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,320
Of course.

561
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,489
This place is nice.

562
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,960
I should come here next time.

563
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,070
("Kim Won, CEO of Jeguk Group, To
Marry Yang Da Kyung of BS Telecom")

564
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,360
("Kim Won, CEO of Jeguk Group, To
Marry Yang Da Kyung of BS Telecom")

565
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,719
Keep your promise to me.

566
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,619
What promise?

567
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:34,130
You promised to break this with me
when I had a wish.

568
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,300
I have a wish.

569
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,599
We don't have forever.

570
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,369
Should I do it myself?

571
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,980
This is yours, and this one's mine.

572
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,409
Don't do it.

573
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,150
Mine is longer.

574
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,019
I guess my wish will come true.

575
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,500
Let's break up.

576
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:17,469
That's my wish.

577
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,750
Even when we sat close
to each other,

578
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,019
we were always so far away.

579
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,920
It's not something I was unaware of,
so don't feel sorry.

580
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:37,860
I'm sorry.

581
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,800
I'm sorry.

582
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:47,170
I'm so sorry.

583
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,739
I told you I would wave to you.

584
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:58,250
Goodbye, Won.

585
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,320
What's with the article?
Are you getting married?

586
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:40,889
How can you get married
all of a sudden like this?

587
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,630
It's too dangerous to protect
the company on our own.

588
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,599
That is why I need this marriage.

589
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,900
This is...

590
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,469
the weight of the crown
that I'll be wearing.

591
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,969
- But...
- I don't need your opinion.

592
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:59,510
This was my decision.
It's not up for discussion.

593
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,610
I also thought about our deal.

594
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:06,050
About you going to the States.

595
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,849
Don't go to the States. Instead,

596
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,619
stay behind me on my side.

597
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,800
This means that you can't
have any other dreams.

598
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,269
It means you have to start learning
how to run the company.

599
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:25,369
Just do that.

600
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:27,969
It's really lonely to be here.

601
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,469
If I stay,

602
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,239
are you less lonely?

603
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:38,610
I'll still be lonely.

604
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,820
But...

605
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:43,119
it's better than
not having you here.

606
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:59,599
You're here for an inspection,
not for a tuning?

607
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,969
It's only been three months
since your last inspection.

608
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,909
I want to choose safety
over pleasure.

609
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,980
I can look at the helmets
over here, right?

610
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,159
Fried chicken is here.
It's 16.10 dollars.

611
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,230
16.10 dollars? Here.

612
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,909
I guess our first meeting...

613
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,980
was ahead of our memories.

614
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:51,219
Here.

615
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,909
Thanks for telling me sooner.
Hang up.

616
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,980
- Jo Myung Soo can't come.
- I bet he's just not coming.

617
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,309
Is he with a girl?

618
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,519
Girls are more important
to him than friends.

619
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:22,780
Is that an indirect confession...

620
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,219
that I'm more important to you
than Eun Sang?

621
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:27,619
I believe so. I'll choose the topic.

622
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,829
- 18.
- It's already hard.

623
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,230
You should've chosen an easier one.

624
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,400
I'll start.

625
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,599
When you're 18,

626
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,170
you hurt yourself.

627
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,699
You're lonely.

628
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:45,440
At times, you have to fight
with a big enemy.

629
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,980
But you have a passionate heart.

630
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,980
And it's an age
when you have lofty dreams.

631
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:52,179
What is this? None of my cards
fit the topic of 18.

632
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,119
Did you guys plan it?

633
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,519
Lee Bo Na is out.
I'm going to say my wish.

634
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,750
- Give me a kiss.
- Hey.

635
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,519
Gosh. How could you wish that?

636
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:02,420
I'm embarrassed to do it
in front of an audience.

637
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:03,760
Which side? This one?

638
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:09,000
Hey. Why did you turn your head
all of a sudden?

639
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:11,099
Sorry. I'll return it.

640
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,599
You guys!
My wish is that you break up!

641
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,710
I think this came from the States.

642
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:20,909
Thank you.

643
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,610
What type of crown
were you trying to wear?

644
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:52,440
Was it wealth,

645
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,780
fame,

646
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:56,849
or love?

647
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,760
The owner of the study changed.

648
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:00,809
My brother went up to the place
he wanted to be and became stronger.

649
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,610
But he cried at night.

650
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:10,090
His place of exile...

651
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,360
must be this house...

652
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:15,590
where he lived all his life.

653
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:26,099
And I became something I thought
wouldn't concern me,

654
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:27,699
a senior in high school.

655
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,780
Didn't your mother tell you this
is a violation of portrait rights?

656
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,679
This is a commemorative moment,
so I took a picture of it.

657
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:43,789
What are you commemorating?

658
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:45,690
How should I put it?

659
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,960
It's the face of someone
who stepped into the real world.

660
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,329
I'll get going.

661
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:25,030
You know tomorrow's
the first mock test, right?

662
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,630
- I have high expectations.
- Focus on protecting your spot.

663
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,429
I don't have a middle ground.

664
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:31,500
I guess he's going to come
in 100th place again.

665
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,340
You jerks.

666
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,690
However, nothing has changed.

667
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,030
We are still unaware of...

668
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,530
how to drift apart proficiently...

669
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,900
or how to tactfully make up.

670
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:09,500
However, we know...

671
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,610
how much we hurt, cried,
and broke down...

672
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:17,409
during the rough times
of when we were 18.

673
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,519
How fierce things were for us then.

674
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:24,219
You're quite ostentatious.
What will you do if Bo Na sees it?

675
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:25,789
I'm doing this so she can see it.

676
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,760
"Look.
My boyfriend bought this for me."

677
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,929
Look at you.
I'm glad I spent the money on it.

678
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:35,030
What did you wish for when you
blew out your birthday candles?

679
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,429
I was curious.

680
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,400
"Please let everyone I know..."

681
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,409
"be happy."

682
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:45,769
- What is that?
- It's true.

683
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:50,150
In about ten years, I'm going
to have a party at my place.

684
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,349
A party?

685
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:00,420
- In ten years, we'll be 29.
- Right.

686
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,760
What are you talking about?

687
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,630
Do you think the divorce
announcement is a joke?

688
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,030
Is everyone there?

689
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:08,500
Yes. Bo Na and Chan Young are still
busy even at the party.

690
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:11,570
Yes, detective. I'm Yoon Chan Young
from the Cyber Crimes Team.

691
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:13,670
- Money's not the problem.
- I took care of the case...

692
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,769
- regarding the network crash.
- I have lots and lots of it.

693
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,610
Can we discuss about this later?
Fine.

694
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:21,710
I heard your debut film was
nominated as Asia's Must-see Film.

695
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,250
It left its mark as a high-class,
military illicit romance movie.

696
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,679
Please consider me
for your next film.

697
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:30,920
Lee Bo Na.

698
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,460
Are you still using
that weird skill of yours?

699
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,329
Yes. Didn't you know?

700
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,030
Doesn't the RS Building
get internet?

701
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,960
I'm always busy preparing
for a new season,

702
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,530
so I don't have time
to look into those things.

703
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:45,000
If I invite you to the premiere,
will you come?

704
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,139
No. I don't enjoy watching movies.

705
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,199
Then come to see me.

706
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:51,570
I'll think about it.

707
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,880
Why must I check my schedule when
you're coming out on holiday?

708
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,949
Don't call me. Bye.

709
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,590
Was that Myung Soo?
Is he a corporal now?

710
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:06,820
He's a sergeant.

711
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,760
He's going through a lot
because he enlisted so late.

712
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,500
Oh, and starting this month, I'm
in charge of JG Convention Jeju.

713
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:15,760
Aren't you excited?

714
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:17,829
Your father must be nervous.

715
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:21,000
Why would you say that?
It makes me want to do a good job.

716
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,710
Tan's here.

717
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:26,269
Hey. Father's in the study.

718
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,139
Hee Nam. You're younger than me?

719
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:57,269
Show me your ID. Show it to me.

720
00:53:58,039 --> 00:53:59,070
Goodness.

721
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:00,739
Son.

722
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,130
And as I blew out the candles,

723
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:28,000
I also wished to be
standing on the same road...

724
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,969
that ends with you,
ten years from now.

725
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,639
For it to be exactly the way it was
when we were 18.

726
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:37,179
When I was passionately after you.

727
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:16,349
I guess we can see everyone smiling
only in our imagination.

728
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:17,619
That's why it's a wish.

729
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,690
I hope it comes true.

730
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,420
It might.

731
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,460
One day.

732
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:35,070
At 18,

733
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,670
we fell in love, liked each other,
cried,

734
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:42,940
ran away, got on our knees...

735
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:44,849
Goodbye.

736
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:47,019
And turned our backs on each other
countless times.

737
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,050
You can't protect me.
Just protect yourself.

738
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,530
Look up to the second floor.

739
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,480
I thought you were a pretty dream,

740
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,409
but you were a nightmare,
Cha Eun Sang.

741
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:56,320
Despite all that, at 18,

742
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,360
we ran toward each other,
held one another's hands,

743
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:04,429
and hugged each other tightly.

744
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:18,940
When are you going to buy me a meal?

745
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,239
Did you believe me
when I said that?

746
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,550
There's nothing you can't say when
you're trying to seduce someone.

747
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:24,849
My gosh.

748
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,650
Are you purposely avoiding
buying me a meal,

749
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,880
so you can cook for me
every morning?

750
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:33,420
Did you just propose to me?

751
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,190
I doubt it.
You're just asking for trouble.

752
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:39,559
Hey, Cha Eun Sung. Stop there.

753
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,730
What did I say I would do
if you showed your back to me?

754
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,159
Why won't you respond to me?

755
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:45,599
Do you want to come over
to my place?

756
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:47,940
Would you be happy to see me
only in my dreams?

757
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,969
We might end up falling again,

758
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,340
and we might end up
getting on our knees again.

759
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,409
However, we...

760
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,079
Despite it all, we...

761
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:01,519
will move forward.

762
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,739
(We sincerely thank all the viewers
for watching The Heirs.)

763
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:09,050
(The Heirs, Thank you for watching.)
