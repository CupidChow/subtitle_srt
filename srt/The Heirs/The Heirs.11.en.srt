00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,929
(Episode 11)

4
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,210
You can stay here alone, right?

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,409
I hope a lady ghost shows up.

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,350
I'll see you later.

7
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:52,719
Kim Tan?

8
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,870
Good. That's more like you.

9
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,140
Don't you second-guess me.

10
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,739
You haven't even seen
the half of me yet.

11
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,480
I will show you now.

12
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,329
What do you think you're doing?

13
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,129
I was showing it to Kim Tan.

14
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,370
What?

15
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,769
Kim Tan is behind you.

16
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:52,680
Stay out of this, will you?

17
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,920
Can't you see
we're having a good time here?

18
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,489
Can't you see I came all the way
from Seoul to ruin that good time?

19
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,890
Would you please stop?
The both of you.

20
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,560
You seem pretty serious about her.

21
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,700
It's none of your business.

22
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,459
Then tell her how serious
I'm about her.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,930
Tell Cha Eun Sang...

24
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,270
that I think I like her.

25
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,479
She didn't seem to believe me
when I said it.

26
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,509
Maybe she will believe it
when she hears it from you.

27
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,650
And that's quite upsetting.

28
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:38,800
Wake up.

29
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,569
What are you thinking?

30
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,939
Stop it. I'm the most
confused one here.

31
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,169
Right.

32
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,939
And I'm the happiest man here.

33
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,240
It took me four hours
of non-stop drive to get here.

34
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:54,280
And this is what you show me?

35
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,449
- I understand you're angry, but...
- No, you don't.

36
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,949
Do you ever think about me?

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,349
Looks like
I'm the only crazy one here.

38
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,460
I know you're having a hard time
because of me,

39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,759
but I wish Choi Young Do is...

40
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,500
not your last resort.

41
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,319
(Hyun Joo)

42
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,860
Gosh, you scared me. I thought
a lady ghost actually showed up.

43
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,530
- Where's Tan?
- Back in the trunk.

44
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,360
I'm not sure if he's alive now.

45
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,729
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

46
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,599
What's happening now?

47
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,900
Let me wait here.

48
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,569
He has to go back to Seoul, so he
should be back before the sunrise.

49
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,080
We booked a hotel.
The hotel you're going tomorrow.

50
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,280
Then he should come back
even earlier.

51
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,110
Did Tan go to meet Cha Eun Sang?

52
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,449
I don't want to put anyone
in trouble by saying something.

53
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,490
He came back earlier than I thought.

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Go to the back seat.

55
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,729
How did you know?

56
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,829
I know you booked a hotel.
We will talk there.

57
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,230
Kids will be walking around here
the whole night.

58
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,579
Could you leave us alone?

59
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,410
I booked this room. He's my guest.

60
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,949
- Do you not have money?
- Hotels are expensive.

61
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:38,420
What is it that
you wanted to talk about?

62
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,149
Did you meet Cha Eun Sang?

63
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:45,819
I'll give you five minutes.

64
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,160
Hearing a love quarrel
makes me jealous.

65
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,829
I did. And I'm waiting
for her to call me.

66
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,329
Did she say she got slapped by me?

67
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,300
I slapped her earlier.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,540
You slapped her?

69
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,339
I guess she didn't
tell you about it.

70
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,769
Who does she think she is to fake
like she's covering up for me?

71
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,040
Is that all you can say?

72
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,540
Wake up, Kim Tan.

73
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,610
You and I have exchanged rings
in front of your parents.

74
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,680
In front of our grandparents...

75
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,589
and even before my divorced father,

76
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,060
we exchanged engagement rings.

77
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,430
The fact that you like her...

78
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:23,360
won't do anything.
Don't you know that?

79
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
I do. That's why
this is driving me crazy.

80
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,769
You scumbag.

81
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:30,470
I will be even worse to you.

82
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,600
So let this engagement...

83
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,680
I saw it. She was
in Choi Young Do's arms.

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,620
Cha Eun Sang, that crazy wench
should know her place.

85
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,019
What's her deal?

86
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,920
I thought there was something
going on between her and Kim Tan.

87
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,220
She's just flirting with everyone.

88
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,889
Just wait until
I find something on her.

89
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,430
I will ruin her completely.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,430
- I can't wait.
- Stupid upstarts are all the same.

91
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,329
- I have never liked her.
- Me neither.

92
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,399
Don't hear that.

93
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,670
Don't get hurt.

94
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,470
And get out of the way.

95
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,089
What are you doing?

96
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm taking revenge for you.

97
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,600
You are hard to understand.

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,860
I agree.

99
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,769
I'll be the one who will get
in trouble if they find it out.

100
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,970
Don't worry.

101
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,240
It'll be easier to explain than
to explain why you live at Tan's.

102
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,350
It was you whom Myung Soo saw.

103
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,720
I think you're living in that place.

104
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,120
Of course, it's just a guess
so don't be so scared.

105
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,089
And no matter what I ask,
don't answer me.

106
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,430
- What do you mean?
- Don't answer my questions.

107
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,470
If you give me your answers,

108
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,370
I won't be able to ask you
any more questions.

109
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,170
I was upset when you confessed
that you were a welfare student.

110
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,839
Because now we have
one less conversation piece.

111
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,509
You call that a conversation?

112
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,910
Are you willing to have
a real conversation with me?

113
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,850
See?

114
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,649
You can't answer
this question anyway.

115
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,790
Why on earth are you living
in Kim Tan's place?

116
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,689
I can imagine about five occasions
on why you must be there.

117
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,730
Occasion number one.
You're their daughter.

118
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,500
Occasion number two.
You're their daughter-in-law.

119
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,370
Occasion number three.
You're their relative.

120
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,240
Occasion number four.
You're their live-in housekeeper.

121
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
Occasion number five.
You're their live-in private tutor.

122
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,709
But you are none of them.

123
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,579
What on earth are you?

124
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,550
Then answer this one question.

125
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,720
Do you really like Kim Tan?

126
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,160
Yes.

127
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,899
I see.

128
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,910
Leave the shoes.

129
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,379
If you take them out,

130
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,750
I will take revenge.

131
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,480
(School Vice President)

132
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,480
- What's up?
- Where are you?

133
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,850
We are having a roll call,
so hurry back.

134
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,690
I'm not in the mood to sleep there
right now.

135
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,149
You can't just act as you'd like.

136
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,120
I will sleep in the hotel tonight,
so deal with it.

137
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,190
I will call your parents then,
so deal with it.

138
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,389
Hey, Yoon Chan Young.

139
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,929
Okay. Let her stay in the hotel.

140
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,429
I will scold her.

141
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,980
This is a part of the business.
Don't get this wrong.

142
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,710
So I'm a woman
who just idles at home?

143
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,450
Forget it. Why is the article
coming out tomorrow?

144
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,850
- It's too early.
- Oh, that article.

145
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,789
Someone canceled
an article for me...

146
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:47,429
and I need to pay back the favor.

147
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,629
How could you do this
without discussing with me?

148
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,700
Once the article gets out,
the stock price will skyrocket.

149
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,500
If you know anyone who needs to pay
some debts, give them a tip-off.

150
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,039
Don't you think I would need
that kind of tip-off too?

151
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,740
Postpone the article by two days.

152
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,940
Meanwhile, I'll take care
of the stocks.

153
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,919
What's that woman doing here?

154
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
Who?

155
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,919
Madam Park?

156
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,220
"Madam"?

157
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:23,059
What are you saying?
What about the shoe?

158
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,500
They are all wet.

159
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,330
We were just hanging out
in the tent.

160
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:32,340
And some crazy punk put all
of our shoes in front of the tent...

161
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,840
into a bucket full of water.

162
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,710
I will kick this person's butt
when I figure out who did this.

163
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,710
They won't dry because it's
late in the night. What do I do?

164
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,529
Put a warm jacket on
and come on out.

165
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,919
Where are we going?

166
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,330
A secluded and dark place.

167
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,929
Just follow me.

168
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,049
Come on and have a seat.

169
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,360
When did you prepare all this?

170
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,759
What are you thinking?

171
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:05,929
They are just here.

172
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,100
So why did you call?

173
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:15,009
- What?
- You called me and then hung up.

174
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:18,980
Before I arrived here.

175
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,809
I told you to put on something warm.

176
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,549
So why did you call me?

177
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,460
And why did you come back?

178
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,690
Why else?

179
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,830
Because I missed you, of course.

180
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,330
Do you want to get inside and
sleep in a warm place together...

181
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,470
or sleep here
in a cold place together?

182
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,070
Choose one.

183
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,870
Leaving is not an option.

184
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,809
I'm not letting you go tonight.

185
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:55,850
Why do you smile?

186
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:58,779
Because I'm happy.

187
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,419
What?

188
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,120
This is exciting.

189
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Really?

190
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,129
Yes. Don't let me go.
I don't want to go.

191
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,200
I got mad earlier because...

192
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,730
Let me tell you
why I called you earlier.

193
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,169
I had many reasons back then,

194
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,309
but now I think about it,

195
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:27,009
I think I did that
because I missed you.

196
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:28,980
I missed you a lot.

197
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,330
Are you being bullied by other kids?

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,440
- I mean, bullied hard?
- Why?

199
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,240
Do I look crazy?

200
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:55,570
Yes.

201
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm far away from home.

202
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,110
It's deep in the night.

203
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,220
You're here.

204
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,519
So I'm escaping to my dreams.

205
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,220
For just one more day,

206
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,620
I would like to be
in this midsummer night's dream.

207
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,730
I have always wanted to do this.

208
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,909
It's not as comfortable
as I thought it would be.

209
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,009
It's because you're actually
leaning on me, you silly.

210
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,509
You need to lean your heart on me.

211
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,419
I see.

212
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,590
The stars look beautiful.

213
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:28,070
Don't ask me to get them for you.
I can't do that.

214
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,169
What? You can't do it?

215
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,769
Chan Young did it for Bo Na...

216
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,100
Which one?
The second one from the left?

217
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,009
The biggest one on the right?

218
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,809
This place has the vibe
of Friday the 13th.

219
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,019
You're unbelievable.

220
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,990
Why do you always have to make
everything into a horror movie?

221
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,120
Why do you even like horror movies?

222
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,690
They are tragic.

223
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,129
Watching those tragedies...

224
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,330
make me feel like
my misfortunes are not a big deal.

225
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,470
Am I one of your misfortunes?

226
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,809
Good night. I'm sleepy.

227
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,480
Unbelievable.

228
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,019
How could you
actually fall asleep like that?

229
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,419
I told you I sleep a lot.

230
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:00,559
I saw the firewood was all gone.
That's why it was warm.

231
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,330
And who do you think
was up all night burning it?

232
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,559
Look at my hands.
They used to be so soft, but now...

233
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,500
My hands are rough now.
Can we hold hands?

234
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,900
No.

235
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,140
- Look at these hands.
- No.

236
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,509
I'm doing it
without asking permission.

237
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,839
- Hey.
- No way. Let's go.

238
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,279
Hey.

239
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,019
Do you remember the time when
we went to see the Hollywood sign?

240
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,859
You said it's actually far away
than it seems like.

241
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,289
I do remember. Why?

242
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,690
You are like that to me.

243
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,000
- What about me?
- You seem so close to me...

244
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,470
when you're actually far away.

245
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,140
Holding your hand like this...

246
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,309
will make me think
we're closer than we are.

247
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,849
You asked me yesterday
if you're one of my misfortunes.

248
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,079
No. You are a stroke of good luck
among my misfortunes.

249
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,319
And that's good enough for me.
I'm awake from my dreams.

250
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,630
I should move on too, you know?

251
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:23,109
How close should I be
for you to believe me?

253
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,339
Don't assume I'm far away just
because you never came near me.

254
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Cha Eun Sang.

255
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,849
Really? Kim Tan came here
last night?

256
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,190
Yes. Myung Soo said he saw him.

257
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,819
Oh, my gosh. Is that why Yoo Rachel
slept outside last night?

258
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,059
She slept outside?

259
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,559
I guess she is his fiancee.
She's on a different level.

260
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,029
Doesn't it sound thrilling?
"Sleeping outside."

261
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,059
I hate Yoo Rachel.

262
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,470
What a playboy he is.

263
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,869
He's going for Yoo Rachel now?
What about Cha Eun Sang?

264
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,039
By the way, do you have to do
your skincare routine even here?

265
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,740
No caring, no beauty.

266
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,609
No beauty, no boyfriend.

267
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,410
Pack your things by 8am
and gather around.

268
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:39,720
When we arrive at the hotel,
you will be assigned to rooms...

269
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,420
and attend your
Harvard graduate alumnus'...

270
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,519
global leadership speech.

271
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,220
Okay, Chan Young.

272
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,960
Did you sleep well?

273
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,400
(Jeguk High School's Leadership Camp
Autumn 2013)

274
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,900
- Come on.
- What's that?

275
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,059
Hey, look.

276
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,369
(Special Lecture
on Global Leadership)

277
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:20,220
Did you really sleep here
last night?

278
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,890
Yes. Why do you ask?

279
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,930
With Kim Tan?

280
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,529
I guess so.

281
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,549
Hey, Tan.

282
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,890
I didn't expect to see you here.

283
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,130
Well, I guess
I can call it an elope.

284
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,299
Eun Sang.

285
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:05,099
Hi.

286
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,549
Would you like to take a seat?

287
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:18,579
Sure, why not?

288
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,450
I'll go get the food.

289
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,089
I woke up early. Did you sleep well?

290
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,990
Yes.

291
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:33,759
Hyo Shin.

292
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,470
Hey, Anchorwoman Lee Bo Na.
It's nice to see you out here.

293
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:41,039
Right? Did you sleep here as well?

294
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,740
Yes. With Tan.

295
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,779
With Tan?

296
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:48,509
What about her?

297
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,849
What? You slept here alone?

298
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,549
I thought you slept with him.
This is hilarious.

299
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,549
I spent the whole night
in the hallway...

300
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,160
because Rachel didn't open the door.

301
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,690
She's one stubborn girl.

302
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,200
Enjoy. Let's go.

303
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,640
You're one busy man, aren't you?

304
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,900
One minute you are with the girl
you missed,

305
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,410
the next you are the girl
you want to sleep with.

306
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,640
Is that American style?

307
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,880
I guess I made a mistake.

308
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,779
Would you like to leave
or would you like me to leave?

309
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,319
I will leave.

310
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,859
I guess it's so hard for us
to have a meal together.

311
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,960
Don't you remember
what I said yesterday?

312
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:12,529
Stop looking.

313
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:55,440
I don't want any of you
to follow me. And I mean any of you.

314
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:08,690
I'm sorry. My hand slipped.

315
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,720
Do you really have to be like this?

316
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,259
Is this what you meant when you said
you were serious about me?

317
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:14,259
No.

318
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,990
What I just did is...

319
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,559
what Kim Tan will do to you
in the future.

320
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:22,400
He will pretend to hold your hand,

321
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,599
but eventually,
he will let go of it.

322
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,339
That's why you
should let go of him first.

323
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:28,809
Stay away from him.

324
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,339
I'm saying this for your sake.

325
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:34,680
Thanks for the advice.
But I know that already.

326
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,809
Which is why I have to say this.

327
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,319
You are so dead.

328
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,920
- I mean it.
- Really?

329
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,160
Am I going to be killed by you?

330
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:00,000
Sorry. My foot slipped.

331
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,299
I understand.

332
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:03,509
And this doesn't feel bad.

333
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,210
I feel like I won.

334
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,890
Come on out.

335
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,490
What are you going to do?

336
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,230
Are you...

337
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:25,599
going to make her a concubine
like someone?

338
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,269
You'd better shut that mouth.

339
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,170
Are you sure you won't regret this?

340
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,299
That's what I want to ask.

341
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:36,940
Are you sure
you don't regret your engagement?

342
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,039
You crazy punks. Break it up!

343
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,420
Why do you stupid losers
fight all the time?

344
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,750
Having rich parents and
an easy life must have spoiled you.

345
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:51,619
Say something!

346
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,259
Are you okay?
Do you think you can climb back up?

347
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:55,630
Don't hold his hand. Hold my hand.

348
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,670
Tan. You should go back
to your hotel room for now.

349
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,569
Your voice sounds very nice
when you swear.

350
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:09,640
You...

351
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,180
You'd better not do this again.

352
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,750
What are you doing?
Go to your room already!

353
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,049
You've got no respect
for your senior now, do you?

354
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:37,029
It's cold. I don't want you
to catch a cold.

355
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,109
You childish punk.

356
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:45,309
Don't listen to him.
Just catch a cold.

357
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:57,390
It's not like I haven't been
in a relationship before.

358
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,460
You shallow punks
make a fuss over everything.

359
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:02,930
Focus on driving.

360
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,430
What are you so proud of?

361
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:06,099
Do you want to walk?

362
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,509
Lee Hyo Shin.

363
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,079
- I'm sorry I didn't come home.
- You think that's the problem?

364
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,480
How could you skip
the college interview?

365
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,849
Did you lose your mind?

366
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,779
I have never said I would go.

367
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,690
I'm shocked me not coming home
was a bigger problem.

368
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,190
Are you even listening to yourself?

369
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,630
You're the one who applied,
so you should have gone.

370
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,130
I told you I'm not interested
in studying law.

371
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,359
Why on earth are you doing this?

372
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:50,640
Finally, you're asking me
why I'm like this.

373
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,579
- What?
- You've never asked me...

374
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,279
why I didn't want to study law,

375
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,220
why I collected the sleeping pills
and why I took them.

376
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,819
Do you want my answer?

377
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,349
Because I'm ready to say it.

378
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,319
Later. After the CSAT exam.

379
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,059
Get back in your room.

380
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,299
Hello, ma'am.

381
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:18,440
I would like to meet you.

382
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,269
I see.

383
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,039
That's what happened.

384
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,539
Sure. I'll call you again tomorrow.

385
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:29,680
I have something important
to take care of at the moment.

386
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,250
Bye.

387
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,420
Where is she?
Where's the woman who lives here?

388
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,789
Hang on.

389
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,029
Let me see the notebook.

390
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:53,339
What brings you here again?

391
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,539
I said, give it to me.

392
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:04,079
(You should have used
a burner phone for the call.)

393
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,480
(You set a spy on Ms. Han.
How's that going?)

394
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,420
What are you doing to Ms. Park?

395
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,650
She has human rights too, you know.

396
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,160
- Give it to me!
- Talk to me.

397
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,690
Why would you bother
my precious housekeeper?

398
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,690
Ms. Park, put that away.

399
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,759
I will talk to you then.

400
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,230
I know you set a spy on me.

401
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:25,339
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

402
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,500
How do you know I did it?

403
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,240
Can you prove it?

404
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,309
You should have used a burner phone
to make a call like that.

405
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,940
You crazy wench!

406
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,079
Do you think they took the photo
to sell it to you?

407
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,049
They know I would pay
double the price.

408
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,180
Even if you didn't do anything, you
would've gotten on my nerves anyway.

409
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,480
And how dare you
mess with me like this.

410
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,319
So let's not sweat this matter...

411
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,460
and settle this family tree.

412
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,490
"Settle the family tree"?

413
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:50,460
You still don't know
your place, do you?

414
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,900
Wait there. Soon I will show you...

415
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,829
where your place is.

416
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:06,079
Suit yourself.

417
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,980
Mrs. Park.

418
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,390
Do you have it ready?

419
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,900
One bill per page.

420
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,440
Three bills?
You've got books of these.

421
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,900
You can probably even buy a house
with that money.

422
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,210
Two bills sound good, right?

423
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,279
Two dollars per page. Okay?

424
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:52,920
Oh, my gosh.

425
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,190
Choi Young Do's dad and Yoo Rachel's
mom are getting married.

426
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:57,329
Does that mean Yoo Rachel and
Choi Young Do will be siblings?

427
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,259
What kind of family is that?
That's so messed up.

428
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:22,420
Good and new morning, Sister.

429
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:27,960
I guess you feel good enough
to get under my skin.

430
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,829
Usually, when two people
become siblings,

431
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,099
love begins.

432
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,029
I'm starting to think that might be
the best way to break this marriage.

433
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,630
It's not too late yet, is it?

434
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,410
I'm afraid it is.

435
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,750
I've become to like someone.

436
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,049
It can't be...

437
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,750
You'd better brace yourself.
It's going to be a long day today.

438
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,549
If you need any help,
call me, your brother.

439
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,720
I saw the article. Congratulations.

440
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,190
Your company's stock price
is skyrocketing.

441
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,289
Of course, it is.
RS International...

442
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,730
and Hotel Zeus are merging.

443
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:07,859
You guys are getting
way richer than me now.

444
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,170
Congratulations, Young Do.

445
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,609
Those two-faced punks.

446
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:22,210
They think that marriage is
messed up,

447
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,509
yet they're buttering him up.

448
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,380
I'm sure they're truly happy
for their friends.

449
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,420
There are no friends in this school.

450
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,420
Here, everyone is just another pool
of network to each other.

451
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:01,819
- Are you feeling all right?
- I shouldn't be, right?

452
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,720
You must be happy to see me
being all pathetic.

453
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,920
This will quiet down in two days.

454
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,490
Don't mind about it.

455
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,390
You are the one
who shouldn't mind about me.

456
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,730
Why are you acting like my fiance
after all this time?

457
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,000
- I'm acting as a friend.
- You're the worst person here.

458
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,970
How come you're never fake?

459
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,099
You don't even know
how to be mad...

460
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,210
and yet you're acting like
a grownup.

461
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,410
If you're jealous of that,
I can give you a hug.

462
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,349
Are you okay?

463
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,349
- What?
- The article.

464
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,219
It's about you too.

465
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,360
I hope you're okay.

466
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,159
Come to think of it,
you're also only 18.

467
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,480
I'll put off the revenge for now.

468
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:28,599
Mic test. 1, 2. Check.

469
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,900
Hello, Sydney.

470
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,500
Wait.

471
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,809
Please listen to me
for just one minute.

472
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:42,280
The very existence of me is...

473
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,949
often mistaken by others.

474
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,320
And the misunderstanding is
impossible to resolve.

475
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,019
So when there's a misunderstanding
that I can resolve,

476
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,690
I do my best to resolve it.

477
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,789
First,

478
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,199
you just saw Rachel and me.

479
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,400
But we are just friends.
I don't want you to misunderstand.

480
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:10,570
Second.

481
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,639
When you fell into the pool,

482
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,409
I didn't help you get out.
I'm sorry.

483
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,150
There were kids around and I didn't
want to put you in trouble again.

484
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,119
But if I had known
it would bother me this much,

485
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,030
I would have just put you
in trouble. I regret it.

486
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,699
And third, which is
the most important,

487
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,070
what did you talk about
with Choi Young Do earlier?

488
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:46,139
What was it that made his eyes
shake like a leaf?

489
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,510
You keep shaking him up like that.

490
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,309
Do you really want to die?

491
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,650
Hey, don't come out.
You don't have any right to speak.

492
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:59,159
I blocked the way, so you can't...

493
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,099
Why did the door
have to open that way?

494
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,099
- What's all this?
- I blocked the door...

495
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:09,099
so you can't come out.

496
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,130
You always say right things,
so I can't beat you otherwise.

497
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,739
Unbelievable. This is why you are
only 100th in school.

498
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:15,769
You saw it?

499
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:18,869
Why would you see
someone else's grades?

500
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,710
What a weirdo.

501
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,780
Speak for yourself.

502
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,710
This is my first time talking
to someone who ranked 100.

503
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,710
This is fascinating.

504
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,880
Goodness.

505
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,150
Hey, couldn't you have said,
"Which subject is the hardest?"...

506
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,659
or "I would like to help you"
instead?

507
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:33,860
Put this away, will you?

508
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,289
Hey.

509
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:43,800
This place hasn't changed.

510
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,170
I guess what I wrote before
is covered up now.

511
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,900
It would be awesome to see it again.

512
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,269
It would be awesome indeed.

513
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,210
"Bye, Lee Bo Na. Be happy."

514
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,480
"Goodbye, Yoo Rachel.
I wish you all the best."

515
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,210
Stop making fun of my love history.

516
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,489
What happened to all those happiness
that you wished for?

517
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,320
I know. It may come true someday.

518
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,789
By the way, did you have to come
all the way here for tteokbokki?

519
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,960
The whole nation saw today
how messed up my family is.

520
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,530
What does it have to do
with this place?

521
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,670
It all started from here.

522
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,000
This is where I lost everything.

523
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,139
What are you saying?

524
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,840
Hey, Young Do! Stop there.

525
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,309
Young Do!

526
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:32,110
I said, stop.

527
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,880
- In front of school...
- Have you lost your mind?

528
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,949
Let go.

529
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,150
We don't have time.
Just come with me for now.

530
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,690
Don't you dare touch me,
you illegitimate punk.

531
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,789
Are you really not going
to listen to me?

532
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:42,429
Shove off.

533
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,630
You're going to regret this moment
for the rest of your life, Young Do.

534
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,230
Whatever.

535
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,349
What is it that you lost?

536
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,320
My mom.

537
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:14,760
A friend.

538
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,599
You lost your mom's friend?

539
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,340
Eat up.

540
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:38,650
I saw the article about CEO Lee's
remarriage came out today.

541
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:43,190
- Right.
- Why did you break up with her?

542
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,389
Did you know about it?

543
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,500
And why did you choose
to break up with Ms. Jeon?

544
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,599
I didn't.

545
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,599
I just set priorities.

546
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,869
Jeguk Group comes first.
Hyun Joo comes next.

547
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,340
That's the choice you made.

548
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:04,070
Why do you think
she will be waiting for you?

549
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,710
The priorities
that CEO Lee and you set...

550
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,809
are the choices you made.

551
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,650
Do you have a plan today
that I don't know?

552
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,860
What did you just say?

553
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:32,639
I asked if you know Tan's birthday.

554
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,769
I'm busy.

555
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:38,570
Do you remember your 18th birthday?

556
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,380
Do you remember...

557
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,050
what your father gave you
for your birthday?

558
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,480
Since last week,
your father is changing...

559
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,190
the owner of the stocks
of Jeguk Holdings he had...

560
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:52,150
under a borrowed name.

561
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,289
I guess it's his present
for Tan's 18th birthday.

562
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,460
Among all the shares Tan's got,
his shares of the holding company,

563
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,030
Jeguk Holdings,
take the largest percentage.

564
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,170
When he receives
his birthday present this year,

565
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,510
I think he will have
as many shares as you...

566
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,280
or even more.

567
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,050
Please call General Manager Yoon in.

568
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:30,059
Why would you tell me this...

569
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:32,159
Let's say it's out of ten years
of motherhood.

570
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,739
Get me the list
of the people who own...

571
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:41,039
my father's shares
under borrowed names.

572
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,039
As soon as possible.

573
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,409
He's not the person
you want to ask that.

574
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,210
He's the person who owns
your father's shares the most.

575
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:59,050
It's time for the executive meeting.

576
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:03,289
Do you even have
an ally in this company?

577
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:20,409
From the 2nd to the 5th floor,
there are 63 stores.

578
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,750
And there's already
a fierce competition...

579
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,780
among international
designer brands.

580
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,619
Therefore, to manage
the second convention center,

581
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,719
we should select the brands
we'd like to open as well.

582
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,619
We can also set the contract
conditions favorably to us.

583
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:38,159
Not only fashion brands...

584
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,260
but also many other brands
in various fields...

585
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:44,469
like cosmetics and furniture
are contacting us,

586
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,869
which we are examining
at the moment.

587
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,769
Do you even have
an ally in this company?

588
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,880
I'm home. Where's mom?

589
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,250
In CEO Kim's room.

590
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,579
Right, could you please
refill this? It's all gone now.

591
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:02,989
Okay.

592
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,650
I saw you.

593
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,260
Come on in.

594
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:47,000
Are you crazy?

595
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,630
You didn't answer me.

596
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:50,800
What did you talk about
with Choi Young Do earlier?

597
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,639
It wasn't another
love confession, was it?

598
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:54,800
What if it was?

599
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,139
How dare you, you criminal.

600
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,510
You were caught red-handed.

601
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,539
Kim Tan has really become nicer.

602
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:04,510
I can't believe I'm setting you
free, not locking you up.

603
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,550
If you turn your back,
I will hug you.

604
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,090
Then I will kill you.

605
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,820
If you talk back to me,
I will kiss you.

606
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:15,019
What...

607
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,130
ever.

608
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,829
Be sweet to me.

609
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,400
- Later.
- Later when?

610
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,900
You didn't pay
my five minutes back either.

611
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,840
I knew something felt off.

612
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,050
What are you doing now?

613
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:38,849
Have you lost your mind?

614
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,320
- Mom, it's not...
- Ms. Han. I have to tell you...

615
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,579
Stop talking. Both of you.

616
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,250
Have you two been dating
behind my back?

617
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,559
Mom, talk to me.

618
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,190
You should go downstairs.

619
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,159
Have you lost your mind?

620
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:53,360
You think this is your home
because you're living here?

621
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,400
You think you can
just come into this room...

622
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,500
when you want to talk?

623
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,570
Stop it, Mom.

624
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,440
The fact that I like her
is troubling her enough.

625
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:04,769
What?

626
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,639
Have you lost your mind?
What are you saying?

627
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,949
That's not true. There was something
we didn't finish talking about...

628
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:12,250
I told you to stop talking.

629
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:15,420
What did you say again?

630
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,849
I said I like her.

631
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,719
I don't want you
to act like that to her.

632
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,289
Your father can hear you.
So keep it down.

633
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:22,989
Go now.

634
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:31,869
You don't have time
to see a low girl like her.

635
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:34,269
Your brother is a CEO now.

636
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:35,739
That's always been where he belongs.

637
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,769
Do you really want
to see me go nuts?

638
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,309
Don't tell me to bring...

639
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,309
what you want to have.

640
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:46,150
- What?
- No one can decide...

641
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,619
what I should have
or whom I should love.

642
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,320
You can't decide that for me.

643
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,559
I will decide it.

644
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:00,000
Right now,
I'm falling in love with Eun Sang.

645
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,829
Please be supportive.

646
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,230
What's wrong? Did something happen?

647
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,659
What do I do, Mom?

648
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:40,500
I went to their
second son's room and...

649
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,039
Ms. Park, how could you do this?

650
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:48,840
How could you repay
my kindness this way?

651
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,309
What's wrong with your daughter?

652
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,349
You said you had nowhere to go,
so I fed you, accommodated you,

653
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:56,920
paid you, and even paid
for your daughter's tuition.

654
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,320
But how dare she cross the line
and go to my son's room?

655
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,460
I'm sorry, Ms. Han. I'm so sorry.

656
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,429
It's indeed my daughter's fault
that she went into his room.

657
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,670
But it's your son
who always asks me...

658
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,099
where my daughter is.

659
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:13,739
Shouldn't you see the whole picture
before scolding at my daughter?

660
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:15,599
What is your mother saying?

661
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,469
She's saying she's very sorry
and will knock some sense into me.

662
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:20,340
She's saying
this will never happen...

663
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,949
Come on, Mom.
I'm very sorry, Ms. Park.

664
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:27,150
What are you sorry for? Let go.

665
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:30,750
Don't you think about going
to school. You're grounded.

666
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,719
And I want you to leave
this house right now!

667
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,760
Just come out already.

668
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:36,690
I'm not done talking.

669
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,329
Let go of me!

670
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,130
I'm sorry, Mom.

671
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,969
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

672
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:55,110
I'm sorry
I couldn't stand up for you...

673
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,550
because I can't speak.

674
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,920
Sweetie.

675
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,949
Don't say that.
I'm sorry I like him.

676
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,190
I'm so sorry, Mom.

677
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,960
Maybe we should move out.

678
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:20,500
Can we really? Do we have the money?

679
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,440
The two of us will definitely
find a way to survive.

680
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,039
I can pay the debts a bit later.

681
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,880
Then let's move out.

682
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,510
I want to go back
to my old school too.

683
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,349
Hang in there
until the end of this month.

684
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,489
Let's move out as soon as I hand it
over to the next person.

685
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,420
Mom.

686
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,380
I'm in the wine cellar. Let's meet
for just one second. Please.

687
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,280
Please come down.

688
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:15,889
Hey, Cha Eun Sang. Answer me.

689
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,539
(Please answer your phone.)

690
00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:59,699
Where is...

691
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:01,599
Eun Sang?

692
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:03,539
She wasn't in her room.

693
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,710
Please tell me.

694
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:09,110
Please.

695
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,880
She just went out,

696
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,849
saying she would be sleeping over
at her friend's place. Don't worry.

697
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,070
(8 missed calls: Kim Tan)

698
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:24,849
(Contacts)

699
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,829
Cha Eun Sang? Why would you call me?

700
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,960
I'm really sorry to ask you this,

701
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,230
but could you let me crash
at your place just for the night?

702
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,300
Are you sleep-talking?
Hang up the phone.

703
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,900
Then can I ask Chan Young...

704
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,940
521 Cheongdam-dong,
Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

705
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,139
Hurry over right now!

706
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:46,579
Take a taxi. Okay?

707
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,619
So what happened?

708
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:55,550
Did you run away
or did you get kicked out?

709
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,119
I think there's an 80 percent
of a chance that I got kicked out.

710
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,760
I put my mother in trouble.

711
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,329
How does that make you run away?

712
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,400
If you don't answer me,
I won't let you stay here.

713
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,530
You're going to be
really surprised to hear it.

714
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,500
What is it?
Does Chan Young know about it?

715
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,639
It's extremely unpleasant...

716
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:17,170
that you and Chan Young share
a secret that I don't know.

717
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,340
Tell me right now!

718
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:23,280
There's a problem
at my mom's workplace.

719
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,719
My mom is a housekeeper.

720
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:29,380
I know you have had
so many part-time jobs.

721
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,789
It doesn't surprise me to hear that
you have such a family background.

722
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:34,789
And she's disabled.

723
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,730
- She can't speak.
- What?

724
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,789
Sorry. I seemed too surprised.

725
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:42,260
I'm not supposed to be so rude
like this. Sorry.

726
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,630
You're a lot nicer than I thought.

727
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:46,130
I spoke ill of you a lot.

728
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,869
It's okay. I did it more.

729
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:51,269
Then who was your mother
that paid for the camping?

730
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,210
- That's...
- Never mind. Don't say it.

731
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,210
If I hear that, we will
actually have to be friends.

732
00:52:57,809 --> 00:53:00,219
Anyhow, you're staying here tonight,
so I want you to pay for it.

733
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:02,480
Chan Young's photos
from his childhood would do.

734
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,489
- You're going to regret it.
- What are you saying?

735
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:08,289
I'm sure Chan Young has
never been ugly in his whole life.

736
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,239
I'm here.

737
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,210
I wasn't looking for you.

738
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,579
But it's about time.

739
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,550
Did you sleep outside?

740
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,349
That's what I want to ask.

741
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,320
I missed your first question.

742
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:23,090
Why did you sleep outside
leaving that huge place though?

743
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,190
It's none of your business.

744
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:27,500
Have this. This tastes better.

745
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,570
Trust me.
I have tried everything here.

746
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,440
Why do you always eat here
when you're so rich?

747
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,010
Here, eating alone
doesn't look strange.

748
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,579
- Do you usually eat...
- Don't do that gaze.

749
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:43,710
It makes my heart flutter.

750
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,760
If you're avoiding Kim Tan,
I can help you.

751
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,489
I don't need your help.

752
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,829
Let's do a gamble.

753
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:34,630
You have nothing to lose,
so just applaud the winner.

754
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,199
Put that away. You'd better
put it away while I'm nice to you.

755
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,070
I know you might not like this,
but bear with it.

756
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,539
It'd be better
if you did like it, though.

757
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,480
I wonder what Kim Tan will bet on.

758
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,750
What?

759
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,659
Cha Eun Sang, look at me.

760
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:37,329
- Let go of her hand.
- Shut it.

761
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,170
Cha Eun Sang.

762
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:53,039
I can't do this anymore.

763
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,710
I'm sorry.

764
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,409
I know this is tough for you.

765
00:58:00,219 --> 00:58:01,420
I'm sorry.

766
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,420
I can't promise it will be better.

767
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:13,829
Still, I want you to hold my hand...

768
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,130
and come with me.

769
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:19,329
Don't hold his hand.

770
00:58:48,199 --> 00:58:50,099
- Do you really like Cha Eun Sang?
- I guess.

771
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,530
So this is how I look
when I look at Cha Eun Sang.

772
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,170
I'm actually not
Chief Director Jung's son.

773
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,699
I have been lying to you. I'm sorry.

774
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:59,610
I think this is all I can do
to help you personally.

775
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:02,039
- Have you lost your mind?
- Are you Eun Sang's mother?

776
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,480
A housekeeper's daughter.

777
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,449
Go ahead and tell others about it
and make fun of me if you want.

778
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:08,219
- I didn't say anything.
- What are you going to do now?

779
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:09,420
What do you want me to do?

780
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,550
Don't you think of blackmailing
Eun Sang with that.

781
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,420
Don't go protecting
Cha Eun Sang hastily.

782
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,190
If you don't,
I will protect everyone.

783
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,489
If I have to be the old me
just to beat you,

784
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:20,599
I will kill you.

785
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:22,260
It was nice to see you
in my dreams.

786
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,230
I know you missed me too.

787
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:37,449
(The Heirs)
