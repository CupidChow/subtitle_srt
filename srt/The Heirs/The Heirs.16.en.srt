1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,610
(The Heirs)

2
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,300
(The Heirs)

3
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,300
(Episode 16)

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
I'll give you 15 days.

5
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,609
You can meet Tan
as much as you want.

6
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,609
But,

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,020
if you break up with him
after the 15 days,

8
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,119
you'll have to go
to where I want you to go.

9
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,030
It won't be in Korea.

10
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,289
It's going to be...

11
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,299
very different...

12
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,769
from America, the UK, or France.

13
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,980
You can choose whichever of the two
you would like.

14
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,310
But what's certain is...

15
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,219
that these tickets
are the only things...

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,950
that will let you go up the stairs
to the second floor...

17
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:27,060
where Tan is locked up.

18
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,519
Ms. Park, I was surprised
by the call in the morning.

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,689
Thank you very much
for paying it back so soon.

20
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,120
I saw you transferred the money.

21
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,790
Thank you so much for sending
the principal with the interest.

22
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,859
Actually, it's been hard for us too.

23
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,949
Ms. Han, did you already give me
my severance pay?

24
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,520
But you didn't leave yet.

25
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,689
Do you want me to give it to you
right now?

26
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,460
Is it your way to ask me to give
you your severance pay?

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,330
- That's not true.
- I didn't like...

28
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,389
any of the women
I interviewed earlier.

29
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,030
The first woman was too talkative,

30
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,300
the second one didn't have
any experience, the third one was...

31
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,969
Why aren't you listening to me?
What are you thinking?

32
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:52,180
Are you thinking of another
employer in front of me?

33
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:55,009
Yes, I'm right.

34
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,780
Who's the family?

35
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,819
How far did you two go?

36
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,189
How close are you with them?

37
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,930
Didn't the Chairman call you?

38
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,629
Didn't you hear anything?

39
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,900
No, he didn't. Why?

40
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,340
I think he paid off our debt.

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,550
(Eun Sol's mom)

42
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,750
(Thank you very much
for paying it back so soon.)

43
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,530
He instantly made me the one
who received money.

44
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,530
What do you mean?

45
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,870
Is this related to you?

46
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,740
Is it because of the younger son?

47
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,810
Tell me.

48
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,009
Why did he give you so much money?

49
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:06,750
Mom, listen to what I'm about to
tell you without bias.

50
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,919
It might be difficult
for you to understand.

51
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,079
Kim Tan, the younger son of Jeguk
Group became a major shareholder...

52
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,250
of its holding company, Jeguk
Holdings. It looks like a fight...

53
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,920
for the control over management
is likely to occur.

54
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:47,160
As a result, Jeguk Constructions
saw an increase in its stock prices,

55
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,589
hitting the price limit right.

56
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,459
Give me all your shares
and go back to America.

57
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,899
And never come back.

58
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,529
He's 18 years old,

59
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,600
and is currently studying
at Jeguk High School.

60
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:02,269
The appearance of the obscure
younger son of Jeguk...

61
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,579
will likely have an impact on...

62
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,649
How...

63
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,759
Can I go in?

64
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,240
How about the guards?
How did you come?

65
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,540
They left their spots for a moment,
so I ran to see you.

66
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:44,920
I missed you so much,

67
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,689
but I couldn't even talk to you
on the phone,

68
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,949
and I couldn't even talk to you
when I ran into you.

69
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:53,160
So I came up to see you.

70
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,629
I thought you were
a CG or something.

71
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,959
You were right in front of my eyes,

72
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,199
but I couldn't even touch you.

73
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,899
I'm sorry for making you locked up
like this.

74
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,910
I think everything is my fault.

75
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,509
Cha Eun Sang, look at me.

76
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,980
It's not your fault.

77
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,250
I came back on my own feet...

78
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,990
to be free from what's
been holding me down.

79
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,220
Because I want us to be together.

80
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,930
Together and free.

81
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,029
So no matter what decision I make,

82
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,870
you should trust me.

83
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,310
You're the only one left for me now.

84
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,319
What in the world is going on?

85
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,579
I'm just liking you.

86
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,459
Tan told me to take
what he got away.

87
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,829
It must be easy.

88
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,100
I'm the one buying this drink.
Can't you just be on my side?

89
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,600
How about trying to understand
Tan a little?

90
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,970
After Grandfather passed away,

91
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,740
all our Uncles, Father,
and even Aunts...

92
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,540
They were reporting each other,

93
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,050
dragging down and pulling up
each other over and over.

94
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,420
And I had to watch
all of those wars.

95
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:00,990
We'll end up fighting anyway.

96
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,790
What's the point
of trying to understand him?

97
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,459
That's why the Chairman
is trying to split it fairly...

98
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,029
so that such fight won't happen.

99
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,959
That fight happened because he
wanted to split it fairly.

100
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,899
Our capabilities are different.
Giving us equal amounts...

101
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,730
isn't fair.

102
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,939
That's true.

103
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,310
Whose side are you on?

104
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,410
Of course,
I'm always for Jeguk Group...

105
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,879
Should we say cheers?

106
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,889
Are you thinking about
the vice president's position?

107
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,820
I'll give you an answer soon.

108
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,070
(It was nice to see you
in my dream too.)

109
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,139
I thought you might be watching.

110
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,940
I'll go to school.

111
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,750
Didn't he come because of Kim Tan?

112
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:13,990
He's an illegitimate son
and a shareholder. It's newsworthy.

113
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:17,889
I wonder if they'll write an article
about a fake upstart student.

114
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,299
Hey. Does Kim Tan
come to school these days?

115
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,230
Well...

116
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,500
Can you not ask her that?
She's hurt.

117
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,370
So this is the yellow journalism
I've only heard of.

118
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,840
Look here.

119
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,639
Go. Turn right.

120
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,009
Do you know Kim Tan well?

121
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,450
Who are you?

122
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,580
I'm Jeguk group's third son. Why?

123
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,019
I'm the youngest daughter.

124
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,389
- Let's go, Myung Sook.
- Okay, Brother.

125
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,460
Who are they? Gosh.

126
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,529
There are so many weird kids
in this school.

127
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,070
(You crazy psycho, just die.
Get away from Kim Tan.)

128
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,870
(Die, Liar)

129
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,120
Is there a cow in there
or something?

130
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,649
It's soybean milk.

131
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,460
So why did you date Kim Tan
and put yourself into a mess?

132
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,399
I know what you're going to say,
but it's not me.

133
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,269
Yes. Is this the snack bar?

134
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,240
Move.

135
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,970
What are you doing?

136
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,509
I'm taking revenge for you.

137
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:46,679
At least one of them
will be the culprit's.

138
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,750
Are you trying to ruin every cabinet
just to ruin the culprit's cabinet?

139
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,179
- Yes.
- Does that make sense?

140
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,220
Why doesn't it make sense?

141
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,019
The culprit is here.

142
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,250
Stop!

143
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,360
- What did others do wrong?
- What did you do wrong?

144
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,259
Why are you smiling?

145
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,330
Now I understand you a little bit,
Choi Young Do.

146
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,700
Thank you for caring about me,
but please don't.

147
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,299
You shouldn't play with food.

148
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,940
So you at least need to feel
thankful to smile for me.

149
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,879
Now you understand me a little too.

150
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,509
Anyway, what are you going to do
with all this?

151
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,950
They're on me.

152
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:29,590
Drink up, Cha Eun Sang.

153
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Hey!

154
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,669
Drink it. Choi Young Do bought it.

155
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,370
- Did you drink it?
- Yes.

156
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,740
Were there any symptoms?

157
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,570
Like fever, diarrhea, or vomiting.

158
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,610
There's no way Choi Young Do
will buy us drinks for free.

159
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,879
These are for you.
It's for letting me sleep over.

160
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,710
My gosh. He's so cute. So cute!

161
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,019
Why are you using a non-celebrity's
picture without their consent?

162
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,120
Don't you have other pictures too?
Like his ugly pictures.

163
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,820
Something that can ruin his life
when revealed to the world?

164
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,460
There's no way it would exist,
given my handsomeness.

165
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,830
That's true.

166
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:11,730
Don't ever break up. Okay?

167
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,799
Of course, we won't.

168
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,470
I'm sorry, Lee Bo Na.

169
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,799
My friend, Yoon Chan Young.

170
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,399
Cha Eun Sang,
are you out of your mind?

171
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,940
Is it today? The day you two
are fighting?

172
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,039
You come here too.

173
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,980
What's wrong?

174
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,480
See? You're being like this
because of the drink.

175
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,450
What is it? Why?

176
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,720
Just because.
I suddenly wanted to do it.

177
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,460
I should've brought you some food
from outside.

178
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,330
Now you're realizing that?

179
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,799
If you're here all day,
what do you usually do?

180
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,110
Thinking about bad things.

181
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,139
Things that teenagers
should not be doing?

182
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,409
It's even worse.

183
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Something that can ruin...

184
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,549
every relationship.

185
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,620
I'm not sure whether this is
the perfect timing or not.

186
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,590
But I have something to tell you.

187
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,389
- What is it?
- Have you heard...

188
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,059
of Eun Sang studying abroad?

189
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:21,669
Studying abroad?

190
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,399
What kind of studying abroad?

191
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,610
I know about the Chairman
more than you do.

192
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,649
He is much more merciless...

193
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:37,779
both as the owner of a company
and father.

194
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,860
I will take my phone.

195
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,190
I never allowed...

196
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:51,759
Put it down.

197
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,639
Mother, you should get me
out of the house.

198
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,840
I have to go to school.

199
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,039
Yes. I'll be waiting then.

200
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,679
Have you called for your mother's
help to go to school?

201
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,320
- Yes.
- Why school?

202
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,980
Don't tell me...

203
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,090
if it's because of that girl.

204
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,090
It is.

205
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,059
You called the Chief Director
of the school...

206
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,490
just so you could see her at school?

207
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes, and she's coming right now.

208
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,700
It's thanks to the stocks
given by you.

209
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,200
Do you think I gave them to you
to use on a measly thing like that?

210
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I have a favor to ask to you too.

211
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:35,570
Please never...

212
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,980
put your hands on Eun Sang.

213
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:41,649
Are you threatening me?

214
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,049
You're the one who handed a sword
to me so I can threaten you.

215
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
It's the sword you handed to me.

216
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,419
If you ever put your hands
on Eun Sang again,

217
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,759
I don't know who I will cut
with this sword.

218
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,490
I'll be back.

219
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,009
Money, reputation, power,
they're good, aren't they?

220
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:14,549
Now, you can call me to come
as you want.

221
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,279
You've changed a lot too, Mother.

222
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,820
You ran to me
just after a phone call.

223
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,120
You should know the rules
of this world too.

224
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,889
That you need to pay for calling
someone to come.

225
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,059
- I know that much.
- Learn properly when I teach you.

226
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,330
You'll have to pay back later
for this small deal today.

227
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:34,870
The moment you regret it,

228
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,629
you'll realize that it's too late.

229
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,370
That moment of regret.

230
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,409
To you, it must've been when you
answered my phone just now.

231
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,639
Do you remember what you did
to me and my mom?

232
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,350
I heard reporters are in front
of the school.

233
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,549
We have to look friendly...

234
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,580
- when we get off the car.
- I know.

235
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,160
We're going to have a family
gathering tonight.

236
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,400
We should be taken more photos.

237
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,970
- Yes.
- I'll bring the Chairman.

238
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,039
I won't be late.

239
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,880
I've never seen them together
like that for years.

240
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,619
I thought she was very strict,
but they're closer than I thought.

241
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,480
It's obviously a show
for the reporters.

242
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,289
As much as you have, people want
to use and gossip about you.

243
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:31,960
We're no exceptions.

244
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,259
He became a major shareholder,

245
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,559
and has absolute protection
by the Chief Director.

246
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,900
I can see how firmly
he's telling people...

247
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,700
not to mess with him,
although he's an illegitimate son.

248
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,390
What are you doing?
Class didn't start yet...

249
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,559
- What's that?
- What is he doing?

250
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:10,990
Hey, Kim Tan.

251
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,670
What's wrong? What are you doing?

252
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:38,420
It was real.

253
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,259
Do you even like me?

254
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,130
Do you even trust me?

255
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:51,799
Answer me!

256
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,009
- Give it to me.
- Do you want to die?

257
00:18:58,779 --> 00:18:59,809
Hey!

258
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,150
Am I really a joke to you?

259
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,380
How can you not tell me about this
after receiving this?

260
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,150
When did you receive this?

261
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,619
Did you receive this
before coming to my room?

262
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,990
This ticket means you can never
come back to Korea.

263
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
You can't even dream about
coming back.

264
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,299
But you received this and came up,

265
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,240
smiling? How could you smile?

266
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,539
Then what else could I do?
I was too scared.

267
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,410
Or else, I'd have to leave
without seeing you.

268
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,980
How could I ever choose
another option?

269
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,380
That's why you should've told me.

270
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,319
You should've let me deal
with my father.

271
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,750
I lost everything.

272
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,059
You're the only left for me.

273
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,730
I can't lose you.

274
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,359
So please,

275
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,230
don't get hurt when I'm not there.

276
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,099
It drives me crazy.

277
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,559
I'm sorry I only made you cry.

278
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,759
I'm sorry.

279
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,140
What happened for you guys
to fight so passionately like this?

280
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,670
You even made a woman cry.

281
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,349
You even used your strength,
Kim Tan?

282
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,549
Do you think you can do everything
because you're a major shareholder?

283
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,720
Shut it and hold her.

284
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,019
I hate to say this,

285
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,430
- but you're the best option now.
- What?

286
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,329
If you want to go back to school,
go with her and bring her back here.

287
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,869
Don't put your hands on her.
I'll pick her up by eight.

288
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,500
You've finally gone crazy.

289
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,339
There's no guarantee that we'll
be here waiting for you until then.

290
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:10,170
I don't have time for this.

291
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
I'll be back.

292
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,019
Why are you crying?

293
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,990
Don't forget you owe me one.
Aren't you going to pay me back?

294
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,000
Are you ignoring it
since we never signed it on paper?

295
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,170
I'll pay you back. For sure.

296
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,200
When?

297
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,410
After school?

298
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,710
Eating janchi guksu together.
Will it do?

299
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,779
Let's just watch a show next time.

300
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,190
We don't have to talk to each other
and get pictures taken. It's better.

301
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,420
Maybe next time.

302
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:38,099
It's nice to get some fresh air
with family sometimes.

303
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,529
How's searching Won's fiancee going?

304
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,930
We just have to set the date.

305
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,099
The picture will be handed
to your secretary tomorrow.

306
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:49,910
Send me your schedule
through him.

307
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,680
I'll book the place.

308
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,740
I'll do it myself
when the time comes.

309
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,980
Please don't bother.

310
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,880
It's time.

311
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,089
You should get married and make your
own family to manage the company.

312
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,789
There will be a temporary
shareholders' meeting in two weeks.

313
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:07,990
Both of you should attend.

314
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,829
The agenda...

315
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,700
is the dismissal of CEO Kim Won.

316
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,670
What did you just say?

317
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,069
The candidate for the next CEO
is Yoon Jae Ho.

318
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,539
It's about time for him to manage
one of our affiliates.

319
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,680
- Father.
- Lower your voice.

320
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:32,650
There are many ears outside hearing.

321
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,049
The agenda was accepted
even when I've already changed...

322
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,519
all the board members?

323
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,789
The board members
that I had hired...

324
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,259
approved the agenda?

325
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,099
So why did you replace
the board members?

326
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,400
Without my consult at that.

327
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,339
Everyone was working for me
with trust.

328
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,740
I should pay back their trust.

329
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,369
Then what about me? I'm young,

330
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:59,240
and you treat me like a kid.

331
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,549
I'm already a puppet-CEO.
Exactly why are you doing this?

332
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:04,650
I said it many times.

333
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,019
The company is not yours yet.

334
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:10,549
But you keep acting like it is.

335
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:15,329
I told you I wouldn't hand it to you
just because you're my eldest son.

336
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,029
Between you two,

337
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,299
I will hand it to the better one.

338
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:25,640
You're just a move
I made in a hurry...

339
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,609
for Jeguk Group.

340
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,809
It's a wrong move,
so I need to take it back.

341
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,250
Did you make Tan a major shareholder
to do this?

342
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,450
I lost appetite.

343
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,450
I think I should get going.

344
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:47,690
I'll go with you.

345
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,730
Then the next family meeting...

346
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,029
will be the temporary
shareholders' meeting.

347
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,500
Let's see there.

348
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,400
I feel like we're going
to meet soon.

349
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,309
Sit down.

350
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:09,049
I see you're holding onto me,
now that I have something...

351
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,680
in my hands.

352
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,890
Don't be so cocky. You're only 18.

353
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,849
You can't do anything
without your guardian's consent.

354
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,720
I'm 18, so I can do things
adults can't do.

355
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,089
- I'm leaving.
- Sit.

356
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,960
I'm not done talking.

357
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,599
Do you have time to be doing this
with me right now?

358
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:32,670
There must be many people
you have to meet.

359
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,269
I should be the last person
you should meet.

360
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,839
Do it as you always did.

361
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:41,309
I was never your priority.

362
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,230
Can we meet?

363
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,980
You heard about my dismissal, right?

364
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,410
- Yes.
- You're the candidate for it.

365
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,180
- Yes.
- Did my father promise...

366
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,420
to offer you my position?

367
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,819
Did you stab me behind my back
with my father?

368
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:25,960
It wasn't supposed to be like that,
but it turned out like that.

369
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,359
How can you do this to me? How?

370
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,329
Is this the answer you told me
that you would give soon?

371
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,829
The offered vice president position
must've looked like nothing.

372
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,329
It didn't.

373
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,869
Win against your father.
Keep your position.

374
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,009
That's all you have to do.

375
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,680
If you keep your position as CEO,

376
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,750
I'll come back and work
as the vice president.

377
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
- Hello.
- Hey, give it to me.

378
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:17,940
Why are you answering
Cha Eun Sang's call?

379
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,509
How can I not? It was ringing
right in front of me.

380
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,049
- Where are you?
- Here?

381
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,480
In your heart? Bye.

382
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,660
Why do you young masters
always pick up someone else's...

383
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,990
The Chairman did that to you
to make Kim Tan kneel.

384
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,000
Am I right?

385
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,869
- That's not true.
- What do you mean it's not?

386
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,269
You were caught by Kim Tan. I know.

387
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,039
Why did you order tteokbokki?
We came to eat janchi guksu.

388
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,640
So I can see you again.

389
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,779
Well, this won't do.

390
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,920
Write a contract.
We didn't eat janchi guksu yet.

391
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,349
I can't trust you.

392
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:04,220
Fine. I will write it.

393
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,369
I promise to have janchi guksu
with Young Do. By Cha Eun Sang.

394
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:18,299
Happy?

395
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,670
Look at you.

396
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,670
There's no way you'd willingly do
what I ask for.

397
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,109
Why did you cry earlier?

398
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,079
Eat your tteokbokki.

399
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,150
I guess today's not the day.
I'll let it slide for now.

400
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,380
Did you memorize my number?

401
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,849
I can't even remember
my own sometimes.

402
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,089
Memorize my number. Kim Tan's too.

403
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,329
Call me if something happens.

404
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:45,799
It'd be even better if you can
call me when you're bored.

405
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,200
If you're not going to eat more,
let's go.

406
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,670
Mom will be worried about me
if I come home too late.

407
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,140
It's already quite late
because I don't have work today.

408
00:28:58,509 --> 00:28:59,680
I will let you go.

409
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,210
I'll have to let you go to make
Kim Tan get mad.

410
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,750
It's really fun to see him
like that.

411
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,519
But you have to take my car.

412
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,349
I will.

413
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,259
(I promise to have janchi guksu
with Young Do. By Cha Eun Sang)

414
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:39,349
You managed to find this place.
But Cha Eun Sang is gone.

415
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:40,619
That's why she isn't here.

416
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,789
You're not someone to let her go.
And she's not someone who'd stay.

417
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:46,259
So why did you come?

418
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:47,390
Thanks for that day.

419
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:51,390
You came to my house
and helped me escape.

420
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,700
Do you have another secret?

421
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:00,740
Like, maybe you're actually a girl.

422
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:03,769
Everyone is using the hidden card
I've been keeping for three years.

423
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,609
I can't even eat
because I'm so upset.

424
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,309
Korea's advanced internet system
doesn't come in handy in this case.

425
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,609
- Let's go.
- Just surrender.

426
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,849
Before you get locked up again.

427
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:16,690
It seems he took care
of Cha Eun Sang already.

428
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,420
I know so mind your own business.

429
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,690
- Let's go.
- You go first.

430
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,990
Get up, punk. Don't sit here alone.

431
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,609
Great.

432
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,970
You're doing so great.

433
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,509
Go back to your room now!

434
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,980
Mom.

435
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,950
Get up. Why are you doing this
on the floor?

436
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,289
My son is home.

437
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,519
My major shareholder son is home.

438
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,190
Mom can't go out with you.

439
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:03,029
So I just had a glass of drink
to celebrate.

440
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,240
Don't say anything, Son.

441
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,640
This is why I can't show you
to other people.

442
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,240
I'm worried you might
cause a trouble!

443
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:14,609
This is why you're a flaw
in Tan's life!

444
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,920
Am I the only flaw? Am I?

445
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,589
Am I the only one
who gave birth to Tan?

446
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,250
I told you to go back
to your room now!

447
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,019
Don't yell at Mom.

448
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,759
My life itself is filled with flaws.

449
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:32,430
One more scratch does nothing.

450
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,599
My mom's sky is the ceiling
of this house.

451
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,069
You're the one who made it that way.

452
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,769
Stop being a selfish coward...

453
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,640
as a father and a husband.

454
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,309
- I won't stand it anymore.
- What if you don't?

455
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,579
What are you going to do
if you won't stand it?

456
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:52,220
Don't be curious.

457
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,750
Because I don't know what I will do
these days.

458
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,690
Don't make me hold hands
with your enemies.

459
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,960
Don't make me think...

460
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,329
about whose hands I should hold
among your enemies.

461
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,029
What?

462
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,230
Mom. Let's go in.

463
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,720
I saw you turned the light off
just now, so come out!

464
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,960
I'll give you five minutes. I need
to prepare for my class tomorrow.

465
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:38,859
I can't come here for a while now.

466
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,759
I can't see you.

467
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,700
So listen up.

468
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:46,740
Go to the States just for
three years. I'll go get you.

469
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:50,210
- Please go, Hyun Joo.
- Why would I go to the States?

470
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:54,279
This is my life. Why do you make
decisions for it?

471
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,509
Because I want to be
in your life with you.

472
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:58,250
- So...
- We can't do that.

473
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:01,180
You can't be with me, you know that!

474
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:03,789
- Go.
- Can't you just go?

475
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,619
It's because I don't want you
to see me at my lowest point.

476
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,460
I said I would go get you.

477
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:14,059
Something happened, right?

478
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:18,299
Please go.

479
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,599
What's the matter? Will I know by
reading the newspapers again?

480
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,069
This is why I asked you to go!

481
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:24,740
Don't read any articles about me.

482
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,609
I can't allow you to know
what pathetic things I gained...

483
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,450
by letting you go.

484
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,319
I'm begging you.
Please don't read them.

485
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,859
Okay. I won't.

486
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,980
(You got a new message.)

487
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Where are you?

488
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,159
Of course, I'm at home.
I'm about to go to bed now.

489
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,530
(Of course, I'm at home.
I'm about to go to bed now.)

490
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,539
Come out with your passport.

491
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,699
If you don't come out,
I'll go in and find it.

492
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,849
I'll keep this.

493
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,219
I said I would go get you.

494
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,659
I said for you to wait.

495
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,389
Please just stay
where I tell you to.

496
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,860
Wait if I tell you to wait.
Don't go if I tell you not to.

497
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,130
You go and come back from school
with me from now on.

498
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,269
Please just listen to me.

499
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Got it?

500
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,219
Don't go anywhere.

501
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,900
Promise me.

502
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
Get in.

503
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,699
Father probably saw the CCTV
already.

504
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,030
It's okay. Get in.

505
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,340
If you hesitate, my efforts
will be in vain.

506
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,250
Daisy is the green light to Gatsby.

507
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:53,679
Looking at the dim green light he
can't reach, shining through fog,

508
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,480
Gatsby lives in hope.

509
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,559
But Daisy was not his hope,
she was a deadly poison.

510
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,489
Gatsby falls in love with Daisy,
a mirage in the end.

511
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,829
And destroys his own life
just to be...

512
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,630
with someone he loves.

513
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,420
I heard Hyo Shin and Rachel
had kissed.

514
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:29,320
I was there. It was a commotion.

515
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,570
- You should avoid me.
- I have no reason to.

516
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,670
It's uncomfortable for me.

517
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,300
It's different
from your original purpose.

518
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:48,199
Tan and I were supposed to be
uncomfortable with each other.

519
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,469
Can't you just avoid me first?

520
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,239
You don't care about what
others think though.

521
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,380
Do you think I care about
what the other kids think?

522
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,539
Then why are you telling me
to avoid you?

523
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,250
I'll go around you.

524
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Thank you.

525
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,940
I heard about the temporary
shareholders' meeting.

526
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,809
I knew the Chairman was scary,
but this is beyond my imagination.

527
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,449
How can he hold a meeting
to fire his own son?

528
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:37,489
I'm on your side no matter what.

529
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,760
I decided to be on the opposite
side of the Chairman.

530
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,130
Don't ask me why.

531
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,489
I won't forget it.

532
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,730
Voting? There's nothing difficult.

533
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:52,440
But I have a condition.

534
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,969
JG Convention in Jeju will be
working together with Zeus Hotel.

535
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,769
Let's get this business going.

536
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:08,079
He talks casually just right away.

537
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:11,949
When you told me about the shares
under borrowed names,

538
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,820
you said you had raised me with love
for ten years. I want to lean on it.

539
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,659
What do I gain?

540
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,679
You should be on my side.

541
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:41,949
Don't listen to Father.

542
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,550
You're supposed to ask me a favor.

543
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:48,719
Not "you should".
"Can you" is more appropriate.

544
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,630
But still, I'll be on your side.

545
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,199
There's a girl I like,

546
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,639
but Father won't leave her alone.

547
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,739
So I want you to get her
an apartment.

548
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,309
- The one in the maid room?
- Yes.

549
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,519
Are you saying you're going to
cast a vote for me just for a girl?

550
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,550
Yes.

551
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:19,190
Just for that girl,
I'm going to do anything.

552
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:21,389
This is the beginning.

553
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:26,760
But don't say she's "just" a girl.

554
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,070
Because that girl
is my everything now.

555
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,210
Fine. Try protecting her.

556
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,840
Do you only need a house?

557
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:42,750
You would need a car
and a driver too.

558
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,980
I'll do everything for you,
so try protecting her.

559
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,550
Call me if they're all ready.

560
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,340
What have you been doing
since a while ago? Are you hurt?

561
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,510
I don't know...

562
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,349
which injury I got from when
still needs recovery.

563
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,980
Are you going somewhere?

564
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,989
I'm going to eat out
with my mom and dad.

565
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:24,920
Do you want to come?

566
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,059
You said your father hates me
as I am.

567
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,230
Even if my father objects, I...

568
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,389
will feed you.

569
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,400
You look skinny these days.
Let's go.

570
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,369
I don't want to. I have a plan.

571
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,940
You're always like that.

572
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:43,309
With whom? When? Where?

573
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:45,539
"With whom" and "where" are clear,

574
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,639
but I'm not sure about "when".

575
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,449
I'm leaving first.

576
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,579
Are you going to wait in front of
Cha Eun Sang's house or something?

577
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,550
Don't do that! You're going
to be so embarrassed by it later!

578
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,760
I've been there. I've done it all!

579
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,449
She's not coming.

580
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,650
- Sorry?
- Let's get going.

581
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,980
Yes.

582
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:32,349
Stop by a convenience store
on the way.

583
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,719
Yes.

584
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,550
What is this? Why are you here?

585
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,989
I knew we had a plan.

586
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,860
But I hate being cold.

587
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:10,789
Wait for me under the roof
next time.

588
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,960
Who's waiting who?

589
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,929
If you're cold, just wear this...

590
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,829
Before I threaten you, just wear it.

591
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:21,039
And don't sleep in the street.
It's getting cold.

592
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,840
It was only once.

593
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,769
Are you kidding me? I've seen
it three times already.

594
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,849
- What?
- At dawn, wearing a sweat suit,

595
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,880
half-asleep, coming out
from the gate of Tan's house.

596
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,579
Myung Soo saw you.

597
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:40,260
I think that day
was when I first met you.

598
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,260
You don't remember it?

599
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,030
Two kiddos this big were crying.

600
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,130
I got into a fight with them
to protect you,

601
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,869
but you left
without turning back even once!

602
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,239
I had no idea.

603
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:58,570
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind!

604
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,880
I like to keep things to myself.

605
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,619
You're a bad guy
but also a nice guy.

606
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,250
It would've been nice
if I knew it faster.

607
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:15,719
It's not late.

608
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:20,199
Let's say today is the "faster" day.

609
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:23,969
Let's not do that.

610
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:26,739
Just let me pass by you.

611
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:30,510
If you get to like someone else,
be nice to her.

612
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,440
Don't trip her over just because you
want to hold her hand.

613
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,849
Don't threaten her
to eat jjajangmyeon together.

614
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:46,289
It was for a brief moment,
but it was warm thanks to you.

615
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,559
Thank you. I'll get going.

616
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:55,360
Don't go.

617
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,199
I have a plan with Tan.

618
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:00,269
You don't.

619
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,309
Today is Jeguk Group's
shareholders' meeting.

620
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,239
How can he have time
to meet you now?

621
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,809
We're supposed to meet before that.

622
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:13,449
I know a lot about farewells
and running away at night.

623
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,820
You don't look like a person
that is going to meet someone.

624
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,019
You look like a person
that is going to miss someone.

625
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,460
What is it? Were you kicked out
of Kim Tan's house?

626
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,300
Are you moving out?

627
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,500
You know everything.

628
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,840
We're moving out soon.
I've been house hunting these days.

629
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,739
Call me if there's a cheap house
to rent in your neighborhood.

630
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,610
We could live in the same
neighborhood if we're lucky.

631
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:42,710
I'll get going.

632
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,869
You can move in starting from today.

633
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:07,869
If you go down,
a driver will take you there.

634
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,309
Whether you use the car
or she uses it, do what you want.

635
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,139
Okay. Bye.

636
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,110
You didn't forget today's
the stockholders' meeting, right?

637
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,309
You must attend.

638
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:23,449
I know that's the price
of wielding my sword.

639
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
I'll be on time.

640
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:28,260
Also, don't forget that you need
to cast a vote against it,

641
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:30,090
not for it.

642
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
You still don't trust me.

643
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:36,699
See you later.

644
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,670
Don't lower your guard.

645
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:43,170
The girl you're trying to hide...

646
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,139
How long do you think it will take
for Father to find?

647
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,510
I know. He will find her soon.

648
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,519
But it doesn't matter.
I'm just showing him.

649
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:58,719
That for the last 18 years,
I loved him and you very much,

650
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,789
but I don't anymore,

651
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,260
and she's the only one...

652
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,699
that's left for me.

653
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:16,139
That's why I don't care who I am,
how I was born,

654
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:18,909
and how old I am.

655
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:22,639
I'm going to use my everything
to protect her.

656
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,280
It's a warning for him
to never put his hands on her.

657
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:58,809
I made a mistake thinking you'd be
smart enough to realize it soon.

658
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,289
I forgot again that people who grew
up without money are shameless too.

659
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,460
How can an 18-year-old's love...

660
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,690
be this fearless and shameless?

661
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,130
Thanks to you, Tan lost Rachel
and his family,

662
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:18,800
and has been laughed at
by the world.

663
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,400
How much more
are you going to ruin him?

664
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:32,949
- You came?
- Yes.

665
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,579
- When did you come?
- Just now.

666
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,079
Do you like it that much?

667
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,780
It's out first matching item.

668
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,849
I really wanted to do this.

669
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:12,019
Still, how could you buy it?

670
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,860
You never miss a chance
to spend money.

671
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:19,130
We have a new pair of shoes,
how about walking a little?

672
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,630
We can show off our sneakers too.

673
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,030
Okay. Let's go.

674
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,170
I actually have somewhere to go.

675
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:33,409
Where is this place?
Whose house is this?

676
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:36,309
Your house.

677
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,550
- What?
- Leave our house.

678
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,780
I'm anxious because of Father.

679
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:45,650
Move in with your mother tomorrow.

680
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,460
Does the Chairman know about this?

681
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:50,960
He will soon.

682
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,960
Even if he knows,
I won't let him bother you.

683
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,829
I promise.

684
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:02,039
Is this your way of helping me
clear all the hurdles...

685
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,610
- in the world?
- This is the beginning.

686
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:09,780
I'm sorry I'm not good with it,
that it has to be this way,

687
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,320
and how it is one-sided.
I'll get better at it.

688
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:16,519
I will try my best to have
my methods get closer...

689
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:18,820
to what works for you.

690
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:37,739
When do you want to move in?

691
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:44,409
Tomorrow?

692
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:48,320
It's about time
for the meeting, right?

693
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,789
- How about you?
- I'll stay here just a little more.

694
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,989
I want to take some pictures
to show Mom,

695
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:55,789
and look around more.

696
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,130
How are you going to go back home?

697
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,500
I think you keep forgetting it,
but I went to America alone.

698
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,400
Don't worry.

699
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,699
Okay. I'll go.

700
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,590
It feels like we're married.

701
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:31,230
You're the one who said
it feels like we're married.

702
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,829
What...

703
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,599
How can you do this
without telling me?

704
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,039
Look at her.

705
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,039
Have you done something
after telling me?

706
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,340
I'll be back. See you at home.

707
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:51,280
Come back safely.

708
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:54,679
I'll wait for you at home.

709
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,489
The 83rd temporary
shareholders' meeting...

710
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,889
of Jeguk Constructions will begin.

711
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:42,300
The first agenda today...

712
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:45,969
is the dismissal of Kim Won,
the CEO of Jeguk Constructions.

713
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,199
(Ballot Box)

714
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,530
I'll announce the result.

715
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:24,110
The proposal to fire Mr. Kim.
Approval,

716
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,309
Three percent.

717
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,280
Opposed, 95 percent.

718
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:34,380
Abstain, two percent.

719
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,590
As it doesn't meet the requirements
to pass the proposal,

720
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:41,360
the proposal to fire the CEO
will be declined.

721
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,829
As a result, the proposal to hire
the new CEO will not be voted.

722
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,800
This concludes our meeting.

723
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,800
(The 1st temporary shareholders'
meeting in 2013)

724
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,909
What was it about?

725
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,880
I guess the Chairman was trying
to tame his son.

726
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:09,480
Well, thanks to that, we made
a progress with our business,

727
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,650
so let's see this
in a positive light.

728
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:28,070
It's rejected, fortunately.

729
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,010
Congratulations, CEO Kim.

730
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:35,010
You're something else.

731
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,050
Are you at least getting a grip
of the situation?

732
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:48,519
Was this...

733
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,860
Was this a show?

734
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,030
You do know how to think.

735
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,099
Your brother might feel appalled
right now,

736
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,699
so don't go around and bother him.

737
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:12,710
How does it feel attending your
first shareholders' meeting?

738
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,019
What did you do to Won?

739
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:19,550
I just made him feel humiliated
just a little bit.

740
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,920
Not only your brother,

741
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,659
but you too.

742
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:28,559
What...

743
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,800
do you mean?

744
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,170
Eun Sang.

745
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:38,969
The girl you hid.

746
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,809
An hour ago,

747
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,210
she left Korea.

748
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:55,519
The number you have dialed
does not exist.

749
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,059
Please check the number,
and try again.

750
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:09,769
Ms. Han, thank you for everything.

751
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,940
I'm sorry for making you
uncomfortable.

752
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,809
I'm very sorry for leaving
without a proper goodbye.

753
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,050
Please take care of your health
and goodbye.

754
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,119
Mrs. Park, is Eun Sang...

755
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,820
Mom, where is Eun Sang?
Where is she?

756
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,260
I think she left with her mom.

757
00:56:32,829 --> 00:56:35,099
How can they do that without even
telling me?

758
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:56,179
Eun Sang? She quit.

759
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,389
Why do you always ask me
where Eun Sang is?

760
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,420
What on earth happened to you two?

761
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,210
Don't forget about today.

762
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,550
The price of wielding your sword...

763
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:04,590
is losing her...

764
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:07,420
today.

765
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:03,409
(The Heirs)
