00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:05,639

2
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,160
(The Heirs)

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,469
(Episode 15)

4
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,329
You made Cha Eun Sang to come here?

5
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,700
For a catering service?

6
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,239
I feel like crap right now,
so don't talk to me.

7
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,939
Cha Eun Sang saved you today.

8
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:12,280
I'll let it slide this time since
Eun Sang came here on her feet...

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,709
and revealed it with her own mouth.

10
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:15,579
But,

11
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,019
there's no second chance, Sister.

12
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,950
Does Cha Eun Sang know that
you're this passionate about her?

13
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,150
She can't know.

14
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,890
I'll be embarrassed.

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,430
Young Do, Young Do!

16
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,230
The thing is...

17
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,829
You know the person who was on...

18
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,069
What was the name?

19
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,269
- Are you drunk?
- Yoo Rachel, you were too much.

20
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:43,480
Do you remember the letter I gave
you at the middle school graduation?

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,609
What if I remember?

22
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,849
You're always like that.

23
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,049
How can you not respond to the
letter that first started in the UK,

24
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,189
which gives its recipient good luck,
getting passed around the world?

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,359
- Cha Eun Sang is ridiculous.
- She should know her place.

26
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,019
How can she kiss Kim Tan?

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,230
Well... I should go to the bathroom.

28
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:12,469
I'm leaving first.

29
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,120
Why are you out here?

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,389
I was waiting for you.

31
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,889
I missed you a lot.

32
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,229
Me?

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,659
(Hyun Joo)

34
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,259
Go in first.

35
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,930
Make sure to come in.

36
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,169
- Hello.
- Lee Hyo Shin, are you crazy?

37
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,840
Are you out of your mind?
How can you not take the exam?

38
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,879
I see this big of a trouble
is the only way for you to call me.

39
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,750
Where are you? Your mother
is looking for you like crazy.

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,750
I'll tell you if you promise
to come alone. Will you come?

41
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,810
Be on the lookout for me.
He fell asleep, but just in case.

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,139
We're in this together now.

43
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,060
If he knows about this...

44
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,560
He must know about it already.

45
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,330
I heard he placed someone
on my tail.

46
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,000
What could it be?

47
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,479
Won's birthday, Tan's birthday,

48
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,889
the foundation day of the company,
his and my birthday. It's all wrong.

49
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,419
I tried everything.
What on earth could it be?

50
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,610
Indeed a person needs skills.

51
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,259
Does it remind you of any
number combination?

52
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,870
Won's mother's birthday.

53
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,199
These punks...

54
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,769
What is this?

55
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,209
My gosh.

56
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,209
How was the exam? Was it hard?

57
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,480
I heard it was harder
than the past years.

58
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,750
How hard could it be?

59
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,649
You're amazing as expected.

60
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,149
Did you really do it well?
I'm getting a bad vibe.

61
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,819
What do you know about studying
to say that?

62
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,490
- He's not wrong.
- You...

63
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,800
Can you distract Cha Eun Sang?

64
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,470
Why do you make my Chan Young
do that?

65
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,509
You just told the world that you're
dating a poor welfare student.

66
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,180
Are you happy now?

67
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,680
I hope you're happy too.

68
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,449
- I mean it.
- I can give up on our relationship,

69
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,319
but I can't stand seeing you happy.

70
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,529
In exchange of getting Cha Eun Sang,
you should lose one of your people.

71
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,089
Or see them being distanced
from you.

72
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,160
Congratulations on getting back
together.

73
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,730
Be happy for just a little bit, then
go back to the messy, illicit love.

74
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,569
Why would you say that
on such a good day?

75
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,410
Hyo Shin.

76
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:51,279
What are they doing?

77
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,680
- What's going on?
- What?

78
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,449
- My goodness.
- What?

79
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,990
- What are they doing?
- What's that?

80
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,360
Yoo Rachel is...

81
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,629
I'm speechless.

82
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,209
- Is it to make Tan feel jealous?
- No.

83
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,910
It's to make you uncomfortable
around Kim Tan.

84
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,079
It's even better if you two
become strangers.

85
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,550
I have no feelings for you.

86
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,019
I don't have feelings
for you either.

87
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,129
What?

88
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,639
This is ruined. It's ruined.
This is my party!

89
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,009
It's ruined!

90
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Look at you.

91
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,319
What on earth did you drink?

92
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,620
Juice. Three glasses.

93
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,790
Juice, my butt.

94
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,089
Jo Myung Soo, that unsound kid.

95
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,459
But why am I so hot?

96
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,600
Can you stop tempting me?

97
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,639
I'm not confident
that I can hold myself back.

98
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:19,670
Hey, Kim Tan.

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,040
Why?

100
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,879
Kim Tan who is so cool.

101
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,079
Stop being so cute.

102
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,279
You're in real danger now.

103
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,950
Kim Tan who walks toward me
whenever he sees me.

104
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,690
Kim Tan who keeps suffering
because of me.

105
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,399
If you say one more word,
I'm going to leave you here.

106
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,899
Kim Tan. I started liking you.

107
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,909
With my heart.

108
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,559
Why are your hands so cold?

109
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,799
You always make me worried
for everything.

110
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,820
Where were you? Were you
with Eun Sang all this time?

111
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,159
You said it's an urgent matter.
You told me to fly over.

112
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,259
Then skip over those things.

113
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,200
I brought another jacket.

114
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,100
The temperature is going to drop
even more tomorrow.

115
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,070
This was the urgent matter?

116
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,440
You're worried
I might freeze to death?

117
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,210
I brought it because I came to meet
you anyway.

118
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:07,580
Actually, I came up with a plan.

119
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,980
First, apologize to Rachel tomorrow.
Say you're sorry for what you did.

120
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,450
Mom, did you not
give up on that yet?

121
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,690
Trust me.

122
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,820
I can turn the engagement
into what it was like before.

123
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,659
It's a little shameless,

124
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,200
but I'll meet Rachael's mother
tomorrow and...

125
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,230
Mom.

126
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,429
What I want to turn back is not
the engagement.

127
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:29,570
Don't you get it?

128
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,070
I don't want to live as a fake.

129
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,799
Why are you a fake?

130
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,440
Whatever people say, you're
the second son of Jeguk Group.

131
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,440
- Then what are you, Mom?
- What?

132
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,309
Is being Kim Tan's mom
not enough?

133
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,850
If I'm not the second son
of Jeguk Group,

134
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,289
am I nothing to you?

135
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,529
Thank you for the clothes.
Get home safe.

136
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,720
You didn't take the exam?

137
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,919
It was possible for you?

138
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,590
- Yes.
- "Yes"?

139
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,730
We concluded that we hadn't thought
through it properly, honey.

140
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,840
Whether it be social science
or humanities, choose what you want.

141
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,210
Do you really mean it?

142
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,779
You're going to retake the exam
anyway, so we're letting you do it.

143
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,710
You can do that while preparing for
Legal Education Eligibility Test.

144
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,120
Then go to law school.

145
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,049
Since you will have more experience,
it'd be easier next year, right?

146
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,460
Cheer up, Lee Hyo Shin.

147
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,330
Just like the early-action
college interview,

148
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,769
why don't you just let me retake the
CSAT right away too?

149
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,240
I'd rather have you scold me.

150
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,710
Instead of suffocating me.

151
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:20,080
Do you know how abusive
your methods are?

152
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,649
And do you know how frustrating
it is to have a disappointing child?

153
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,779
It's late. Let me finish
the conversation with him.

154
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,549
Whatever your dream is,

155
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,320
I have a dream...

156
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,830
I dreamed for you too.
Don't forget that.

157
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,710
Lee Hyo Shin.

158
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,649
What in the world happened?

159
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,080
How could a senior not take
the college entrance exam?

160
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,289
Everyone is looking at you. Are you
happy to become a star?

161
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,690
They're looking at us because
it's amusing to see us together.

162
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,529
Guy number one in the messy,
passionate love drama,

163
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,259
and guy number two.

164
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,659
Shouldn't we actually
be feeling awkward?

165
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,669
Don't act like you have
common sense.

166
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,169
You're the one
who didn't take his CSAT.

167
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,009
So are you okay?

168
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,580
What did your family say?

169
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,610
"Cheer up, Lee Hyo Shin."

170
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,080
That's what they said.

171
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,450
What kind of torture
are you going through?

172
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,220
It doesn't seem like you're living
above the clouds either.

173
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,490
I'm sorry about yesterday.

174
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,730
I swear the second one
was not in my plan.

175
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,870
I just wanted to show it to someone.

176
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,700
That "someone" isn't me, right?

177
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,980
Okay! The class is over.

178
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,179
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

179
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,659
Do you have something to say?

180
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,830
Look at how confident she is.

181
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,100
You faked to be an upstart
when you're a welfare student.

182
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,659
You're too fearless for someone
who did that.

183
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm sorry that I deceived you.
I'll apologize.

184
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,370
Is an apology enough?

185
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,539
Someone fooled us that an escort
bar was a bottled water business,

186
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:28,210
and a welfare student fooled us
that she was an upstart.

187
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,240
What a wonderful school!

188
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,879
How did you pick up Kim Tan?

189
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,440
Tell me your way.

190
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,210
- I don't want to.
- Hey.

191
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,149
You must be so brazen since you have
Kim Tan behind your back, right?

192
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:42,850
Do you know what the world is like
these days? It's not for villains.

193
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:44,490
Choi Young Do, she...

194
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,090
If you thought I sounded like
I was allowing you to talk to me,

195
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,690
it puts us both
in a very tough situation.

196
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,429
Let's go.

197
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,370
Don't hang out in groups.

198
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,669
You need to learn how to live
your life by yourself too.

199
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,309
Thank you for being
the "dark knight".

200
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:03,470
Who is the dark knight?

201
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,039
If I'm the dark knight, is Kim Tan
the prince on a white horse?

202
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,149
My face is fairer than his.

203
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,850
Hyo Shin didn't take the exam.
Did you hear that?

204
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:18,059
I already liked him,
but I like him even more now.

205
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,389
- See?
- See what?

206
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,299
Even if you don't mention my secret,
we can still have a conversation.

207
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,169
Why are you suddenly coming at me?
You're making me uncomfortable.

208
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,039
I just thought you might be
not used to talking about yourself.

209
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,409
Go on your own from here.

210
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,940
You were seeing me off?

211
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,039
How can you be so slow?

212
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,250
Choi Young Do, come out!

213
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,179
Did you tell your father?

214
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:19,419
How about you?
Did you tell your brother?

215
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,320
What about the report card?
Did you show him?

216
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,149
Can't you just say I hit you?

217
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,500
You must know the reason
why I called you over here...

218
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,899
from your secretaries.

219
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,539
I'm sorry for bringing in
busy people to say this,

220
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,779
but I think I reached my limit.

221
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:47,779
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,179
I'll give him a warning.

223
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,419
Do you know Young Do's grades,
Mr. Choi?

224
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,450
Young Do is ranked 98th.

225
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,889
I'll give him a more serious
warning.

226
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:03,429
CEO Kim, do you know
what Tan's rank is?

227
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,259
It's 100th. None other than 100th.

228
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,529
- Nationwide?
- In Jeguk High,

229
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,039
out of the 100 juniors.

230
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,180
There's no middle ground for me.

231
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,049
I guess your IQ...

232
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,619
has no relation to your grades.

233
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,420
But still,

234
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:35,759
you beat Tan for the first time.

235
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,079
100...

236
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,119
Are you going to do the same
for the final too?

237
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,450
No.

238
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,759
- I'll get better.
- As if you can get any worse.

239
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,390
Why do I like that you're
getting mad at me?

240
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,359
I thought you wouldn't care
about how bad my grades were.

241
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:18,170
Don't you have classes? Do you
wipe the windows all the time?

242
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,369
Thanks for coming, Won.

243
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,670
Bye.

244
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,960
Is the school work hard?

245
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,859
Why do you look much thinner?

246
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,059
The kids still treat me
as a teacher.

247
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,829
Because the news article of me
being an orphan wasn't released yet.

248
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,430
Thanks to the Chairman, I heard
it would be out next week.

249
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,500
It won't be released.

250
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,309
Just please answer my phone.
I won't eat you up.

251
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,839
The article... Did you block it?

252
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,460
Thank you for sparing your time.

253
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:18,029
You must be busy, so I'll just
cut to the chase.

254
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,029
Please do so.

255
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,430
I came to ask you
to formally break off...

256
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,269
Tan and Rachel's engagement.

257
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,609
Even if it's going to happen,
I should be the one to call it off.

258
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,910
What's this audacity?

259
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:35,380
That's Tan's and my opinion.

260
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
You...

261
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,950
I'm not sure what I should call you,

262
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,190
but I don't care about the opinions
of what Tan and you...

263
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,819
may hold.

264
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,089
Moreover, why should I be talking
about such an important matter...

265
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,930
with someone like you?

266
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,230
That's exactly why you should
talk with me.

267
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,470
I'm Tan's mother.

268
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,170
Tan's mother that I know
is Chief Director Jung.

269
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,170
I know what you think of me.

270
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,779
I know what I look like to you too.
I'm used to it.

271
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,710
But it doesn't matter.

272
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,180
They're too young to be tied
with each other by a promise made...

273
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,420
between two companies.

274
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,920
- So their engagement...
- It's true Rachel is too good...

275
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,960
to be tied with an illegitimate son.

276
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,299
My daughter's future is at stake,
so there's nothing I can't say.

277
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,670
I hope we won't have any chance
to see each other's face again.

278
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,210
I didn't want to go this far, but...

279
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,740
I don't know what that is,
and I don't care.

280
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
I'm sorry.

281
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,519
It's also a matter
of my son's future.

282
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,960
There's nothing I can't do.

283
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,630
You're playing so dirty.

284
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,759
Why did you pry into someone else's
private life?

285
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,470
Okay. Let's break the engagement.

286
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:05,099
Completely.

287
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,769
Yes, that's what I want.
Let's end the engagement.

288
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,609
The final assessment will
be a group project.

289
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,450
You have to choose one of
the classical pieces written here,

290
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,119
and use your creativity to express
your opinions on the literature.

291
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,450
Write your names under the piece
you want to work on,

292
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,859
and find your teammates on your own.

293
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,359
Each group should have
between 2 to 4 members.

294
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,230
- We don't have time for this.
- No way.

295
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,890
We read things like that
in elementary school.

296
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,200
But you have changed.

297
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,569
If the reader changes,
the literary work changes too.

298
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,799
Chan Young, let's do it together.

299
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,839
I'll help you.

300
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,710
Do you want to do it with us?

301
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,609
Sure.

302
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,480
Who is it?
Who is the one who made this group?

303
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,019
I was definitely in Chan Young
and Bo Na's group.

304
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,519
Choi Young Do, was it you?

305
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,549
A team with these members
are not my type.

306
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,690
Then what's your type?

307
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,660
Choi Young Do, Cha Eun Sang,
Suzy, and HyunA.

308
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,799
Are you joking in this situation?

309
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,900
- Kim Tan, was it you?
- My taste...

310
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,930
is Kim Tan, Cha Eun Sang,
Cha Eun Sang, and Cha Eun Sang.

311
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,900
- What are you looking at?
- Both of you, listen.

312
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm very busy with my part-time job,
so please cooperate.

313
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,740
It's obvious you won't read
the piece even if I ask you to.

314
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,109
That's why I prepared this.

315
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,650
I'll read the book on my own,
you watch the movie version of it.

316
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,549
And contribute at least a sentence.

317
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:31,990
I won't hesitate to take out your
names if you don't participate.

318
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:33,160
Keep that in mind.

319
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,559
Look at the screen. And don't fight.

320
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,900
Think that you're
in different universes.

321
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,549
Here is your drink.

322
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,849
Excuse me. I said
two coconut juices.

323
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:01,849
I'm sorry.

324
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,210
The Chairman asked us to bring you.

325
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,980
Look at the scale of Jeguk Group.

326
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,619
Is it all because you ran away
from home?

327
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,630
If you don't cooperate, I'm allowed
to touch you.

328
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,230
Let go. I'm going with you.

329
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,869
If you need my judo skills,
why don't you ask for my help?

330
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,640
I don't think today is the day.

331
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,779
Don't worry. I'm just going home
earlier than I planned to.

332
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,779
Don't flirt with her.

333
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,279
Let's go.

334
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,900
Can I leave work
just 30 minutes early today?

335
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,029
I'll work until close tomorrow.
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,769
Did he just get dragged away?
Is he from a rich family?

337
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,539
- Hey.
- What?

338
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:33,940
Do you want me to give you
a ride on my motorcycle?

339
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,680
Buses are a bit slow, right?

340
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,119
- Can you do that for me?
- Only two of us are left.

341
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:43,519
I want to throw a party, but how can
you ask me to give you a ride?

342
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,859
You owe this to me.

343
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,950
What in the world did you do?

344
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,390
What on earth did you do while you
were away for this to happen?

345
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,390
Rachel had no intention
of breaking the engagement!

346
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,930
She finally made the right choice.

347
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,700
I said it's me who ended it.
Why are you lashing out at him?

348
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,670
I didn't like Rachel from the start.

349
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,700
She has pointy eyes,
a pointy nose...

350
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,240
Won't you keep your mouth closed?

351
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,069
You missed your last chance.

352
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:39,440
Do you know what this means?

353
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:42,049
It means they won't keep quiet...

354
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:44,210
about your secret,
and our family situation.

355
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:47,549
It means Jeguk Group became
something to gossip about!

356
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,720
And you'll get even more rich.

357
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,619
"War between brothers", "Conflict
over the control over the company".

358
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:56,329
The rumors will make the stock
price rise. What's to worry about?

359
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,759
I'm sure you're not worried about
Mom and me being hurt.

360
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,700
I've been worried about your life.

361
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,000
Are you doing this
because of Cha Eun Sang?

362
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,099
It's because of you.

363
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,170
Chairman, please don't!

364
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,240
Who's the chairman?

365
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:12,140
Why is he a chairman even at home?

366
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,740
Is Father still your boss?

367
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,650
Do I really...

368
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:24,089
have to put my hands on her?

369
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:25,619
Do you not want to see me
ever again?

370
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,859
They're only 18-year-old
high school students.

371
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,690
It's not like they want
to get married now.

372
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,960
But the engagement has ended!

373
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:37,000
You're not allowed to take even
a single step outside of your room!

374
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,569
You can't go to school either.

375
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,400
Give me your phone.

376
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:45,680
"I'm sorry, I did wrong."
Can't you just say that obediently?

377
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,049
Your phone and laptop are taken,
and you're locked up in your room.

378
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:50,710
What are you going to do now?

379
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,720
They say you can see the star
better when it's darker.

380
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,490
Now since it's darker,

381
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:57,789
I'll see the stars better.

382
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,490
What on earth are you talking about?

383
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,490
Was it really you
who broke the engagement?

384
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:04,289
Yes. She agreed to do it.

385
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,359
Did you meet her?

386
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,160
Didn't she say something bad to you?
What did she say?

387
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,799
I took care of it on my own.

388
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,740
I just wanted to make
what you wanted happen.

389
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,970
Because I'm your mom.

390
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,180
- You won't regret this?
- I won't.

391
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:22,779
I,

392
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,819
for the first time,
was Tan's mother.

393
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:32,720
My son held my hand...

394
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,190
and freed me from my room.

395
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,059
That's why I'm locked up this time.

396
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,329
Why don't you free me this time?

397
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,299
You should rest. Let me know
if you're hungry.

398
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:51,369
I told you to wait.

399
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:55,410
You do whatever you want
when it comes to marriage.

400
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,180
You got me engaged then ended
the engagement without my consent!

401
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,920
What's with this sad drama?
It's not like you.

402
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,890
Can't you think rationally?

403
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,690
You marrying an illegitimate son?
Does that make sense?

404
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:08,589
That family is messed-up.
It's for the better.

405
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:10,759
You liked it because it was
Jeguk Group.

406
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,829
How classy are you?

407
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,529
Is there a guarantee that you won't
divorce Young Do's father...

408
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,029
and take half of his company
this time like you did before?

409
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:20,869
You fought Dad with 7 or 8 lawyers
to divorce him!

410
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,440
That's how you divorced him!
Is that you being classy?

411
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,380
I saved you from a sham marriage.

412
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,680
Yoo Rachel. Watch your words.

413
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,650
At least I liked Tan.

414
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,789
I liked your dad too.

415
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,299
Although the ending was a divorce.

416
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,529
- You should forget him quickly.
- I don't need your advice.

417
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,039
Don't interfere
with my life anymore.

418
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,670
Don't even try
to do business using me.

419
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,710
I...

420
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,809
am not a product for a new season.

421
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,269
Wait.

422
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:33,609
I told you to put your hands in my
pockets and hold it.

423
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,380
You should suffer from chilblains
and get your fingers cut off,

424
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:40,450
to regret and think, "I should've
put my hands in his pockets..."

425
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,819
"even when I know he likes me
when I'm riding his bike."

426
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,589
Thank you for the ride.

427
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,609
It seems like Kim Tan is locked up.

428
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,809
What a heartbreaking chapter
if it were to be written in a book.

429
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,779
Title. "The Advancement
of the Chairman."

430
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,549
Are they standing there so that Tan
can't leave?

431
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,319
You can pretty much say more than
half of the characters are guards.

432
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,960
They aren't father and son in this.

433
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,859
They're fighting, man to man.

434
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,000
Even if you're under the same roof,
you won't be able to see him.

435
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,740
That's good news.

436
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:38,609
I'll get going.

437
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,710
I'll pay you back.

438
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:48,720
You don't even know what I'm going
to ask you to pay back with.

439
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,230
I live here.

440
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,549
You saw what's going on
in the house, right?

441
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,720
Can't we sign the housing
contract earlier?

442
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:22,220
I'm worried you'll be affected
by this as well.

443
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,720
I don't think the tenants didn't
move out yet.

444
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,789
I'll call the owner.

445
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:30,589
Is Tan locked up in his room?

446
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,430
Don't come out
and stay in your room.

447
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,109
(Kim Tan)

448
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:49,750
Where are you? In your room?

449
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,180
Are you okay?

450
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,390
(Where are you? In your room?
Are you okay?)

451
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,930
You three, listen carefully.

452
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,529
Ms. Jung Ji Sook,
find Won a fiancee.

453
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:11,900
Take everything into consideration
and find the best one.

454
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,400
- Okay.
- There's one more.

455
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,740
Just because Won got rid
of my people at the company,

456
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,480
it doesn't mean the company
is in his hands.

457
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:25,250
If you're going to mess up with Won
and gamble with stocks like that,

458
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,849
just take his name
off the family registration.

459
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,819
Han Ki Ae, if you're going to raise
Tan like that,

460
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,230
get out of this house.

461
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,200
- Mr. Yoon.
- Yes, Chairman.

462
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,599
The engagement with RS broke.

463
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,539
They will probably tell
the whole world...

464
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:49,410
Tan is an illegitimate son
to damage his reputation.

465
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,410
You should fix that.

466
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,180
Okay.

467
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,980
Before the end of today, call over
all the board members...

468
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,880
to finish transferring the stocks
under borrowed names to real names.

469
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,019
Bring everything tomorrow.

470
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,289
Yes, Chairman.

471
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:06,920
Bring your resignation letter too.

472
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,160
Won got rid of all my people,

473
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,630
except you.

474
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:18,130
What do you think that means?

475
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:23,410
It means I didn't betray anyone
and I didn't become anyone's enemy,

476
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,480
and I didn't work for anyone
to come this far.

477
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,109
That's why
I'm being fired right now.

478
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,349
That's right.

479
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,049
Not having an enemy means
not having an ally.

480
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,059
I know very well
that you're an upright person.

481
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:46,130
But what's left for you now?

482
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,099
Start teaching Tan again.

483
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,640
Meanwhile,
I'll think about whether...

484
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,670
I should approve
your resignation or not.

485
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:57,869
Yes, sir.

486
00:33:58,109 --> 00:34:00,210
Really? Were you really fired?

487
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:02,349
Yes.

488
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,519
How can you say that over
having plain old doenjang stew?

489
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,349
I had a chance for a promotion,

490
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,920
but I lost it and got demoted.

491
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,460
Are you sure you lost it?
Or did you not want it?

492
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,389
Even if I didn't want it, I should
have been an alley to someone,

493
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,460
but trying not to hurt anyone...

494
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,929
was not being on anyone's side.
I didn't know that.

495
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,269
I can't understand everything,

496
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,239
but I support your failure.

497
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,570
Don't worry. I'll hurry and graduate
to start making money.

498
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,650
But it's not that you don't have
any money saved, right?

499
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:39,920
I'm not sure.

500
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,780
What?

501
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,369
Why did you lock the door?

502
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,309
Open it!

503
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:43,250
Won't you hurry and open it?

504
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,579
Are you on a hunger strike
or something?

505
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,579
No one will listen to you
even if you do this.

506
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,820
It's bad for you only!

507
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:53,190
Before you starve to death,
I'll worry to death.

508
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:54,690
Tan!

509
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,389
Kim Tan!

510
00:35:57,929 --> 00:35:59,699
Please open the door.

511
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,730
You should live to see if things
will be a success or a failure,

512
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,230
or neither, Kim Tan!

513
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,610
Did you come by yourself?

514
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,920
Is Kim Tan totally locked up?

515
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,489
The guards are everywhere even
on the stairs to the second floor.

516
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,460
It must be so scary for Tan.

517
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
Hey.

518
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,590
Why are you going so far,
Cha Eun Sang?

519
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,159
Do you think I'm on your side
just because I like you?

520
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,800
Or do you think
I'm on Kim Tan's side?

521
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,969
Why are you letting your guard down?

522
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,639
Can't we have a conversation
like this as friends?

523
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,840
Who said we're friends?
Why am I your friend?

524
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,340
Don't draw the line.

525
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:47,809
Or I will cross it.

526
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,989
Move away.

527
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,059
I said move.

528
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:17,769
What are you doing?

529
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:24,650
Let me go to school at least.

530
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,650
If you want to talk,

531
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,550
I'll listen after coming back.

532
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,190
You don't have to go.

533
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,889
If it's hard to handle this kid,
you're allowed to hurt him.

534
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:38,460
Put him in his room.

535
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,099
It's okay as long as he can breathe.

536
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,400
I'm going for a walk.

537
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,440
Mr. Yoon.

538
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:27,980
I think you should call me
teacher again.

539
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,579
The Chairman wants me to restart
your business management class.

540
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,920
That's why you're here?

541
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,519
Yes. You didn't forget everything
you learned...

542
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,119
while you were having fun
in the US, right?

543
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:41,860
I didn't even memorize anything
from the beginning.

544
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,429
Well, let's think of this as a good
chance to start with the basics.

545
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:46,460
I don't want to.

546
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,699
Thinking about the people
under Jeguk Group's roof,

547
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:54,940
the major shareholders,

548
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,809
the uncles, aunts, and cousins...

549
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,480
that are no better than strangers,

550
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,710
and deciding who I should take hands
or get rid of based on their stocks.

551
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,550
I'm not interested
in stupid things like that.

552
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,989
You were a little young back then.

553
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,320
But now you're old enough
to learn what you don't like.

554
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,519
I said I won't.

555
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:19,059
Are you not interested
in business at all?

556
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,599
I was ten when I had
my first class with you.

557
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:32,110
That was the first time I thought
something was weird.

558
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,650
- What was weird?
- "Aunt had many stocks,"

559
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,449
"but why does my mom not have any?"

560
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,849
I thought, "If my mom does get
something called shares,"

561
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,760
"would she able to hold my hand
and go out?"

562
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,389
So I asked myself this.

563
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,360
"Won, what do I have to do..."

564
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:02,940
"to make my mom have more shares..."

565
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:05,670
"than Chief Director Jung?"

566
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,210
I can't forget the look he had...

567
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,849
at that moment.

568
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,019
The company is my brother's.

569
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:20,690
I'm not interested
in things that are his.

570
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,340
Enjoy your meal.

571
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,710
Hey, Cha Eun Sang sat at the welfare
student's seat.

572
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,010
- What's wrong with her?
- What's wrong with her?

573
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,539
- Seriously...
- Really?

574
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,610
Why don't you take another seat?

575
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,420
If you're sitting here, I feel like
Kim Tan will pop out of nowhere.

576
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:49,449
It makes me feel very bad.

577
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,849
You know he can't come.
Let's just eat.

578
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,190
Please be scared of me, will you?

579
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:55,889
Just eat the food.

580
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,429
- What?
- It's big news.

581
00:40:58,429 --> 00:40:59,460
What in the world...

582
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,170
Choi Young Do!
This is from the tabloids just now.

583
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,030
- Kim Tan is illegitimate!
- What is he talking about?

584
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,340
He's the son of the Chief Director.
Why is he an illegitimate?

585
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,639
Was he adopted?
Does it mean his mom is a mistress?

586
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,710
No way.

587
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,510
If it's true, Jeguk Group
must've blocked the news.

588
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,039
Did you hear, Yoo Rachel?
The guy you... Where are you going?

589
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,409
- Hey, did you see it?
- The Chief Director isn't his mom?

590
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:18,610
- So he has another mother?
- Lee Bo Na, did you see it?

591
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,650
That's nonsense. Do you believe
such rumors?

592
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,119
80 percent of what they say
are lies.

593
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:25,650
If it's true, Jo In Sung and I
got secretly married last year.

594
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,489
He didn't come to school today.
Don't you know why?

595
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,389
No way. Is that really true?

596
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,789
Is that why he didn't come?
Because he knew?

597
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,530
How many guards are there
in and out of the house?

598
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,429
About six? Why?

599
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:40,869
Has it been a month or a year since
the Chief Secretary left?

600
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,110
How could you be so incompetent?

601
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:47,639
How can you let such a small matter
slip and make things worse?

602
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,250
Figure out who was behind this!

603
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,650
I'll call you again.

604
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,619
What are you doing?

605
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,360
Hurry and make this issue bigger.

606
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:04,760
Do you want me to release it
to the news?

607
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,869
The clothes are already stained with
ink. It can never be clean again.

608
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,269
In that case, you need to draw
another picture on it.

609
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,969
"War Between Jeguk Group Brothers".

610
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,239
"Will Blood Be Shed?"

611
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,610
"Amid Fight for the Crown Between
the Legitimate and Illegitimate."

612
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,110
"Stock Price to Rise Day by Day"
Call reporters for a press release.

613
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,719
Make an announcement on Tan.

614
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,420
Make him a major shareholder.

615
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,900
There's an announcement.

616
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,659
Tan has become a major shareholder!

617
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,269
You really didn't know about this?

618
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,800
Did he do this alone?

619
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:52,469
(Changes in Major Shareholders:
Kim Nam Yoon, Kim Tan)

620
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:05,989
As Jeguk Group is likely to get in
a power struggle,

621
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:08,219
including its holding company
Jeguk Holdings,

622
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:11,260
it has seen an increase in its 11
affiliates' stock prices,

623
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,360
hitting the price limit right before
the closing bell.

624
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,059
It's weather news.

625
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,469
I said I came to see Kim Tan.

626
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,039
You should tell me
how you know him first.

627
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,539
Are you doing this knowing who I am?

628
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,429
Tell them I'm the heir
of Hotel Zeus,

629
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,099
Choi Young Do.

630
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:50,829
Hello, Mr. Kim.

631
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,239
It's Young Do.

632
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:58,739
But what's this commotion you
caused in my house with your guards?

633
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,409
I came to do homework.

634
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,150
What?

635
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:05,610
We have a group presentation
for literature class,

636
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,949
Tan and I are in the same group.

637
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:09,789
We should watch a movie together,
read a book,

638
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:11,090
and even debate.

639
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,489
But Tan didn't come to school,

640
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,460
so my schoolwork became a mess.

641
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:18,429
I told my father I was going
to Tan's house.

642
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,429
He told me to give
his regards to you.

643
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:25,030
Mr. Choi must be glad.

644
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,510
Seeing his son so passionate
about studying.

645
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,039
Thank you.

646
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,210
Where is Tan's room, Mr. Kim?

647
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,690
Kim Tan, let's do homework.

648
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:03,070
Why do you look so touched?

649
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:07,079
Hey, are you crazy? Can't you see
what's going in our house?

650
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,210
What did you come here for?

651
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,250
I'm already being hated by Father.

652
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,519
You're such a good son.
That's why you can't do anything.

653
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,789
Since the beginning of history,
all fathers and sons have fought...

654
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:21,059
against each other. You need to win
against him to get the throne.

655
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,090
Okay.

656
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,260
Let's see when you can win against
your father with dishwashing.

657
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,599
Three years of my effort has turned
into nothing by one gossip.

658
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,670
So how could I not come?

659
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,670
- What are you talking about?
- About you.

660
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:38,539
Everyone at school heard the gossip
in the morning.

661
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:42,179
And this article was released
in the afternoon, confirming it.

662
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,119
(Jeguk Group Kim Tan)

663
00:45:48,219 --> 00:45:49,690
("Fight Between Legitimate and
Illegitimate Son Over Management")

664
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,849
("Who Will Be Winner?")

665
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:57,030
You're really surprising.

666
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,599
As soon as you hit the lowest
with your secret being revealed,

667
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,400
how could you become
a major shareholder?

668
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,139
Buy our stocks before they
even go up higher,

669
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,369
I'm the only illegitimate son,

670
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,670
so you won't have another chance
like this ever again.

671
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,110
- Why are you putting on clothes?
- I should get out of here now.

672
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,280
Are you going to stay here alone,

673
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,179
or will you help me?

674
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:20,679
It's right for me to not help,
given our relationship.

675
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:22,920
But...

676
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:25,789
Kim Tan being indebted to me...

677
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,719
is very appealing.

678
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,420
If it's appealing, take it.

679
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,489
You brought a helmet, right?

680
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:44,969
Excuse me.

681
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,440
Excuse me! Hey!

682
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:48,980
Hey!

683
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,320
- Catch him.
- Catch him!

684
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,480
Catch him!

685
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,920
Hey!

686
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:57,449
No!

687
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:06,559
Move away!

688
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:08,900
- Hey!
- Let go of it!

689
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,699
Let go!

690
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:12,500
Get out!

691
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,809
What are you?

692
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,119
Let go.

693
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,389
Do you have a problem?

694
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,289
Find him. Go find him!

695
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,070
They're so suspicious of people.

696
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:46,670
My hair is messed up.

697
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,440
Did you see the announcement?

698
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,909
You must've known about it
of course.

699
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,780
Yes. It was my last work.

700
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,820
I can't handle any of Jeguk Group's
official matters anymore.

701
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,150
- I will no longer be able to come.
- You're on the waiting list, yes.

702
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:05,449
Then you're jobless.

703
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,690
My main job is being a father.

704
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,389
Being jobless is my side job.

705
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:09,590
Then instead of a side job,

706
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,000
how about the vice president
of Jeguk Constructions?

707
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,969
I won't give you this offer again.

708
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:18,800
So don't think about it too much.

709
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:22,440
Won.

710
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:25,139
I was about to leave.

711
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,210
I'll call you. Please talk.

712
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,119
Look at me.

713
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:43,730
Why should I?

714
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,829
Do I have to make myself favorable
to you and listen to you now?

715
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,630
I'd like it if you could do that.

716
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:51,329
What?

717
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:53,099
I saw the announcement.

718
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:56,469
As soon as I saw it,
I had to come see you.

719
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:59,880
So please look at me, listen to me,

720
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,780
and believe my sincerity.

721
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,780
Sincerity?

722
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,809
Do you even believe in yourself?

723
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:07,849
What moves people is the situation,
not sincerity.

724
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,989
I can't even trust you now.

725
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:11,690
I can't trust you
ten years from now.

726
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,690
Today is the start.

727
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,789
And your shares that became equal
as mine is your sincerity.

728
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:18,659
I never said I would
take the shares.

729
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,130
I don't want to use them
as they're in my hands now.

730
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,199
Even if it's true, do you think
it was easy for me to come to you?

731
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,369
What should I do to gain your trust?

732
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:30,539
Go to the States.

733
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:35,010
Give me all your shares
and go back to America.

734
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,349
And never come back.

735
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:37,980
That's how you can gain my trust.

736
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,119
How?

737
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:44,820
How can you say that?

738
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,420
Why? You don't want to do it?

739
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,860
I can give you all my shares.
But...

740
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:52,429
I don't want to go to the States.

741
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,730
How can you tell me
not to come back ever again...

742
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,570
so easily?

743
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:01,639
Because that's my sincerity.
And you're not being sincere.

744
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:03,039
Do you really mean it?

745
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:06,639
I said I would give you my shares.

746
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,610
I won't be an obstacle on your path!

747
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:13,420
You can hate me, mistreat me,

748
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,880
and ignore me.

749
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,420
But how can you abandon me again?

750
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,860
How can you say that I should
never come back?

751
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,869
I'll ask this for the last time.

752
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:36,000
Do you really have to do this?

753
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:39,010
I'll say this for the last time.

754
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,780
Just answer me if you're going
to go to the States or not.

755
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,250
I'm not going.

756
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:49,280
I don't want to.

757
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,590
And I'm not giving you
my shares either.

758
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,989
Just now,

759
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:00,159
I changed my mind.

760
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,469
You want my shares?

761
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:08,800
Then take them away.

762
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,900
From now on,

763
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:40,570
I'll give you two options to choose.

764
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,289
Seeing the one who ran away
on his feet came back,

765
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,530
I guess money is surely
a good thing.

766
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,460
Your son was locked up.

767
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,239
But the illegitimate son of Jeguk
Group became a major shareholder.

768
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,400
It's an early birthday present.

769
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,809
Because you're my son.

770
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:27,710
Starting today, I'm not your son.

771
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:29,780
I'm my brother's enemy.

772
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,579
I thought I could persuade you.

773
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,719
If I don't take away what
my brother has in his hands,

774
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,489
and if he goes his way,
while I'm going my way,

775
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,329
I believed our family
would have peace.

776
00:53:45,429 --> 00:53:46,489
But today,

777
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:49,460
you ruined all my effort.

778
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,630
While Won runs the business,

779
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,469
you never know what will
happen to him.

780
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:57,340
He could go to jail.

781
00:53:57,909 --> 00:53:59,809
Or he could become sick like me.

782
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,079
Then they will come at him,
trying to steal his seat like dogs.

783
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,619
That's why we need you.

784
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,619
That's what I can do
for your brother,

785
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:15,760
for the company,

786
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,530
and for peace.

787
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:19,730
So...

788
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,699
you're saying the peace we have
to protect is being...

789
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,670
in a constant state of worrying,
doubting, and being anxious...

790
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,739
about whether I would steal
what Won has,

791
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,639
and whether he would steal
what you have, right?

792
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,980
Now you understand.

793
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,050
But Father,

794
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:40,420
thanks to you,

795
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:43,489
I lost my family.

796
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:47,889
I became my brother's enemy today,

797
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,289
so he can't be my mom's family
no matter what.

798
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,730
Also, my mom
was never your family,

799
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:02,469
and you...

800
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,679
are no longer my family.

801
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,409
That's...

802
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:14,119
the weight of the crown
you must endure.

803
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:18,690
You should bear it.

804
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,989
If you break up with Tan today,

805
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,530
I'll send you...

806
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,300
to anywhere you want to go.

807
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:11,369
Any cities in Korea,

808
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,679
America, the UK, France,

809
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,110
wherever is fine.

810
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,949
But...

811
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:25,690
if you can't break up with him
immediately,

812
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,619
there is another option too.

813
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,630
I'll give you 15 days.

814
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,000
You can meet Tan
as much as you want.

815
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:39,570
But,

816
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:42,840
if you break up with him
after the 15 days,

817
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:49,079
you'll have to go
to where I want you to go.

818
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,010
It won't be in Korea.

819
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,280
It's going to be...

820
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,119
very different...

821
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,489
from America, the UK, or France.

822
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:43,099
How?

823
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,489
Does Kim Tan come to school
these days?

824
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:15,400
Can you not ask her that?
She's hurt.

825
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,099
- Who are you?
- I'm Jeguk Group's third son.

826
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,400
I'm the youngest daughter.

827
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,670
How much more
are you going to ruin Tan?

828
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:22,269
He even made me the one
who received money.

829
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:24,070
Do you even like me?
Do you even trust me?

830
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,809
Then what did I have to do?
I was too scared.

831
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:27,210
Don't be hurt without me.

832
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,679
It drives me crazy.

833
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,039
You heard about my dismissal, right?

834
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,579
Did my father promise
to offer you my position?

835
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:34,849
Hold her. I can't find a better one
than you.

836
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:36,780
- What are you doing?
- Taking revenge for you.

837
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,420
The culprit is here.

838
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,489
Don't feel relieved.

839
00:58:39,489 --> 00:58:41,619
I'm going to protect her using
everything I have.

840
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,929
So don't ever put your hands on her.
It's a warning.

841
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:52,030
