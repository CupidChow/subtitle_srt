3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,399
(Episode 18)

4
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,240
If you miss Eun Sang, just go
and at least see her from afar.

5
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,909
I'm not going there anymore.

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,549
You can have her.

7
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,229
What did you just say?

8
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,640
Do you want to die?

9
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,280
You think you deserve to be
this heartbroken?

10
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,280
No, I don't.

11
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,890
I can't do it anymore,

12
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:29,489
Young Do.

13
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,270
As you've probably been reported,
Chief Secretary Yoon has been...

14
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,169
appointed as the Vice-President
of Jeguk Constructions.

15
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,169
Pathetic.

16
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,639
That's all he was ever meant to be.

17
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,479
Even the Red Hare is
a mere animal...

18
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,620
without Lu Bu.

19
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,949
While it's true that the Red Hare
carried Lu Bu,

20
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:33,629
Guan Yu went on more battles
for a longer period of time.

21
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,530
Get going now.

22
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,930
I'm not here to see you.

23
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,699
My goodness! What happened?

24
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:48,210
Did you get into a fight again?

25
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,879
What are you trying to do?

26
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,810
What happened to your face?

27
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,680
What a pathetic brat.

28
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,250
For how long
are you going to be like this?

29
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,419
I can only tolerate with it
if it's for a day or two!

30
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,319
Tan...

31
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,539
Get up. Let's get you
to the hospital.

32
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,139
- Get out.
- You made a deal with me.

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,639
You said you'd do anything
I told you to do.

34
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,080
That means you should do it
without talking back at me.

35
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
Get up.

36
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,250
Get out.

37
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,520
Get out!

38
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,289
When are you going
to get your life together?

39
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,629
Nothing is going to change
by you acting like this.

40
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,330
You know that better.

41
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Won,

42
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,409
when am I going to the States?

43
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,009
I feel like I'm going to die.

44
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,250
Just send me off already.

45
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,020
Save me, please.

46
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,730
Hold up, Choi Young Do.

47
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,410
Did Tan get into a fight with you?

48
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,810
No, it was more like me
beating him up.

49
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,110
He deserved the beating.

50
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,879
If you want to sue me, go ahead.

51
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,990
Why did you beat my brother up?

52
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,290
My bad.

53
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
I know better than to mess
with people with brothers,

54
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,389
and I forgot that Tan had one.

55
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,029
Tan never talks about you,
after all.

56
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,430
I guess Tan neither has a brother,

57
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,399
nor a friend.

58
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,839
You should put some cream
on your face too. It'll scar.

59
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,750
"He entered the edge
of the village."

60
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,149
"He walked on until he came
to his house."

61
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,560
He entered the edge of the village.

62
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,730
He walked on until he came
to his house.

63
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:00,060
"It was empty.
'Something is wrong!', he cried."

64
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,939
It was empty. And he cried,

65
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,069
- "Something is wrong!"
- There's something wrong with you!

66
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:11,610
Finals are coming up and you can't
take your eyes off of my photos.

67
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,949
Why do you keep looking at my photos
when I'm right here?

68
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,149
No way. You've been snooping
on Eun Sang's Facebook all along?

69
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,889
I was looking to see if I could find
any clues as to where she must be.

70
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,889
Oh my goodness. Is she crazy?

71
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,459
"I hope Jeguk Group burns down."
"Where are you?"

72
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:29,930
"I'm drinking water."

73
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:32,329
Why is she talking to herself?

74
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,660
I don't think that's Eun Sang.

75
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,399
What do you mean? It's her account.

76
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,240
"Kim Tan is so handsome."

77
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,740
If not Eun Sang, who would write
such a thing?

78
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,939
Read the post below, too.

79
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,139
"Where are you, Cha Eun Sang?"

80
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,110
Why is she looking for herself?

81
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,680
(Where are you, Cha Eun Sang?
I miss you.)

82
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,949
Where are you, Cha Eun Sang?

83
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,319
I miss you.

84
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,360
(Eun Sang)

85
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,870
(Eun Sang)

86
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,410
Wherever you went,

87
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,949
I was always there with you.

88
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:28,790
So,

89
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,860
just wait.

90
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,259
I'll come for you.

91
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,389
I'll be there soon.

92
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,899
Wherever you may be at,

93
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,370
I'll always be standing behind you.

94
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,100
(Would you like to delete
this photo?)

95
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,740
(The post has been deleted.)

96
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,980
(Cha Eun Sang)

97
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,959
(The post has been deleted.)

98
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:13,560
(There are no more photos.)

99
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,899
(Cha Eun Sang)

100
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,990
I got you a good drink.

101
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,230
Drink it before I force you to.

102
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,799
Eun Sang used to buy me this
all the time too.

103
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,240
Eun Sang bought this for you?

104
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,610
You're an heir of a conglomerate.
How could you let her treat you?

105
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,679
I thought I'd have a chance
to pay it all back.

106
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,580
Don't you think fighting
on the streets as a rebellion...

107
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,220
is a little too cliche?

108
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,450
Your pretty face is all bruised up.

109
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,620
You're annoying. Just go and study.
Stop calling me up.

110
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,659
You have to do well on the finals
to retake the exam.

111
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm warning you.
Hospital food is gross.

112
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,830
You're too young to ruin
your health.

113
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:24,669
I don't plan on dying,
so stop nagging me.

114
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,240
If you can't take it anymore,
just bring her back.

115
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,169
Nothing may change,

116
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,480
but it'll at least make you
feel better.

117
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,909
Hello, ma'am.

118
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,149
Hello, ma'am.

119
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:27,730
I'm here to see Eun Sang,
but I guess she's not home.

120
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,529
Thank you.

121
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,029
You should eat with me.

122
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,440
Eun Sang went to Seoul...

123
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,679
to submit some documents to school.

124
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,330
Thank you.

125
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,379
Your food is delicious.

126
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,529
Were you Eun Sang's classmate?

127
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,399
Are you close to her?

128
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,120
I have a crush on Eun Sang.

129
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,730
I see that you've moved
to a beautiful town by the ocean.

130
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,370
And you met Tan there.

131
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,039
That wasn't on purpose.

132
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,809
This is why I wanted to send you
to the other side of the world.

133
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:58,919
When you broke the promise
you made with me and ran away,

134
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,549
I thought you got the message.

135
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,919
I trusted you and let you be.

136
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,220
But...

137
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,029
how could you just come to me
and tell me that you met Tan?

138
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,429
- Tan is...
- How dare you say his name?

139
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,929
kind,

140
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,169
honest,

141
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,769
and compassionate.

142
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,309
That is why...

143
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,110
I really liked him.

144
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,009
How can you say such a thing?

145
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,649
Because I'm not at fault
for catching feelings for him.

146
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,549
No, it is your fault
when you've been paid with my money,

147
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,190
benefitted from me,
and yet, grew feelings for him.

148
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:39,460
I will make sure to pay back
what you've paid on our behalf.

149
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,789
But since you paid our debt
without asking my family,

150
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,399
I will also diligently pay you back
in my own ways.

151
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,429
Are you saying...

152
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:53,100
that you'll date him again
once you pay me back?

153
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,639
How can you young kid
be so fearless?

154
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Because...

155
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,210
I like Tan.

156
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,620
I still like Tan.

157
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,919
Even if you keep scaring me,

158
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,690
and even if I'm terrified,

159
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,690
I can't lie to you that I no longer
have feelings for him.

160
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,230
However,

161
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,100
I won't see him since you told me
not to.

162
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,500
So, please,

163
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,840
stop summoning me like this.

00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,419
(Seoul to Wonju)

166
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:00,389
(Wonju)

167
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:06,329
We're going now!

168
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:15,789
Why were you looking for me?

169
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,390
Don't talk to me.

170
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Don't come to me.

171
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,369
Stop it.

172
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,539
Cha Eun Sang.

173
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,140
I can't get over you.

174
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
What do I do?

175
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:07,380
What did you just say?

176
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,950
I said, it's in your lowly blood.

177
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,920
How dare an Info Desk employee...

178
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,750
come up all the way
to the Chairman's Office?

179
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,559
Such lowly trait wouldn't go
anywhere.

180
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,589
How could you say such a thing?

181
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,160
Why not?

182
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,930
You and Tan both are too spoiled.

183
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,269
You're all living a life
that most people dream of,

184
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,240
yet you're all so greedy
to have everything you want.

185
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,710
You told me to come.

186
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,849
You were the one who told me
that I could come.

187
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,920
You told me
that your office was at the top!

188
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,019
That's why my life is a mess
right now.

189
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,359
The household has become
so lowly...

190
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:54,690
because I was enticed
by something cheap and shiny.

191
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,529
- Chairman Kim!
- Tell Tan.

192
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,329
When he doesn't know what to choose,

193
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,700
he must always choose
the most expensive thing.

194
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,470
The cheaper it is,
the more it shines.

195
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,309
Tell him to get himself together
so that he won't end up like me.

196
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,210
You're so cowardly.

197
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,049
Who am I to you?

198
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,119
I just told you.

199
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,220
Why ask again?

200
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,930
They're customized,
and under Yoo Rachel and Lee Esther.

201
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,930
I'd like to cancel the orders.
The wedding is off.

202
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,099
Choi Dong Wook and Choi Young Do's
orders as well, for the same reason.

203
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,509
I'll go and check first.
Please hold on.

204
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,809
The wedding is off,
and so is the engagement.

205
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,549
And I lost a sexy younger sister.
That's sad.

206
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,650
Don't worry.

207
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,549
I'll make it a little better for you
by staying sexy.

208
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,220
I really liked the younger sister
part of the deal.

209
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
Why don't we celebrate
this happy day with a meal?

210
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,289
I know a sexy sushi restaurant.

211
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:36,990
Don't try to seduce me, you kid.

212
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,759
You're not my sister now,
so who knows what I'll do?

213
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,200
I have somewhere to go.
Let's eat together next time.

214
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:45,369
Where?

215
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,539
(I promise to have janchi guksu
with Young Do. By Cha Eun Sang)

216
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,359
(Cha Eun Sang)

217
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,130
(Are you doing well, Young Do?)

218
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,829
Are you doing well, Young Do?

219
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,910
(Are you doing well, Young Do?)

220
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,289
Do you still not have a wish?

221
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,089
Will you grant it for me if I do?

222
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,289
Tell me. I'll make it happen.

223
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,900
You won't be able to.

224
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,799
Do you want to get married to me?

225
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,470
- You think it'd be that lame?
- You think marriage is lame?

226
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,140
You feel bad for going
on the blind date, don't you?

227
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,710
How come you're not asking anything
about her?

228
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:03,079
Her name, her age,
or how pretty she is.

229
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,720
It's not like I'm second to anyone
when it comes to those.

230
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:13,190
So you know.

231
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,599
I do wonder which family she's from.

232
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,500
If I were like Tan,

233
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,069
do you think things would've been
different between us?

234
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,809
What is Tan being like?

235
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,509
He's fierce. He fights anyone
he sees,

236
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,279
and he's broken into pieces.

237
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,809
He's a complete mess.

238
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,349
You couldn't do that.

239
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:44,119
Why not?

240
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:47,059
You dream of being
at the highest place in the world,

241
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,630
but Tan...

242
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,500
dreams of Eun Sang being his world.

243
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,970
I won't get in your way.

244
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,470
I'll grant your wish.

245
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,970
You can keep going up.

246
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,410
I'm getting there.

247
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,710
Just wait a little longer.

248
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,960
"Then,"

249
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:28,500
"our hands held each other's
as we walked through the crowd."

250
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,500
"The bones and the muscles..."

251
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,170
"that were desperately holding
onto each other."

252
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,309
"That's all I know about love."

253
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,509
"What other kind of love
could there be?"

254
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:57,130
"Other than being unable
to let each other's hands go."

255
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,329
Welcome.

256
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,740
Tan came here, didn't he?

257
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,750
He told me that he was going out
to see you.

258
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,720
As you can tell if you've seen him,
he's a complete mess right now.

259
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,619
Don't you think
that's because of you?

260
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,960
I think you're responsible for it.

261
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,990
What do you think?

262
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,029
Are you not going to go to school?

263
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,470
What about Tan? Don't you miss him?

264
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,609
Are you holding yourself back,
or have you forgotten him?

265
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,509
You have to answer
for me to keep talking.

266
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,519
I won't see him.
I promise that I won't.

267
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,359
I'll get over him.
I'm on it right now.

268
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,990
What is it that you want to say?

269
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,099
I don't have much time.

270
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:09,130
When do you want to go back
to where you belong?

271
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:14,500
- Sorry?
- It's my father's fault...

272
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,539
that you're here.
Tan and I know that well.

273
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,210
So, you can demand anything
that you'd like.

274
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,710
I'm just here to do
what I have to do.

275
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,880
What do you think?

276
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,720
If you can't make up your mind,

277
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,119
don't think too far.
Just think of tomorrow.

278
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,799
Your answer will change when you
focus on what you want tomorrow.

279
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,000
If you need a good excuse
to go back to Tan,

280
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,640
what about using
the finals as an excuse?

281
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,569
When you can't be courageous,

282
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:53,309
using a little excuse
can go a long way.

283
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,880
You said that you'd do
anything I tell you, right?

284
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,849
Yes. I'll go to the US.

285
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,220
When do you want me to leave?

286
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,789
The first thing I want from you...

287
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,730
is for you to do well
on your finals.

288
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,029
Go back to school.

289
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,269
Don't be the last one
in class again.

290
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,750
I think the girl wrote this.

291
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,319
I told her that those bottles
were mine,

292
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,960
but she put it there, so she must've
wanted me to give this to you.

293
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,960
I found it a few days ago,
and I thought about keeping it,

294
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,359
because why should I?

295
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,599
But if this can be a reason for you
to live on, then so be it.

296
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,230
You wanted me to save you.

297
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,609
Dear Tan,

298
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,279
two seasons have come and gone,

299
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,089
and the summer that we met seems
so far back.

300
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,990
It was too hot during the day,

301
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:53,500
and too cold at night.

302
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:56,700
And I liked you.

303
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:01,500
Will I be able to forget
how much we were in love?

304
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,509
Will I be able to forget...

305
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,079
how cold and hot
our love could be?

306
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,980
Will I ever be able to forget it?

307
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm sorry for running away
like this.

308
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm sorry for lying to you...

309
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,829
that I'll be waiting for you
at home.

310
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,130
You're the best part
of my life of misfortune, Tan.

311
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,630
I am going to disappear...

312
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,539
like a dream now.

313
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,309
I was so happy...

314
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,380
to have lived the dream with you,
Tan.

315
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,410
Hello, Tan.

316
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,349
Did you study a lot?

317
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:00,960
I didn't, so I'm quite worried.

318
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:03,329
Is that...

319
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,730
really you?

320
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,130
I wanted to ask you
when I saw you last time.

321
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,799
What happened to your face?

322
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,309
What have you possibly been up to?

323
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,880
You left.

324
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,279
But I'm back now.

325
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,650
I'm not going to run away anymore.

326
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,559
First, I'm going to take the finals.

327
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,930
And then, I'm going to make up
whatever excuses I need...

328
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,799
to stay...

329
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,569
here,

330
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:45,130
by your side.

331
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:14,430
Apparently, Eun Sang is back
at school.

332
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,829
What? I thought she quit school.

333
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:17,900
I thought so too.

334
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,160
Young Do...

335
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,970
Cha Eun Sang!

336
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,809
Look at you two, being lovey-dovey
here because I'm not here.

337
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:00,210
Did I interrupt you two kissing
or something?

338
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,680
- How could you just...
- Are you out of your mind?

339
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,950
The broadcasting club is a mess
because of you!

340
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,349
Come here, you.

341
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,289
What happened? Where were you?

342
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:13,090
You even changed your number!

343
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,989
You two really missed me,
didn't you?

344
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,090
You're funny. We'd have to find
a new producer to fill your seat,

345
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,230
but nobody is interested
in the broadcasting club.

346
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,230
That being said, don't you dare
go anywhere again, okay?

347
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,929
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
in advance.

348
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:28,269
I should've called your father too,
but I've been so busy.

349
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:30,769
Are you okay now?
Is everything sorted out now?

350
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,079
I'm not completely okay
and everything is still a mess,

351
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,980
but I just came. I missed you.

352
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,119
Whatever it is, tell us...

353
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,219
when you come and leave.

354
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,650
- Give me your new number.
- No! Give it to me first.

355
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,619
I'll save it and give it
to Chan Young.

356
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,789
Sure.

357
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,739
You'd better be good to me
if you want her number.

358
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:02,269
Yes, ma'am.

359
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:12,349
(Name: Lee Bo Na)

360
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,960
(Name: Yoo Rachel)

361
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,389
(Name: Choi Young Do)

362
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,159
(English Part 1)

363
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,769
Will you walk yourself
or should I drag you out?

364
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,300
Is something wrong?

365
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,369
I'm trying to understand
what being a loan shark feels like.

366
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,579
How nice would it be if you just
came and paid your debt?

367
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,579
You need someone to force you,
don't you?

368
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:52,650
Let's go and get guksu.

369
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Aren't you going to eat?

370
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,199
Sorry? I'm eating.

371
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:10,800
Why are you back at school?

372
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,099
- For finals.
- Come on.

373
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,369
Because I wanted to come back.

374
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,179
You're really taking that path?

375
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,079
I want to now.

376
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,929
Don't get hurt, trying to fight
the mighty Chairman Kim.

377
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,099
If you ever get exhausted
from the fight, just sit down.

378
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,099
That'll at least give me a chance
to say,

379
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,710
"I told you so."

380
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,139
I will.

381
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:54,639
Thanks for the guksu.

382
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,320
Bye. Let's not see each other
ever again.

383
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,690
I'm breaking up with you right now.

384
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,559
You and I...

385
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,130
can't even be friends?

386
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,860
I told you. I don't do that.

387
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,070
I fell in love with you
from the start,

388
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,840
and I'm still in love.

389
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,539
From now on,

390
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,139
you'll be my first love.

391
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,480
Let's not say hi
if we ever bump into each other.

392
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,690
Let's not ask each other
how we're doing.

393
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:40,090
Even when years pass by,

394
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,989
let's not act
like we know each other,

395
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,400
smile, and reminisce.

396
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,300
You can buy this for me.

397
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,639
Thank you.

398
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,789
Why are you out so late?
When are you coming?

399
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,400
I'm staying out tonight.
I'm sleeping over elsewhere.

400
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,429
See you tomorrow.

401
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,570
Seriously?

402
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,639
Who did you meet with?

403
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,880
A friend who doesn't want
to be friends with me.

404
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,349
Did you tell Bo Na
that you're with me right now?

405
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:15,920
Kind of.

406
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,550
You're being very good today.

407
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:19,190
I'm scared that you might leave.

408
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,489
I don't have anywhere to sleep.

409
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,730
That's my excuse right now.

410
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:29,500
Why don't you make
a small excuse too?

411
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:33,239
A small excuse on why
you're with me right now.

412
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,139
I like you.

413
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,280
That's your excuse?

414
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,610
I missed you.

415
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:45,920
Make a smaller excuse.

416
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,860
I thought I was going to die.

417
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,389
I told myself that I won't smile,

418
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,099
I won't live a good life,

419
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,230
and will become the most miserable person
in the world.

420
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:10,809
I wasn't going to love
anyone ever again,

421
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,710
and laugh at those
who believe in destiny.

422
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:18,480
That's what I told myself.

423
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:26,690
That's why you should never
abandon me again.

424
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,630
Understood?

425
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:05,230
How could you study all night?

426
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,659
It's weird to do anything else
during finals.

427
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,429
That's a stereotype.

428
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,429
I'm going to see how good you do
on the finals this time.

429
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,469
Do you think I'm just going to sleep
through the exams?

430
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:15,969
Don't be surprised if you do.

431
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,639
I feel bad for Myung Soo.

432
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,739
I'm always staying over
without paying rent.

433
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:25,050
You know, I've been
really frustrated lately...

434
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,519
for being a minor.

435
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:30,989
- What do you mean?
- A lot of things.

436
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:32,489
What's wrong with being a minor?

437
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:34,159
Because a heartbroken minor is...

438
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,260
only understood as a cranky kid
going through puberty.

439
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:39,699
There's no solution to that
except for us to grow up.

440
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:42,260
Don't you want to listen
to the second reason?

441
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,630
No.

442
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,769
Go and take the call.

443
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,940
- Yes, Mom?
- Where were you last night?

444
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,250
Stop making me worry like this.

445
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,550
I slept over at Myung Soo's.

446
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,280
You're up early.

447
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:00,920
What time are you coming back?

448
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,820
I might...

449
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,659
not be home.

450
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,760
I just thought I'd tell you.

451
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:14,260
All right.

452
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,130
Good luck on your exams.

453
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,469
Bye now.

454
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:42,260
What did you just say?

455
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:43,989
Let's break up.

456
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,360
Let's break up.

457
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,639
Are you drunk? It's midday.

458
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:58,969
I know I broke
Chief Director Jung's heart,

459
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,480
but my youth wasn't
all roses and butterflies, either.

460
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:04,449
I'm now going...

461
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,519
to go out and really take
a good look at the skies.

462
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,590
- Let's break up.
- I know that what I've said...

463
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:14,489
may have hurt you.

464
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,329
I get it.

465
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:19,900
But you think you can
just abandon Tan...

466
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,869
and break up? Just like this?

467
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,469
When I think about Tan's future,

468
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,670
I want to leave him
under Jeguk Group's roof.

469
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:31,469
But if Tan doesn't want that,

470
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,510
I'm going to let him be.

471
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,940
And who said that he can?

472
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,309
What right do you have
to let him be?

473
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,679
I know that I have no right to.

474
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,349
That's why I'm breaking up with you.

475
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:44,519
We're not tied legally,
nor do we have money between us.

476
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,420
Once I walk out of this house,
we're done.

477
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,159
Have a nice life, Chairman Kim.

478
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,630
Regardless of how we began,

479
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,610
I did love you.

480
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,820
We don't have
a single photo together.

481
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,719
I just realized that today.

482
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:20,960
I'll tell Tan.

483
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,289
He will understand.

484
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:24,659
Understand what?

485
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,659
Even I can't understand.

486
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,269
Secretary Jung.

487
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,070
I'll drop you off at the airport.

488
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,510
The airport?

489
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,010
Why am I heading to the airport?

490
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,610
What I want to do is to just walk
out of this house!

491
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,079
You may have come as you'd like,

492
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:47,519
but it doesn't work like that
when you're walking out.

493
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:49,789
Stay in the US.

494
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,420
Enjoy the American skies...

495
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,059
until you feel better,

496
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,989
and shop as much as you'd like.

497
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,329
I don't even speak English.
Why would I go to the US?

498
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:04,030
You're not even letting me
to break up with you as I'd like?

499
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,300
No need to call Tan.

500
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:08,670
He can't even take care of himself,

501
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,539
so don't mess with him
and just head to the airport.

502
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,179
I'm just saying, at least be
a good mother.

503
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,280
Secretary Jung, take her.

504
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:23,550
Chairman Kim!

505
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,690
Hey! Kim Nam Yoon!

506
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:38,369
Taxi!

507
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:42,039
Hop in!

508
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:45,269
Please drive quickly.

509
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,449
The number you are trying to reach
is unavailable right now...

510
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,260
Hello.

511
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,460
Aren't you Young Do?

512
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,000
Yes.

513
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,900
What brings you here?

514
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:15,699
I know it's late, but I'm sorry.

515
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:18,409
Young Do, have you seen Tan?

516
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,079
I'm in a rush right now,
so could you find him for me?

517
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,710
He won't pick up his calls.

518
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:26,250
Are you going somewhere?

519
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,449
I don't have much time.

520
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:30,050
I can't enter the school
because of Chief Director Jung.

521
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,289
Could you help me find Tan?

522
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:35,090
Get into my car first.

523
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,659
Stay right there, okay?

524
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,159
Hey!

525
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,130
Your mother is at school right now.

526
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:14,230
Go. Go right now!

527
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:27,980
- Tan!
- Mom!

528
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,309
Thanks, Young Do.

529
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:53,000
Have you seen Young Do?

530
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:00,840
Have you seen Young Do?

531
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,349
- You haven't seen my Young Do?
- Sorry, ma'am.

532
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,289
Have you seen Young Do?

533
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:12,389
Young Do?

534
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,760
I don't know.

535
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:21,699
Would you mind finding him
for me?

536
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,500
I'm sorry. I have to get going.

537
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:26,070
Sorry about that.

538
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:33,409
(Are you doing well, Young Do?)

539
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,320
(No.)

540
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,050
Are you doing well, Young Do?

541
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,219
No.

542
00:49:57,469 --> 00:49:58,900
I think I've lived my life wrong.

543
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:02,769
We're at the parking lot
right by that building.

544
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:05,010
Yes.

545
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,480
Is someone coming?

546
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,880
Our car.

547
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,050
Did you really break up with Father?

548
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,150
Yes.

549
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,280
Even though we're breaking up,
nothing will change for you.

550
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,320
You'll always be my son and his son.

551
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,449
Is that all?

552
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,760
Then why are you being chased?

553
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,659
What's with the guards earlier?

554
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,260
Your father is trying to stop me.

555
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,329
But I don't love
your father anymore.

556
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:31,369
Your father seems to feel the same,
which is why we're breaking up.

557
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:32,699
Stop lying.

558
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:35,969
Does everyone get chased by guards
when they break up?

559
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:38,769
Does everyone run out of their homes
with nothing?

560
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,639
Does everyone get security guards
to chase their lovers?

561
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:45,679
What has Father done to you?

562
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:47,119
It's nothing like that.

563
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,489
Mom, get in first.

564
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:58,090
Go somewhere. We'll talk after.

565
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:05,500
Did you just get out of the house
without anywhere to go to?

566
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,940
I didn't expect things to turn out
this way.

567
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,409
Head to Young Do's hotel for now.
I'll call you.

568
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:16,280
Where are you going?

569
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,590
I met with Mom. Didn't I tell you?

570
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,130
She's your woman, so you need
to take care of her.

571
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,500
And yet, you've abandoned her.

572
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,369
What do you mean?

573
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:40,869
I'm just letting her get
some fresh air.

574
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,340
What's wrong with that?

575
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,940
That's what abandoning is.

576
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,139
I'm going to take care of her now.

577
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,980
I can only take so much
of your whining.

578
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,119
How are you going to do that?

579
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:55,920
By not seeing you again.

580
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,090
I'm going to move out.

581
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,760
I'm going to only live
as my mother's son from now on.

582
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,789
I don't need your permission.

583
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,130
Everything that made me happy
in life...

584
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,670
were all the things
that you never allowed.

585
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:14,599
Regardless,

586
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:17,170
thanks for birthing me.

587
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,690
You've gone this far
to put on a show,

588
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:33,559
and yet, your live-in girlfriend,
nor Won and Tan have shown up.

589
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:38,030
Seems like I'm the only one
by your side.

590
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,329
I guess so.

591
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:42,429
What are you going to do?

592
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:45,670
What am I going to do?
Make them come.

593
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,539
If they don't come today,
I'll make them come tomorrow.

594
00:52:49,539 --> 00:52:52,840
If they don't come tomorrow,
I'll make them come the day after.

595
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,840
I want you...

596
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:58,610
to take care of Tan's birthday.

597
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:01,219
Prepare it like you did for Won.

598
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,219
The entire world knows
that he's an illegitimate son,

599
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:06,389
but you want me to prepare
for his birthday like Won's?

600
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:09,619
I have to be equal
because the whole world knows.

601
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,429
Make it big and flashy.

602
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,400
Come in.

603
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:24,469
Have a seat.

604
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:30,010
You heard that Father is
hospitalized, right?

605
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:34,320
He is? Why?

606
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,519
Never mind if you don't know.

607
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:37,920
You don't need to go, so don't.

608
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,119
Don't ask me to go with you, either.

609
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:41,489
This is part of the deal too.

610
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,329
I'm worried that it's because of me.

611
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:45,690
It's not.

612
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,929
I hear...

613
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,769
- that your mother left the house.
- Yes.

614
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:53,230
Tell her that I'm leaving
the villa in Cheongdam-dong empty.

615
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:56,869
I'm part of the reason
why she chose to leave, anyway.

616
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,309
Won,

617
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:06,719
I really liked you.

618
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,989
Before Mom came,

619
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,619
you were the only person
I could rely on...

620
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,590
between Father and your mother.

621
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:18,789
I'm sorry...

622
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,030
that I relied on you
when you didn't ask for it.

623
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,769
I'm sorry for having said
all the terrible things I've said...

624
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,030
and all the horrible things
that I've done to you.

625
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,400
No need to apologize.
You're making me uncomfortable.

626
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:32,570
What are you going to do
about what Father is preparing?

627
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,980
The entire company is losing it,
trying to prepare for your birthday.

628
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,050
What do you mean?

629
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,519
It must be to tame you
if you don't know about it yet.

630
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,820
Father is getting
the secretary's office...

631
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,789
to call up all reporters
and big figures...

632
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:47,960
for your birthday party.

633
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,960
I thought I made myself clear.

634
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,800
It's at Hotel Zeus tonight.

635
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:56,360
You'll need to make a choice.

636
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:59,630
If you don't go,
you'll humiliate Father.

637
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,940
- But if you go...
- I must go.

638
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,469
I'll go. You should come too.

639
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,880
Get going now. I'm busy.

640
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:19,889
Happy birthday, by the way.

641
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:35,340
(Tan's birthday.)

642
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,269
Bo Na, kids are saying...

643
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,340
You mean, Tan's birthday party?

644
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,679
You already know?

645
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,179
I got a call straight
from Jeguk Group's secretary office.

646
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,849
Are you going?

647
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:49,250
I don't have much to do
now that the CSAT is over.

648
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,019
I'm going to crash the party
and make a scene.

649
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:53,150
Come on. Don't make a scene.

650
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,090
You know that I'm very sensitive
with things like that.

651
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,860
Are you going to be kissing
Rachel there too?

652
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:00,099
Are you dating her?

653
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,929
I'm really not for that.

654
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,829
I can't let Rachel take
another one of my people again.

655
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,199
Sounds like you had
a rough experience.

656
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,570
I wonder if Eun Sang will be going.
I'm going to call her.

657
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:13,139
You'd better not go to Tan's party.

658
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,110
I'm going to break your legs
if you do.

659
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,280
Is this really Yoon Chan Young?

660
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,980
Yes. He's so cool, isn't he?

661
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:28,460
We were ordered
to politely bring you.

662
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,460
By who?

663
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,949
You look dazzling.

664
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,449
It's good that you noticed.

665
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,449
This is me paying back
for the cab ride.

666
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:02,260
I still owe you.

667
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:03,489
You can pay back today.

668
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,059
We're going to have to be
very courageous today.

669
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:08,760
You can do that, right?

670
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,010
Let's go.

671
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,489
Please look here!

672
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,630
Please say something!

673
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,510
Are you nervous?

674
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,880
- Just a little.
- It might be a long night.

675
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,519
But even so,

676
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:03,889
we're moving forward.

677
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,929
(The Heirs)
