1
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,620
Where should we go next?

2
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,010
Than used to flirt with me
back in school.

3
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,840
Just accept his feelings,
what are you waiting for?

4
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,740
We just started flirting,
let's take it slow for now.

5
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,130
Nene, close your eyes.

6
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,460
Saranghae.

7
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,610
Now that I'm courting you again,
do I have a chance?

8
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,030
If you're not gonna tell the truth,
don't call it an explanation.

9
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,840
This song is meant
for someone special.

10
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,210
But I haven’t had the chance yet.

11
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,270
Today, may I ask for permission?

12
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,800
Excuse me.

13
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,750
Hello, Meya. Where are you?

14
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,190
Hello, this is from
Ramkhamhaeng Hospital 2.

15
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,800
Mom.

16
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,010
Are you okay, Mom?
Is anything hurting?

17
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm fine,
I just fainted from dizziness.

18
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,690
When the hospital called,
I was really worried.

19
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,030
I think I’ll be able to
go home tomorrow.

20
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,829
How about you?
How was the play at school?

21
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,230
I wanted you to watch it.

22
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,540
I'll send you the pictures.
Lots of parents who took them.

23
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,870
Next time,
I won’t miss it, I promise.

24
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,550
Let’s pinky promise.

25
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:10,950
The other hand?

26
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,690
Okay.

27
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,260
Are you tired?
Should I have him take you home?

28
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,560
No, I will stay here.

29
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,940
But she needs to rest, Mawin.

30
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,710
No, no, no, I'll stay here.

31
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,460
I can sleep right here.

32
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,950
Come here, scoot over.

33
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,340
Should I stay with you?

34
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,350
It's okay, you can go home.

35
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,570
Okay.

36
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,920
Then you stay here with your mom.

37
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,700
His clothes are in the car.
I’ll grab them for you.

38
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,110
I’ll come pick him up
tomorrow afternoon.

39
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,310
Thank you.

40
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,140
Goodbye.

41
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Goodbye.

42
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,220
Goodbye.

43
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,750
Goodbye.

44
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,930
So, how was it? Did you have fun?

45
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,410
- Yes, it was fun.
- What role did you play?

46
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,620
This place.

47
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,870
This place again?

48
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:17,990
Why?

49
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,500
Isn't it good?

50
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,140
It’s good.

51
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,900
If we're sure a restaurant is good,

52
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,990
why take a chance with
a different one?

53
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,750
Or do you want me
to keep switching?

54
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,450
Sure, that's fine.

55
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,150
That's true.

56
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,820
Good stuff, great flavors.

57
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,470
If it's tasty,

58
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,500
no need to change.

59
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,080
You go order first.

60
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,130
Do you know what I want to eat?

61
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,030
I need to use the restroom.

62
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,220
Hello.

63
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,250
I'll have one of these,
and one of these.

64
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,520
And two pineapple juices, please.

65
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,890
Hey, Pond!

66
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,600
- Hi, Toon.
- Are you here alone?

67
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,560
Who are you with?

68
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,190
Oh, I'm with Ek.

69
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,830
- Max.
- Oh.

70
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,200
He's Max.
So are you here alone or not?

71
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,250
Never mind, I won't ask.

72
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,570
This mall likes to keep
things a secret.

73
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,210
- Right.
- Huh?

74
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,090
You're being sneaky, Mr. Tiger.

75
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,270
Let's sit at that table
over there, Ek.

76
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,180
Max.

77
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,120
Let’s sit over there, Max.

78
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,230
Pond probably doesn’t want us
to see who he’s with.

79
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,470
Don't forget next week,
there's a meeting about the new product.

80
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,850
Oh, okay.

81
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,910
Let's go.

82
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,150
Let’s change restaurant.
See you at the car.

83
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,250
About the expenses…

84
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,480
It's fine, I have insurance.

85
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,920
Okay, let's go.
We can head back now.

86
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,150
Are you okay?

87
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,060
You’ve been silent since yesterday.

88
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,260
Grandpa, Grandma,
have you seen this picture?

89
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,620
- Let me see.
- Wow!

90
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,330
Do I look pretty?

91
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,720
Of course, Last time you were
a model in an ad.

92
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,160
Now you’re Snow White. Wow.

93
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,030
It's a shame
I couldn't see you on stage.

94
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,850
I missed seeing
your beautiful dress on stage.

95
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,990
A lot of people
complimented the dress.

96
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,720
Really?

97
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,090
Was the person wearing it pretty?

98
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,780
- Yes, she was pretty too.
- Wow.

99
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,170
Come here, give me a kiss.

100
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,130
Look at this picture.

101
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,540
- Wow, it’s amazing!
- There’s a picture of Mawin too.

102
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,940
And there’s a couple picture too.

103
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,060
Couple picture? Let me see.

104
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,480
What’s on your mind, Than?

105
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,320
I don’t know if what I’m about
to do is wrong, Dad.

106
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,820
What’s going on, son?

107
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,590
If I want to start fresh
with someone,

108
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,450
but I don’t know if he's already
with someone else,

109
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,020
what should I do?

110
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,780
Is this about Uncle Kin?

111
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,980
Water, Uncle.

112
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,870
Thank you.

113
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,230
Can I stay another night, please?

114
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,280
Sure, but will you sleep
in your room or in mine?

115
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,700
In your room.

116
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,840
I’ll move my things to your room.

117
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,710
Thanks a lot for taking care of us
like we’re your own family.

118
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,890
No problem,
I don’t have anyone either.

119
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,180
My parents are far away.

120
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,750
Having Mawin around
really helps with the loneliness.

121
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,350
So no one is courting you?

122
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,970
People might think
Mawin is your child,

123
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,150
so they’re too shy to approach.

124
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,580
I’m still not sure

125
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,570
if I believe in needing
someone else in my life.

126
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,340
Why? Afraid of starting over?

127
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,640
Something like that, I guess.

128
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,900
Sometimes pain just reminds us

129
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,440
how to love better next time.

130
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,130
And what if...

131
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,520
what if it’s starting over
with the same person?

132
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:56,900
What’s wrong?

133
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,160
You've been quiet the whole way.

134
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,430
You barely ate dinner.

135
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,270
Wasn’t it good?

136
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,110
It was good.

137
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,460
I just feel like some of the dishes

138
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,390
weren’t right for me.

139
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,730
Are you upset because
we changed restaurant?

140
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,070
I just didn’t want to explain
everything to Too.

141
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,770
I understand.

142
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,330
Some people are meant to stay
where no one can see them.

143
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,210
I just didn’t think
I’d be one of those people.

144
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,440
Uncle Than.

145
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,860
What are you doing?

146
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,740
Grandpa and Grandma
asked you to eat dinner.

147
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,670
I’m looking at old pictures.

148
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:07,850
Here.

149
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,550
This is me when he was born.

150
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,270
This is Dad Sun.

151
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,130
How is it? Cute, right?

152
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,850
Here, this is Nene.

153
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,120
This is me in high school.

154
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,690
Did you know
Mawin's dad since school?

155
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,150
Yes, I did.

156
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,430
This is Uncle Kin in university.

157
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,090
He's two or three years older
than me.

158
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,880
Why are there so many
couple pictures?

159
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,920
Were you dating?

160
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,530
Such a tease!

161
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,500
Wait, this is the photographer
who took my pictures?

162
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,730
Yeah, you're right.

163
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,290
Pond still looks the same, huh?

164
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,020
Wow, Dad Sun looks so cool!

165
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,070
Between Dad and Pond,
who’s the better photographer?

166
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,070
Dad Sun for sure.

167
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,040
Let me see.

168
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,390
Look, I told you to
bring him to eat.

169
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,170
Both of you disappeared!

170
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,080
Hurry up!

171
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,550
Grandpa’s waiting. Go eat!

172
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,590
I’ll follow you soon.

173
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,390
Are you hungry?

174
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,270
Go, run to Grandpa!

175
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,340
Excuse me.

176
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,950
You’re not staying for dinner?

177
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,240
It’s okay,
I have some work to clear up.

178
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,590
Your mom still needs to rest,
don’t be too naughty, okay?

179
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:06,910
Okay.

180
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,960
I’ll head out now.
Call me if you need anything.

181
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,510
Thanks a lot.

182
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,220
Take care of yourself too.

183
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,950
And if Mawin and I are keeping you
stuck in the past,

184
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
we're ready to move out.

185
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,710
Let’s go, we should eat.

186
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,440
Then we can shower.

187
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,590
Can you read me
a story tonight, Mom?

188
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,980
Of course! How many stories
do you want me to tell?

189
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,920
- Two.
- Two? Really?

190
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,460
How about just one?

191
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,600
Okay.

192
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,830
Nene, eat more, sweetie.

193
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,520
Look at the picture with Mawin.
He’s way taller!

194
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,090
Aren’t you the same age?

195
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,410
Were they born in the same year?

196
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,600
Yes, they're in the same grade.

197
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,840
I think Mawin was born
just a few months later.

198
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,650
Really?

199
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,120
Being small is cute.

200
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,140
A girl should be delicate, huh?

201
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,560
Grandma.

202
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,170
Whether big or small, girl or boy,

203
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,820
she needs to eat and stay strong.
She's still growing.

204
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,360
Eat a lot, dear.

205
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,470
Mawin's dad is tall, too.

206
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,130
Your dad is tall, too.

207
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,120
Tomorrow is the 5th year
your dad passed away.

208
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,820
Let’s wake up early and offer alms.

209
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,050
Okay, that way Dad Sun
will be happy up there.

210
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,050
I’ve already prepared it.

211
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,350
Than, what about Akin?

212
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,310
Are you going for it
or backing off?

213
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,820
Are you going to date him?

214
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,350
I support it!

215
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,950
What about Mawin's mom?
Is she still around?

216
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,280
Should I investigate for you?

217
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,790
If you love someone,
you have to be sure first

218
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,369
that no one is waiting
for him at home.

219
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,140
Love isn’t wrong.

220
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,140
It’s wrong if you love
the wrong person,

221
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,830
at the wrong time,
or against moral standards.

222
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,030
Like when I met your Mom,
she already had a boyfriend.

223
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,140
- Really?
- Yep.

224
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,990
But I didn’t think of stealing her
or doing anything to break them up.

225
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,220
So what did you do?

226
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,180
I stayed in the role of a friend.

227
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,430
A well-meaning person.

228
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,100
I believe that true love starts by
not trying to steal someone away.

229
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,030
It should begin when they’re free,

230
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,060
and you’re there beside them.

231
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,420
If you want your love to last,

232
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,670
the beginning must be pure.

233
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,560
And do you love Grandpa?

234
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,730
I do.

235
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,320
So why did you choose him?

236
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,040
I'm handsome.

237
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,670
Very handsome.

238
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,970
Yes.

239
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,210
The reason I love him.

240
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,870
is because he didn’t try
to be the perfect man,

241
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,000
but he tried to stay by my side

242
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,850
through every day
that wasn’t perfect.

243
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,310
He didn’t rush to win my heart,

244
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,620
but waited for the day I was ready.

245
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,160
And he always stayed there.

246
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,490
Thank you.

247
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,010
Than.

248
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,850
Don’t let your feelings lead you

249
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,060
to hurt someone else’s family
without realizing it, okay?

250
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,510
Yes, Dad.

251
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,810
Wow, that was so insightful.

252
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,520
Do you know what it is?

253
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,000
- You're quiet.
- Do you know?

254
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,110
- Do you know?
- She does. She knows.

255
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,360
- Eat a lot so you can grow big.
- Still not finished.

256
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,860
When you take a picture with Mawin,
you have to be taller than him.

257
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,810
- Yes, Nene.
- No, I won't accept that.

258
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,030
It's never locked.

259
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,300
Why lock the door today?

260
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,380
Just wanted to try it

261
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,100
to see how it feels

262
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,920
if I have to shower alone.

263
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,300
Some people are meant to stay
where no one can see them.

264
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,830
I just don’t think
I’m one of those people.

265
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,420
Ready for the meeting?

266
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,600
Today, we have
Indy and Pond online.

267
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,970
For the clients, we have Mr.Don,
Mind, and the marketing team.

268
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,920
Let’s go ahead and get started.

269
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,230
The others will join
as they log in.

270
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,020
- Okay.
- Alright.

271
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,800
AJ, let’s not have any problems
like last time, okay?

272
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,080
I’ve checked.
The issue was the internet.

273
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,380
This time, it’s all good.

274
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,750
Oh, what’s that sound?

275
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,810
Oh, sorry. I forgot to mute my mic.

276
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,840
When the mics are close,
it makes that sound.

277
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,530
Oh, sorry. That was mine.

278
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,970
Oh, okay.

279
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,780
Hello, Mr.Don.

280
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,500
Is everyone ready?

281
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,770
We’re still waiting for Pond.
I’ll call him to get online.

282
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,970
Please wait a moment.

283
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,970
Pond is the only one missing.
I’m calling him now.

284
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,700
Yes?

285
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,240
Okay, if everyone’s ready,
let’s start the meeting.

286
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,890
Pond, did you get
the reference I sent?

287
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,060
Is there anything
you’d like to add?

288
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,120
Just follow that, please.

289
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:21,880
Okay.

290
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,580
Mr.Don, when would you like to
schedule the first round of review?

291
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,920
Here comes the sound again.

292
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,360
Who hasn’t muted their mic?

293
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,070
I’ve muted mine.

294
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,320
Why is the sound still here?

295
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,530
Sorry about that.

296
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,560
It’s probably because my mic
and Don’s are too close.

297
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,110
Okay...

298
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,210
Before the end of the month.

299
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,180
Let’s end the meeting for today.

300
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,100
Thank you, everyone.

301
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,860
Goodbye.

302
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,010
Goodbye.

303
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,860
How did Pond get
into Mr.Don’s room?

304
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,060
Pond might have just gone
to a meeting at his office.

305
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,750
But that’s not an office.

306
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,580
It’s like a room in a condo.

307
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,840
Or maybe Pond went to
fix something for him.

308
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,020
Fix what? Air conditioner?

309
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,100
No, I saw the other day...

310
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,090
AJ, don’t gossip about clients.

311
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,680
Didn’t you learn that from him?
Don’t you remember?

312
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,160
But honestly, Fai,
I want to know about this too.

313
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,060
Bro.

314
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,570
Never mind, if it’s something
we shouldn’t know,

315
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,350
let’s not try to find out.

316
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,900
If they’re not uncomfortable
keeping it a secret,

317
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,370
we shouldn’t feel uncomfortable
pretending we don’t know anything.

318
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,050
Have you ever heard?
A secret never hurts anyone,

319
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,260
except the person
who has to keep it.

320
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,660
What makes it tiring is not
keeping it a secret,

321
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,100
but pretending that
it doesn’t exist.

322
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,610
It sounds easy to understand.

323
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,950
But I don’t get it at all.

324
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,990
Bro, do you understand?

325
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,900
Why did you do that?

326
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,250
I don’t want to hide anymore.

327
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,700
We agreed on this, didn’t we?
I thought we talked about it.

328
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,440
If people know about us,

329
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,610
it won’t be good for you.
It won’t look professional.

330
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,320
And they might think

331
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,390
that I like your work
and had you take photos for me

332
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,060
it’s not because of your skill
but something personal.

333
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,950
And they could think
all sorts of things.

334
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,770
Who would think that?

335
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,690
If you mean Beyond Perfect,

336
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,160
they saw my work, they trust me.

337
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,100
They won’t question
why I got this or that job.

338
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,150
Because I’m a skilled photographer.

339
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,980
And I’m confident that
every job you choose me for,

340
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,850
it’s because I’m good,
and I’m good enough.

341
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:40,250
And I believe that
you’re professional enough

342
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,960
not to choose me because
of our personal relationship.

343
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,330
Or maybe you’re still not sure

344
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,480
if you really want me in your life.

345
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,460
I’m just not ready.

346
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,060
Not ready to accept it
or not ready to reveal it

347
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,180
that actually you and I
might not really be suited.

348
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,040
- But..
- It’s okay.

349
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,870
I understand.

350
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,130
But I can't stay in the shadows,

351
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,310
in your secret

352
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,030
any longer.

353
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,920
Mawin, can I ask you something?

354
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,090
Sure, what do you want to ask?

355
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,390
But you have to promise me first
that you won’t tell anyone.

356
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,670
Okay, what is it?

357
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,380
Where is Mawin’s mom?

358
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,870
Why haven’t I seen her?

359
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,040
My mom has a coffee shop
far from here.

360
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,760
Far from the condo.

361
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,390
On weekends,
I go visit her at the cafe.

362
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,090
She makes delicious pastries.
She makes them herself.

363
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,440
I’ll bring some to you next time.

364
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,800
Hmm, but why...

365
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:16,400
Why don’t your parents live together?

366
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,300
Your parents don’t
live together either.

367
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,700
I only see Uncle Than,
Grandpa, and Grandma.

368
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,220
Where are your parents?

369
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,170
My parents? Oh...

370
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,620
My dad is in heaven, far away.

371
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,930
But he passed away
before I was born.

372
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,870
Oh...

373
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,070
Where did your parents meet?

374
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,610
I don’t know either.

375
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,590
Maybe at the cafe.

376
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,970
But...

377
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,460
Your dad knew Uncle Than when
he was still in his school uniform.

378
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,300
And so?

379
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,050
It means he came before your mom.

380
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,770
What’s wrong with that?

381
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,120
I want Uncle Than
to date Uncle Kin.

382
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,430
I want that too, sure.

383
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:18,410
But your dad already has your mom.
He can’t have another one.

384
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,940
Did you forget?

385
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,670
Just let him have two partners.

386
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,050
No, he can only have one. No, no!

387
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,180
- Yes, yes, yes.
- No, no, no!

388
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,590
What are you two talking about?

389
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,440
Why are you doing that
zipper-mouth gesture?

390
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,660
Oh, I see, you’re playing
the “forbidden word” game?

391
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,500
Can I play too? Please?
Let me join.

392
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,180
Let’s go, we should head back.

393
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,980
Do you have homework today?

394
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,070
Yes, I do.

395
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,550
- Dad.
- Yes?

396
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,950
I want to know if it’s okay
to have more than one partner.

397
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,530
Is that your homework, Mawin?
Why are you asking that?

398
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,640
Nene said a person
can only have one partner.

399
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,830
But I think it’s okay
to have more than one.

400
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,140
Why are you two talking about this?
Or is it...

401
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,250
Oh, it's just a curious age.
You know, kids being kids.

402
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,240
Right?

403
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,990
Let's go. Time to head home.

404
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,630
You can finish your homework,
and after that, we’ll go swimming.

405
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,150
Who wants to go swimming?

406
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,150
Raise your hands.

407
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,960
You want to go? Okay, let's go!

408
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,890
- Let’s go. Time to head back.
- You're all messy now.

409
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,150
Be careful on the stairs.

410
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,540
Nene, what did you tell him?

411
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,300
Troublemaker.

412
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,670
Hey, what’s up with you?
You used to be strong,

413
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,240
now you're like a sad dog.

414
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,100
I don’t know if it hurts

415
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,070
because I’m hidden

416
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,780
or does it hurt because
I allowed myself to be hidden?

417
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,400
What kind of love needs
to be hidden like this?

418
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,020
Damn, how can you and him
still call it love?

419
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,380
Thanks for making me realize that
I’m just a shadow of the relationship.

420
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,380
I’m not the real one.

421
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,000
(The world thinks we’re not
right for each other.)

422
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,090
(If we date someone different,
what if the world thinks we’re not suited?)

423
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,760
(What should we do if the world thinks
we’re not right for each other?)

424
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,840
(Just go our separate ways because
we deal with what others think.)

425
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,800
(The world always makes people
who are suited for us.

426
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,070
(If you still love them,
don’t let go.)

427
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,100
(Differences aren’t a problem
if you’re sure about your feelings.)

428
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,670
(You don’t love him,
you love yourself.)

429
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,570
(If you loved him enough,
this question wouldn’t even exist.)

430
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,400
(It’s a pity,
shouldn’t you try to fix things?)

431
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
(If both of you are uncomfortable,
just separate easily.)

432
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,630
(Is it the world or you
who says you’re not suited?)

433
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,270
(Put your ego down.)

434
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,630
I think you’ve had enough.

435
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,699
Even if you drink,
you still won’t forget about him.

436
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,260
You’ll just forget what
you’re supposed to do next.

437
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,920
Or is it my fault?

438
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,870
Is it my fault for being this way?

439
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,660
Are you okay?

440
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,520
Why did you drink so much?

441
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,070
You’re here in this bar?

442
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,340
It’s not really fitting for you.

443
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,480
But maybe it’s safer

444
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,710
because no one will see you.

445
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,000
People around here

446
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,350
are just like me.

447
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,270
I’m sorry.

448
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,600
Maybe I didn’t care enough
about you.

449
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,810
But it’s not that
I don’t feel anything.

450
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,890
I understand.

451
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,170
But look at your situation and mine.

452
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,560
Even from Mars, anyone would know
that we’re not suited for each other.

453
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,030
The hidden corners you’ve given me

454
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,730
have now become
where I can’t breathe.

455
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,110
Let’s go talk in the room.

456
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,210
In the room?

457
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,200
I guess I only matter to you
when I’m in the room.

458
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,060
There’s also a room behind the bar.

459
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,450
Do you want to try?
Change the mood a bit.

460
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,850
I assure you no one will know.

461
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,020
You’ve drunk too much.

462
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,790
If you feel something for me,

463
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,590
you wouldn’t have to hide me.

464
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,440
I’m tired of being hidden.

465
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,370
You should go.

466
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,690
I’ve left the keycard here.

467
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,900
You can come whenever you want.

468
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,840
But please come.

469
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,240
The person who’s right
for you isn’t me.

470
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,310
I think you need to change.

471
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,870
If you don’t want to be
just a shadow,

472
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,410
you’ll have to be brave enough
to make him stand by you openly.

473
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,210
The light in my room went out.

474
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,170
Yes, it's really hot too.

475
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,900
But my room doesn't go out.

476
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,540
It should’ve gone out
for the whole floor.

477
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,920
I called the building management.

478
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,250
They said it’s probably
the electrical box in my room.

479
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,930
They’ll send someone
to check tomorrow.

480
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,850
Uncle Than and I wanted to ask you

481
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,130
to let us stay the night here.

482
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:25,840
Yes.

483
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,590
We can sleep on the couch

484
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,430
because we can sleep anywhere.

485
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,570
Go.

486
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,660
Nene and I can sleep here.

487
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,060
Comfortable, right, Nene?

488
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,710
- Yes.
- It’s fine.

489
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,850
I’ll have Mawin sleep in my room.

490
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,090
You sleep here,
Nene will sleep in his room.

491
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,010
The bed is small,
you probably can’t sleep.

492
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,340
Hello, Uncle.

493
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,870
Hello, Nene.

494
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,020
Nene and I will stay here
for the night.

495
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,150
Yes, the power’s out in our room
and it’s really hot.

496
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:17,940
Sure.

497
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,990
You go grab you things
and sleep in my room.

498
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:22,640
Okay.

499
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,810
Nene, put the pillow and blanket
in the room.

500
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,740
Then help Mawin with his things.

501
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,010
Let's go.

502
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,230
I've never seen your mom stay here.

503
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,650
My mom? She’s only been here twice.

504
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,450
Sometimes she comes to drop by,
sometimes just to visit.

505
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,430
But she’s never stayed the night.

506
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:07,670
And your dad has ever stayed
at your mom’s house?

507
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,420
Never. My dad only drops by
and then leaves.

508
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,110
Nene, why do you ask?

509
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,100
Uncle Than asked me…

510
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,540
Uh… I just said it casually.

511
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,560
Have you ever met your mom?

512
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,460
We’re talking on the phone.

513
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,020
And also via video call.

514
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,630
She said she would come visit too.

515
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,100
But I don’t know when she’ll come.

516
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,510
There aren’t any family photos
in your room.

517
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,400
Why?

518
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,670
Usually, there’d be pictures of
parents and children on the wall

519
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,590
or on a table, something like that.

520
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,010
I meant to ask last time
I stayed here.

521
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,320
There you go.

522
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,230
I’m going to sleep now.

523
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,150
Thank you, Uncle.

524
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,150
- Good night.
- Yes, good night.

525
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,240
Good night, Uncle.

526
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,790
Good night, Nene.

527
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,630
I’ll sleep first.

528
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,330
Good night.

529
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:36,990
Kin.

530
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,490
- Hello, Mr. Don.
- Hello.

531
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,630
Hello.

532
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,150
Please, come in.

533
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,770
Shall we get started?

534
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,890
Yes.

535
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,410
Mind will explain the details
of the new product.

536
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,240
One moment, please.

537
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,000
Oh, cosmetics?

538
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,040
Mind, this is the wrong file.

539
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,530
Ah, just a moment.

540
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:23,400
Let me help you.

541
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:26,590
Ah, this one.

542
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:28,270
Thank you.

543
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:33,780
Okay.

544
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,110
The product is a mattress.

545
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,520
- It has innovation from Japan.
- From Japan.

546
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,340
The company has been
established for 459 years.

547
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,230
- 459 years, wow.
- Yes.

548
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,900
It helps improve sleep efficiency

549
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,930
especially for people who exercise.

550
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,430
It’s suitable for those
who like to work out.

551
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,470
It should help with
weight distribution, right?

552
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,820
- Yes, it’s good.
- Maybe we could target runners.

553
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,870
- Okay, I’ll look into that.
- Yes.

554
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,140
Okay, we accept the brief.

555
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,870
And Beyond Perfect needs
no more than a week.

556
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,380
The product’s character is
quite clear.

557
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,330
I think we can do
a lot of fun stuff.

558
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,260
For the still photography,
we’ll use Pond as usual.

559
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,490
I don’t mind.

560
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,110
But if he’s taking this job,

561
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,860
he should attend the meeting.

562
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,370
He’s probably busy.

563
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,570
I called this morning,
and he didn’t pick up either.

564
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,560
- Right.
- Yes.

565
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,430
Might be good to have
another photographer as backup.

566
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,640
I’m not attached to
any particular person.

567
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,590
As long as the work
comes out perfect, I’m fine.

568
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,990
Got it.

569
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,820
- I’ll look for a backup.
- I’ll check on photographers too.

570
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,700
Sure, bro.

571
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,920
Sorry for being late.

572
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,940
My alarm didn’t go off.

573
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,090
We've already finished.

574
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,940
You definitely won’t pass.

575
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:14,930
Thank you.

576
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,550
- I'll see you off.
- You go, Fai.

577
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,170
I'll see him off.

578
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,880
So embarrassing.

579
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,820
Don’t be late again.

580
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,610
- Don’t do this again.
- Yeah.

581
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,530
How can I get over breakup
in one day.

582
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,530
You can’t fix the past in a day,

583
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,210
but you can download
a dating app in a minute.

584
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,500
How can I get over a breakup fast?

585
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,960
Move on, dress up, go outside,
find someone who sees you.

586
00:47:59,170 --> 00:47:59,890
Ouch.

587
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:01,990
Stressful.

588
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,370
Good thing the first branch is
still making revenue.

589
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,990
Otherwise, it’d be even more stressful.

590
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,880
Oh, right, bro.

591
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,300
Bro.

592
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,980
Is it possible

593
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,050
that a husband and wife

594
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,550
have never stayed overnight
in the same condo?

595
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,250
Or never stayed overnight
at each other’s house?

596
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,330
Are they living completely separately?

597
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,380
Just raising the child together?

598
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,710
Yeah, like couples who are divorced.

599
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,840
Kin and Mawin's mom
might be divorced.

600
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,830
But they’re still doing
their roles as parents.

601
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,160
Could be possible.

602
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,290
Mawin’s mom has never stayed
overnight at his condo even once.

603
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:58,100
He has never stayed
at her house either.

604
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,580
I think I heard him
alking on the phone…

605
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,290
It does sound a bit strange.

606
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,050
Strange how, bro?

607
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:13,460
Don’t worry.
He is like my kid anyway.

608
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,470
I’ll send you the clip
from the shoot later.

609
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,380
Have you been waiting long?

610
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:47,960
Half an hour.

611
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:51,900
You should’ve said “not long.”

612
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,020
No need to be that blunt
with everyone.

613
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,050
This guy might not
handle it like I do.

614
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:03,910
Shall we order?

615
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,740
I’ll have the burrata
with cherry tomatoes, please.

616
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,290
And for the main course,
grilled sea bass with asparagus purée.

617
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,120
I’ll have this one.

618
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,330
For the main, lobster risotto.

619
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,720
But no onions,
and no olive oil, please.

620
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,550
And could the chef use a stock
without any animal products?

621
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,120
Plant-based, please.

622
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,510
And for the cheese,
switch to organic Parmesan.

623
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,550
Wow, that’s a lot of requests.

624
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,830
The chef should come out
and smack him.

625
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,080
But he seems perfect for you,
you’re just as picky.

626
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,980
A perfect match.

627
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,070
Sparkling water,
medium cold, no ice.

628
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,350
And absolutely no lemon, please.

629
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,220
Last time you gave me lemon in it.

630
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,850
Hmm, your glass isn’t suitable.

631
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,870
If he drinks that,
his throat will feel irritated.

632
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:19,360
If you’re dating him,
you’ll need a new fridge.

633
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:31,470
What kind of business do you do?

634
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,990
Oh, I…

635
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,840
Wait a moment, please.

636
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,470
I might not be someone
from your world

637
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,720
if you’re looking for
someone “suitable.”

638
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,990
All I have is simplicity
and sincerity.

639
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,410
And that might not be enough.

640
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:10,660
Never had a boyfriend?

641
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:12,070
Hmm.

642
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:17,220
- Maybe it’s your personality.
- Hey.

643
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:44,360
If your world is full of
perfection and suitability,

644
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,320
let me be a simple person
who loves you

645
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,780
and always has you in my world.

646
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,110
Is that okay?

647
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,390
Dad, Uncle Than and Nene.

648
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:03,910
The power’s out again?

649
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,630
No.

650
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,380
Uncle and I bought
some ice cream for you.

651
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,270
We just went out to eat.

652
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,290
We passed this shopม I remembered

653
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,740
you used to buy it
when we were still...

654
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,860
Thank you.

655
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,830
This one’s for you, Marwin.
I remember you like this flavor.

656
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,110
Thank you, Nene.

657
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:29,520
Thanks, Nene.

658
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,520
I don’t mean to interfere
between anyone, bro.

659
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:37,330
I just want to know...

660
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,050
- You and his mom...
- Marwin.

661
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,370
- You’re sleepy now, right?
- Yes.

662
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:46,310
We’ll talk about it later.

663
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,640
Say good night to
Uncle Than and Nene.

664
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,950
Good night, Nene.
Good night, Uncle.

665
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,170
Good night, Mawin.

666
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,560
Sweet dreams.

667
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,480
Nene said Uncle is going to
flirt with you.

668
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,180
So she asked me to help.
Do you like him, Dad?

669
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,600
You should go to sleep now.

670
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,740
Your mom will pick you up
tomorrow evening.

671
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,700
- Really?
- Really.

672
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:19,440
Let’s go, champ.

673
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,470
It’s okay. Let’s try again. Go.

674
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,120
Have you eaten yet?

675
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,350
I made spaghetti for you.
Come eat with me.

676
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,310
I’m starving.

677
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,490
What are you hungry for?

678
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,430
What’s there to eat?

679
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:18,480
Then come take a look yourself.

680
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,170
Switching from
photographer to model?

681
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:35,210
Don’t let “what if,” “but,” or “wait”

682
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,430
become obstacles in your life.

683
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,010
If the past makes you hesitate,

684
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,640
leave it behind.

685
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,700
Oh, are you going off to
war or something?

686
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,580
Are you ready?

687
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,140
If you’re ready, let’s do this.

688
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,710
One, two, three. Good.

689
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,630
I want you to meet someone.

690
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,130
Hello.

691
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,440
Let's start over
our relationship again, Kin.
