1
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,120
Put your left hand on your head.

2
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,680
- Like this?
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,930
- Now raise your right hand.
- Like this?

4
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,820
- Okay.
- Is it alright?

5
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,760
Stay still.

6
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,129
Not sure if you’ll remember

7
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,010
that small, special moment

8
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,360
when the whole world
stopped spinning.

9
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,789
Just the two of us.

10
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,970
Don’t move yet.

11
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,830
Hurry up, my leg is going numb.

12
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,289
Don’t rush, give me a second.

13
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,070
What’s this? Why throw it?

14
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,900
Then why suddenly smile?

15
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,080
I told you to stay still.
Your composition changed.

16
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,080
If you want to be a model,
endure it.

17
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,620
Otherwise, I’ll find someone else.

18
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,900
I told you to stay still.

19
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,890
Don’t move.

20
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,050
I’m not moving.

21
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,350
I’m still as can be.

22
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,720
Still, I said. Do you not get it?

23
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,720
Are you teasing me?

24
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,540
Teasing? No way.

25
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,070
You’re the one not listening.

26
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,860
I said stay still.

27
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,130
No fidgeting, don’t move.

28
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,840
Do you not understand?

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,970
Hmm?

30
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,560
You’re teasing me.

31
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,810
If you don’t want me to move,
stop your hand.

32
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,500
Or if not, you move instead.

33
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,920
Move? What do you mean?

34
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,070
Hmm?

35
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,680
You started it.

36
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,150
Take responsibility.

37
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,180
Take responsibility how?

38
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,180
Don’t leave it hanging.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,910
Finish it.

40
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,260
Like this?

41
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,659
You...

42
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,280
Kin.

43
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,180
Is it good?

44
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,260
Yes.

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,030
Thank you.

46
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,310
Do you know why you can’t move?

47
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,360
Kin.

48
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,900
Why did you leave me like that?

49
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,180
Do you know how I have felt?

50
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,930
I wanted it to stay that way too.

51
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,340
Hi, Pond. This is Mr. Donlaphat.

52
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,020
- He is a client...
- A very important client

53
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,810
of Beyond Perfect
House of Perfection.

54
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,740
I have a photo shoot to fix,
I want you to take it.

55
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,770
What do you say, Pond?

56
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,900
Cash only, no checks.

57
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,920
What a coincidence,
our rooms are right across.

58
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

59
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,630
Uncle.

60
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,060
Uncle, wake up.

61
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,290
Uncle.

62
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,240
Uncle.

63
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,550
Go take a shower now.

64
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,480
Hello.

65
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,950
- Hello.
- Hi, Nene.

66
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

67
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,120
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

68
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,590
Mawin.

69
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,790
Are you looking for someone?

70
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,400
Mawin is here early today.

71
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,820
He’s been here since dawn.
His dad brought him.

72
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,789
- It’s already quite early.
- Yes?

73
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,710
Oh.

74
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,120
By the way,
did Mawin’s dad leave already?

75
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,570
He dropped him off
and left right away.

76
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,030
Yes.

77
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,940
Wake up, wake up!

78
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,400
Why is it so slow?
Why is it so lazy?

79
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,970
Oh, we are Beyond Perfect!

80
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,860
We need to have high energy!

81
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,300
- Because we are...
- House of Perfection.

82
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,820
The energy still isn’t here, right?

83
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,790
Alright, if the energy
isn’t here, then...

84
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,760
Everyone, we need to
get up and paddle!

85
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,960
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

86
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,390
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

87
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,780
Paddle and meet the log.
Paddle and meet the log.

88
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,580
- Who worked overnight?
- Get up and paddle!

89
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,810
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

90
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,950
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

91
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,230
Paddle and meet the sulking person.

92
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,670
Who wants to sleep?
Get up and paddle!

93
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,780
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

94
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,120
Paddle, paddle,
still water runs deep.

95
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,220
Paddle and hit the bridge.
Paddle and hit the bridge.

96
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,840
Who wants to work?
Get up and paddle! Yay!

97
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,190
Oh!

98
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,940
- Energy’s here. Let’s go!
- It’s here. Let’s start work.

99
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,150
Let’s talk about work now.

100
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,360
And let’s also pick the restaurant
for tonight, I’ll treat you all.

101
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,960
Wow, awesome!

102
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,250
Book the same table by the stage.
He'll treat as usual.

103
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,630
- Got it.
- Got it.

104
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,590
Alright, if you're ready,

105
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,920
Just update me on some work stuff.

106
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,490
Sure.

107
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,410
Akin, how’s the coffee going?

108
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,410
Still on track. I expect to finish
within this week.

109
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,540
Great, that’s good. And...

110
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,700
Mr. Prasert, the campaign
for the EV cars we’re handling?

111
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,980
Oh yes, I’ve handled that already.

112
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,220
I showed him our showreel.
He was stunned!

113
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,610
We’re definitely getting the job.

114
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
Excellent, Indy.
But I have one request.

115
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,570
For new clients, if there’s something
special, make sure they get it.

116
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,410
- Got it, I’ll take care of it.
- Okay.

117
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,630
Anyone else need to
update anything?

118
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,750
- No, all good.
- All good.

119
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,940
- Oh, wait. AJ.
- Yes?

120
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,500
When does the internship end?

121
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,720
According to the schedule,
five more months.

122
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,700
I want to who which month?

123
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,320
End of March.

124
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,900
End of March? Hmm...

125
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,530
And after that,
do you want to work here?

126
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,350
It depends on your kindness.

127
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,060
I’m just kind of perfect.

128
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,840
Well, we’ll talk about it later.

129
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,260
Anyway, thank yo.

130
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,100
I understand that
you're dedicated to our company.

131
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,990
So, I have something special
to give you.

132
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,240
Is it a bonus?

133
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,710
Better than that! I want you to
take care of your health.

134
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,880
Because people like us
get high pay,

135
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,390
but we work hard and party hard,

136
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,000
and get little rest.
That’s not perfect.

137
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,820
I’ve decided to set a KPI for whom
taking good care of their health.

138
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,600
And there’ll be a special bonus
every 3 months.

139
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,310
How will you evaluate?

140
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,460
By attendance or sick leave or...

141
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,850
Oh, I’m not that harsh, Akin.

142
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,620
Our building just opened
a fitness center.

143
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,710
And I want everyone to work out.

144
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,110
You can go before or after work.

145
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,310
You can work out there.

146
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,230
The trainer will send me
monthly evaluations.

147
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,450
And anyone who meets
the criteria will get a bonus.

148
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,150
That’s it.

149
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,100
Okay, that’s still good.
Better than nothing.

150
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,590
Yeah, and if anyone has
questions about the evaluation...

151
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,960
This person will answer
all our questions.

152
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,950
Who?

153
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,660
The release cue is perfect!

154
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,820
This is Nut.

155
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,920
The owner of the gym
in our building.

156
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,770
He will explain everything.
Please welcome!

157
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,950
- Hello.
- Hello.

158
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,860
Hello, I’m Nut.

159
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,170
Glad to take care of you
and make you perfect.

160
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,570
Perfect!

161
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,360
Perfect, of course, perfect.

162
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,590
- Like this, coach?
- Yes, that’s right.

163
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,050
Where should I tense up?

164
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,460
- The stomach.
- Stomach, yes.

165
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,460
- Keep it tense.
- One.

166
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,300
- Can you do it?
- I can.

167
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,490
Two.

168
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,510
- Whoa, AJ.
- Yes?

169
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,110
- This isn’t how you do it.
- Oh.

170
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
AJ, you need to face forward first.

171
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,850
Now, hold here.

172
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,190
Or you can hold here.

173
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,430
Then slowly push up.

174
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,710
Breathe out while pushing.

175
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,680
And when you lower it, breathe in.

176
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,650
Breathe in. That’s it.

177
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,590
Nine.

178
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,630
Got it. Here we go.

179
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,360
I’m about to puke! Ten.
Done, coach.

180
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,010
Can I take a break? A whole hour?

181
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,740
An hour? One minute?

182
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,820
Three, four.
Feel your shoulders more.

183
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,130
Slowly lower, breathe in,
breathe out, push.

184
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,090
You okay?

185
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,530
- Anything I can help with?
- Nut?

186
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,500
Whoa, hey!

187
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,620
You could barely sit earlier!

188
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,530
- Alright, ten reps!
- Huh?

189
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,780
Hah, let’s try!

190
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,280
One, two, three...

191
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,850
Whoa, fit like this,
you’ll have a six-pack in no time!

192
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,990
- See how fast I run?
- Yes.

193
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,390
Are you too slow?

194
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,080
Here, here, I’ll show you.
It’s like this, Fai.

195
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,970
Go faster.
Run as I push. Fai!

196
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,490
Run faster, Fai!
Faster, run, faster!

197
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,280
Faster, Fai, faster!

198
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,830
Don’t play like that,
it could be dangerous.

199
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,390
Sorry, I was just playing around.

200
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,290
And, if we want more speed,
we press on the right.

201
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,830
But if you need an incline,
press on the left.

202
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,940
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Yes?

203
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,670
Showing off your body or something?

204
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,590
The first one,
I totally win this, don’t I?

205
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,920
Right?

206
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,170
Come here, come on!

207
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,270
Why do you bring me here?

208
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000
You need to exercise too,
to stay strong!

209
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,820
I’m strong already.

210
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,210
I just see you studying,
always sitting at the desk.

211
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,900
Come stretch a bit,
or you might get sick later.

212
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,910
Which machine should I use?

213
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,490
I’ll show you first.
The first move.

214
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,410
Pull it out,
then take a step forward.

215
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,740
Push your body to a 45-degree angle,
arms perpendicular, then push it out.

216
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,080
Breathe out when you push.

217
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,370
Alright, try it out.

218
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,510
Step your leg.

219
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,980
Is this really safe?

220
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,040
I’m a sports science kid,
trust me. Come on.

221
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
Alright, step your leg first.

222
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,180
Step out one step. That’s right.

223
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,849
One step is enough, step out.

224
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,630
Breathe out.

225
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,470
- Is it correct?
- Yes, and then breathe in.

226
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,010
Tighten your stomach too.

227
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,220
That’s it! Great.

228
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,660
Okay.

229
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,420
You okay?

230
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,700
Can we do cardio in
the room after this?

231
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,610
Let’s take a break,
then do another set.

232
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,850
Another set?

233
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,030
Are you following me everywhere?
Is this too much?

234
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,890
Who said I’m following you?
This is my turf.

235
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,130
I’m a co-owner of
the gym here with Nut.

236
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,030
It’s who came to my place today.

237
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,340
You missed me, didn’t you?

238
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,310
You’re staring at me like that,
I’m blushing now.

239
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,310
It’s been a while
since you stared at me.

240
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,490
Do you think
I’m the same as before?

241
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,510
- I think I’m more toned.
- Stuck on the past, huh?

242
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,070
Why are you blushing?

243
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,500
You’ve done more before,
haven’t you?

244
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,420
More?

245
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,570
What do you mean by “more”?

246
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,710
Well...

247
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,480
I don’t really remember.

248
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,830
Hey!

249
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,610
You’ve done more before,
haven’t you?

250
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,330
Why are you waiting here?

251
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,570
You're going to catch a cold.

252
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,590
Have all our fans left already?

253
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,730
What fans? They're just friends,
cheering for me.

254
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,780
- So you forgot about me?
- I didn’t forget.

255
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,590
Accepting gifts and taking pictures.
That’s why I was late.

256
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,990
Some are in the clubroom already.
I can pick it up later.

257
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,550
You’ve been waiting for a while?

258
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,530
Can I say sorry?

259
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,140
What if you can’t?

260
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,320
Come on, I’m sorry!
I won’t be late next time.

261
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,430
Here, I brought you a gold medal.

262
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,550
I didn’t want a medal.

263
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,740
But I wanted to give it to you.

264
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,500
Every shot I made,
I thought of you, I swear.

265
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,060
So, you want to shoot in my face?

266
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,960
- Huh?
- No, no!

267
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,370
It’s just that seeing
your face gives me strength.

268
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,370
I was just teasing you.
Seeing you gives me motivation.

269
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,030
Now, I got this gold medal.

270
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,410
Don’t you think
I deserve a prize too?

271
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,330
Your fans already gave you a lot.
What else do you want?

272
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,790
But I want it from you.
Please give me a reward.

273
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,240
- Please?
- What do you want?

274
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,590
Hmm... I want a kiss.

275
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,410
One more, just a little more.

276
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,900
That's enough.

277
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,800
Thank you for cheering me on.

278
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,340
I want you to come cheer for me
every time I compete.

279
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,330
Hmm.

280
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,360
Hmm? Answer me.

281
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,100
I saie "hmm."

282
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,720
What does it mean?
Answer properly.

283
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,320
Yes.

284
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,780
What?

285
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,080
Yes.

286
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,520
I love you. Do you love me?

287
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,730
I do.

288
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,450
Do you love me a lot?

289
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,410
Again. Answer properly.
Do you love me a lot?

290
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,340
Yes.

291
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:03,140
I love you so much that I don’t
think I can love anyone else.

292
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,470
- Really?
- Hmm.

293
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,320
"Hmm" again?

294
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,580
You know, right?

295
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,950
What’s going to happen?

296
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,560
I’m heading out now.

297
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,040
See you, bro.

298
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,300
- See you.
- Bye.

299
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,420
Thanks, bro.

300
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,790
You're in a surprisingly
good mood today.

301
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,000
Lately, it's been nothing
but good things.

302
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,220
What kind of things?

303
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,060
Oh, first love is hard to forget.

304
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,470
How do you know that?

305
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,240
It just feels familiar.

306
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,750
But you've never met
Kin before, right?

307
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,660
You’ve shown me pictures.
Almost all the pictures you have.

308
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,100
The way you act when you see him,
I'm sure, this is the one.

309
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,300
4th-year student in
communication arts

310
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,610
left a 1st-year
science sports student

311
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,650
without a care or any reason.

312
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,510
Are you reminding yourself
or trying to rub it in my face?

313
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,840
You know how much it hurt.
This time, it might hurt even more.

314
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,000
Is this supposed to
be encouragement?

315
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,840
What do you think I should do?

316
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,950
Now that we've met again,
it can't end like before.

317
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,860
I won’t let him slip away again.

318
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,290
Alright, let's go with that.

319
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,820
But if you mess up and
he doesn’t want you back...

320
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,130
I’ll wait for my turn.

321
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,180
Bro.

322
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,390
I’m serious.

323
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,110
Being brothers is better anyway.

324
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,100
What? Water drops on a rock every day,
does the rock never erode?

325
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,690
Where there’s effort,
there’s effort.

326
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,130
- Here you go, Akin.
- Thank you, Fai.

327
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,930
Thank you.

328
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,900
Everyone, Mr. Don has arrived.

329
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,830
Oh, great! So cool.

330
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,820
- Because we are Beyond...
- Perfect.

331
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
House of Perfection.

332
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,990
Same floor.

333
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,680
Oh, you’re the important client.

334
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,470
Don, my name’s Donlaphat.

335
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:47,520
Sorry for not introducing myself,
Mr. Photographer.

336
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,980
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Important Client.

337
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,090
How was the juice shoot
the other day?

338
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,570
I approved it yesterday.

339
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,320
I hope our future collaborations

340
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,360
will go smoothly.

341
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,390
Did you spill perfume
this morning?

342
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,840
The scent was so overpowering.

343
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:32,380
We’re not close enough for you
to comment on my personal stuff.

344
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,720
I’m just trying to help.

345
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,540
Also, that kind of scent is usually
worn by old men, or sugar daddies.

346
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,140
Trust me, throw it out
when you get home.

347
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,180
Thanks for the detailed critique.

348
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,510
Detailed?

349
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:55,130
Your critique was so thorough,
down to the tiniest details.

350
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,460
You're welcome.
Appreciate it very much.

351
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,310
But I think…

352
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,770
- We’re not close enough for…
- Come on.

353
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,860
Don’t drag it out, just accept
differences of opinion.

354
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,590
Learn to lose.

355
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,690
Everything’s ready?
don’t make mistakes.

356
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,330
- Wow! Oh my.
- Hello, your outfit looks great.

357
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,370
- Hello, Mr. Don.
- Hello.

358
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,870
Please, follow me to
the meeting room.

359
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,880
- Please sit.
- Okay.

360
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,720
Not opening the file?
Want me to stare at a blank screen?

361
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:08,480
Oh, sorry. One moment please.

362
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,400
Is it the file you
sent to me yesterday?

363
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,240
I can open it from
my computer instead.

364
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,120
Thanks.

365
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,630
Here it is. Shall we start?

366
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,860
This is the client’s first
project with us.

367
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,620
And I want to impress him.

368
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,690
The product is ice cream,
and he has high expectations.

369
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,530
I’ve reviewed
the marketing team’s research.

370
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:40,470
I can say this product
will shake up the market.

371
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,690
Yes.

372
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,010
Pass on the details and timeline

373
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,610
along with the client’s information
to Beyond Perfect.

374
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,870
Please take care of it.

375
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,020
Gladly.

376
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,010
For the photographer,
we’ll use Pond as usual.

377
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,820
If he’s available, I don’t mind.

378
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,640
If the client likes my work,

379
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,870
I don’t mind either.

380
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,390
Great.

381
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,310
You can trust us.
The results will be high quality.

382
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,070
- Because we are Beyond...
- Perfect.

383
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,330
House of Perfection.

384
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,470
- Okay, let’s continue.
- Signature pose.

385
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,550
Let’s continue.

386
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,490
Tonight there’s a small party to
celebrate the completed project.

387
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,690
You should join us.
Almost everyone’s going.

388
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,600
And today is also Singles’ Day.

389
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,020
But we have
a meeting tomorrow morning.

390
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,460
Oh, that’s fine, Not late.

391
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,960
Just a little sip.

392
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,090
Pond, come with us.
We’re all here anyway.

393
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,560
But I wasn’t involved
in the previous project.

394
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,060
Oh, it’s fine. Come along,
let’s celebrate Singles’ Day.

395
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,800
11.11, you know.

396
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,850
Good, I have no client
appointments tonight, right?

397
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,850
None.

398
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,740
Okay, then I’ll go.

399
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:18,590
Great.

400
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,120
Good.

401
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,150
Sounds fun.

402
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,380
Then I’ll join you.

403
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,090
Great. Fai, send the location
to Pond and Mr. Don too.

404
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,140
Okay. Are you coming with us?

405
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,440
Uh, I’ll pass.

406
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,600
I need to take care of some work.

407
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,710
I also have some work to clear.
Excuse me.

408
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,600
Oh, no, Akin, come with us.

409
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,380
Just a quick drink,
then you can get back to work.

410
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,090
Today Mawin’s going to
his mom’s home.

411
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,250
Alright, but not too late, okay?

412
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:58,710
Okay.

413
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,610
- Okay.
- Let’s go together.

414
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:14,159
Singles’ Day 11.11 is
working well, huh?

415
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,000
Looks like there are
a lot of singles around here.

416
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:21,880
At least there are two of us here.

417
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,380
I’m not single.

418
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,130
Just that my relationship
status isn’t clear yet.

419
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,400
Mmmm.

420
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,370
How about we invite
our trainer to chill tonight?

421
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,530
Sure, there’s a new place
opening around here. Let’s go!

422
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,590
Alright.

423
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,980
Please go inside.
This place is our regular spot.

424
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,270
It’s our regular spot.

425
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,740
Where’s AJ?

426
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,710
After finishing or getting a new one,
We always come here.

427
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,650
Let’s go quickly!

428
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,940
Okay, everyone, enjoy tonight!
The host is ready to pay.

429
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,680
Awesome.

430
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,190
Wait, are we all ordering
the same thing?

431
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,710
Yeah, go for it, little brother.

432
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,970
Hey, guys.

433
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,090
- Big order, alright?
- Okay.

434
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,840
- Order food too, okay?
- Guys!

435
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:28,930
- Fai.
- Yes?

436
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,250
- Take care of Mr. Don.
- Of course.

437
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,940
- Pond, go all out.
- Okay.

438
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,780
Yes, brother.

439
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,580
What would you like to drink?

440
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,790
- I’ll have wine, please.
- Let me check on that for you.

441
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,820
- Sorry, do you have any wine?
- No, sorry.

442
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,360
It’s okay, thank you.

443
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,210
Sorry, they don’t have wine
at the moment.

444
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,060
Would you like me to send
someone to buy it outside?

445
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,100
No, it’s fine.
I’ll have it on the rocks instead.

446
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,140
On the rocks, please.

447
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,850
Sorry, do you have round ice cubes?

448
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:59,840
No, sorry.

449
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,160
Should we change the place?
You might break out in a rash.

450
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,940
This place is not very high-end,
no wine, no round ice cubes.

451
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,620
It's fine, I'm relaxed about it.

452
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,110
- Thank you for caring.
- I wasn't really caring.

453
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,270
It just seems like
you are in the wrong place.

454
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,280
- Oh, here we go!
- Here it comes!

455
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,130
Give Mr. Don first.

456
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,500
- Give him first.
- Here you go.

457
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,640
- Please go ahead.
- Go ahead.

458
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,550
Here we are!

459
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,960
For the Singapore project
that just finished,

460
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,720
congratulations on
the new project from Mr. Don.

461
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,410
- Eh?
- What?

462
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:50,240
- And for the Singles’ Day.
- What does it have to do with this?

463
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,810
Single?

464
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,430
Refreshing after a long day's work.

465
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,920
Excuse me, I need to
step out for a minute.

466
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,770
- Step out?
- Step out for what?

467
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,720
He needs to pee.

468
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,430
- Go, go!
- Alright, I’ll head out too.

469
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,460
Oh, Kin.

470
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,210
- Don't leave yet.
- Don’t be drunk. We have a meeting.

471
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,370
- What the hell?
- Kin.

472
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,960
- Goodbye. Mr. Dol, goodbye.
- Are you serious?

473
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,270
- I’m leaving now.
- Kin.

474
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,470
- Are you serious?
- I’m leaving now. Goodbye!

475
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,900
Go home safely.

476
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,720
Going home early, huh?

477
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,290
Tomorrow’s Saturday.
What meeting are we having?

478
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,510
If it's not convenient,
we can postpone.

479
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,980
It’s fine.
Everything is the same as usual.

480
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,940
Work hard, play harder.

481
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,200
And if they are not ready
for the meeting,

482
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,300
it will affect their evaluation.

483
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,720
Me?

484
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,180
Oh, I’m safe.

485
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,790
- Let’s go!
- Cheers!

486
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,530
Mr. Don, would you like
anything else?

487
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
It’s fine,
I’ll just go to the restroom.

488
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,970
- Do you want my help?
- No, it’s fine.

489
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,930
No need. Trust me.

490
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,950
- No need to.
- No need to. He can walk.

491
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,900
The customer’s going
to the restroom.

492
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:58,260
Are you drunk, our important guest?

493
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,100
Excuse me.

494
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,050
Excuse me...

495
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,990
Is this enough?

496
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,820
Move.

497
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,500
I moved. Just a bit.

498
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,380
Here you go.

499
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,100
Sorry.

500
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,750
Give me a kiss.

501
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,220
Are we continuing?

502
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,640
Harder.

503
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,280
So, where’s Pond?
He's already found a girl for sure.

504
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,720
One single gone already tonight.

505
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,540
Yeah, he’s off the market.

506
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,380
Wait, where did Mr. Don go?

507
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,730
I think he probably
go home already.

508
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,160
Gone with the wind.

509
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,800
He’s scared of getting too drunk
and ruining his image.

510
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:24,010
Let him be. Our client’s grown-up,
let him take care of himself.

511
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,940
Hey, how can you just let him go?
He's the client!

512
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,060
- Fine, boss.
- Where is he now?

513
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,520
- Mr. Don, right?
- Where’s the glass?

514
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,130
- Let’s go.
- One more..

515
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,230
AJ, cheers!

516
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,980
- Cheers, bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

517
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,450
For Singles’ Day,

518
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,100
I’m single. Are you single too?

519
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,640
I’m not. My boyfriend’s possessive.
He’s coming to pick me up.

520
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,480
Hey, don’t ask about this one.

521
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,720
Single but won’t admit it.

522
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,580
Hey, that’s called
“single with hope.”

523
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,530
Come on, another glass.

524
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,340
- Coming right up.
- Let’s go.

525
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,420
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

526
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,470
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

527
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,810
- Here we go!
- Let’s go!

528
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,990
Here you go, fill it up.

529
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,350
- Hey, enough. Let’s go home.
- Another one?

530
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,210
The gym’s open as usual tomorrow.

531
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,540
That’s enough. Let’s go.

532
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,810
Waiter, check please.

533
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,060
Sure thing.

534
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:28,150
Hey, you okay?

535
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,000
I’m fine, no problem.

536
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,580
Are you sure?

537
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,920
Hey, I think you’re not okay.
Let me take you home.

538
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,990
Hey, I’m fine, really.

539
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,730
Are you afraid he won’t make it
to your room?

540
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,980
No, no, don’t say that.
This is my older brother.

541
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,710
My good older brother.

542
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:58,600
Same status. Never leveled up.

543
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:02,860
Let’s go.

544
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,110
People live with hope, Nat.

545
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,800
I’m off.

546
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:13,900
Hey, hey.

547
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,560
A little move, boss.

548
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,520
Boss, boss.

549
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,050
Why isn’t it opening?

550
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,400
Hey, it’s not opening.

551
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,080
Hey!

552
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,730
Hey, hey!

553
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,140
Wrong room.
This isn't your room.

554
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,260
Water.

555
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,140
Don’t start with that joke.

556
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,630
Water, please.

557
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,210
Here, water.

558
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,420
Hey, you can’t throw up here.
Go to the bathroom.

559
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,830
Hey, wait.

560
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,960
I miss you.

561
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,950
I’ve missed you all along.

562
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,720
When you get your senses back,
go back to your room.

563
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,060
No.

564
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,930
I want to stay like this forever.

565
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,860
Stay in your arms like we used to.

566
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,050
Hug for a long time,
I don’t want to let go.

567
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,070
Than... Than.

568
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:25,510
You little thing.

569
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,730
Who says I’m little?
I’m not little.

570
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:31,380
I’m not sleeping.

571
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,040
What’s this?

572
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,150
I’m so tired.
Do you think I’ll pass the exam?

573
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,410
Just give it your best shot.
That’s all.

574
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:49,060
Soon, you won’t be able to hang out
with high school kid anymore.

575
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,930
You’ll be a senior,
and I’ll be freshmen.

576
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,680
Pass it first.

577
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:00,940
Gget up and drink some milk first.
Then you can study more, or sleep.

578
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,990
Let me rest my eyes for 5 minutes.

579
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,470
But don’t leave, stay here.

580
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:09,110
I’ll fall asleep.
Wake me up in 5 minutes.

581
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,380
Hmm.

582
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,040
Hmm again. That’s not cute at all.

583
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,070
You should say, “Yes, darling.”

584
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,350
Yes, darling.

585
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,610
Go ahead, close your eyes.
I’ll wake you up in 5 minutes.

586
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,600
Is this how it feels
to never change?

587
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:30,620
Let’s shower together.

588
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,420
I haven’t cleared things up yet.
Let’s find a chance to talk about it.

589
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,110
I think I’ve found a new kid
who’s perfect for this product.

590
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:38,940
Who is it?

591
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,940
Deal a kid named Nene
be the model for it.

592
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,680
Than said, if you want something,
you should talk to him directly.

593
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,390
I'm not sure, though.
When I’m drunk,

594
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,930
I might spill everything about
last night to anyone.

595
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,220
Is this blackmail?

596
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:55,240
Tell me when you stopped loving me
and started loving someone else?

597
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,720
Help me understand everything.
Right now, I’m completely confused.
