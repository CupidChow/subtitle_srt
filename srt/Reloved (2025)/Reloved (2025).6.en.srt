1
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,390
Bro, someone wants to see you.

2
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,710
Let's start over again, Kin.

3
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,380
Take it, he intentionally
bought it for you.

4
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,000
- Bro, let's eat.
- Oh.

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,050
Let's find something to eat.

6
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,780
- Let's eat.
- So starving.

7
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,970
I really don't know
what I made you sad.

8
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,250
I'm sorry no matter what it is.

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,340
Please give me a second chance

10
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,289
to show you that I have never
stopped loving you

11
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,630
since the day we met

12
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,850
until now.

13
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,900
I've never been with anyone else,
and I won't do it.

14
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,150
You can trust me.

15
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:52,590
No need to answer me.

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,140
Just take it.

17
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,520
Then I'll know that
you feel the same.

18
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,290
Let me be the one who's
try to win your heart again.

19
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,970
Kin.

20
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,680
I know you're not good at lying.

21
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,560
Are we still feeling the same, Kin?

22
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,460
Everything has changed.

23
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,820
Something in the past is
still lingering.

24
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,730
But now,

25
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,030
we must forget it and move on.

26
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,380
Can you really do that?

27
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,210
I'm always here for you.

28
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,300
Please answer me,
I'm waiting to hear it.

29
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,490
Almost noon, won't you go to work?

30
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,100
My day off.

31
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,580
Have work today?

32
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,540
I had.

33
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,510
It was just cancelled.

34
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,890
I'm free now.

35
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,460
Day off means to rest.

36
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,940
Let's go on a trip.

37
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,500
A trip?

38
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,630
Yes, a date.

39
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,700
Just give me a quick shower.

40
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,060
Have you had it?

41
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,960
No.

42
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,980
Let's have it together

43
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,170
Hey.

44
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,280
Everything including that
is off today.

45
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,400
I promise that I won't do it today.

46
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,400
Let's have a cute date
and spend time together.

47
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,760
What's that?

48
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,630
Can I really trust you?

49
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,090
- You said...
- No.

50
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,400
This is just a moring glory.

51
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,670
Let's have a shower.

52
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,000
Come on.

53
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,180
Valentine's Day
came so fast this year.

54
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,060
No, it didn't.

55
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,360
- Then why did he give you...
- Maybe...

56
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,090
He owns a flower shop?

57
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,350
I think this one is better.
You can eat it.

58
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,810
I don't think so.

59
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,130
Shut up, enough.

60
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,390
Let me ask him. Kin.

61
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,409
When did you date him?

62
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,550
Why didn't you tell us?

63
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,010
I heard he wanted to
win over your heart.

64
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,960
You're so fast, bro.

65
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,000
- AJ.
- AJ.

66
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:49,340
He tried to win over my heart
since the university time.

67
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,580
Now we meet again,

68
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,860
so he wants to do once more.

69
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,500
You should accept his love, Kin.
What are you waiting for?

70
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,550
He is so cute.

71
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,840
He has a good job and so kind.

72
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,230
Don't let him do it so many times.

73
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,700
Would it be okay?
Kin has his own family.

74
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,040
Is Than trying to have an affair,
and making Kin cheat on his wife?

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,670
Or you're single now, Kin?

76
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,550
Stop, enough.

77
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,390
Mind your own business.

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,850
You're bad, AJ. Such a nosy boy.

79
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,060
Eavesdropping is disgusting,
you know?

80
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,160
- That's bad.
- Yes.

81
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,840
Come on, let's eat something.

82
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,920
Yes, I've been starving
since I eavesdropped him.

83
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,890
I'm starving too.
Come on, let's go.

84
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,830
Okay.

85
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,130
Kin, come with us.

86
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,380
Give me a minute.

87
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,970
- Okay.
- Let's go.

88
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,400
- Let's go.
- We'll go then.

89
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,960
Mind your own business.

90
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,730
- You're nosy.
- That's not good at all.

91
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,710
Eavesdropping is a bad manner.

92
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,289
Let's pick Nene and Mawin up
together this evening.

93
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,740
Trying to win
my ex-boyfriend's heart.

94
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,260
I've been looking for you.

95
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,020
Don't act slick.

96
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,310
So what will you do
about the new product?

97
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,370
Find someone to do it.

98
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,830
What did the brand say?

99
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:46,820
Don.

100
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,210
And the timeline?

101
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,210
Okay.

102
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,400
That's fine.

103
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,420
You can change the model--

104
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,110
Pond, it's my work.

105
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,900
Day off.

106
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,440
Love each other.

107
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,600
But don't create a commitment.

108
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,160
And may love be like
the ever-changing ocean

109
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,100
between the souls of both of you.

110
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,840
Fill each other's cups.

111
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,150
But don't drink from the same one.

112
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,060
Give bread to each other.

113
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,540
But don't bite from the same piece.

114
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,370
By Khalil Gibran.

115
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,760
I've finished it for you.

116
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,100
How many boyfriends have you had?

117
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,690
Three?

118
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:48,690
Zero.

119
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,040
Never had one?

120
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,520
Yes.

121
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,800
Probably because of your behavior.

122
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,770
Hey.

123
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,890
I don't think
being single is a problem.

124
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,110
You?

125
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,380
Lend me your fingers.

126
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,040
Can I count you in?

127
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,550
Acting slick again.

128
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,090
For everyone, AJ.

129
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,660
One, two, three, four,

130
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,200
five, six, seven, eight.

131
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,270
You're giving all of us, bro?

132
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,110
They'll be fresh in the afternoon.
For energy boosting.

133
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,530
Oops, the cup with hearts.

134
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,640
Is it for Too?

135
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,580
I know whom it's for.

136
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,790
But a lot of hearts...

137
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,040
Won't Kin think that
you're a two-timer?

138
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,570
Yes, that's true. Remove them.

139
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,470
That's good.

140
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,920
Help me, AJ.

141
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,850
I will.

142
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,420
Fai.

143
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,330
- Yes?
- Please take care of the work.

144
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,240
Sure.

145
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,980
Let's keep going.

146
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,350
This is for you.

147
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,590
Comes with someone's heart.

148
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,940
AJ, where's the photo I asked for?

149
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,870
Will you pass the internship?

150
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,240
- My gosh.
- Will you?

151
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,750
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

152
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,050
Thank you, bro.

153
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,750
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

154
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,780
Mawin.

155
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,280
- Dad.
- Uncle.

156
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,350
Hello, Dad. Hello, Uncle.

157
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:03,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

158
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,850
Hello, Uncle. Hello, Uncle Kin.

159
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,970
Hi.

160
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,580
Look at this.

161
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,330
I have one too.

162
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,830
What is it?

163
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,450
They'll hold
a New Year party at school.

164
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,000
I was chosen to be the princess.

165
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,090
Wow.

166
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,700
I'll be Snow White.

167
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,010
Wow. And you, Mawin?

168
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,990
I'll be the prince.

169
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,980
But I have to find the costume.

170
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,890
Oh, where will we find them?

171
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,930
So do I, Dad.

172
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,550
My costume must be under
the same theme as Nene.

173
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,930
We'll play in the same story.

174
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,360
Okay, let's find out
where to buy it.

175
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,450
This royal guard will find them

176
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,640
for both of you, your higness.

177
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,720
Could you please
get in the pumpkin carriage?

178
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,860
I'll drive you home.

179
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,960
Wrong story.

180
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,530
Wrong?

181
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,990
This is Snow White.

182
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,570
Which one has
the pumpkin carriage then?

183
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,950
Cinderella.

184
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,530
I see.

185
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,800
Sorry. Okay, get in the car.

186
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,850
- Let's go.
- My princess.

187
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,160
Show me how to walk like a knight.

188
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,600
Snow White.

189
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,160
I've just start making a move.
Only this close is enough.

190
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,180
Close your eyes, Nene.

191
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,710
You too.

192
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,550
I'm not seeing anything.

193
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,810
Neither am I.

194
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,720
Anything else?

195
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,400
Let's see.

196
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,670
I'll have this one.

197
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,280
Are you a kid?

198
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,360
It's just a smile.

199
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,190
And this one.

200
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,280
These are perfect.

201
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,450
Let's go.

202
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,230
- Let me see some salad.
- Sure.

203
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,710
Both of them.

204
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,540
Can you eat all of them?

205
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,490
Come on, we can eat them.

206
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,420
How many? Two?

207
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,970
Make it four.

208
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,880
Ones with lots of fat.
These are very little.

209
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,810
I chose a mix of them.

210
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,900
Come on, let's go.

211
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,950
Go have a shower
and do your homework.

212
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,740
I have no homework today.

213
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
Neither do I.

214
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,080
That's good. Let's swim, okay?

215
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,690
Good, can I bring
the balls and swimming ring?

216
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,670
You can.

217
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,010
Let's swim together, Mawin.
I have some colorfull balls.

218
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,950
You had a running nose last night?

219
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,330
I'm fine now. My nose is okay.

220
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,810
I'm better now.

221
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,060
Let him exercise sometimes

222
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,860
so he won't get sick
easily like you.

223
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,230
I'll give you 15 mins
to get changed.

224
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,010
See you down
at the swimming pool, okay?

225
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,560
- Okay.
- Okay?

226
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,130
- Okay.
- Okay?

227
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,920
Come on, counting down. Let's go.

228
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,920
Let's go.

229
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,340
Come on, let's go.

230
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,850
You see?
Someone won't swim with us.

231
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,680
My dad can't swim.

232
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,800
I wanted to teach him,
but he refused.

233
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,590
You've ruined the reputation of
dating a sports science student.

234
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,510
You're just my ex.

235
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,850
No, we've never broken up.

236
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,050
And now I'm starting my move again.

237
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,300
Let's go.

238
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,550
Mawin.

239
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,410
Nene.

240
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,260
Mawin.

241
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,680
Kin.

242
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,490
What? Hey.

243
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,960
Are you okay?

244
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm fine.

245
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,680
Ouch! Easy.

246
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,690
I'll apply some ice to it.

247
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,020
Wait for me here, kids.

248
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,270
- Hold this for me, please.
- Sure.

249
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,940
I think you should
take your shirt off.

250
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,760
Help me then.

251
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,100
Thank you.

252
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,740
Ouch! Easy, Than.

253
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,190
Sorry.

254
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,140
Does it hurt here?

255
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,800
Yes.

256
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,020
Need my help?

257
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,060
No.

258
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,590
Have a seat.

259
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,550
I'll show you my skill.

260
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,940
Thank you.

261
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,330
You're multifunctional.

262
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,690
You are a good photographer,
a good masseuse,

263
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,370
and a good chef.

264
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,240
I'm so good on bed too.

265
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,450
This is a cute date, isn't it?

266
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,480
- You mentioned that again.
- My bad.

267
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,780
Has Mawin gone to bed?

268
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,110
Did the ice make you feel better?

269
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,330
It did.

270
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,530
Let me check if it's swollen.

271
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,530
No need to. I'm fine.

272
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,630
Ouch!

273
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,570
I don't think you're fine.

274
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,680
Sit on the sofa.

275
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,660
Come on.

276
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,270
Take off your shirt.

277
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,040
If you're shy, I'll close my eyes.

278
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,410
I'm not.

279
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,050
Ouch!

280
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,540
Easy.

281
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,160
Sorry, come on.

282
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,240
I'll apply the ointment.

283
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,690
Ouch! Easy, please.

284
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,640
You see? You're in pain
because of hard training.

285
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,820
The match is coming.

286
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,880
The entrance exam is coming too.

287
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,520
I know you love basketball
but this exam is also important.

288
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,600
I'm not afraid of the exam.

289
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,430
I have you with me.

290
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,000
I've read almost all of
your summary.

291
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,370
Have you thought about where
to study if you don't pass it?

292
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,640
I haven't. I'll pass it.

293
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,440
I will be your junior
in the faculty.

294
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,320
I'll be there waiting for you
every evening

295
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,080
to check if you date someone else.

296
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,400
You're the one who'll become
popular once you get in.

297
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,640
I don't care about them.

298
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,330
I'm going to hang a big sign
saying I have a boyfriend.

299
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,890
He's in the Faculty of Visual Arts.

300
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,530
His name is Akin.

301
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,260
Ouch!

302
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,880
Easy, please. Ouch!

303
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,200
Ouch!

304
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,040
Easy.

305
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,150
I'm doing it gently.

306
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,950
Are you trying to get my attention?

307
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,170
Enough. Go to your room.

308
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,450
A bit more.

309
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,360
It took too long.

310
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,720
Opportunist?

311
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,060
You caught me.

312
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,230
Get up.

313
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,150
Go to your room.

314
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,800
Kin.

315
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,740
Do I have a chance in
winning you over this time?

316
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,790
I don't know.

317
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,070
It's like still standing on
an old feeling

318
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,270
that has never been explained.

319
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,370
What do you mean?

320
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,130
I can explain all of them.

321
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,060
An explanation is a truth
we dare to tell.

322
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,280
An excuse is a distorted truth.

323
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,010
And a lie

324
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,840
has no truth from the start.

325
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,990
If you don't intend to
tell the truth,

326
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,750
don't call it an explanation.

327
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,320
The truth of what?

328
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,690
Well...

329
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,550
Oh.

330
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,060
Why haven't you gone to bed?

331
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,930
Why have you woken up?

332
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,940
I heard you talking,
so I came out to see.

333
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,120
Uncle Than brought me the ointment

334
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,640
He's about to leave now.

335
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,420
Thank you.

336
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,230
We can talk later.

337
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:30,990
Sure.

338
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,350
I have to go.
Please take good care of your dad.

339
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,760
Don't let him carry heavy things.

340
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,970
Got it.

341
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,530
- Have a good dream.
- You too.

342
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,800
Good night, Kin.

343
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,630
Mawin, let's go to bed.

344
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,880
You need to go to school early.

345
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,100
Let's go.

346
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,600
Can I own a steak restaurant
if I lose my job?

347
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,090
You tasted it.

348
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,380
You'll never lose it.

349
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,780
You're on an upward trend.

350
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,340
Has Beyound Perfect told you
about the new product?

351
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,710
They have.

352
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,870
I'm so full. Thank you.

353
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,490
There's one more.

354
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,750
The dessert must be followed.

355
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,910
Full course, isn't it?

356
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,970
By the way,
can I serve it on the sofa?

357
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,880
Tonight's dessert won't be served
on a plate.

358
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,930
Let me show you how to eat it.

359
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,860
Sweet bite.

360
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,610
I have an option for you.

361
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,410
My dessert is not very sweet.

362
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,480
If you want it sweeter,

363
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,780
I have a dipping sauce.

364
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,750
Where's my cute date?

365
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,820
Just a dessert

366
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,040
that isn't on a plate.

367
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,950
Isn't it cute?

368
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,590
You're so cunning.

369
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,520
Don't you like it?

370
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,140
Who's cunning now?

371
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,540
This is a product from
Krajood Maliwan

372
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,909
by Milwan Khongkua.

373
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,429
Is it Krajood from Cha-uat,
Nakhon Si Thammarat?

374
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,870
They've distributed
the work to the community

375
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,300
to make these beautiful
bags and baskets.

376
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,429
Beautiful.

377
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,600
Very chic.

378
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,800
- Yes.
- I like it.

379
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,929
The next one is made from
tie-dyed cotton fabric.

380
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,270
It was inspired by Nai Khanom Tom.

381
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:44,210
Various elements have been added
to make it look more modern.

382
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,030
- Very chic.
- Turn it around, AJ.

383
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,570
Show it to Too and Indy.

384
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,040
- Wow.
- Oh, Thai boxing.

385
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,670
Beautiful.

386
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,620
And the next one.

387
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,700
This is a bag from Prawpha.

388
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,070
It's a combination of Thai silk
and premium grade leather.

389
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,230
It looks beautiful and expensive
at the same time.

390
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,950
- Okay.
- Do you like it?

391
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,200
Well... I like it.

392
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,400
Which one the most?

393
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,650
I think this one is
perfect for you.

394
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,910
I like small bag. This one.

395
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,600
- That's big.
- Small?

396
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,320
Does it healed? Let me see.

397
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,690
It's been a week.
Doesn't hurt anymore.

398
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,090
I can use my arm now.

399
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,950
Sure? Okay, raise your left arm up.

400
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,890
Bend your arm and touch your head.

401
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,040
Yes. How does it feel? Hurt?

402
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:01,980
No.

403
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,640
Really?

404
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,610
Okay, don't move your left arm.
Now raise your right one.

405
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,330
Yes, bend it to touch your head.

406
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,770
So? Do you feel any tension?

407
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,050
I don't.

408
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,310
Okay, wait. I'll take a photo,
so you can see how it is.

409
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,970
Saranghaeyo!

410
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,220
Are you kidding me?

411
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,940
A little smile each day
brightens the spirit.

412
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,540
We have to get the costumes
for the kids this week.

413
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,270
You can go there with me.

414
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,970
Mawin.

415
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,800
Why do you bring us here?

416
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,390
Hey.

417
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,050
Grandma. Grandpa.

418
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,560
- Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad.
- Hi.

419
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,000
Is that Akin?

420
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,010
Yes. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad.

421
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,000
Hi, long time no see. How are you?

422
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,090
I'm good.

423
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,890
How are you?

424
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,830
- We're fine.
- We're good.

425
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,550
Oh, who is this young boy?

426
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,240
Mawin, greet them properly.

427
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,570
Hello, Grandpa. Hello, Grandma.

428
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,350
My name's Mawin.
I'm Dad Akin's son.

429
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,490
- Oh, Mawin.
- I see, Mawin.

430
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,270
Too cute for your own good.

431
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,910
Why is he too cute, Grandma?

432
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,770
Can't he be just cute?

433
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,720
We can't praise kids too much.

434
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,270
Ghosts would steal them.

435
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,730
Come on, let's have
a glass of water inside.

436
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,640
- Come on.
- Okay.

437
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,600
Why did you mention a glass?

438
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,390
Can't we use other containers?

439
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,110
You're such a curious girl.
Okay, I tell you now.

440
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,110
It is what old people like to say.

441
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,800
All of you wait here, okay?
We'll be back.

442
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,290
Just a while.

443
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,830
Is this home a nice place to live?

444
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,150
Yes, it has a garden.

445
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,180
If you live here,
you can play in there.

446
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,380
That's my photo when I was young.
Was I cute, Uncle Kin?

447
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,900
You were very cute.

448
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,660
How about me? Cute or not?

449
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,760
Tada.

450
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,550
- Wow.
- Wow.

451
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,510
Is that for me?

452
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,680
That's right.

453
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,890
So cool.

454
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,840
- Don't forget to thank them.
- Thank you.

455
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,760
Where did you find them, Grandma?

456
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:20,440
Your uncle told me to use my skill.

457
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,140
She sewed them herself.

458
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,720
It must be tough for you.

459
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,630
No, not at all.

460
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,530
When Than and Sun
had thier school parties,

461
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,670
I did it for them too.

462
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,050
I sewed this new prince costume
for you, Mawin.

463
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,670
Wow. Can I try it on, Grandma?

464
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,300
Sure, you can.

465
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,150
Do you want to try, Mawin.

466
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,330
If it doesn't fit you,
I'll have her fix it for you.

467
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,360
Okay, come on.

468
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,750
Come on, kids.

469
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,960
- Come here.
- Here.

470
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,500
Do you want to go out and see
the bougainvillaea we planted?

471
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,850
It's been growing
while we went seperate ways.

472
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,210
Now we meet again.

473
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,580
It will probably bloom soon.

474
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,330
It's been growing.

475
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,450
We've been changing a lot
since that day.

476
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,160
Not only us.

477
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,010
Many things
have changed since then.

478
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,030
Wow.

479
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,490
You're good looking, Mawin.
Just like your dad.

480
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,040
Is he good looking like me?

481
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,700
What are you talking about?

482
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,720
You're beautiful like
a princess, Nene.

483
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,910
Just like me when I was young.

484
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,790
- Yes.
- Do you agree?

485
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,270
Come on,
let's practice your script.

486
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,590
- Princess.
- Are you ready?

487
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,600
Once upon a time...

488
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,350
Wow, so beautiful.

489
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,890
There was a little princess
holding an apple.

490
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,840
Snow White.

491
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,750
Witch, I got you.

492
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:52,760
Please give a big hand
for Snow White.

493
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,290
Our performers are very cute.

494
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,900
Come to the front of the stage.

495
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,420
Snow White ends now.

496
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,710
Great job, Mawin.

497
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:09,120
- Great job, Nene and Mawin.
- Come to the front of the stage.

498
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,000
Let's take a photo together.

499
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,170
Come to the front
and stand in line.

500
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,850
Smile a lot, Mawin.

501
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,740
Please give a big hand for
all of our students here.

502
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,470
Please come and take
a photo with us.

503
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,120
Where are your parents?

504
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,100
Come on, Mawin.

505
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,450
Come on, Mawin.

506
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,020
Take a photo with me.

507
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,670
Great job, Mawin.

508
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,810
Both of you were so great.

509
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:47,990
You're good too, Nene.

510
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,770
Where is Mom?

511
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,180
She's probably stuck
in traffic around here.

512
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,210
Such a shame. I want her
to watch me on stage.

513
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,410
- Let's take a photo.
- Let's take a photo.

514
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,870
Come on, let's take a photo.

515
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,740
Let's take a break here
for a moment.

516
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,530
We have activity booths
all over the place outside.

517
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,630
Take your parents for a walk
and play at the booths together.

518
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,450
We'll meet here again later.
Let's go.

519
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,180
I want to play
the balloon popping game.

520
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:19,640
Me too.

521
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,580
Then let's go together, okay?

522
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,460
- Okay.
- Okay.

523
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:23,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

524
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,620
Can I play it?

525
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,870
You want to?

526
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:30,850
Fine.

527
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,940
How much?

528
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,470
100 baht. I'll scan it.

529
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,210
- You can take it.
- Thank you.

530
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,310
One, two...

531
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,600
Almost.

532
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,230
Mawin.

533
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:00,960
One, two...

534
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,330
What do you want this time?

535
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:10,990
That one.

536
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,720
- Yeah.
- You got it.

537
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,130
Do it again.

538
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,270
Here.

539
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:33,950
Tag me.

540
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,500
A bit right.

541
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,000
A little bit right.

542
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,310
Okay.

543
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,780
Watch and learn.

544
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:55,850
What do you want to eat?

545
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:57,870
I don't know. Let's see.

546
00:46:59,010 --> 00:46:59,840
What do you want to eat?

547
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,160
- I don't know yet.
- Really?

548
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,710
Oh, Mr. Don.

549
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,680
You like to shop in this mall too?

550
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,500
Yes, I'm here with my friend.

551
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,410
I'm here with my friend too.

552
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,870
Everyone comes here
with their friends.

553
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,260
Let's eat.

554
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

555
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,960
Dad, let's go to the stage.

556
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,050
Why?

557
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,520
Come on, we'll be late.

558
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,870
Where to?

559
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,020
- Come on.
- What?

560
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,330
The next one is another show
from a parent.

561
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,100
You've seen the magic show.
Let's change the mood now.

562
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,270
There's a beautiful song
waiting for us here.

563
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,460
Okay.

564
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:11,130
I wrote this song a long time ago.

565
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,100
I wanted to sing it to someone,

566
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,100
but I never had a chance.

567
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,110
Please allow me to sing it today.

568
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,870
We had to part,

569
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,390
without a reason clear,

570
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,610
And though I tried,
I couldn’t hold you near.

571
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:03,720
So many whys were left unsaid,

572
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:09,110
Just silence where
your words once led.

573
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:14,050
And meeting you again today,

574
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:18,210
I realize, though years have flown,

575
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:24,110
My heart’s still yours,
you’re still my own.

576
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:29,490
It’s been so long
since last we met,

577
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,660
Do we still feel the same way?

578
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,850
Just like the days
we used to share,

579
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,200
those memories linger everywhere.

580
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,850
Tell me, love, are you doing fine,

581
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,610
Let's start it over again, Kin.

582
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:51,180
Do your memories still softly call,

583
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:57,910
the way they whisper
through my walls?

584
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,040
Kin.

585
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,630
That song belongs to you and me.

586
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,570
Excuse me.

587
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,390
Hello, Meya. Where are you?

588
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,310
Hello, this is
Ramkhamhaeng 2 Hospital calling.

589
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,220
Pond? Are you alone?

590
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,760
If I want to start over
with someone,

591
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,890
but I don't know
if he's in relationship,

592
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,360
what should I do?

593
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,620
You're not ready to admit it,
or you're not ready to reveal it?

594
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,240
We're just not right
for each other.

595
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:08,830
You don't have any of
your family photos.

596
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,160
If you want a long love,

597
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,480
you must have a clean start.
