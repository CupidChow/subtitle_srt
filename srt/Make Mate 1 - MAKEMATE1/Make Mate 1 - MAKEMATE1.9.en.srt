This is the last stage for Groups A and B.

1284

Since it was the last stage before the finals,

1285
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:14,591
there had been mistakes and lingering regrets.

1286

But since there are those regrets,

Unfortunately, you lost the match.

1297

How do you feel, Mate A Group?

1298
01:00:05,724 --> 01:00:08,791
What I always tell my team is that

1299
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:11,224
if you gave the process your all

1300
01:00:11,224 --> 01:00:13,757
while preparing for the performance,

1301
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:16,124
no matter what the results are,

1302
01:00:16,124 --> 01:00:21,257
the biggest lesson you will get lies within.

1303
01:00:21,257 --> 01:00:25,657
I think there were no regrets about this stage,

1304
01:00:25,657 --> 01:00:28,691
so while it's sad that we lost, I'm satisfied.

1305
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,991
Just like what Joon Pyo said,

1306
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:35,257
I really enjoyed preparing for this performance

1307
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:39,124
and had fun today,

1308
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:41,191
so there are no regrets.

1309
01:00:41,191 --> 01:00:44,124
While it's sad to have lost,

1310
01:00:44,124 --> 01:00:46,657
my mind doesn't feel heavy.

1311
01:00:47,224 --> 01:00:48,624
That's what I think.

1312
01:00:48,624 --> 01:00:54,324
The viewers would have also found it hard to pick

1313
01:00:54,324 --> 01:00:58,224
one of two teams and to pick one member.

1314
01:00:58,224 --> 01:01:02,957
Still, both teams did so well today.

1315
01:01:02,957 --> 01:01:06,691
The participants of both teams may now return

1316
01:01:06,691 --> 01:01:09,791
to the green room and check their individual scores.

1317
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,691
Good job to both teams.

1318
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:14,391

How do you feel?

1323
01:01:27,857 --> 01:01:29,457
I'm sorry.

1324
01:01:29,457 --> 01:01:31,157
I don't know. We had the most fun we could.

1325
01:01:31,157 --> 01:01:33,324
And when it was over, the teammates said,

1326
01:01:33,324 --> 01:01:36,524
"We did so well, didn't we? That was fun."

1327
01:01:36,524 --> 01:01:39,091
So it makes me feel better recalling that.

1328

- My heart isn't completely heavy.
 - Me too.

 - It's okay.

1351

What I felt during the contest was that,

1352
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:35,424
and I should tell this to my friends later on,

1353
01:02:35,424 --> 01:02:37,007
is that losing isn't just about losing

1354
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,591
and winning isn't just about winning.

1355
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,257
That's what strongly hit me.

1356

That's right.

01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:47,024
I've seen how things could lead to a better result.

1358
01:02:47,024 --> 01:02:50,657
That's why I hope the sadness ends today.

1359

Personally, I was a bit disappointed with "Love Killa"

because they all looked so nice.

1364
01:03:03,324 --> 01:03:05,191
They could have been sexy.

1365
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:07,557
But they looked too nice rather than naughty.

1366
01:03:07,557 --> 01:03:09,291
- They should have looked naughty.
 - Right.

1367
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:11,924
- They needed a bad boy feel.
 - That's right.
