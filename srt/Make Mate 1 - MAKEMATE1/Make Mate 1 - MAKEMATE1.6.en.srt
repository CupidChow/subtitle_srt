00:35:51,297 --> 00:35:55,297
The participants I call out must leave the stage.

707
00:35:55,297 --> 00:36:00,231
[Nine were eliminated as they had to say goodbye]

708
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:06,131
[That evening]

709
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,897
[The participants gather
in the practice studio]

710
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:11,131
[Upset and gloomy]

711
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:14,464
I can't watch Kai practice anymore.

712
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,264
I can't watch Chen Shiau Fu practice any more either.

713
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:17,997
I know, right?

714
00:36:17,997 --> 00:36:20,464
But there were vacancies created today,

715
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:22,697
so a team member rearrangement is unavoidable.

716
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:24,364
- Yes.
- Yes.

717
00:36:24,364 --> 00:36:28,864
[Girl Group A Group has too many survivors]

718
00:36:28,864 --> 00:36:33,664
[Solo A and B Group has too few survivors]

719
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,531
Mate B Group doesn't have enough members.

720
00:36:36,531 --> 00:36:41,864
That's why some of Mate A Group's nine members

721
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:43,897
will have to go over to Mate B Group.

722
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:44,898
Oh, my gosh.

723
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:48,097
[One from Mate Group A
must move to Mate Group B]

724
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:50,431
The Mate B Group dance
must be memorized in a week.

725
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:52,797
Wow, what will I do if I have to go there?

726
00:36:52,797 --> 00:36:55,664
I'm suddenly worried now.

727
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:56,764
There's no telling who can come over.

728
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,218
Hyeon Uk wouldn't be a bad addition.

729
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:01,731
But he won't be sent over.

730
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:04,024
I felt mostly anxiety.

731
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:06,448
It's because the prepping time wasn't long

732
00:37:06,448 --> 00:37:07,931
and the thought of matching
our moves with a new member

733
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:13,031
and going through the
steps one by one is daunting.

734
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:18,597
The participant to be sent to Mate B Group...

735
00:37:18,597 --> 00:37:19,697
[Really?]

736
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:23,397
[It will be revealed shortly]

737
00:37:23,397 --> 00:37:26,431
Now the Mate Rule also applies to Round 2,

738
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:28,631
and that's how the final score will be calculated.

739
00:37:28,631 --> 00:37:31,397
Out of the two Mate Group teams contending,

740
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:34,131
the team with the highest individual score total

741
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:35,697
will get the "Winning Team Benefit,"

742
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:37,714
and in the case of the
Mate Group's winning team

743
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,731
being larger than its opposing group,

744
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:42,097
they will win the "Mate Group Benefit."

745
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:43,664
Hey, we really need to get that benefit.

746
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:44,931
Jia Hao needs that benefit.

747
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,931
[With no benefits so far, I'd like to get some]

748
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:53,931
Now then, the Round 2 contests
for Make Mate 1 will officially begin.

749
00:37:57,831 --> 00:38:02,064
The two teams for "Change,"
the first Round 2 contest,

750
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:03,831
will now come onto the stage.

751
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,997

They've already won in terms of looks.

759
00:38:30,731 --> 00:38:33,931
- Hey, look at Bing Fan.
- He looks cool.

They're already posing.

They're already getting into character onstage.

765
00:39:00,397 --> 00:39:02,964
Such concentration can be a plus.

766
00:39:02,964 --> 00:39:04,531
They're so cute.

767
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:07,197

- He flexed his triceps on "Three."
- He flexed.

Just look at how pretty our boys are.

802
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:27,897
I think the audience will
be very shocked by this.

803
00:40:27,897 --> 00:40:29,931
- They are such manly guys.
- They won't know

804
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:31,831
- which song will be performed.
- Exactly.

805

All of you must have been shocked.

It'll be fun to see what charms will be displayed

807
00:40:37,664 --> 00:40:40,131
if an original girl group song is performed

808
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:43,797
as a boy band song and how they compare.

809
00:40:43,797 --> 00:40:45,831
Actually, this mission

810
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:50,331
is about showing one's
masculinity in the best way.

811
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:53,064
- Taking liberties with the original song.
- Right.

The two teams that prepared
the "Change" Mission Girl Group Contest

supposedly went through a war of nerves

814
00:40:58,464 --> 00:41:03,164
from the song selection up to this moment.

815
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:05,964
How was that, Jeong Hyeon Uk?

817
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:12,064
We didn't even give B Team a single thought.

We'll show you everything we prepared,

826

That was a good comment.

Yoon Jae Yong has a way with words.

concerned about each other.

Sparks are flying between the two groups already,

834

pick from black or white.

Which one would you like?

843
00:42:20,297 --> 00:42:24,731
Since we're wearing black, we'll choose black.

- Can we do that?
- B Team chooses black.

845

- We are

01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:49,399
Being able to lose oneself is a talent.

1580
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:53,166
But you must deconstruct it and explain it to others.

1581
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:54,599
Okay.

1582
01:19:54,599 --> 01:19:57,599
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1583
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:00,266
I have a question...

1584
01:20:00,266 --> 01:20:01,366
Yes, go ahead.

1585
01:20:01,366 --> 01:20:03,399
Yes, go ahead.

1586
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:04,499
The thing is...

1587
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:09,466
You said I should bring it out from me.

1588
01:20:09,466 --> 01:20:12,299
But I don't know how to do that exactly.

1589
01:20:12,299 --> 01:20:15,066
- Jia Hao would know about that well.
- I see.

1590

[Proud Jia Hao]

1591
01:20:19,299 --> 01:20:22,232
I became a leader by
winning in facial expressions.

1592
01:20:22,232 --> 01:20:25,766
But I got the most negative feedback,

1593
01:20:25,766 --> 01:20:30,032
so I felt sorry about not being a model leader.

1594
01:20:30,032 --> 01:20:32,499
And Jia Hao knows the right answer.

1595
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:35,699
I was told that Jia Hao was the one holding the key.

1596
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:40,132
The results will be good
if we trust and follow him.

1597
01:20:40,132 --> 01:20:44,999
Yesterday, most of the
feedback we got was negative.

1598
01:20:44,999 --> 01:20:48,532
Our chances of winning are at risk.

1599
01:20:48,532 --> 01:20:49,966
[Unable to face it]

1600
01:20:49,966 --> 01:20:54,366
The most important feedback point was "immersion."

1601
01:20:54,366 --> 01:20:56,266
- Immersion.
- Immersion.

1602
01:20:57,499 --> 01:21:03,299
May I tell you what I was thinking?

1603
01:21:03,299 --> 01:21:07,599
Honestly, this song "UNFORGIVEN" is sad and heavy.

1604
01:21:07,599 --> 01:21:12,266
Villains and unfairness and all that.

1605
01:21:12,266 --> 01:21:17,066
So I'm continuously thinking about my life.

1606
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:24,166
I was born in 2002, so I'm 23 years old.

1607
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:27,066
I consider this to be my last chance.

1608
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:28,866
But I do believe

1609
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:34,999
I'm a person who tries very hard.

1610
01:21:34,999 --> 01:21:40,032
I showed everything that I wanted to show.

1611
01:21:40,799 --> 01:21:43,899
And yet, I kept getting negative results.

1612
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,266
My rank kept dropping

1613
01:21:46,266 --> 01:21:50,299
from 11th place to 12th, 17th, and 19th place.

1614
01:21:52,532 --> 01:21:54,266
The way I see it,

1615
01:21:54,266 --> 01:21:56,066
I'm a villain suppressed by unfairness.

1616
01:21:56,066 --> 01:21:58,399
This world is the hero.

1617
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,199
But the hero world is unfair.

1618
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:09,899
The ones trying hard might not get to win.

1619
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:14,899
I expressed this song with that in mind,

1620
01:22:15,466 --> 01:22:18,732
with the feeling of revenge against this world

1621
01:22:18,732 --> 01:22:23,532
because I want to show how great I am.

1622
01:22:23,532 --> 01:22:28,499
The mindset of "If I can't make a debut, who can?"

1623
01:22:31,499 --> 01:22:33,632
If I want to be immersed,

1624
01:22:33,632 --> 01:22:36,132
I can't be blindly angry.

1625
01:22:36,132 --> 01:22:42,499
I have to think about why
I want to make a debut,

1626
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,699
to think about what I've got,

1627
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:47,799
what I want to show,

1628
01:22:47,799 --> 01:22:52,799
and ask myself "Who am I?" to get immersed.

1629
01:22:54,832 --> 01:22:56,932
I've been writing notes a lot in my notebook.

1630
01:22:56,932 --> 01:22:59,266
But none of it seems to matter.

1631
01:23:00,132 --> 01:23:02,232
That is the real answer.

1632
01:23:02,232 --> 01:23:05,366
I lacked the most important tool,

1633
01:23:05,366 --> 01:23:07,066
and the answer to that was Hao.

1634
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,866
Frankly, I kept thinking about

1635
01:23:08,866 --> 01:23:13,266
how I could act out this song.

1636
01:23:13,266 --> 01:23:14,566
I also did that.

1637
01:23:14,566 --> 01:23:15,932
But listening to Hao's story,

1638
01:23:15,932 --> 01:23:20,699
only facial expressions
from the heart work on people.

1639
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:22,766
Oh, so this is what immersion is.

1640
01:23:22,766 --> 01:23:24,532
We've actually become villains.

1641
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:26,900
Whoa! I got goosebumps.

01:23:30,732 --> 01:23:32,816
I never imagined that our biggest dilemma

1644
01:23:32,816 --> 01:23:34,899
would be solved in such a short time.

- We can do it!
- We can do it!

1647
01:23:42,866 --> 01:23:45,832
Since we've realized how we can get immersed,

1648
01:23:45,832 --> 01:23:50,032
we'll appear as real villains onstage.

1649
01:23:55,999 --> 01:23:57,832
