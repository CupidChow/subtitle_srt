It was hard to manage facial expressions.

The choreography was very active, too.

395

Here are the reasons for the pick.

416

I debuted as Highlight 15 years ago now.

544
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,600
He's a major senior.

545
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,940
Didn't you debut 15 years ago, too?

546
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,140
I'm 15 years old.

547
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:34,560
I think teamwork was the best asset for our team.

548
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,700
We worked together, enjoying ourselves

549
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,790
and cheered each other up when we were struggling.

550
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,620
Our struggles ended up becoming...

551
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,700
fond memories.

552
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,880
So I hope the entire contestants of MA1

553
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,030
create harmony and enjoy performing together.

554
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,320
I'll announce the audience favorite of Team "Miss Right."

555
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,730
I think it'd be Sun Yub. He sang so well.

556
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,200
I can't tell with this team.

557
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,550
I think An Xin might win first place.

558
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,900
The audience favorite of Team "Miss Right" is...

559
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,020
An Xin.

560
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,730
An Xin.

561
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,140

Thank you. I can do it.

567
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,420
Why is he so cute?

568
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,000
Thank you for your support. I'll practice harder from now on

569
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,580
and do well in each performance.

570
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,430
Team "Miss Right," thank you so much.

571
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,950
Well done.

572
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,410
Thank you!

573
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,320
You're the best!

574
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,340
Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job.

575
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,720
That was the best teamwork.

576
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,870
That's so funny.

577
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,400
I wonder which team will be next.

578
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,070
We'll make it totally spicy.

579
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,280
It'd be hot and spicy.

580
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,770
Two, three. Fighting.

581

Please reveal.

582
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,850
It's "Very Good" by Block B.

583
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,880
They're doing this?

584
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,740
[Block B's "Very Good" boasts a fun and powerful rhythm]

585

587
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,000

Wow, Yu Seop is so confident.

589
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,250
They feel totally different than other teams.

590

Please introduce yourselves individually.

591

Hello, I'm Han Yu Seop of Team "Very Good."

592
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:25,150
Yu Seop's image is way different than the ones we've seen.

593
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,310
He definitely feels ready.

594
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,880
He was trained. He was a trainee for a bit.

595
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,930
I knew it.

596
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,720
Hello, I'm Seo Yun Deok of Team "Very Good."

597
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,170
You're like a puppy!

598
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,490
Yun Deok is cute.

599
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,310
Yun Deok feels mischievous, too.

600
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,010
I can tell he'd have a lot of fans.

601
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:50,030
Falling for that kind of charm is hopeless.

602
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,070
Hello, I'm Jia Hao of Team "Very Good."

603
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,460
He's handsome.

604
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,630
I want to see Jia Hao up close. Can you zoom in?

605
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,140
He's handsome.

606
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,550
He's really handsome.

607
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,380
Jia Hao was picked as the best performer, too.

608
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,770
- Wow, really?
- He must be a good dancer.

609
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,850
Hello, I'm Kim Hak Seong of Team "Very Good."

610
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,220
Hak Seong is handsome, too.

611
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,980
He's so cool.

612
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:20,950
Hak Seong has an interesting history.

613
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,450
History?

614
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,050
Really?

615
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:31,100
There hasn't been a defector trainee in the audition show history.

616
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,160
- I've never seen one.
- You're right.

617
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,600
I suspect this song would be all about being mischievous.

618
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,820
I wonder if the team with no experience could pull it off.

619
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,630
This is a legendary team, too.

620
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,460
They're powerful, too.

621
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,050
[What kind of performance did Team "Very Good" prepare?]

622
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,580
The next team is Team "Very Good."

00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,810
I'm looking forward to this team.

624
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,950
You're confident, right?

625
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,310
I am.

Yes.

628
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,250
But this song is too energetic.

629

They totally changed the atmosphere.

638
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,100
Boom.

639
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,730
Yun Deok...

640
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:02,290
I really liked it personally.

641
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:06,280
Hao is tall, has long limbs,

642
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,310
and his face is like that, too.

643
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,310
He's the No. 1 dancer,

644
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,190
but he's good at hitting high notes, too.

645
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,090
Wow, I have very high hopes for him.

646
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,880
Thank you.

647
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,370
He's good at everything. Everything.

648
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,540
As expected.

649
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,730
I think Yun Deok actually mocked us while performing.

650
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,160
[Aggressive performance]

651
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,200
- You didn't, right?
- Maybe?

652
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,370
What's his deal?

653
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,070
Each of you has your own charm.

654
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,070
There are two cheeky ones.

655
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,450
And these two balance things. You each have characters.

656
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,890
The performance felt very dynamic.

657
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,220
What I found so interesting is...

658
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,160
To be honest, they don't look very professional.

659
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,510
They don't, but...

660
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:05,850
it makes you go, "What's this?" and draws you in.

661
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,810
I think it's because of your charm. You're so bubbly.

662
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,370
That's why I think it was fun to watch.

663
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,410
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

I thought we should make it fun.

669
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,440
I think we should make it even more "delicious."

670
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,750
What can we do?

671
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,080
Shouldn't we come up with something?

672
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,350
How about we encourage the audience?

673
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,000
[Thinking Hao]

674
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,920

Let's try something like this.

681
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,080
Yun Deok should go to the back.

682
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,510
I'll go to the right.

683
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,990
Should I go there, toward Hak Seong?

684
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,150
Yes, yes. We all need to be different.

685
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,700

01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,610
Seung Ho feels like your college senior.

1082
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:39,420
Yes, yes.

1083
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,950
He's young, but he feels like an oppa.

1084
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:45,070
Hello, I'm Aki of Team "U."

1085
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,010
Why is Aki so handsome?

1086
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:51,010
Hello, I'm Choi Han Gyeol of Team "U."

1087
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,860
He's cute. I want to cheer for him.

1088
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:58,360
You seemed a bit stiff when you said hello.

1089
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,770
It's so nerve-wracking, isn't it?

1090
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,110
- Yes.
- Yes.

1091
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,100
Jae Hyeon can't control his face.

1092
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,670
Jae Hyeon is broken right now.

1093
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:10,720
Are you sure you're okay?

1094
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,840
I don't think so.

1095
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,000
Is Seung Ho nervous right now?

1096
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,710
I think they're blanking out. What do we do?

1097
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,440
- I know. How...
- That could happen.

1098
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:19,880
They're like, "I think I forgot."

1099
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,650
This makes you feel like you're their parents.

1100
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,480
I'm so worried about them.

1101
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,420
[Why are they so worried about them?]

1102
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:29,570
Next is Team "U."

1103
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,280
They're all tall.

1104
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,510
Wow, they're so handsome.

1105
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,690
This is a handsome team.

1106
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,050
[Amazing good looks!]

1107
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,720
- So cool.
- Ho Hyeon is so handsome. Wow.

1108
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:46,170
So handsome.

1109
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:47,710
Two, three.

1110
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,610
Huh? Hello.

1111
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:52,040
[My way]

1112
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,110
[We need to do it together]

1113
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,260
- Let's try again.
- Wasn't that on purpose?

1114
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:02,020
No.

1115
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:05,010
- Two, three.
- Hello.

1116
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,280
We're Team "U."

1117
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,660
We're Team "U."

1118
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,360
You wanted to do that?

1119
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,990
Okay, okay, okay.

1120
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:15,360
We're so excited.

1121
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:21,060
Let's look at the MATE PICK result for Team "U."

1122
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,480
I think it'd be about their looks.

1123
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,270
It's the looks. I loved them for it.

1124
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,550
Please reveal.

1125
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,480
No. 1 team in looks.

1126
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,060
No. 1 team in looks.

1127
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,550
Yes, yes.

1128
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:32,410
How about the other pick?

1129
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,180
[Bottom team]

1130
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,380
[Bottom team]

1131
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:41,340
You were picked as the bottom team.

1132
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:45,250
You received both positive and negative picks.

1133
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:49,880
It was an expected result.

1134
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,280
I knew we'd be chosen as the bottom team.

1135
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,050
To be honest, I picked our team, too.

1136
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:59,940
Team "U."

1137
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,050
Do we need to write down our team name?

1138
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,730
It's painful.

1139
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:06,880
The bottom.

1140
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,140
It's Team "U."

1141
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:13,300
[What will be the introduction performance of the team that ranked last?]

1142
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:22,100
Play music for Team "U."

1143
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:35,990
[Their dancing is getting clunky]

1144
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:38,910
Gosh, gosh. What a disaster.

1145
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,490
[The movements got messed up]

1146
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:05,130
Aigoo, gosh.

1147
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,660
[Sighing]

1148
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:13,180
[Team "U" is waiting for the feedback nervously]

1149
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:15,610
Team "U" was...

1150
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,280
putting on a talent show just now.

1151
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:26,440
If I were the producer, I wouldn't let you perform.

1152
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,510
I won't let you perform.

1153
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:35,040
There will be an audience for the first performance.

1154
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,750
I think this won't be fair to them.

1155
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:47,010
Whoever does the reading needs to fix you manually.

1156
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:48,440
You know what I mean?

1157
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,920
Where are your hands...

1158
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,720
and feet pointing at? Which position are you in?

1159
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,460
Where are you facing? What's the timing for this?

1160
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:59,000
You have to repeat until you get that. You need muscle memory.

1161
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,820
I don't expect a dramatic development.

1162
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,620
You need to show us how much you can grow.

1163
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:13,320
Aki is the only member who has danced before.

1164
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,860
It wasn't easy to do it the first time.

1165
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:20,130
- How are you supposed to count?
- Five, six, seven...

1166
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:22,250
Since we didn't know how to practice,

1167
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,730
it took a lot of time.

1168
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:29,810
It took us longer to learn the choreography.

1169
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:32,840
[Team "Breathless"]

1170
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,120
We'll practice in a totally different way

1171
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,600
as if we're starting anew.

1172
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,940
Should we decide now to practice today?

1173
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,500
Shall we?

1174
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:47,120
Just like this?

1175

[Taking tons of notes]

1176
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:53,370
Since our team members learned how to dance here,

1177
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:56,810
we didn't have much of a practice routine.

1178
01:13:56,810 --> 01:14:00,720
So, in order to listen to the feedback after the intro meeting,

1179
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:04,040
we came out with our own routine.

We should stop being called a handsome team.

1190
