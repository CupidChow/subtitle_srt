I'm MA1's MC...

29
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,670
and your mate, Xiumin of EXO.

00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,380
Nice to meet you.

The boys who've been living ordinary lives

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,540
greeted you through their first performance.

33
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,830
They've been growing rapidly through three rounds of competition

34
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,040
and proved themselves as idols.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,760
Now they're awaiting their last performance, the fateful final round.

36
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,560
Which ones among them will be born as a global idol K-pop group?

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,340
I'm so curious.

38
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,440

They're the families of the contestants who are in the final round

44
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,950
and their MATES who have been dreaming with them.

45

Yes, to cheer for their friends, Chen Shiau Fu, Kai, and Aki

46
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,810
flew all the way here, apparently.

47
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,300
Have you been well?

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,700

Participate in the online Favorite Voting.

64

(Ha... This man...)

69
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,420
I'm a sinner.

70
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,370
I'm a sinner who made you vote to death.

71
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,770
Hyun Joon!

72
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,610
If voting is a sin,

73
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,350
I'd serve life in prison.

74
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,700
(Hyun Joon and Ki Hyun are sobbing)

75
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,430
Gosh, how frustrating.

76
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,610
Gosh, you're driving me crazy!

77
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,340
I can't vote unless you tell me how to!

78
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,110
(Oh, really?)

79
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,470
What did you say?

80
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,910
How does it work?

81
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,780
All Fanmates know. You still don't know?

82
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,740
You mean the live online Favorite Voting Part 2?

83
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,350
Bingo. You probably all voted by now, right?

84
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,410
I can't vote unless you tell me how to!

85
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,880
What did you say? How does the voting work?

86
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,310
Let me teach you.

87
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,940
Copy me starting now.

88
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,320

(Online Favorite Voting ends during the live show)

108
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,350
In MA1's final Favorite Voting Part 2,

109
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:21,350
you vote for just one contestant who you want to debut.

110
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,190

111

Please vote now if you haven't yet.

112
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,670
Okay!

113
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,440
Through the Fanmates' precious votes,

114
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,330
the ordinary boys' dreams will come true.

115
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,730
The final round will be starting now.

116
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,620
Since this is the last performance before they debut,

117
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,820
we'll make things special tonight.

118
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,400
The last round will be New Song Mission.

119
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,030
(New Song Mission is the final round)

120
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,680
The 16 contestants who are in the final will be

121
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,400
split into two teams and perform new songs.

122
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,980
In the final round, the two teams won't compete against each other.

123
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,640
The contestants will be judged individually.

124
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,420
(They will be judged individually)

125
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,370
For the final round,

126
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,010
the Favorite Voting Part 1 that happened last week,

127
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,250
the Favorite Voting Part 2, which is happening today,

128
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,440
the MATE growth points from the last round,

129
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,100
and the C MATES' scores from today will be combined.

130
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,490
For the Favorite Voting Part 2, the scores will count twice as much

131
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,420
and the scores will be in proportional representation.

132
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,610
Just three months ago,

133
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,550
the ordinary boys have never been on stage before.

134
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:56,700
Now they will be the artists of new songs.

135
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,420
This will be a meaningful day for the final contestants.

136
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,150
These people can't be excluded...

137
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,520
on a meaningful day like this.

138
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,900
They've been the MA1 contestants'

139
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,440
running mates by giving them affectionate advice.

140
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,670
Here are the MA1's C MATES!

141
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,410
C MATE Im Han Byul.

142
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,100
How does it feel to be in the final round?

143
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,600
Hello, I'm Im Han Byul.

144
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,520
It's already been over 100 days since we met the ordinary boys.

145
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,310
They were just ordinary boys you see in everyday life.

146
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,100
But they're about to perform live in front of countless fans.

147
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,880
I really can't believe it. Are you all excited?

148
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,870
Yes!

149
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,680
One more time. Are you excited?

150
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,420
Yes!

151
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,540
Nice.

152
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,410
In the KBS hall, where countless K-pop stars were born,

153
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,770
I hope new K-pop stars will be born tonight.

154
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,910
- I'll be looking forward to it.
- Yes.

155
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:27,350
The C MATES have been using carrot and stick

156
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,480
often in each round as running mates.

157
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,470
Solar has been using a stick more than anyone else.

158
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,590
Please say something to the final contestants.

159
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,930
First of all, I'm sorry.

160
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,920
Since I saw their potential,

161
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,740
I wanted to tell them a lot of things because I wanted more from them.

162
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,420
Starting today, I'll root for them as colleagues

163
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,290
and I hope they're born as amazing artists

164
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,340
throughout their singing career.

165
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,930
Yes.

166
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,770
Anyone would be grateful to get criticized by Solar.

167
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,400
C MATE Vata has known the contestants from the beginning.

168
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,470
This must be meaningful to you. How do you feel?

169
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,390
I know. When I first met them,

170
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,230
they were like blank sheets of paper.

171
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,980
Now I think, "How did they grow this much?"

172
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,560
They grew so much.

173
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,940
I'm really impressed with them.

174
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,450
I think it's because they worked extra hard.

175
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,780
I'm proud of them, and I feel rewarded.

176
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,130
Yes.

177
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,030
And C MATE In Gyoo.

178
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,060
You've been giving them a lot of harsh criticism.

179
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,820
Please say a word to the contestants and me, who are very nervous right now.

180
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,900
Don't be so nervous.

181
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,240

I'm not sure what the result would be tonight,

366

but I'll work hard to show my best self.

367

383
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,980
Since the First Stage, I've grown a lot.

384
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,210
I received a lot of support from the Fanmates, too. Thank you.

385

I worked hard for the final round, too.

Let's debut, Takuma!

402
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,550
Yes, that was Team "Higher Wire" sharing their determination.

403
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:35,740
Since this is a new song, think of it as your debut, and do your best.

404
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,300
The final's New Song Mission.

405
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,600
- Aren't you all excited?
- Yes!

406

Team "Higher Wire" finally got together.

- I think our team is the true Avengers team.
- I agree.

414
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:16,250
Round 3's 1st place contestant is Jia Hao.

415
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,390
(This team has the Top 5 contestants)

416
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,700
(We're the Avengers)

417
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,980
­

418
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,530
- I love this team.
- I've never felt so secure...

419
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,930
seeing the members' faces.

420
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,510
All of our teammates are so talented.

421
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,880
I think we can give a perfect performance.

422
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,910
(Full of confidence)

423
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,970
We can do it. I think so.

424
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,630
(What will be their new song for the finals?)

425
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:45,940
("Higher Wire" - A song about a dream in a hopeless situation)

426
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:55,180
(It tells a story about their determination to move forward)

427
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,640
(Our song is crazy)

428
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,510
It really feels like the final. The last moment.

429
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,270
Yes, it feels like the final.

430
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,300
This is the final song. We debut after this.

431
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,190
Our determination to debut...

432
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,670
It's about the will to move higher up.

433
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,090
I think that's why it's called "Higher Wire."

434
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,430
I think you're right. The determination to debut.

435
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,680
Yes, that's right.

436
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,090
One thing we can all agree on...

437
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,660
is our desire to achieve our dreams while training.

438
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,180
It'd be good to keep that in mind.

439
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:37,830
We've been working so hard to get to the finals.

440
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,600
Yes.

441
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,310
We've been through a lot.

442
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,070
(They took a step closer to their dreams in every MA1 performance)

443
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,190
(They worked hard every day to debut)

444
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,710
I think we worked really hard.

445
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,720
I put my life at stake.

446
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,060
(They've been sweating to achieve one dream)

447
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,260
Someone ends up losing after working hard.

448
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,760
- Right.
- Even when you did well.

449
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,320
Some people lose even though they're good.

450
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,590
It's not easy.

451
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,230
I'm so sorry.

452
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,070
- I'm sorry.
- You did fine.

453
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,710
Let's make sure our hard work doesn't go to waste.

454
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,640
Let's do our best.

455
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,810
This really is our last performance on MA1.

456
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:44,290
Let's work hard and debut together.

457
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,450
- We should.
- We should.

458
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,900
It'd be devastating to go home now.

459
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,640
We only have one step to go. The last battle.

460
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,040
Let's make it a happy ending.

461
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,750
Lin. Takuma. Ki Hyun.

462
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,550
Hyun Wook. Yu Seop.

463

Hyun Joon. Bing Fan. Jia Hao.

464
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,040
Debut!

­

466
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,770
(We need to practice to debut, right?)

467
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,830
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

468
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:20,480
(Team "Higher Wire" is starting to practice)

469
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,680
(Looking intently)

470
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,860
Let's stay where we were.

471
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,620
(Understood)

472
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,590

(Satisfied)

475
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,580
Yes!

476
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,130
(They pick things up immediately)

477
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,890
- Easy.
- Peasy.

478
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,090
Lemon squeezy.

479
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,660
­

480
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,610
Nice.

481
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,120
(We're so good)

482
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,220
(So cool)

(Perfectly in sync)

485
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,010
It's so satisfying.

486
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,330
We'd look great in the end.

487
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,480
We look great.

488
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,960
I find my team so dependable.

489
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,300
(As dependable as a bowl of gukbap)

490
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,490
I wish we could debut immediately.

491
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,420
- As a team.
- It's like we already debuted.

492
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,730
Can't we debut after the finals?

493
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,850
It feels like we're debuting already.

494
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,900
(Interim assessment day)

495
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,200
Hello, we're Team "Higher Wire."

496
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,720
We're in your care.

497
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,680
There are top contestants here.

498
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,600
(Embarrassed)

499
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,930
Shall we see? Shall we?

500
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,790
Fighting. Fighting.

501
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,050
(Missed a beat)

502
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,420
(Confused)

503
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,510
♫  ♫

504
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,950

505
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,090
♫  ♫

506

(The supposed Avengers team is out of sync)

507
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,760
Thank you.

508
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,250
(What will the C MATES say?)

509
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,790
Well...

510
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,920
(Gulp)

511
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,480
­

512
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,520
There's no need to think. You just need to dance really well.

513
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,170
To be honest, you're really bad now.

514
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,420
­

515
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,070
­

516
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,760
Even your hand positions bother me.

517
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,430
Stop bending your arms. Stretch them out. Stick out your chest, too.

518
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,430
You need to fix all the angles.

519
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,240
You need to check every single thing.

520
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,860
This is your song. But you did so poorly.

521
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,400
It's a waste of good choreography.

522
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,970
They came up with the choreography for us.

523
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,550
But they said it was wasted on us.

524
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:49,630
It made me upset and less confident.

525
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,520
Shall we try? I'll walk you through the refrain.

526
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,320
This isn't in three parts like this.

527
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,760
One, bam! There are only two parts, okay?

528
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,930
It's not this. Get it? You start from here.

529
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,080
Look. Swoosh, bounce. Like this.

530
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,960
It doesn't look like much.

531
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,890
But you need to bring these qualities to look good.

532
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,700
Wow.

533
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,820
You know this is your song and choreography.

534
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,150
I'm telling you to just keep training.

535
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,720
It's all about the labor.

536
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,500
That'd make you look really good.

537
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,120
(Endless practice to debut)

538
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,750

00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,300
With our names and voices.

00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,510
(Moved)

723
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,370
Did you anticipate this group?

724
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,860
I didn't.

725
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,190
I knew there would be these four.

726
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,760
Hak Sung surprised me so much.

727
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,390
I was surprised to see you, too.

728
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,160
I was surprised to see Joon Pyo.

729
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,990
Joon Pyo is the most surprising one.

730
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,830
(The members who are not innocent at all)

731
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,700
(I'll show you what innocent means)

732
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,480
(His ears are about to pop off)

733
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,270
- You're blushing.
- Your ears...

734
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,320
(It's hard to act innocent)

735
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,280
Wow, it's hot.

736
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,830
(Seo Yoon Deok's attempt at acting innocent)

737
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:15,750

738
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,040
(Bowing as a habit)

739
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,350
Stop bowing.

740
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,620
Bowing first isn't right.

741
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,450

- So cute.
- He's good.

745
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,620
Shi On, what do you think is important?

746
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,370
I think the song needs to suit you first.

747
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:45,060
You guys are hopeless.

748
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,150
You need to be cute.

749

750
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,550
But I'm cute.

00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,790
(Jeon Joon Pyo - 21 years old. Still a cute age.)

752
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,690

753
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:59,590
(Interim assessment day)

754
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,040
How did the preparation go, Joon Pyo?

755
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,260
I thought keeping the mood light was the priority.

756
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,390
I think I focused on that a lot.

757
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,940
- Should we have a look?
- Yes.

758
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,770
Let's go.

759
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,720
(Trying to be as innocent as possible)

760
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,650
♫  ♫

761
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,900

(Ending pose)

767
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:42,540
Thank you.

768
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,800
(Serious)

769
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:52,350
The performance didn't really move me.

770
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:53,940
Didn't really move me.

771
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,040
(The song isn't being communicated well)

772
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,590
It didn't feel like a performance, either.

773
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:03,420
You all looked fake.

774
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:15,120
"Make it Bounce" isn't only about being fun and innocent.

775
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,300
There's something sad about it. You know what I mean?

776
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,810
You're completely ignoring that right now.

777
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:26,390
I thought it suited all of your stories so far.

778
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,290
Your life is all about bouncing right now.

779

What do you think is bouncing right now?

782
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,770
The heart.

784
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:40,540
Yes, I'd like you to be sincere.

785
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:44,320
It shouldn't be fake. Express your feelings

786
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,990
through this song.

787
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,930
It's already within you.

788
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:53,260
You need to be sincere now.

789
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,610
We've been practicing wrong.

790
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,550
It's not about copying...

791
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,320
someone else trying to be innocent.

792
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,100
"Make it Bounce" is about me.

793
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,190
­

794
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:12,770
They said "Make it Bounce" isn't all about being innocent in the interim assessment.

795
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:16,490
We should talk about that one more time.

796
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:21,450
I don't think we have to keep things bright.

797
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:26,610
Our journeys so far...

798
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,410
weren't always just fun.

799
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:31,280
They were difficult...

800
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,290
and we felt frustrated with ourselves, too.

801
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:35,820
Right.

802
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,940
♫  ♫

803
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:45,690
(They made mistakes in the first performance)

804
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,140
Why? Come on, come on...

805
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,080
(Bowing)

806
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,520
Bowing in the beginning isn't right.

807
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,460
You shouldn't apologize to us.

808
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,930
You should apologize to yourself.

809
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,110
You need to because you did so poorly.

810
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,850
(They got scolded for being inadequate)

811
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:09,690
Focus. We have to go again if one person messes up.

812
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,340
One. Hey, stop.

813
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,080
Shi On, what did I tell you?

814
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,320
- What did you do just now?
- Oh, right.

815
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,640
Fix that.

816
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,960
Well done.

817
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,960
(It was sad that their friends left one by one)

818
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,460
- You worked so hard.
- You, too.

819
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,740
(The moments they had to keep trying)

820
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:38,110
It'd be moving to look at other members dancing.

821
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,210
"This is really our last time.

822
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:43,660
I'm giving the last performance with these guys."

823
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:49,870
That would make you feel happy and sad.

824
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:53,470
That'd be important while we practice, too.

825
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:56,830
Let's have fun and look at each other.

826
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,870
We all know how each other feels.

827
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:04,280
Let's convey our memories together in the performance.

828
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,810
I think that might be our answer.

829
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:12,750
New Song Mission is our beginning and MA1's last stage.

830
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,880
Let's enjoy it because it's the finals.

831
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,540
I'm planning to pour everything into it.

832
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:27,580
I want this performance to make everyone's hearts pound.

833
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,630
Remember us.

We just heard the second new song, "Make it Bounce."

895
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:20,570
I felt satisfied to see them pulling off the new song perfectly.

896
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:26,710
To be honest, I want all 16 of them to debut.

897
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:31,370
I think you all feel the same way.

898
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:40,410
And the C MATES were smiling during the performance.

899
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:44,250
C MATE Kim Sung Eun, what did you think?

900
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:52,310
While I was coaching them, we faced some difficulties.

901
00:58:52,310 --> 00:59:00,460
I asked them to overcome themselves. It was a difficult request.

902
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:06,630
Because this song will be sung in their voices for the first time.

903
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:10,640
So, I asked them to feel responsible for the audience.

904
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,720
I made such a difficult request.

905
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,550
But I'm not sure how I'm feeling right now.

906
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:21,860
My heart is really pounding right now.

907
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:25,520
I think I just saw a masterpiece.

908
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,390
Yes.

909
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,530
­

910
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:32,380
I felt so happy, guys.

911
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,100
You did great.

912
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,170
Yes.

913
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:39,980
Next is C MATE In Gyoo.

914
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:43,360
I heard you directed the choreography.

915
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,410
What did you think of the performance?

916
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:49,810
I created this choreography thinking of them.

917
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:56,250
You all showed off your unique charms better than I expected.

918
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,600
I got the chills all over my body earlier.

919
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,620
I'm happy that you gave a great performance.

920
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:06,090
My heart is pounding as if I performed with you.

921
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:08,730
You did great. Truly.

922
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:16,210
Yes, the second team, Team "Make it Bounce," finished their performance, too.

923
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:20,130
C MATES, please finish grading.

924
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,700
Team "Make it Bounce," thank you.

925
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:27,190
Thank you!

926
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:39,180
They were ordinary boys just a few months ago.

927
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:45,850
I could tell how hard they worked to give their dream performance.

928
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:51,410
Right now, it's 11:13 p.m.

929
01:00:51,410 --> 01:01:00,980
Favorite Voting, which is currently happening, is ending in just a moment.

930
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:06,790
Please help the ordinary boys achieve their dreams with your precious vote.

931
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,010
­

932
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:09,520
­

933
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:17,110
MA1's live final round is heating up more and more.

934
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:26,450
The next performance is even more special than the new song performances.

935
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,200
I hope you look forward to it.

936
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,970
I'll see you in a moment, then.

937
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:39,960
As MA1 started last March,

938
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,480
I told you the keyword of the show was "mate."

939
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,550
Mate. It means a friend, but it's used in "checkmate."

940
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:53,660
It also meant a competitor.

941
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,890
­

942
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:00,580
The 36 contestants who got together under the name MA1

943
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:05,350
became friends who performed together

944
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:10,790
and competitors who fought over benefits.

945
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:14,900
The 36 contestants who started the journey together reunited.

946
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,650
Today, they'll pause competing

947
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:23,430
and perform together as friends.

948
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:30,870
They prepared MA1's main song.

949
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:36,190
After this performance, the voting will end.

950
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:40,690
Please hurry up if you haven't voted yet.

951
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:48,740
The 36 contestants will perform MA1's main song.

952
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:54,320
It's "Time of Our Life." Let's watch it together.

953
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,210
(MA1's 100 days)

954
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:01,350
The clapboard will be clapped for the first time on MA1.

955
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,050
This is so crazy.

956
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,490
We're finally starting.

957
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:11,250
(The ordinary boys' journey toward their dream)

958
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:16,140
(They've been running toward their one dream)

959
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:21,340
Hello, we're the contestants of a show called "MA1." Hello.

960
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,330
I just got the chills.

961
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,880
(The boys have been stepping toward their dream)

962
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,480
That's so cruel. What was that?

963
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,140
This is making me nervous.

964
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:48,640
(The ordinary boys' first performance)

965
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,060
The winning team is...

966
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:58,090
(They sometimes won)

967
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:03,610
Aki, please leave the stage.

968
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,960
You did a great job.

969
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,020
(And sometimes, they had to leave)

970
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:11,450
(They discovered on the journey to their dream)

971
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,670
You did great.

972
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:15,440
You did great.

973
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,440
(Another name for a competitor, "mate")

974
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,630
Whether we win or lose, that was a great performance.

975
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,520
- Very good.
- We survived today.

976
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,760
We're still a team, even if we get separated.

977
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,250
- Yes.
- I'm tearing up right now.

978
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,480
(It was beautiful because they were together)

979
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,100
(It was dreamy because they were together)

980
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,070
He's heavy. I need to hurry up.

981
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:52,890
(A beautiful page from their youth)

982
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:58,990

And as the special performance ended,

1010
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,790
the last voting for the debut team,

1011
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:53,060
the final Favorite Voting Part 2 has ended.

1012
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,900
While we count the points to determine the debut team,

1013
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:06,090
let's hear from C MATES, who enjoyed the main song performance.

1014
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:11,610
First, C MATE Solar, how do you feel after watching their performance?

1015
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:16,500
They worked so hard to reach this point...

1016
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,020
I just want to say good work.

1017
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:25,620
Don't lose your original heart for the performance and for your dream.

1018
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:32,200
I hope you become a comfort to many people with great performances.

1019
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,800
Good work.

1020
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,570
Yes.

1021
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:41,910
C MATE Hanhae, what did you think of the main song performance?

1022
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:47,180
Now that I see everyone together for the first time in a while,

1023
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,540
it reminds me of our introduction meeting.

1024
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:56,790
I felt somewhat strange while reminiscing about the journey we've taken.

1025
01:08:56,790 --> 01:09:01,860
Whether you debut or not,

1026
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:08,080
I was thinking I'd like to see them often.

1027
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,330
Good work.

1028
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:11,790
Yes, thank you.

1029
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,310
To everyone who's journeyed with us on MA1,

1030
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:23,160
I hope this performance isn't the end but the first page of the new beginning.

1031
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:29,470
Thank you to the 34 contestants of the MA1 who performed.

1032
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:40,870
In a moment, the fate of the 16 finalists will be determined.

1033
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:46,300
Who will get to fulfill the dream of the debut?

1034
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:51,500
We'll announce the MA1 debut team soon.

1035
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,090
I'll see you in a moment.

1036
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:56,990
(Final Stage D-7)

1037
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,150
I wonder what we're doing right now.

1038
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:00,230
They said it's a surprise fan meeting today.

1039
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,460
I wonder what we're doing today. I have no idea.

1040
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,100
I have no clue.

1041
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,060
FaceTime our parents?

1042
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,880
Boot camp?

1043
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,090
No boot camp.

1044
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:13,040
Put together a performance in an hour.

1045
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,280
Wait, this street is...

1046
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,630
It's our way to the studio!

1047
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,580
But we finished everything. We're not performing there anymore.

1048
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,090
I know, right?

1049
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:24,070
I wonder what we haven't done yet.

1050
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,100
Or how about a hidden mission all of a sudden?

1051
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,250
Oh, please, no...

1052
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,670
We're almost there.

1053
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,210
Why are we here?

1054
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,200
Don't worry.

1055
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,280
- Wait, why...
- Whoa, the wind!

1056
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,270
(Why did the ordinary boys come here?)

1057
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:39,790
My hair!

1058
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,310
The wind is so strong.

1059
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:45,330
Jeju Island. It feels like Jeju Island.

1060
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,660
What, what, what?

1061
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,050
- Whoa!
- What, what, what?

1062
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,390
- It's dark.
- What is it?

1063
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,990
- What, what, what?
- It's blinding.

1064
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,830
- What is it?
- The stage disappeared.

1065
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,380
There's nothing here.

1066
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,650
Wow, it's so spacious.

1067
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:04,630
Did we have a stage put in a space like this?

1068
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,070
(They don't know why, but they're just happy...)

1069
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:09,950
(Where is this place they're running around in?)

1070
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:20,040
(Where the stage has been for the last three months)

1071
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:24,140
(The film studio has been dismantled)

1072
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:29,160
(Back in the studio, leaving one last page)

1073
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,120
Reminds me of the signature song.

1074
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,070
Time of our life...

1075
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,590
I'm sad.

1076
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,130
It feels lonely.

1077
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:40,090
(How do they feel after seeing the stage dismantled?)

1078
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:43,900
- It feels empty.
- Our memories have vanished.

1079
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,060
I'm a little sad.

1080
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:52,170
It was a space that was fancy and filled with lots of people.

1081
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,870
And now that it's all empty overnight,

1082
01:11:56,870 --> 01:12:01,040
I feel like this space is so sad.

1083
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,390
It doesn't feel good now that it's empty.

1084
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:05,500
It feels bittersweet.

1085
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,060
(How did they feel standing onstage for the first time?)

1086
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,400
I was so excited.

1087
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:13,690
I was so nervous when I first saw the stage that I thought my heart would burst.

1088
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:17,440
- I almost died from being nervous.
- Since it was our first time on stage like that.

1089
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,840
(Contestants on stage for the first time)

1090
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:26,690
The stage was huge, and I felt overwhelmed.

1091
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:29,120
(Speechless)

1092
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,570
I think I was so nervous that I could hear my heartbeat.

1093
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:38,380
The fact that we had to do our first performance in front of the audience

1094
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,230
was so much pressure, and I was so worried.

1095
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,740
And since they're coming to watch us when they don't know us,

1096
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:47,100
I felt like we had to satisfy them. So, I was so nervous.

1097
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:51,890
If you see the audience in front of us, they write our names in the sketchbook

1098
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:55,950
and they draw cute teddy bear drawings.

1099
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,470
I was so happy.

1100
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:59,760
I was so thankful.

1101
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,100
Who'd be your No. 1 fan?

1102
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,910
My parents.

1103
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:07,280
- Parents.
- My parents.

1104
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,600
Then, lastly, your No. 1 fans...

1105
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:19,000
we'll say a word to your parents or to your family.

1106
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,850
Mom and Dad!

1107
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,250
When I said I wanted to become a singer,

1108
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:29,060
you've trusted me and rooted for me.

1109
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,290
Thank you so much.

1110
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:37,770
I've lived overseas for six years.

1111
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:40,970
You were worried about me, right?

1112
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:45,630
I'm getting better, so you don't have to worry about me.

1113
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:51,150
I couldn't call them often...

1114
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:56,480
I miss you so much.

1115
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:01,450
When I think about Mom, Dad, and Noona...

1116
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:04,630
I would start crying right away.

1117
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:07,070
That's why I couldn't call you.

1118
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:11,610
I didn't want to show myself struggling.

1119
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:14,470
I really miss home a lot.

1120
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:18,030
I miss my parents a lot.

1121
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:23,050
I'm working hard. Aren't you proud of me?

1122
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:28,250
I'm sure you're promoting me really hard, asking for votes.

1123
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,300
Your hard work and your faith in me... I won't let it go to waste

1124
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:35,900
and repay you by making my debut. I love you.

1125
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,030
I love you.

1126
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:38,840
I love you.

1127
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,550
I love you.

1128
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:42,980
Love you.

1129
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:45,760
I thank you and love you from the bottom of my heart.

1130
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,550
Thank you always.

1131
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:52,370
Thank you for giving birth to me.

1132
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:55,530
Thank you for cheering me on.

1133
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:00,240
Thank you, and I love you.

1134
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:05,320
Thank you for being my No. 1 fan.

1135
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,990
I love you.

1136
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:25,240
Each and every step of the ordinary boys toward their dream has brought them here today.

1137
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:30,940
Rather than an empty stage, they will be artists performing in front of the world.

1138
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:36,540
I'm curious who will be the contestants in the Top 7.

1139
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:41,340
In the final round, Part 1 and 2 Favorite Voting, Growth scores,

1140
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:47,090
and C Mate scores for a total of 10,000 points.

1141
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:56,910
And in the live final Favorite Voting, Fanmates from 141 countries participated.

1142
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:02,310
Thank you again for your interest and support, Fanmates.

1143
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:15,660
Now is the fateful hour.

1144
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:24,780
I will not begin the announcement of the MA1 debut team.

1145
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:40,110
I will make the announcement of the debut team from the MA1 final round.

1146
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:41,510
First,

1147
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,310
out of 16 contestants,

1148
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:47,730
I will announce contestants who have ranked in the

1149
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:53,340
lower half who did not make the debut team.

1150
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:06,490
At the cusp of making the debut team of MA1,

1151
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:10,440
I will announce contestants who have ranked in the

Please say a word to the Fanmates who cheered you on to the end.

1156
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:59,450
First of all,

1157
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:02,780
I'm disappointed that I didn't make the debut team.

1158
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:08,050
But since I gained so much through MA1,

1159
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:18,710
Since I gained so much, I think I created a memory that I will not regret.

1160
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:20,420
Thank you.

1161
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:26,400

I've worked hard thus far...

1189
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:00,540
and I'm disappointed because I came so close.

1190
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:04,090
But I'll work hard and show you more growth going forward. Thank you.

1191

01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,840
Although it's disappointing not to be able to debut today,

1200
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:44,840
but I have no regrets since I feel good about my final performance.

1201
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,760

01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:26,690
Placing in the Top 9 in the mid portion of the rounds, he's maintained that spot.

1252
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:32,240

1256
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:51,850
(6th place / Jeon Joon Pyo / 5,862 points)

1257
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:56,960
I could never get used to sending off other contestants.

1258
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,870
I feel so out of it at the moment.

1259
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:03,970
I'm so happy that I will make my debut.

1260
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:11,860
I have never called out to my parents from the stage.

1261
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:19,000
It's my first time showing them my performance today.

1262
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,520
I feel like I've repaid them with a great result, and that makes me feel good.

1263
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:32,660
And I want to say thank you to all the Fanmates who have cheered me on.

1264
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:37,950
And there are so many people who have worked so hard behind the scenes.

1265
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:42,650
Thank you so much, the writers, producers, and all the staff.

1266
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:47,520
There is still so much in me that I haven't shown you.

1267
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,180
I'll show you many sides of me going forward.

1268
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:53,840
Please root for me. Thank you!

1269
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,890
Yes, congratulations.

1270
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:12,930
Moving on, I'll announce the next contestant to join the debut team.

1271
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:21,790
(Announcing 5th place for Top 7)

1272
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:26,140

1273
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:30,690

1274
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:35,480
It's contestant Noh Ki Hyun. Congratulations!

1275
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,350
Contestant Noh Ki Hyun, who handled unexpected situations,

1276
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,860
gaining approval from the Fanmates.

1277
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,770
He showed passionate performances in each round.

1278
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:10,910
He began the final round at the lowest ranking of 16th place.

1279
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:15,870
As he places in 5th place in the end, he joins the debut team.

1280
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:23,180
Yes, contestant Noh Ki Hyun, congratulations on making the debut team.

Please tell us how you feel.

1282
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:33,970
I first thought about...

1283
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,260
how I got started.

1284
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:43,210
When I first started dreaming of becoming an idol,

1285
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:47,030
my parents were deadset against it.

1286
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:52,010
But as I worked hard and showed them what I do and noticed how happy they were,

1287
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:57,870
I was so happy then. And...

1288
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:09,330
Fanmates who always root for me and love me,

1289
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:16,060
C MATES who helped to put on good performances,

1290
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:20,750
and thank you so much to all the crew who put on wonderful stages. And...

1291
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:26,100
MC Xiumin and all the contestants,

1292
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:30,550
I was so happy to make connections with you.

1293
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:32,440
Thank you!

1294
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:36,770

Contestant Jang Hyun Joon. Congratulations!

1299
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:22,520
Contestant Jang Hyun Joon began as the main vocal for the main song

1300
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:26,700
and showed off the flawless high pitch in each round with his strong voice.

1301
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,950
Befitting the opinion that says he's a trustworthy main vocal,

1302
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:33,490
he joins the debut team in 4th place in the final round.

1303
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:39,690

Thank you so much for letting me perform so wonderfully.

1314
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:30,020
Love you!

1315
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:31,760

While working on this project, I've never been able to receive any benefits.

1334
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:14,120
So, I was so anxious every day.

1335
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:18,480
But thanks to all of your support,

1336
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:23,680

1420
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:28,660
- Thank you.
- Please tell us how you feel.

1421
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:30,540
(7th place / Han Yu Seop / 5,757 points)

1422
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:36,360
First of all, I had no idea they'd call my name,

1423
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:39,190
so I was so worried.

1424
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:46,920
I want to thank my family for always

1425
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,840
trusting and rooting for me.

1426
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,710
More than anything,

1427
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:58,100
I want to thank my mom.

1428
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,790
And...

1429
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:06,780
the staff members who helped us,

1430
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:12,690
C MATES who helped me to grow,

1431
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:18,090
and more than anything, Fanmates

1432
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:23,530
who allowed me to be here, I want to say thank you.

1433
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:28,320
I believe this is the beginning for me.

1434
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:35,830
I'll do my best to become Han Yu Seop, whom the Fanmates can be proud of.

1435
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:37,380
Thank you!

1436
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:42,950
Yes, the last contestant, Han Yu Seop. Congratulations again.

1437
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:50,390
And contestant Kim Shi On, I'm so sorry.

1438
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:54,280
However, you know that this isn't the end, right?

1439
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:59,830
Please say a word to the Fanmates who cheered you on to the end.

1440
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:04,950
Yes, I regretfully am dropping out, everyone.

1441
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:07,460
Although...

1442
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:13,810
I'm dropping out from MA1,

1443
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:16,620
I will never abandon this dream of mine.

1444
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:20,780
So, please watch me to the end.

1445
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:23,380
And to everyone...

1446
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:28,310

1447
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:35,310
Please do an awesome job as you make your debut.

You guys are awesome.

1449
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:43,710
I won't abandon this dream, and I'll continue to work hard.

1450
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:46,910
I'd be so grateful if you cheered me on to the end.

1451
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:49,610
I'll work even harder. Thank you!

1452
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:53,740
Yes, contestant Kim Shi On, who tried his best to the end.

1453
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:56,470
We'll continue to root for you.

1454
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:15,250
MAKEMATE1, the ordinary boys' global idol debut project,

1455
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:20,730

1461
01:55:01,270 --> 01:55:08,750

(Official debut in January of 2025 confirmed!)

1465
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:39,800

Everyone in MA1, stand attention!

1473

Greet!

1474
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:19,630
Would you be my mate?
