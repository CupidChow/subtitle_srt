178
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,293
It just so happens that the Special C Mates for today

179
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:14,593
all became winners of audition programs.

180
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:15,493
- Yes.
 - That's right.

181
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:19,726
It must feel new to be coming on MA1 today.

182
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,826
How do you feel?

183
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:24,226
For me, I made my debut as IZ*ONE

184
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:26,526
through an audition program as well.

185
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:29,426
It feels very new to be on stage here

186
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:30,826
and I'm also very moved,

187
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:34,960
so I'll offer my support for the performances today.

188
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,160
...

189
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,826
Although I'm only 21 years old,

190
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:45,160
I look back on my life and wonder
whether I had ever possessed such tenacity.

191
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,426
So I'll watch MA1 today and return to my roots.

192
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:55,626
I'll also be an MC remembering when I first began.

193
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,593
Please offer some words of support.

194
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:02,060
Yes, I heard that some trainees came from Japan,

195
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,126
so I'll say something in Japanese.

196
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,693
[Wow, you must feel lucky]

197
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:13,293
Many things might get harder from now on,

198
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:16,826
but form a solidarity with the group members beside you

199
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,493
and fight on until the very end.

200
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,460
You can do it!

201
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,660

- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

204
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:31,426
So what factors will be evaluated for Round 1 today?

205
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:36,660
Naturally, singing and dancing skills are a given,

206
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,726
and we will also look for star power

207
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:44,360
and the members with more discernible charms.

208
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,926
Yes, our participants are good, everyone.

209
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,960

210
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:54,193

221
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,026

222
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:27,460

226
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:39,926
from one artist will be performed against one other.

227
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,893

228

Global idol debut project MA1

264
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,393
has a special system called the Mate Rule

265
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,060
in which the mates from the previous round

266
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,760
can become rivals for the current round.

267
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,193
The participants will be divided into two mate groups

268
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:44,726
of MATE A and MATE B for each evaluation round.

269
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:47,560
The mate groups will be divided into two teams

270
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,493
according to the individual ranks of the
participants of the leader's personal choices.

271
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:57,026
Through this, they will perform
as diverse member combinations.

The winning team and mate group of the round stage

273

will win their own benefit scores

274
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,720

the participants' individual rankings.

280

from one artist differently.

during the auditions too, right?

with the same artist's song,

302

the one with the higher score
will get winning team benefits,

303

and when the total score of all the team members

304
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,160
is higher than that of the opposing group,

305
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,493
they will win the Mate Group benefits.

won through the Mate Rule

At first, I felt a lot of pressure,

You were the leader although you're the youngest.
