687
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:11,264

1482

- That's right. 
 - Exactly.

1483

First of all,

1492
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:54,151
I feel bad about Noh Ki Hyun

1493
01:09:54,151 --> 01:09:57,018
because he did all the vocals by himself

1494
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:59,151
and that must have taken a lot of strength.

1495
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:01,951
Since he focused on the vocals so much,

1496
01:10:01,951 --> 01:10:04,451
it seemed like he couldn't show what he got.

1497
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:07,351
Looking at the overall balance,

1498
01:10:07,351 --> 01:10:11,784
I had to watch the performance in suspense.

1499

Ki Hyun took the risks and threw himself into the sea.

 - That's right.

1502
01:10:19,051 --> 01:10:23,718
The song's hard, but nobody could be the main vocalist.

1503

That happened when I was on a survival show.

1504

I wasn't in the main vocalist position,

1505
01:10:27,284 --> 01:10:30,451
but the situation in the team called for it.

1506
01:10:30,451 --> 01:10:34,251

SHINee A Group had better energy.

1594
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:24,818
Both groups were nervous,

1595
01:14:24,818 --> 01:14:27,751
but I could feel SHINee A Group's energy a bit more.

1596
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:31,185
- The existence of the main vocalist makes an impact. 
 - An enormous impact.
