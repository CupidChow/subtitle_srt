00:44:00,532 --> 00:44:02,432
Is that his Korean name?

896
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:03,898
Oh, it's Lin.

897
00:44:03,898 --> 00:44:05,532
[Lin's Korean name is Lim Han Jung]

898
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:08,200
[Call me Lim Han Jung today]

899
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,865
Hello, I'm Charming
Loverboy Player Han Yu Seop.

900
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:16,966
[Mate A Group backstage]
Yu Seop.

901
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:19,198
Yu Seop's looks are on point today.

902
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,565
Hello.

903
00:44:20,565 --> 00:44:26,798
I am Jealous Loverboy Player Takuma.

904
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:29,798
His eyes will change once
the performance begins.

905
00:44:29,798 --> 00:44:31,832
Oh!

906
00:44:31,832 --> 00:44:34,032
Oh, that's a good point.

907
00:44:34,032 --> 00:44:36,032
Takuma will be smiling now,

908
00:44:36,032 --> 00:44:39,532
but once the song begins, he'll change.

909
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:43,265
Hello, I am Thunderous
Loverboy Player Kim Hak Sung.

910
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:46,032
[Hak Sung is the best]

911
00:44:46,032 --> 00:44:49,998
Hello, I'm Tone Master
Loverboy Player Jo Min Jae.

912
00:44:49,998 --> 00:44:52,632
[Even while he's talking, his voice is sweet]

913
00:44:52,632 --> 00:44:56,998
Hello, I'm Mischievous
Loverboy Player Jeong Hyeon Uk.

914
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:03,032
He looks quite relaxed.

915
00:45:03,032 --> 00:45:05,498
Yes, he's always relaxed.

916
00:45:05,498 --> 00:45:08,398
Everyone on the team is a Loverboy.

917
00:45:08,398 --> 00:45:11,998
Is there a special reason
for being Loverboy Players?

918
00:45:11,998 --> 00:45:15,232
We want to repay the
love we got from the Mates,

919
00:45:15,232 --> 00:45:16,498
so that's why we decided on the name.

920
00:45:16,498 --> 00:45:18,298
[That's a good response]

921
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,698
[Love you]

922
00:45:19,698 --> 00:45:21,065
[We've been repaid]

923
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:24,798
Yes, and the concept of this team is

924
00:45:24,798 --> 00:45:28,098
a performance showcasing
the charisma of Korean music.

925
00:45:28,098 --> 00:45:31,898
The foreign participants
must have found that hard.

926
00:45:31,898 --> 00:45:34,198
[What happened to them?]

927
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,198
We all survived somehow.

928
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:38,765
What's our concept?

929
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:40,065
K-rock.

930
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:41,498
What's rock?

931
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:43,465
[Don't you know rock 'n' roll?]

932
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:45,432
- Rock.
- Is this just rock?

933
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:47,598
- It's rock.
- It's the character for "enjoyable."

934
00:45:47,598 --> 00:45:49,765
- Enjoyable "rak"?
- No, it's not.

935
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:51,499
[I didn't know that either]
Is it that "rak" then?

936
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,165
- Yes.
- Hak Sung.

937
00:45:53,165 --> 00:45:57,132
So that's why it's not "rock" in English but "rak."

938
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,498
I honestly thought it was this.

939
00:45:58,498 --> 00:46:00,332
It feels a bit like the Ganggangsulae dance.

940
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:03,032
The skilled members are
all in the opposing team.

941
00:46:03,032 --> 00:46:03,999
They have the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place members.

942
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:05,532
- Yes. They have Jang Hyun Joon.
- Jang Hyun Joon,

943
00:46:05,532 --> 00:46:06,832
Bing Fan, and Noh Ki Hyun.

944
00:46:06,832 --> 00:46:08,865
- The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place members.
- Right.

945
00:46:08,865 --> 00:46:10,965
Hey, they've got half of the Top 9.

946
00:46:10,965 --> 00:46:13,332
- Takuma, what's your ranking?
- I'm in 17th place.

947
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:14,665
What's your ranking, Hak Sung?

948
00:46:14,665 --> 00:46:16,165
I'm in 11th place.

949
00:46:16,165 --> 00:46:18,432
- What's your ranking?
- I'm in 20th place.

950
00:46:18,432 --> 00:46:21,098
[I have the lowest ranking here]

951
00:46:21,098 --> 00:46:23,298
- They are a strong bunch.
- They are very strong.

952
00:46:23,298 --> 00:46:27,533
But we've got Lin, who has the highest score
from the previous performance.

953
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:29,132
- That's right.
- Straighten your shoulders.

954
00:46:29,132 --> 00:46:30,432
There's no need to feel intimidated.

955
00:46:30,432 --> 00:46:32,732
Although we're not the
Top 3, we're in the Top 9.

956
00:46:32,732 --> 00:46:34,432
- What is your rank now, Min Jae?
- I'm in 6th place.

957
00:46:34,432 --> 00:46:35,565
- What is your ranking?
- I'm in 7th place.

958
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:37,965
- What is your ranking?
- I'm in 5th place.

959
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:39,832
- We're in 5th, 6th, and 7th place.
- We are.

960
00:46:39,832 --> 00:46:41,632
So it's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th.

961
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,798
So it's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
versus 5th, 6th, and 7th.

962
00:46:43,798 --> 00:46:44,832
That's a worthy match.

963
00:46:44,832 --> 00:46:46,965
There is an important notice to be made.

964
00:46:46,965 --> 00:46:47,972
- Yes?
- Yes?

965
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:51,166
- The Interim Check will be held tomorrow.
- Really?

966
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,365
[We're in trouble]

967
00:46:52,365 --> 00:46:55,032
- Did you say it's tomorrow?
- It's tomorrow.

968
00:46:55,032 --> 00:46:56,033
This is crazy.

969
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:57,598
We have to win.

970
00:46:57,598 --> 00:46:59,365
The benefits.

971
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:01,265
I've been thinking about this.

972
00:47:01,265 --> 00:47:03,298
In order to win,

973
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:05,532
we have to increase the lowest score.

974
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,165
Because the individual scores are totaled,

975
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:09,298
all six of our members must aim to get

976
00:47:09,298 --> 00:47:12,198
the perfect score of 800 points to win.

977
00:47:12,198 --> 00:47:15,532
Akuma Takuma must make a return this time.

978
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,698
Let's try this one by one.

979
00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:19,732
[The high-score project for
Team "Thunderous" begins]

980

[Takuma checks each member thoroughly]

981
00:47:28,865 --> 00:47:30,398
That's not it.

982
00:47:30,398 --> 00:47:32,332
You must do it like this.

983
00:47:33,032 --> 00:47:34,265
This part is in poor shape.

984
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:35,820
Who is in poor shape?

985
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,765
Hak Sung!

986
00:47:37,765 --> 00:47:38,856
It's me!

987

[Hak Sung chosen as the dance failure]

988

[Takuma gives Hak Sung a one-to-one lesson]

989
00:47:44,665 --> 00:47:46,265
Your knees should hurt.

990
00:47:46,265 --> 00:47:47,965
Let's do it again.

991

Hak Sung.

997
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:02,265
By working on Round 2,

998
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:06,298
I realized that it's not
enough that only I do well.

999
00:48:06,298 --> 00:48:10,832
I believe "Crooked" lost in Round 2

1000
00:48:10,832 --> 00:48:13,498
because the rankings of
Jang Hee and Do Ha were low.

1001

[Lost the Round 2 Solo
Match due to the lower scores]

[In the end, Team "RINGA LINGA" lost]

1003
00:48:26,098 --> 00:48:28,532
For Round 3,

1004
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:30,498
we must crush our parts individually.

1005
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:33,732
It felt that all of the members must do well,

1006
00:48:33,732 --> 00:48:38,198
so we practiced with the aim of

1007
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:42,398
offering advice and developing
our own highlight parts.

1008
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:45,165
Takuma, you did well today.

1009
00:48:45,165 --> 00:48:46,265
Give a big hand to Takuma.

1010

[Interim Check the next day]

What's the concept for Mate B Group?

1013
00:48:55,598 --> 00:48:57,165
It's K-rock.

1014
00:48:57,165 --> 00:48:58,832
What concept is K-rock?

1015
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:00,198
The enjoyment of Korea?

1016
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:03,198
With the Chinese letter "rak" for enjoyment.

1017
00:49:03,198 --> 00:49:05,598
Do you know about Korean enjoyment, Lin?

1018
00:49:05,598 --> 00:49:07,365
We're injecting the concept into him.

1019
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:08,698
Lin's father is Korean.

1020
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:10,648
Oh, that's why.
[Korean Name Lim Han Jung / Lin has Korean blood]

1021

How about Takuma?

1022
00:49:12,232 --> 00:49:14,198
We're injecting the concept into him.

[Interim Check begins in a warm atmosphere]

1024
00:49:15,756 --> 00:49:18,265
Let's see the performance first.

1025

[Performance that begins with seriousness]

1026
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:24,098
[Not bad]

1027
00:49:35,698 --> 00:49:39,465
[Powerful dance]

1028
00:49:53,832 --> 00:49:56,665
[Ending with impact]

1029
00:49:56,665 --> 00:49:59,132
[Wow, they're good]

1030
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:01,265
Did they really prepare that in only a day?

1031
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:06,098
Every member is so good that they
can make such an impact with the refrain.

1032
00:50:06,098 --> 00:50:08,265
- Weren't you surprised a bit?
- I was.

1033
00:50:08,265 --> 00:50:10,532
I think you did really well.

1034
00:50:10,532 --> 00:50:12,732
But right now, it's a bit...

1035
00:50:12,732 --> 00:50:14,232
It's lacking.

1036
00:50:14,232 --> 00:50:15,798
- Yes.
- Yes.

1037
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:20,398
When it comes to K-rock,
it's hard to break even.

1038
00:50:20,398 --> 00:50:22,365
When you're not good, you'll get criticized.

1039
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:25,798
You would have to do
better than the original song.

1040
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:27,732
There are no added flavors

1041
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:30,365
to your version of K-rock now.

1042
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:32,632
You have to approach it like a period drama.

1043
00:50:32,632 --> 00:50:35,132
You must write your own narrative.

1044
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,032
Think of yourselves as Confucian scholars.

1045
00:50:37,032 --> 00:50:39,598
Or think of yourselves as "Thunderous Talent."

1046
00:50:39,598 --> 00:50:44,032
Think about what concept to implement for it.

1047
00:50:44,032 --> 00:50:46,898
Just like he said, it's
like a Confucian scholar.

1048
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:49,348
You know how Confucian scholars walk

1049
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:51,798
with their hands behind their backs?

1050
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,165
They do this.

1051
00:50:53,165 --> 00:50:56,232
But right now, you're
all leaning forward a bit.

1052
00:50:56,232 --> 00:50:58,132
This is for hip-hop.

1053
00:50:58,132 --> 00:50:59,865
You're not like scholars,
but like hip-hop artists.

1054
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:02,598
I think you need to take that scholarly feel.

1055
00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:04,198
- By using gestures like this.
- That's right.

1056
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:06,332
As if saying "I have arrived"
or something like that.

1057
00:51:06,332 --> 00:51:09,432
You know how you can rent hanbok outfits

1058
00:51:09,432 --> 00:51:12,998
when you visit Gyeongbokgung
or the Folk Village.

1059
00:51:12,998 --> 00:51:14,098
It would be great if you
could do it in a hanbok.

1060
00:51:14,098 --> 00:51:15,898
Wear hanbok together

1061
00:51:15,898 --> 00:51:19,665
and go to a place like the Folk Village.

1062
00:51:19,665 --> 00:51:22,366
Walk with your hands behind your backs.
It's different.

1063
00:51:22,366 --> 00:51:24,598
And try dancing while wearing hanbok.

1064
00:51:24,598 --> 00:51:27,398
This isn't a simple matter of dancing well.

1065
00:51:27,398 --> 00:51:30,265
