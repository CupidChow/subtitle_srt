1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:09,220

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,080
 Married Woman Abducted, Demand for 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,650
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,940
 She killed Song Yu Min and disposed of the corpse without a trace.

5
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,290
 How can she look so calm?

6
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,520
 He left behind the thing that he should have burned first?

7
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,630
 I knew that my husband was secretly following me, and that he was after the money, also.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,060
 You're not scared of me, are you?

9
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,530
 I am more scared. Me!

10
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,460
 I won't go down alone. I will kill this piece of trash first.

11
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,620
 I told you don't do anything on your own!

12
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,790
 You really have nerves of steel, even coming to the exhibition of your abductor's artwork.

13
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,300
 What should I do?

14
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,220
 If it were me, I would ask him to die.

15
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,150
 How about we take the five billion won?

16
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,150
 Do you know where it is?

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,030
 Don't worry. Things will go according to plan.

18
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,360
 There is infinite happiness hidden in the black world of coffee.

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,720
 My husband said that.

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,360
 I need this money to do things according to my plan.

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,570
 A dead end at the edge of a cliff. The end of the line was not far away. It's right in front of my eyes.

22
00:01:53,050 --> 00:02:00,190
 Whatever the reason, not keeping a promise is unforgivable.

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,260
 It was not the princess's kiss that made the frog into a prince.

24
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,060
 The princess is disgusted by the frog, so she throws it to the ground.

25
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,230
 The frog must die in order to become the prince.

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,030
 Marriage is a type of a cruel fairytale, too.

27
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,460
 You thought you married a prince,

28
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,390
 but you come to realize that your husband is a frog.

29
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,910
Why did he die?

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,120
Why?

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,590
Honey, did you get the money?

32
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,890
This isn't the time for that. Song Yu Min...

33
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,800
he died. He is dead.

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,190
What? What happened?

35
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,400
Did... you do that?

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,530
No! No! He fell out of the window and I saw it.

37
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,990
No way.

38
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,270
- Excuse me.
 - Yes? Is something going on?

39
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,060
We wanted to ask you something.

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,830
There was an incident nearby so we're gathering information.

41
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,200
- An incident?
 - Yes, a man fell from a nearby motel and died.

42
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,690
- Was it suicide?
 - For now,

43
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,320
it's hard to say that for sure. But have you seen anything?

44
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,100
No, nothing in particular.

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,590
Thank you for your cooperation.

46
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,490
Wait, hold on!

47
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,760
I was thinking that I saw you somewhere. Aren't you the husband of that woman who was abducted?

48
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,310
- You are mistaken.
 - I'm sure I've seen you before.

49
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,020
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

50
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,680
Wait a minute, sir, please!

51
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,870
Sir.

52
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,860
I think Song Yu Min was renting that room.

53
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,360
Detective,

54
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,030
I saw Kim Yun Cheol in the parking lot.

55
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,890
Seonbae, Kim Yun Cheol was in a nearby parking lot, he said.

56
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,400
- Are you sure?
 - I confirmed it with his car license plate number.

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,630
Kim Yun Cheol, you don't think...

58
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,170
Everyone listen up. CCTV around this area, fingerprints, footprints, hair,

59
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,530
make sure to scrape every last thing that may involve Kim Yun Cheol.

60
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,460
This makes it look like I killed him.

61
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Why did Song Yu Min die?

62
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,900
Did he commit suicide? If not...

63
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,790
No way, my wife? Did my wife plan this, too?

64
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,760
She knew I was planning to take the money, and she wanted to let me know she knew?

65
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,100
This could have all been part of her plan all along.

66
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,020
 Old Crop

67
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,240
 I think I made an enemy out of the last person whom I should make into an enemy.

68
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,860
 Episode 7
 Perfect Wife

69
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,010
Omo,

70
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,720
what brings you here at this early hour?

71
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,810
I wake up so early now because I've gotten old.

72
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,970
Since I was awake, I thought I'd get a free cup of morning coffee from Brother-in-law.

73
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,380
Ah, Yun Cheol isn't here, yet. If it's alright, let me make it for you.

74
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,620
Oh, I'd be grateful. But Jae Gyeong, you're at the restaurant by yourself so early?

75
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,520
I am learning how the restaurant works so I can be helpful. So I came early to get things ready.

76
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,210
Ah, yes.

77
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,800
 Gentleman Capital

78
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,040
Let's see... it's already been two years since this restaurant opened, huh?

79
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,990
I know, right? Time sure flies, doesn't it?

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,820
Oh, it's done?

81
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,340
Thank you.

82
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,090
- It tastes great, indeed.
 - I'm glad to hear it.

83
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,060
Have you had breakfast?

84
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,550
Breakfast? When I live alone?

85
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,690
How are you doing living alone?

86
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,360
It can be comfortable, but also uncomfortable, of course.

87
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,610
How about you? Are you two getting along?

88
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,490
It can be comfortable, but also uncomfortable.

89
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,080
Let's see,

90
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,570
how many years has it been since you two married?

91
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,420
Six years.

92
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,210
Six years. It's about time you're both very uncomfortable, huh?

93
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,120
Is that right?

94
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,980
I'm actually feeling more comfortable, lately.

95
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:15,130
Hold on just a moment. Let me whip up at least a simple snack for you.

96
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,640
Hello.

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,070
Yes, welcome.

98
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,480
- Your husband?
 - He is probably at home. I came here a bit early today.

99
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,010
We meet again, Seonbae.

100
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,110
Want to share a cup of morning coffee?

101
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,700
I'm not in the mood. I will take a look inside.

102
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,260
What? Why?

103
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,780
Um, has anything happened?

104
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,100
Song Yu Min has died.

105
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,910
What? Why?

106
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,270
It appears he fell from the window of a room he was staying in.

107
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,040
Then did he commit suicide?

108
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,800
We don't know that yet.

109
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,630
It could be homicide.

110
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,420
Please stop being interested. I don't think it concerns you.

111
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,040
But it involves my family, how could it not concern me?

112
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,950
Just because I got divorced, does that end the affections that have accumulated?

113
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,560
There was something suspicious, so I came here to confirm.

114
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,350
Someone saw Kim Yun Cheol near the site of the death.

115
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,950
What?

116
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,610
Seonbae.

117
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,000
He's not here.

118
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,430
I sent an investigator to your home, too, and he's not there, and he's not here.

119
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,260
Is there anywhere else Kim Yun Cheol is likely to go to?

120
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm not sure.

121
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,530
If he should contact you, please give us a call right away.

122
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,070
- Yes.
 - Sorry for the intrusion.

123
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,900
Something is off. Let me check it out too.

124
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,130
Yes.

125
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,600
I'll have breakfast after.

126
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,630
I found out that he and Kim Yun Cheol's sister got divorced a few years ago.

127
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,410
Usually, he wouldn't care about his divorced wife, right?

128
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,640
There's only one reason he would be snooping around here. He smelled money.

129
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,300
He hopes to somehow get a rake-off.

130
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,030
He does other side jobs beside his pawnshop.

131
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,930
Does a pooping dog stop pooping?  He will do anything for money.

132
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,620
He didn't have enough money to even gamble on screen, so he stole confiscated items.

133
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,020
I can't believe he was a detective.  Seriously.

134
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,000
What is this?  Where are the coffee beans?  
 Delivery Expected: 7/9/2020
 7:00 AM

135
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,370
Darling, didn't you follow her?

136
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,920
She wasn't there.

137
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,460
She really wasn't? She might have been tracking her accomplice to catch him.

138
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,600
I said she wasn't there.

139
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,640
What happened to him, Song Yu Min?

140
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,060
It would be nice if I were joking.

141
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,720
Driving me crazy, really!

142
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,150
But why did you run away?  It makes you look more suspicious.

143
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:47,730
Yeah, I know.  But, at the moment, I didn't know what to do.

144
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,270
Calm down.  What are you going to do now?

145
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,360
Let me think about that.

146
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,130
I think I should let it all out.

147
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,900
What?  Tell the police everything?

148
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,060
My wife and that bastard conspired to do the kidnapping,

149
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,850
the two had a conflict over the five billion,

150
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,990
she killed Song Yu Min

151
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,590
and you made me a criminal!

152
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,220
- Do you have any evidence? 
  - Evidence? Evidence.

153
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,570
Who will the police believe if she says she doesn't know?

154
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Look. Yun Cheol, can you defeat your wife?

155
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,350
Honestly speaking, you went to the motel to steal the money, didn't you?  You did.

156
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,350
She will say you killed him while fighting over the money.

157
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,580
What should I do?

158
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,220
Is anybody home?

159
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,800
Miss Jin Seon Mi, we're coming in.

160
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,570
Jin Seon Mi, are you there?

161
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,700
- What has happened that you are here so early— 
 - I'm looking for Kim Yun Cheol.

162
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,650
Let me take a look inside.  This is a warrant.

163
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,200
-  Wait a moment. 
 - Excuse me.

164
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,630
When was the last time you talked to Kim Yun Cheol?

165
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,900
- I'm not in contact with him. 
 - Really?

166
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,090
I'm just a girlfriend he dumped.

167
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,460
I got a court warrant to examine Kim Yeon Cheol's communication records.

168
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,780
The records will say whether or not what you are saying is right or wrong.

169
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,840
When something happens to Kim Yun Cheol,

170
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,360
whom will he reach out for first, you or his wife?

171
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,260
I think it will be you.

172
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,970
What do you mean?

173
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,340
That's a compliment.

174
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,750
Really, because of that Sim Jae Gyeong!

175
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,000
Did you go and completely forget?

176
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,010
You're such a high maintenance person.

177
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,500
H-How are you here?

178
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,420
An anti-theft GPS is basic.

179
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,620
Wait a sec.  This is ... isn't this near the woman's house?

180
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,560
Are you still seeing her?

181
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,190
I think it would be better to rely on me than her.

182
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,150
Why are you someone I should believe and trust?

183
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,530
Because it's easier to trust me. Why do you keep going on the difficult path?

184
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,400
First, let's get rid of the car.  The police aren't dummies either.

185
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,690
Here, get out.

186
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,660
Hurry up.

187
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,750
Drink.

188
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,180
It's been a long time since we went on a date.

189
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,950
In the old days, you would order a cup of coffee and talk all day.

190
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,270
Here's your coffee.

191
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,420
Thank you.

192
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,010
I want to hear what you used to say.

193
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,930
Do you remember?  What you used to say to me?

194
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,510
"A perfect woman like you is too good for someone like me."

195
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,130
Cut that out!  I'm being chased by the police.

196
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,520
How did you know where Yu Min lived?

197
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,560
Why did you go find him? Were you following him?

198
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,980
Did you two plan it? To steal the five billion?

199
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,770
Did you kill him while the two of you fought over the money?

200
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,090
No.  It's not me.

201
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,230
It's not.

202
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,830
I believe you. You don't have the guts.

203
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,840
You have the guts.

204
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,890
Sim Jae Gyeong, you know you're the one who killed him.

205
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,960
Ridiculous.

206
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,370
That was the goal from the start. You were planning to make me a killer, right?

207
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,000
- After such a long time, do you want to ruin our date? 
 -  Stop kidding and be honest.

208
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,550
You did it, didn't you?

209
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,100
If it were me, it would have been different.

210
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,220
I would have done it perfectly, so unless someone knew,

211
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,290
it would be hard to find a clue.

212
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,560
No.  It's been done in order to make me the culprit.

213
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,620
You are pathetic.  Why would I make you the culprit?

214
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:47,920
If you were thinking about it, you would have put to good use a knife covered with fingerprints,

215
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
for example, like this!

216
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
What are you going to  do now? Are you insane?

217
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:58,450
There would be concrete evidence and the police would walk in and catch you red-handed.

218
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,140
They asked me to let them know when I saw you.

219
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,290
They have probably already surrounded you.

220
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,630
Did you report me?

221
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,000
It's for your sake.

222
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,180
Welcome.

223
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,490
It's okay.  If you remain silent until 4 o'clock, you will be proven innocent.

224
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,000
- What do you mean? 
 - Trust me. I'll rescue you. Give me the knife.

225
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,030
Mr. Kim Yun Cheol.

226
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,620
We finally meet.

227
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,990
Honey.

228
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,130
Let's go.

229
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,650
Are you okay?

230
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,800
Thank you.  I am a lot better.

231
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,300
From now on, don't work overtime.  You're in bad shape immediately after.

232
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:24,000
 ... suspect Song Yu Min was found dead this morning at a motel on Jongno 5-ga.

233
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,120
  At the scene of the incident there was a painting, apparently painted by Mr. Song, and a knife,

234
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,260
and the police are considering both the possibility of murder and suicide.

235
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,630
Why did you turn it off?

236
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,850
Because I keep on becoming upset.

237
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,900
I'm sorry that I haven't paid your salary yet for last month.

238
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,350
Can you wait a little longer?

239
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,710
Okay.

240
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Let me ask you just one question.

241
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,940
This morning, why were you near

242
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,800
where Song Yu Min's body was found ?

243
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,990
It's quite ...

244
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,740
So ...

245
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,820
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

246
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,640
Is it true that the president was taken to the police station?

247
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,940
He just was accompanied there as a reference witness.  He will be back very soon.

248
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,200
Will our restaurant be okay? His image keeps appearing.

249
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,950
It will be fine.  Just do your work as usual.

250
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,460
We will. We should try harder at times like this.

251
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Could you prepare  a special dish before dinner?

252
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,720
You're very taciturn today. Well, there's no rush

253
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,800
because the evidence will wait.

254
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,970
To be honest, I was rooting for you.

255
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,820
I was sorry that I suspected you initially.

256
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,780
But this isn't right.  Money is the most important thing till the end.

257
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,930
 What did she mean that by 4 o'clock my innocence will be proven?

258
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,670
 Can I really trust my wife?

259
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:20,010
This is a video from a CCTV outside a convenience store in the vicinity of where Song Yu Min's body was found.

260
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,580
That's you, right?

261
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,400
I think you were very upset. It seems you're running away.

262
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,470
It's correct that's me.

263
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,230
It's because I was shocked to see the scene of the accident.

264
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,700
Could it be ... also ... that was a coincidence?

265
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,700
A morning drama coincidence? Was running away also a coincidence?

266
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,740
What do you mean by "running away"?

267
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,320
Wasn't it a suicide?

268
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,250
It was murder.

269
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,810
There was a knife near his body.

270
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:06,350
Song Min Yu's fingerprints are on the handle.

271
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,960
He probably jumped holding on to the knife.

272
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,530
Would a suicidal person jump holding onto a knife?

273
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,340
♫  Because you who are wandering in the endlessly dark night  ♫

274
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,700
♫  have put yourself in my hand  ♫

275
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,190
♫  Even if you try to run away you will circle  ♫

276
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,320
♫  inside my desolate maze without any opening  ♫

277
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,120
♫  Who’ll ever gonna get you out?  ♫

278
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,640
♫  You better move. Run.  ♫

279
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,000
  4F Interrogation Room

280
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,390
Detective Seo.

281
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,390
All right.

282
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,620
You're wondering how much we know, right?

283
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,980
- Jeez! What are you doing? 
 - Young lady ...

284
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,760
Let go of me.

285
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,170
Hurry.

286
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,180
- Jin Seon Mi. 
 - What are you doing now?

287
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,900
Let her go!

288
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,210
Detective. I've come to save Kim Yun Cheol.

289
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,590
Wasn't your relationship that you neatly dumped each other?

290
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:03,190
Actually, we were supposed to meet at a nearby love hotel this morning.

291
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,570
We are still seeing each other.

292
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,040
Yun Cheol ran away to hide that fact.

293
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,230
He had nothing to do with the death of Song Yu Min.

294
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,140
It wasn't nearby was it?  It was the same motel.

295
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,020
I verified it in a video from a CCTV at the motel Song Yu Min stayed at.

296
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,740
I obtained a statement from  a member of the cleaning crew.

297
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,270
How would you explain that?

298
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,170
I ...

299
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,690
I felt sorry for him. He was like me.

300
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,880
After meeting him,  I wanted to persuade him to turn himself in.

301
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,940
But I coudn't meet him. Really.

302
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,770
I wanted to meet him.

303
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:53,070
Then, I could have prevented the ultimate choice.

304
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,440
If you continue to lie like that,

305
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,340
you will be liable as an accomplice or for criminal concealment.

306
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,590
Yun Cheol is innocent.

307
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,320
He was afraid I would be in danger. I told you we went together.

308
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,610
Are you really here for the sake of Kim Yun Cheol?

309
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,320
You must have come for yourself.

310
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,520
You thought it would be better to say it before you are discovered

311
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,490
seeing Kim Yun Cheol through our review of his phone records. You're very intelligent.

312
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,630
It's a compliment.

313
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,980
We're talking first in there.  Make yourself comfortable at home.

314
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,380
Your turn is next.

315
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,650
Is it Jin Seon Mi?

316
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:31,450
I'm the attorney representing Sim Jae Gyeong. Nice to meet you.

317
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,260
You're getting this as a favor from Sim Jae Gyeong.

318
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,450
You're going to need it.

319
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,360
What is this?

320
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,370
It's severance pay.

321
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,690
On condition that you never approach Kim Yun Cheol again.

322
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,920
The amount should be satisfactory.

323
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,640
Excuse me, I'll leave first.

324
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,470
Fine. Let's see where this leads.

325
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,170
Excuse me.

326
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,030
Thank you for your hard work.

327
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,090
I am Kim Yun Cheol's wife, Sim Jae Gyeong.

328
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:41,840
Could I please see my husband?

329
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,500
This was voluntary, wasn't it?

330
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,560
My client doesn't want to listen anymore. Right, Mr. Kim Yun Cheol?

331
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,080
Oh, yes.

332
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,730
Please release Kim Yun Cheol immediately.

333
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,860
Is this ... ?  What about waiting until 4:00?

334
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,770
I understand.

335
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,980
- Chief Seo. 
 - Inspector Seo.  That's enough.

336
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,440
 Somehow, I am escaping.

337
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,290
Kim Yun Cheol,  thank you for giving so much time.

338
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,570
Detective Seo.

339
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,780
There, shall we return?

340
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,710
Wait a minute.

341
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,340
Kim Yun Cheol's blood was discovered

342
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,700
on the tip of the knife found at the scene.

343
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,280
 DNA Examination Results
  Sample 1: Kim Yun Cheol; Sample 2: Crime scene evidence

344
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,720
"Song Yu Min's fingerprints were on the knife handle."

345
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,660
It's conclusive evidence that the two people met.

346
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,080
I would like to request an arrest warrant.

347
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,030
No, no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

348
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,580
I am to blame.

349
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,640
It was all my fault.

350
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,470
I will tell... the truth about everything.

351
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,400
Jae Gyeong.

352
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,560
What are you talking about?

353
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,890
That guy attacked my husband in the garage.

354
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:42,290
Since he was driven to the edge, he said that he would kill my husband and then himself.

355
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,430
Wait a minute.

356
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,450
Are you saying that the kidnapper was Song Yu Min?

357
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,970
He said that himself.

358
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,970
The blood on the knife was from the fight that day.

359
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:57,720
My husband almost died because of that man.

360
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,680
You expect us to believe that?

361
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,460
I was in a state of panic, so I hit his head with this.

362
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,840
And he stole our car's spare key to sneak in and attack us.

363
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,420
I'm submitting these as evidence.

364
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,480
Isn't this enough evidence?

365
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,810
We will hold on to these.

366
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,700
Why... why didn't you report this to the police?

367
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,870
I suggested that he turn himself in

368
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,020
because that was the best thing for him.

369
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,930
He asked for time to think.

370
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,670
I was waiting for him to turn himself in.

371
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,460
How could this happen?

372
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,240
Then Kim Yun Cheol, what were you doing near the scene of the incident?

373
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,980
Yes, I was...

374
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,800
- I was— 
 - I had a bad feeling.

375
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,770
It seemed like that man would cause trouble somehow,

376
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,060
so I said that I was going to meet him because I was worried.

377
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,150
My husband went to meet with him instead because it was dangerous.

378
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,140
Yes, how could I not run away in shock?

379
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,630
When the person I went to meet was dead?

380
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,900
But then... why didn't you tell the truth from the beginning?

381
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,410
- The thing is— 
- Honey!

382
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,870
Just tell the truth and tell them you were trying to protect me.

383
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,500
On the day he was attacked, my husband thought we should tell the police right away.

384
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,280
If not, there was a risk of committing the crime of hiding a criminal.

385
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,710
In order to prevent me from being accused of a crime for protecting my hoobae,

386
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,320
he didn't say anything until the end.

387
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,210
Honey.

388
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,690
I'm sorry.

389
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,540
No, it's alright.

390
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,410
Fine.  I understand why your husband was at that place,

391
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,690
however, that isn't evidence that he didn't kill Song Yu Min.

392
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,910
It's possible that his talk with Song Yu Min didn't go well, so at the end of a long argument,

393
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:22,080
an accidental homicide is possible.

394
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,000
My husband is not the kind of person who would do that even by mistake.

395
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,650
Seonbae.

396
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,070
This was delivered to the investigation headquarters.

397
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,820
 N31

398
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,160
To all of you who are investigating,

399
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,420
please deliver this letter to Sim Jae Gyeong.

400
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,520
This is Song Yu Min.

401
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,750
 Sunbae Jae Gyeong,

402
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:24,490
 Since the day I drew you, sixteen years ago,

403
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,080
 I admired you.

404
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,010
 I wanted to be with you.

405
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,850
 If I falsely accused your cheating husband of a crime,

406
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,320
 I thought you would come back to me.  
♫   I see   ♫

407
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,500
 That's what I believed.  
♫   And trust only you   ♫

408
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:46,210
 However, when I saw how happy you looked on the day you left the hospital,  
♫   There was a time like that   ♫

409
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,700
 my dream of being with you collapsed.

410
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,970
 But I couldn't give up.

411
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,820
 If only that bastard would die,  
♫   Joining you was enough   ♫

412
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,670
 Then I thought that you could be free.  
♫   In a love   ♫

413
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,750
 I found out that your thoughts were different from mine.  
♫   Which would last forever   ♫

414
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:12,930
♫  now, everything  ♫

415
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,040
 Now...

416
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,550
 everything has lost its meaning.

417
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,680
 What I wanted wasn't money. 
♫   It was just   ♫

418
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,760
 I also burned all of the five billion won.  
♫   Your plausible excuse.   ♫

419
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,250
 Along with the money that made you miserable, 
♫   It's a nice wish   ♫

420
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,770
 From this world, I will...  
♫   My flower   ♫

421
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,870
 ... disappear. 
♫   Is falling   ♫

422
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,940
 If possible,  
♫   In your laughter   ♫

423
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,440
 Please cremate me with the portrait I drew of you, Seonbae.
 ♫  Forever   ♫

424
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,600
 Thank you, and I'm sorry.

425
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,410
With this, your charges against Kim Yun Cheol have all disappeared.

426
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,420
There's no doubt that Song Yu Min committed suicide.

427
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,060
We can assume that the kidnapping case has been solved as well, right?

428
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,700
 Expected delivery date and time: 7/11/2020, 4:00 PM

429
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,050
 Yun Cheol, if you can stay silent until 4 o'clock,

430
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,010
 your innocence will be proven.

431
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,060
 Was this your hidden card?

432
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,280
 You really are perfect, Sim Jae Gyeong.

433
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,780
- Kim Yun Cheol is here!
 - He's here.

434
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,720
- Kim Yun Cheol, any progress on the case?
 - Why have you been summoned by the police?

435
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,150
How are you involved with the suspect Song Yu Min's death?

436
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,630
- I'm sorry. 
- I'm sorry.

437
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,690
Please refer to the police announcement for full details.

438
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:21,270
Kim Yun Cheol, I have one more question.

439
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:25,040
Kim Yun Cheol, please speak to us.

440
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,280
How are you related to his death?

441
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,510
Sunbae.

442
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,860
There is a high possibility that the handwriting will match Song Yu Min's.

443
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,940
What's going to happen?

444
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,070
We will have to re-do the puzzle. I can't see the picture.

445
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,170
There was something I missed.

446
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,070
What?

447
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,740
The fact that they're still a married couple.

448
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,670
I will start the briefing.

449
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,910
After abducting Sim Jae Gyeong and demanding a large amount of money,

450
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,370
the kidnapping suspect, Song Yu Min,

451
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,880
took a leap to his death this morning, and has died.

452
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,840
We, the police have concluded that Song Yu Min was the sole culprit,

453
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,750
and are planning to close the investigation.

454
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,150
She came out.

455
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,540
- Did you hear the police announcement? 
- How do you feel right now?

456
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,100
All of you...

457
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,560
By chance, are you hungry?

458
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,790
The pizza is here.

459
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,560
- Is the food to your taste?
 - Yes, and we were hungry.

460
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,890
You must have been hungrier since you have to work hard because of us.

461
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,090
If you need anything else, just let me know.

462
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,620
We need to give Madam a second look. Her idea is daebak.

463
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,070
There will be automatic publicity for the restaurant.

464
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,940
Try it while it's warm.

465
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,700
I'm sorry.

466
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,720
I did something I shouldn't have done.

467
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,420
The kindness that the boss showed me,

468
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,620
I interpreted the way I wanted to and crossed the line.

469
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,700
As another woman,

470
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,300
I committed an unforgivable sin towards you.

471
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,990
I wanted to apologize in person.

472
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,950
I take responsibility for all of it.

473
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm sorry.

474
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,010
Please forgive me.

475
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,660
I want to continue to work here.

476
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,520
I will work harder than anyone else to repay you for my sins.

477
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,400
You can curse at me.

478
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,850
I will take all your criticism and work hard.

479
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,910
Please,

480
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,790
Could you...

481
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,900
let me work here again?  I beg you.

482
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,610
What are you doing?  Get up.

483
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,290
Anyone can make a mistake.

484
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:58,410
We can start again from the beginning.

485
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,460
Even in the future, please take good care of our restaurant.

486
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,360
Thank you.  Thank you.

487
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,400
Wow.  That's amazing.

488
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,600
Applause!

489
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,080
 I knew you would say that.

490
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,100
Meat is all about timing.

491
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,390
You need to know the time when it's most delicious.

492
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,180
Eat up.

493
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,260
- I will eat well, Sunbae. 
- Okay.

494
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,660
Eat up.  Here.

495
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,370
Investigating is timing also.

496
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,910
Relax, kid.  I'm just buying a meal for my hoobae.

497
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,510
This is just a person to person interaction, okay?

498
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,280
Go on.

499
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,870
From the police perspective, it would be best to blame Kim Yun Cheol, huh?

500
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:18,690
An unknown artist joined the adulterous husband to abduct the wife and get a ransom.

501
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,350
While dividing the money, there was a disagreement.

502
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,150
And Kim Yun Cheol got rid of Song Yu Min.

503
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,250
He appeared voluntarily at the police station.

504
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,330
But then get evidence and get a warrant.

505
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,530
He is my ex-wife's little brother.

506
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,400
So I just can't stand by and watch.

507
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,160
Should I get more food or not?

508
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,110
Thank you for the food.

509
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,510
Sit down.  Sit down.  Sheesh.

510
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,730
Oh, come on.

511
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,790
Ahjumma,

512
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:07,030
I'd like two more orders of ribeye!

513
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,700
My insides are burning up.

514
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,020
Excuse me?

515
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,120
The meat is burning.

516
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,770
So was there nothing special?

517
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,310
The cooler.

518
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,610
The cooler?

519
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,670
There was something strange inside.

520
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,530
What, was there charcoal briquets in the cooler?

521
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,690
There were coffee beans.

522
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,160
Coffee beans?

523
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,040
Coffee b-

524
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,490
 Delivery to: Old Crop Restaurant

525
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,370
This was sent from our store.

526
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:11,220
Do you remember who bought it?

527
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,860
Why would you ask something like that?

528
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,720
I asked at the restaurant, and nobody knows.

529
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,240
Look, all sales are final, okay?

530
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,550
Of course. I need to know who sent it so that I can thank them.

531
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,480
It was a man, and he looked like he was in his thirties.

532
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,960
He didn't have any special features?

533
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,460
I thought he was the cook at that restaurant.

534
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,150
- The cook?
 - Yes.

535
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,150
Well, he was pulling around that cooler, so I thought he was food shopping,

536
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,890
and that he must be ordering coffee beans as well.

537
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,200
- A cooler?
 - Yes.

538
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,090
 Old Crop Restaurant

539
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,650
Should we go home?

540
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,810
You're not going to ask me?

541
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:54,830
How I knew that the suicide letter was going to arrive at 4 o'clock?

542
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,350
It's fine, since I trust you.

543
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:07,660
So you trust me now.

544
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,900
Now that I think about it, I've only gotten help from you.

545
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:27,170
Truthfully, I'm thankful to you for that day.

546
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:33,700
Actually, I met Yu Min last night.

547
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,970
Don't say any more.

548
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,460
Listen until the end.

549
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:43,390
I asked Yu Min for a favor.

550
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,370
That he leave a suicide note, and...

551
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:55,560
hide somewhere as if he committed suicide.

552
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,870
You really didn't kill him?

553
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,070
I didn't do it.

554
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:13,120
Then... Song Yu Min really committed suicide?

555
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:23,110
The money.  What happened to the money?  Is it really gone?

556
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:31,650
What he wrote in the suicide note is probably the truth.

557
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,890
If you're worried about money, don't worry.

558
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:44,160
It's not a lot, but I have some saved up.

559
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,800
We can probably take care of the most urgent of your debts.

560
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,620
You need to protect the restaurant.

561
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,000
 Bank Book

562
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:16,190
I really didn't think he would end up like that.

563
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,230
Let's go home.

564
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:39,770
Let's go eat, wash up, brush our teeth, and go to sleep together.

565
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,490
Those are the things that make a married couple.

566
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,030
Honey.

567
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,660
You didn't do anything wrong.  You did your best.

568
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:58,350
You... you're a good wife.

569
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:44,130
 Old Crop __.17.05

570
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,160
 Seonbae?

571
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,920
 Song Yu Min?

572
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:47,690
 Don't suffer on your own and tell me everything.

573
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,400
 If I can help, I'll do anything I can.

574
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,070
 I will make sure to protect you, Seonbae.

575
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:07,000
 Seonbae, you are more important to me than art.

576
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,480
Would you die?

577
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,630
Could you die for me?

578
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,640
Leave behind a suicide note, and go somewhere

579
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,090
and live quietly, as if you'd committed suicide.

580
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,030
If I did that, would you come to me?

581
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,360
I wish that you weren't someone's wife

582
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,090
and that you'd just be a happy person.

583
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,880
Honey?

584
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,990
 I will begin a new start today.

585
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:41,640
 The early bird drinks the morning coffee, they say.

586
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,450
 I am off to do a diligent day's work.

587
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,890
 I remembered that feeling from yesterday.

588
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,310
 My heart fluttered for the first time in a long time.

589
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,230
 Indeed, my wife is first class.

590
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,890
 What year were these beans purchased?

591
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,830
 She was... almost perfect.

592
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,210
 Indeed, my wife is first class.

593
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:54,610
 She was... almost perfect.

594
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:59,270
 The Old Crop coffee bean which must be cared for by observing the temperature and humidity carefully

595
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:02,020
 should have been in the bag.

596
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:14,460
 If even one bean was out of the bag,

597
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,990
 it meant that someone opened the bag before it had ripened.

598
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:27,030
 It was strange that the cooler was full of coffee beans instead of money.

599
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:31,630
 So I thought that the money and the beans were exchanged at the market.

600
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,170
 Someplace where no one would open the bag.

601
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:42,890
 Right here. This was very like my wife.

602
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:07,060
 Yes, let's say that this money is the price to be paid

603
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,750
 for having opened memories that shouldn't have been opened.

604
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:31,610
 If the money is here, that means the suicide note that he burned the money was not true.

605
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,840
 Then Song Yu Min didn't commit suicide.

606
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,720
He was murdered?

607
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,890
 My wife really was a scary person.

608
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:43,390
 But who cares? I won't be seeing her face ever again.

609
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,780
 The reason I loved the bittersweet taste of coffee

610
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:03,830
 was because I was sick of all the grease that had I smelled since I was young.

611
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,890
 - How many?
 - Two fried chickens, please.

612
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,380
 Ah, yes.

613
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,530
 Hey.

614
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:14,400
 What are you doing, not helping? Hurry and wrap those up.

615
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:22,270
 Even if I ate only one meal, I wanted it to be a proper meal.

616
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,020
 How to choose coffee beans.

617
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,960
 Even if I drank only one cup, to drink it elegantly.

618
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:48,360
 I became a chef, but the food I prepared was only put on the table of those who had money.

619
00:58:53,740 --> 00:59:00,290
 I was still hungry, so I had to climb higher.

620
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:10,390
 This was my last ladder.

621
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,630
 Wife

622
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,690
Good morning.

623
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,610
I just received a postcard in our mailbox.

624
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:35,930
 Postcard?

625
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,090
It's from Song Yu Min.

626
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,420
There is a new cell phone number on it.

627
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,350
He was trying to tell me.

628
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:48,030
What are you saying?

629
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:52,720
It means Yu Min never intended to commit suicide.

630
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,810
Yes, it's not like there are just a few bizarre things about any of this.

631
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:01,510
 Starting from why the knife that fell in our garage ended up there... ?

632
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:06,460
He was killed by someone. I'm sure of it.

633
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,580
 But you know well who that killer is.

634
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,560
 The person who had to become a suspect so that you could save me.

635
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,420
Then you shouldn't be calling me. You should be calling the police.

636
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,320
I'm worried about you, that's why.

637
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,530
You're not worried about something else instead?

638
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,430
Please be careful, Yun Cheol.

639
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,760
Yes, alright, alright.

640
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,450
There is an enemy that we don't know about.

641
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:32,800
I understand. Sure thing.

642
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,730
You're making me laugh. You're the one I have to be careful of you.

643
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:43,450
Rather than trust you, I will trust in this money.

644
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,370
♫  We are traveling on the same train  ♫

645
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,210
 Why are you calling me so early?

646
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,670
Five billion won! It's in my hands now.

647
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:01,910
Five billion won!!

648
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:05,230
I found it in the coffee storage room.

649
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:08,320
We will take this money and run away together.

650
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,410
Got it?

651
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,410
 Honey? Honey, what's wrong? Hello?

652
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:32,020

653
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,190
♫  Your bickering every day is wearing me out. Damn  ♫

654
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:40,650
♫  The game is boring.  ♫

655
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:44,640
♫  After a long night, in front of me was  ♫

656
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,620
♫  another boring scene.   ♫

657
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:51,050
♫  I giddily think whether I have it or not  ♫

658
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:54,730
♫  Your eyes shine differently from the start, you are shaking again  ♫

659
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,520
♫  Oh Love me like you do  ♫

660
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,820
♫  We are a wall which has lost the way  ♫

661
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,790
♫  Tell me what you want now  ♫

662
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:02,350
♫  Tell me what you want now  ♫

663
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,660
 My Dangerous Wife
 Preview

664
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:12,110
 A tooth for a tooth. Poison for poison. I will use the poison that was going to kill me to recover my five billion won.

665
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,730
 If we get caught, we don't know what she will do.

666
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:19,390
 Your wife is certainly beyond my expectations.

667
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,950
 My daughter Chae Rim!

668
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,520
 Chae Rim has been kidnapped.

669
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,230
 No! Don't go.

670
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:26,970
 It was you who killed Song Yu Min, right?

671
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:33,260
 Those who took what is precious to me must be mercilessly eliminated.

672
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,370
♫  Our crazy relationship is really weird like a psycho  ♫

673
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:39,490
♫  Struggling you try to read my face  ♫

674
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:42,610
♫  Tingling Tingling you hope.   ♫
