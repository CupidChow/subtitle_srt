1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,460

2
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,100
 My Dangerous Wife

3
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,480
 Will you, Kim Yun Cheol, love the bride, Sim Jae Gyeong,

4
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,290
 in sickness and in health until the last moment?

5
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,990
 Yes, I will love her!

6
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,620
 Will you, the bride Sim Jae Gyeong, love your groom, Kim Yun Cheol,

7
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,790
 until the last moment?

8
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,160
 Yes.

9
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,340
 Knowing that it can't last forever, we promise love will never change.

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,110
 Groom put the ring on the bride's finger.

11
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,760
 There are only two way to keep the marriage vows:

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,480
 either increase the time span of love

13
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,230
 or reduce the life span of the other person.

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,590
 Bride and groom, seal the vows with a kiss.

15
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,090
 Therefore, we pronounce Kim Yun Cheol, the groom, and Sim Jae Gyeog, the bride,

16
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,500
 a lawfully wedded couple.

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,290
 Episode 1 
 The Wife I Want to Kill

18
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,090
 Kim Yun Cheol
 President, Old Crop Restaurant

19
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,070
You're already up? I was going to fix breakfast today.

20
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,160
 Sim Jae Gyeong, Kim Yun Cheol's Wife

21
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,200
I just made plain pine nut porridge. Is that okay?

22
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,500
Yes, good.  I'll do the rest.

23
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,710
- Then, should I get some water kimchi? 
 - Okay.

24
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,760
Eat it while it's warm. When it's cool, it gets watery.

25
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,920
It's Gapyeong yellow pine nut, which is both high in lecithin and good for your circulation.

26
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,460
How it it?

27
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,730
- Delicious. 
 - Thank goodness.

28
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,290
Isn't something different about me today?

29
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,860
You look more beautiful today than yesterday.

30
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,420
I had my nails done.

31
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,140
- What do you think? 
 - They're pretty.

32
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,810
I wish you would line them up properly.

33
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,840
Ah, sorry. I'm sorry. What was I thinking? Sorry.

34
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,570
I will do that. If you keep on doing that, your husband will be criticized.

35
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,670
I'm just doing my job. Well.

36
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,200
It's a waste of you. Would you like to work together at the restaurant with me?

37
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,590
Housekeeping is also a job. A full-time housewife is also a professional.

38
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,610
What I was saying ...

39
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,770
What I talked about yesterday. Won't you reconsider?

40
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,710
The loan.

41
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,040
No. Never mind.

42
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,960
Dear, will you be late again today?

43
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,050
Huh? Yes, go to bed first.

44
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,490
I'll wait. I need to talk to you.

45
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,510
Darling, come home safely.

46
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,810
Don't skip out on your meals, just because you're working from home.

47
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,800
Don't come home late from work.

48
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,660
Why don't we bathe together since I will be home early? Maybe soak in wine?

49
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,150
We'll see.

50
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,620
- I was going to give you a massage, too. 
 - Then do you want to get off work now?

51
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,300
I'll be back soon.

52
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,920
Hello.

53
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,960
Come home safely.

54
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,520
I'll be back.

55
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,940
 Medicine for dry and ichy skin

56
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,360
 Old Crop

57
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,190
Today's courses are Korean beef and Italian Steak Lupino Aziano.

58
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,680
 Jin Sun Mi, General Manager of the restaurant  
 The dessert is a special eclair.

59
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,310
Please recommend each dish to the customer.

60
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,070
Have a pleasant day again. Fighting!

61
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,990
We're falling behind in the orders. Please speed it up.

62
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,920
Yes! Okay.

63
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,840
- I've got Order 3. 
 - Yes.

64
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,130
- Rush Order 5. 
 - Yes.

65
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,330
- President, your necktie looks great. 
 - Is that so?

66
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,230
- The madame has good taste. 
 - Thanks.

67
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,210
I'll take it out.

68
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,540
I think it's really a blessing I was born a woman.

69
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,940
I wouldn't want to borrow a woman's hand to get ready for work.

70
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,140
The president is truly my wanna-be.

71
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,710
Frankly, toques suit the president more than neckties.

72
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,030
It's been a while since he's stopped cooking, right?

73
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,150
Do you still dream of those? A man who cooks?

74
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,370
- Quit talking and get back to work. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

75
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,710
 Old Crop

76
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,600

Gentleman Capital. The loan is due.

77
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,270
Damn, you frightened me.

78
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:16,770
I can't dress you, but I can take it off.

79
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,070
Darling, you poor thing. Did you take your medicine?

80
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,680
How do you survive? You're allergic to your wife's touch.

81
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,780
At least I have my medicine.

82
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,970
You.

83
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,760
♫  You  wouldn't know that I got you now.   ♫

84
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,560
♫  Without knowing, you  ♫

85
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,510
♫  You dare tear all my heart apart  ♫

86
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,240
♫  Fearless you, right? ♫

87
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,710
♫   Because you who are wandering in the endlessly dark night ♫

88
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,990
♫  have put yourself in my hand  ♫

89
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,560
♫   Even if you try to run away you will circle ♫

90
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,670
♫  inside my desolate maze without any opening   ♫

91
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,670
♫   Who’ll ever gonna get you out? ♫

92
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,940
♫  Confined alone in a blocked tunnel  ♫

93
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,850
♫  Yeah no one gonna hide you now  ♫

94
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,650
♫  You better move  ♫

95
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,400
♫  Run  ♫

96
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,510
Hey, why don't you tidy up and clean?

97
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,340
So, you don't like me?

98
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,560
I do like you. I like you a lot. This is precisely

99
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,370
how a person smells.

100
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,380
You're really dirty.

101
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,850
Naughty boy.

102
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,250
Why don't we quit everything and go somewhere quiet?

103
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,420
She's not going to give you the money?

104
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,960
She's not giving it.

105
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:16,290
Just the two of us. We can start anew, anything.

106
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,070
Do you want to start anew from the bottom at your age?

107
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,240
Why? Can't I do it with my ability?

108
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,780
Get serious.

109
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,130
Well. Has your ability not been sufficient up to now?

110
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,070
Stop bottom feeding.

111
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,490
If she disappeared, it would all be yours. Everything.

112
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,540
You ...

113
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,580
Adokicin.

114
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,120
Within 12 hours of her ingesting it, she will have severe diarrhea,

115
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,730
vomiting and fever.

116
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,320
The toxin destroys the cells

117
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,080
and the person who drinks it dies within two days from organ failure.

118
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,340
What's amazing about this poison is that the cause of death shows up as a disease.

119
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:42,140
Even if there is an autopsy, the results are inconclusive because the dosage is so low.

120
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,590
If you put it in red wine, she won't notice it.

121
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,440
Since you use different beds and were drunk, you didn't know a thing.

122
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,920
You will wake up in the morning, report it, and it's all over.

123
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,520
 L'Amour Eternel Cabernet Syrahh

124
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,190
Kim Yun Cheol.

125
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,680
Not this.

126
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,120
 SD card formatted.

127
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm home.

128
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,160
This is ...

129
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,620
Dear.

130
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,030
Dear.

131
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,790
Jae Gyeong!

132
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,450
Dear.

133
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,370
Dear. Dear.

134
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,120
Dear.

135
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,980
Dear.

136
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,560
Jae Gyeong.

137
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,360
Dear.

138
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,440
Dear!

139
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,580
Dear.

140
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,600
 Wife.

141
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,800
 Prepare five billion. If you report, your wife dies. -N31-

142
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,610
 If you report, she dies.

143
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,970
I'm disappointed in you for avoiding your wife's phone call.
  Seo Ji Tae, Lieutenant, Joongam Police Station

144
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,430
It's during work hours.

145
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,210
I will never—

146
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,380
What? You will never live like me?

147
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,260
You try getting married. See if your life fits perfectly like puzzle pieces.

148
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,770
What? I won. Yes, bonus.

149
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:52,050
 Buyeong-dong 3-27. 3-27. We got a report of a kidnapped woman.

150
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,390
Kidnapping ... let's go.

151
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,750
Team 3 confirms. We are on our way.

152
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,920
He is the husband of the victim.

153
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,900
I'm Lieutenant Seo Ji Tae of Joongam Police Station.

154
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,010
Please try to be as comfortable as possible.

155
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,030
We will take care of everything, so don't worry.

156
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,920
Thank you, please take good care of me.

157
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,670
Seonbae.

158
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,320
 Prepare five billion. If you report, your wife dies. -N31

159
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,410
N31. Do you have any guesses?

160
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:00,030
Not at all. It says to not report to the police. So maybe I shouldn't have—

161
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,520
Please don't worry.

162
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,470
A predator will not release the bait until they get what they want.

163
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,730
Five billion? That's a lot.
  Prepare five billion. If you report, your wife dies. -N31-

164
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,650
Can you prepare this amount of money?

165
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,160
I think that I can.

166
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,860
You can prepare this amount in cash, you said?

167
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,250
Yes.

168
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,500
If you tell us your bank account information, we can officially request cooperation from them.

169
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Yes, let's do that.

170
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,440
Here it is.

171
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,300
Seonbae?

172
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,900
Mmm?

173
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,490
 Sim Jae Gyeong

174
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,280
 ₩5,170,010,000

175
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,900
Is anything missing?

176
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,200
No.

177
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,990
So everything is in the same place?

178
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,490
Yes, it appears so.

179
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,540
A lot of blood, but no sign of resistance.

180
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,180
For abductions, the culprit is usually someone close to the victim.

181
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,270
He's just saying that that's how it is, statistically.

182
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,470
- It's cocoa.
 - Yes.

183
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,690
When was the last time you saw your wife?

184
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,840
In the morning, on my way to work.

185
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,520
Did anything seem different?

186
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,750
Different...

187
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,500
Even something trivial would be fine.

188
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,390
Let's see.

189
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,940
 I got my nails done.

190
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,490
Nail...

191
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,640
- Nail?
 - Yes.

192
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,240
She got a manicure, and she was happy about it.

193
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,940
Has your wife had any worries recently?

194
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,620
For example, money problems or men problems?

195
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,610
 The loan... never mind, it's fine.

196
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,090
 If you help me just this one time, I won't concern you with it again.

197
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,830
 Consider it as an investment in me—

198
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,100
 Honey, I hope that you won't work so hard.

199
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,790
 We had enough before.

200
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,770
 I'm not doing this just for myself, am I? This is for both of us.

201
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,230
 Please trust in me, just this once.

202
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,780
 It's that I'm worried about you.

203
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,460
I don't think so.

204
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:21,050
Yes. Are these cups in the sink usually for guests?

205
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,320
No, those cups are used by my wife and myself.

206
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,080
Oh, you two, together?

207
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,650
I don't drink cocoa.

208
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,540
Ah, yes.

209
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,320
- Get the fingerprints from these.
 - Yes.

210
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,930
So who did she drink cocoa with?

211
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,660
How can I know that?

212
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,860
By the time I returned home, my wife was already gone.

213
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:51,790
If you returned home shortly before you called the police, then it would be around midnight.

214
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,540
Based on your restaurant's homepage, closing time is 9 PM.

215
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,570
So what did you do after you left work?

216
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,760
 Closed.

217
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,610
On Fridays, I do a lot of remaining work and roast coffee beans.

218
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,020
Owner.

219
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,210
- We'll go in now.
 - You've worked hard, go on home.

220
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,500
Alone?

221
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,210
Yes.

222
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,880
Are you checking my alibi?

223
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,460
Well, these are the usual questions.

224
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,040
I'm sorry if they made you feel unpleasant.

225
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,070
So I finished up some work alone and came home.

226
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,390
Look at this.

227
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,760
That is wine that I purchased and brought home.

228
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,760
It appears you and your wife enjoy wine.

229
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,670
Yes, sometimes.

230
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,390
Ah.

231
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,460
Today isn't a special day for you two?

232
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,890
I bought it to drink with my wife since it's been a while.

233
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,300
And look at what's happened...

234
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,730
Yes. Your wife will safely return.

235
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,530
You can drink it with her to celebrate her return.

236
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,420
Nothing unusual on the second floor, either.

237
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,690
Yes, it appears so.

238
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,860
What kind of person was your wife?

239
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,770
She put her best effort into everything, and she was very neat.

240
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,700
She always wanted her life filled only with necessary things, and never wanted anything superfluous.

241
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,450
She is someone I had much to learn from, in many ways.

242
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,930
Did your wife do any outside activities?

243
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,740
Lift your left leg, please.

244
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,490
Breathe out and bring your left knee to your chest.

245
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,010
She did yoga for two hours in the mornings.

246
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,000
But aside from that, she didn't do much else.

247
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:43,440
Ah, I heard that she invites other housewives to our home once in a while.

248
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:49,790
Apparently, there were many women who wanted to learn my wife's housekeeping know-how.

249
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,300
In every way, she was the perfect wife.

250
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,770
Yes, I see.

251
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,290
She is too good for me.

252
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,070
When is the last time you spoke to your wife on the phone?

253
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,770
There was no special reason, so I did not speak to her on the phone.

254
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,490
Yes.

255
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:24,000
You should get some sleep. This seems like it will be a long fight.

256
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,700
Yes.

257
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,790
Then...

258
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,680
Quite the quandary, huh?

259
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,140
His wife was abducted,

260
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,120
but the husband is suspected first? Imagine how that would feel.

261
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,790
Did you see his expression? Rather calm, isn't he?

262
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,110
He returns home at midnight, without even a phone call that he will be late?

263
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,570
And he plans to drink wine with her? They even sleep in separate beds.

264
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,890
- But you're the same, Seonbae.
 - What?

265
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,960
Have you ever called your wife even once?

266
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,770
You don't even answer when she calls.

267
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,420
Quiet. Only the couple can really know what goes on in the marriage.

268
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,900
So what is real?

269
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,280
Look at this. If they are not the perfect couple, who is?

270
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,340
The real marriage happens outside the frame.

271
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,050
Just because your marriage is unhappy, is everyone else the same?

272
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,260
Hey, who said my marriage was unhappy?

273
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,580
- You're angry.
 - Shut up.

274
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,890
The victim's phone records, text messages, all the CCTV near this house, black boxes in cars, get them all.

275
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,670
I'm free!

276
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,380
I reported to the police,

277
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,880
but if she doesn't return ...

278
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,310
the money will be ...

279
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,800
Who ...

280
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,360
 You ... you

281
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,070
My arm hurts. It hurts.

282
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,860
- Mr. Kim Yun Cheol. 
 - Yes.

283
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,550
I am checking.

284
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,030
Last night ... I couldn't sleep.

285
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,560
Yes. I understand completely.

286
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,660
Kim Yun Cheol.

287
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,700
Unfortunately, the blood on the floor is probably your wife's.

288
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,270
Did you usually use couple's cups?

289
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,620
Yes, I think so.

290
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:39,050
There are many other cups on the shelf so why out of all cups was cocoa put in that one?

291
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,110
Was there anyone who was close enough to be using the couple cup?

292
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:48,160
I really have no idea.

293
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:59,020
Act as naturally as possible.

294
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,470
 Hello. We're from next door.

295
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,440
Oh, yes.

296
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,000
- Did something happen? 
 - Something happen? Not at all.

297
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,800
Let's have dinner together sometime at our house.

298
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,330
I'm into making paella recently,

299
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,020
but it's too much for the two of us.

300
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,680
My wife has big hands. (  TN: She is generous.)

301
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,820
I see. But, what brought you over?

302
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,800
Right. I think mail was mistakenly delivered to our house.

303
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,730
Thank you.

304
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,670
If you need any help, let me know. 
  N31

305
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,100
Your good neighbor is closer than a distant relative.

306
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,600
Well, good bye.

307
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,800
 Number 3-72, Buyeong-do, Jongno-gu, Seoul Special City

308
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,360
 N31

309
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,000
 You called the police. Did you give up the easy route? Fine. I'll kill her.

310
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,460
 Fine. I'll kill her.

311
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,820
 -N31-

312
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,990
Wi ...

313
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,560
Wife's fingernail.

314
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,340
Don't be too pessimistic. It's just a threat that he will take the next step.

315
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,470
If he really kills her ...

316
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,900
 President Kim Yun Cheol (2 missed calls)

317
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,140
Did you have an arranged date?

318
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,060
Huh? Why?

319
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,310
Just because it seems you're waiting on a phone call.

320
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,860
I don't think you slept all night.

321
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,450
Is that so?

322
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:47,240
I had a vivid dream last night so I'm tired.

323
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,730
What kind of dream was it?

324
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,780
A bit ... dangerous dream?

325
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,620
Unni! No way. Erotic?

326
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,900
Back to work.

327
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,630
Yes, President.

328
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,260
What?

329
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,880
The madame was kidnapped?

330
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,230
 Bank Account Statement

331
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,330
 July 02 (Thurs), 2020 06:30:15

332
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,940
 July 03 (Fri), 2020 08:09:50

333
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,870
 July 1 (WED), 2020, 11:00:11

334
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,100
 July 1 (WED), 2020, 11:30:27

335
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,550
There's nothing in the call records.

336
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,260
I think she was a housewife who lived quietly.

337
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,010
There's nothing special on the CCTV footage.

338
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,360
Yes, it looks like a headache.

339
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,160
I think we have located all the CCTV in the cul-de-sac.

340
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,730
It would be faster to secure a living CCTV. (i.e., a living witness).

341
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,570
Hello.

342
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,610
- I'm a police officer. 
 - Oh, yes.

343
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,930
I would like to ask you something.

344
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:31,110
I'm wondering if you recently saw anything that was unusual.

345
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,170
The neighbors are close with each other, right?

346
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,180
I am a good neighbor.

347
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,010
I see them almost every day.

348
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,670
 I'll be back.

349
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,680
 Hello.

350
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,950
Then, do you know if anything was going on between the couple?

351
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,720
I don't snoop into other people's business.

352
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,320
One could get hurt.

353
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,920
What did she mean that someone could get hurt?

354
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,570
How would I know?

355
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,680
At least you've been married.

356
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,570
That's why I'm crazier.

357
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,690
The longer we live together, the more it is a mystery.

358
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,600
Is your wife a mystery? What kind of a person is she?

359
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,180
What, someone's  husband praises his wife a lot.

360
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,160
Praising his wife.

361
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,810
Yes, that's weird.

362
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,350
Usually, it's hard for a husband to answer questions about his wife immediately.

363
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,540
Why? Because he has never thought of her as interesting.

364
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,280
But he sounded like he was prepared.

365
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,700
 She was a perfect wife in every way.

366
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,420
She could have really been a perfect wife.

367
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,800
You should try living too. A perfectly ideal wife.

368
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,610
That's perfectly weird.

369
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,980
Welcome. It's delicious.

370
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,340
Is it delicious? Is it okay? Have some more.

 N31: My husband abandoned his wife

375
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,480
Are you saying the kidnapper posted this himself?

376
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,860
Yes. Other than "N31" we don't know any information about the suspect.

377
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,080
Visitors to the victim's Instagram page are exploding and the relevant picture is already spreading rampantly.

378
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,170
But why are you doing this?

379
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,070
The culprit is definitely after something.

380
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,580
Are you going to dig further?

381
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,000
After all, what a kidnapper wants is money.

382
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,100
What if there's a way to obtain something worth more than money? 
 - What?

383
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,380
The value of the life you will get if the victim dies. It's an inheritance.

384
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,850
In the absence of evidence, it's risky to assume the husband is a suspect.

385
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,500
What the culprit wants is money and attention.

386
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,290
I don't think this would be very beneficial for the husband.

387
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,750
It's a perfect set-up for him to get criticized for not looking for his wife.

388
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,550
The has-been star chef's account is about to explode.

389
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,820
This could be a self-marketing strategy he planned.

390
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,150
This is way beyond a couple's relationship.

391
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,680
People have started to pay attention to everything in the media.

392
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,900
It means we have to catch the culprit as soon as possible

393
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,390
The matter is growing too big, anyway.

394
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,600
Set up an investigation command center immediately and give it priority.

395
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,000
Okay.

396
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,200
They came out!

397
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,270
How's the investigation?

398
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,940
Please  step out of the way.

399
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,980
You can't go in.

400
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,200
Please don't move any closer.

401
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,740
  An attention seeker should read all the comments here.

402
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,600
 Kim Yun Cheol? He's so insincere.

403
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,960
 Chun****: Don't they know yet whether she's still alive or dead? I pray she returns alive!

404
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,700
 Sks_****: She was so pretty when she appeared on TV in the past. It's so sad.

405
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,010
2 chy5****: Wife kidnapped? Freedom! He must have saved the country in a prior life.

406
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,420
 lyss**** Heol ~ ~ He' really a loser.

407

 Top Searches: 1. Housewife kidnapping; 2. Inluencer; 3. Illicit affiair; 4. Buyeong-dong Kidnapping

408
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,030
 Chef? Thanks to his wife, he's on the real-time search list.

409
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,880
 The victim's husband alerted the police

410
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,550
 that he got a message that demanded a large ransom

411
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,920
 or his wife would be killed.

412
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,530
 The police have switched to a public investigation to locate the victim.

413
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,200
 Noona (Older sister)

414
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,300
 Temporarily Closed

415
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:13,300
What's going on?

416
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,860
Is there nothing we can help with?

417
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,610
The shop is closed today, just say what you need help with.

418
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,320
No, the police are handling it.

419
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,530
 No, no, I'll come right now.

420
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:27,120
I said don't bother! Instead of making a fuss, act natural.

421
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,580
Just stay natural.

422
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:32,540
Goodness. You can't not be doing something!

423
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,200
Do you think I can do anything now?

424
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,970
I'm hanging up.

425
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,110
What can we do?

426
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,430
She will really be okay.

427
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,890
Of course,

428
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:53,100
Auntie will come back.

429
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,140
If she can't ...

430
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,130
 What if my wife really doesn't return?

431
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:25,840
 Decedent: Sim Jae Gyeong.

432
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,130
 Rest in Peace

433
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,430
 I once imagined

434
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:46,060
 the death of my wife.

435
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:52,300
 But I'd never thought it would become reality.

436
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,500
 Strangely... it feels like nothing.

437
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,870
Inspect it thoroughly, even for a speck of dust.

438
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:38,410
Yes, Sir.

439
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,300
- Sunbae, Sunbae, 
 - What?

440
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,900
Two years ago she received an inheritance from her dead parents.

441
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,400
- Was that 5 billion won? 
 - No. It was approximately 500 billion won.

442
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,350
- Five hundred billion? 
 - Sim Jae Gyeong was the only daughter of Undam Foods.

443
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,400
My hunch was right!

444
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:00,710
The profit must have been huge from the sale of not just the food company but also real estate and stocks.

445
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,650
That guy did a proper Wed-Tech (  Combining marriage and financial technology).

446
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,300
Kim Yun Cheol as a chef met Sim Jae Gyeong, a member of the company's planning and PR team

447
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,910
while developing the company's products.

448
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:13,430
My hunch was right. Five billion was a decoy. Becoming the heir is his objective.

449
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,010
No, her inheritance was donated to charity.

450
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,680
What! Hey, Dude!

451
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,130
You should have told me everything at once. Why did you cut it off and feed me? Is this kimbap?

452
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:28,240
Wait a sec ... my hunch ... stop ...

453
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,880
According to the parents' wills, she inherited 10 billion won.

454
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,340
That's what she bought this house with and after he quit his job—

455
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,620
She spent the inheritance in opening the restaurant.

456
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,830
But I've heard the financial situation is terrible.

457
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:49,480
The tax accountant said he has a deficit every month.

458
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,600
He even borrowed from a private loan company (  i.e., "loan shark").

459
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:58,250
It wasn't a marriage. He lured her into an investment.

460
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,630
They're coming out. They're coming out.

461
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:06,500
- Kim Yun Cheol! 
 - Is your wife still alive? Kim Yun Cheol!

462
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,140
- Please make a comment. 
 - Is your wife still alive?

463
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,490
Of course, she is still alive.

464
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:16,240
Even if it is a small tip, please give it to me so I can find my wife.

465
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,760
- What are the conditions for the release of your wife? 
 - Is there any progress in the police investigation?

466
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,410
 Old Crop

467
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:28,400
 Of course she is alive.

468
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,680
What will happen to our CEO?

469
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,990
This is a complete surprise. I thought he would walk though a garden until his next life.

470
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,030
We'll have to pray that its nothing big

471
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:41,580
We're opening soon, what are you doing? Get moving now. Quick.

472
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,460
Team Leader Jin is right.

473
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,080
Don't worry and proceed as we usually do.

474
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Today's dessert is hand made Swiss chocolate and "Death Wish" coffee.

475
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,270
Please explain to the customers that the caffeine content is high.

476
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,990
Let's have a pleasant day again. Fighting!

477
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,200
Let's begin.

478
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,440
You will get bored from just watching.

479
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:25,520
Please have some food.

480
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,960
Today's special is good.

481
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,280
According to the Kim Young Ran Law that is a problem. ( TN: Anticorruption Law prohibits gifts over 50000 won.)

482
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,060
I thought it would be, so I changed it a little.

483
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,110
It's lobster pasta without the lobster.

484
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,630
Ah, you left it out?

485
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:50,000
You can get as many refills as you want for less than 30,000 won.

486
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,220
Thank you.

487
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,400
You should eat a lot.

488
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:09,500
You startled me.

489
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,800
The husband who pleads for the safe return of his wife.

490
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,510
It brought tears to my eyes. Congratulations.

491
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,280
Can't I congratulate you for this?

492
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,820
We're alone. Accept it.

493
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,720
They demanded exactly 5 billion won.

494
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,000
Who could have done that?

495
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,030
Is that important? Only the result matters, doesn't it?

496
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:49,120
You escaped that marriage you are sick of, and you protected your business, too.

497
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,550
And I'm happy I don't have to see your wife.

498
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:02,930
But what if... something really goes wrong?

499
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,430
Things will turn out well.

500
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,330
What? Are you really worried about her?

501
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:14,520
Don't worry. Luck is on your side.

502
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,600
What's wrong with you?

503
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,700
Have you done something wrong, Honey?

504
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,770
Did I do something wrong?

505
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,110
Not us?

506
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,840
 Do you still think I'm joking?

507
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,810
 How can I... no.

508
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,670
 Don't you think this is all so unfair to you?

509
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,660
 You worked so hard, but nothing is yours.

510
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:44,610
 House. Car. Restaurant. Do you even have a bank account to your name?

511
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:48,740
 I guess your cell phone is yours, but that is it.

512
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,480
 Be honest. You thought marrying that woman would give you wings, didn't you?

513
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,490
 That's not how it is. She has broken your wings

514
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,880
 and locked you in a bird cage, while feeding you just enough.

515
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,010
 Do you really want to continue living this way?

516
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,590
 Aren't you even angry?

517
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,030
Why don't you ask me?

518
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,830
What?

519
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:25,010
If I put that poison in the wine or not.

520
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,430
Because

521
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,610
that's something that is up to you.

522
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:40,710
Will she really die?

523
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:43,370
If we wait, we'll find out, won't we?

524
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:45,780
What if she returns alive?

525
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:52,120
Then have a toast in celebration. You've still got that wine, after all.

526
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,240
Hey, what are you doing?

527
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,310
What if someone sees us?

528
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:08,160
Then let them find out. How much longer will their meal last?

529
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,940
Are you crazy?

530
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:14,650
I thought we were getting bored with each other already. But I'm so turned on.

531
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,500
Wait... hold on...

532
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,590
Would the employees really feel like family?

533
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:37,160
They see each other more often and spend more time together, even more than family, don't they?

534
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,940
Yes, probably.

535
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,670
How long has it been?

536
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,650
I'm done eating already.

537
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,860
The bathroom is on the first floor.

538
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,750
Ah yes, I already visited it.

539
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,880
The offices must be on the second floor?

540
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,880
Did you enjoy your meal?

541
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,340
Yes, thanks to you.

542
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:15,300
I've let Team Leader Jin know what to do, so everyone obey her well.

543
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,800
I'll make a new equipment list, so leave it to Team Leader Jin.

544
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,690
Don't worry about the restaurant and please concentrate on finding Madam.

545
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:25,140
Yes, leave everything here to us.

546
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,300
Yes, thanks.

547
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,320
Mr. Kim Yun Cheol.

548
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,530
- How do you feel?
 - Have you heard anything?

549
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,590
- Is there anyone you suspect might be the criminal?
 - Please look this way.

550
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:41,830
- Mr. Kim Yun Cheol.
 -  Have you heard anything?

551
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,380
Please give us a comment.

552
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:52,990
Something smells. Very smelly.

553
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,740
A woman's perfume, that is.

554
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,120
 Exhibit 3: Threatening message

555
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:14,200
Based on the urgent DNA analysis, the blood found on the fingernail matches the victim Sim Jae Gyeong.

556
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,300
There is a high possibility that the culprit is very close with the victim.

557
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,930
I don't think we can remove her husband Kim Yun Cheol from the list of suspects.

558
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,520
Just speculation? No evidence?

559
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,060
This was found in the victim's husband's car.

560
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,410
We consulted the hospital that issued this prescription

561
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,070
and this medication was prescribed for allergies that were a result of severe stress.

562
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:35,150
For Kim Yun Cheol, he was suffering severe financial problems with his restaurant.

563
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,620
Anyone running a business can go through difficulties.

564
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,860
We found conclusive evidence as well.

565
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,460
 Sim Jae Gyeong Abduction Case Briefing
 Exhibit 2: Blood in trunk
 Exhibit 5: Shoe print

566
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:48,170
We found blood in the victim's husband's car.

567
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,120
Is it the wife's blood?

568
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:55,460
After checking the husband's black box (dashcam), only the footage from the day of the abduction has been erased.

569
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:01,040
In addition, we found footprints of an adult male in the main entrance and the entryway to the living room.

570
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,760
Isn't this more than enough?

571
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:08,690
We found a footprint at the site of the abduction.

572
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:12,870
Seeing how parts of the footprints are missing, they either tried to rush while erasing the evidence

573
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:16,830
or they didn't pay enough attention.

574
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:21,530
But this matches your shoe size, Mr. Kim Yun Cheol.

575
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:32,360
So are you saying this is my footprint?

576
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:37,730
Kim Yun Cheol, where did your sneakers go?

577
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:01,300
 Someone is framing me as the culprit.

578
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:06,550
 Why? Why would they?

579
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,660
 Team Leader Jin

580
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,390
Let me take this call. It's the restaurant.

581
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,750
Yes, is something going on?

582
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:30,050
Did you see the news?

583
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,090
 Did you get along well with the abduction victim, Ms. Sim?

584
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,380
 We were close, she treated me like an older sister.

585
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:46,230
Perhaps she had problems? Money problems, marital problems?

586
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:50,920
 Recently, she thought that her husband...

587
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,920
Did you see it?

588
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,960
 ... might be having an affair, and she was worried.

589
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,090
Yes.

590
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:00,610
You said you were never caught and that no one knew.

591
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:09,060
You didn't tell the police about us, did you?

592
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,520
Of course, I didn't.

593
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,810
Be sure to not get caught. If we do, you're the one who will get hurt more than I do.

594
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,450
Don't you know that attempted murder is a crime, too?

595
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,840
What about the wine?

596
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,590
Wine? I have it.

597
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,720
You still have it?

598
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,550
Why?

599
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,570
You didn't put the Adokicin in it, did you?

600
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,320
You told me to have a celebratory toast with her.

601
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,720
Why do you still have that?

602
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,720
But I didn't feed her the poison yet, did I?

603
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,020
Are you joking? And will anyone buy that excuse?

604
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:55,720
Don't you know that attempted murder is a crime, too?

605
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,500
So get rid of the wine first.

606
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,780
Okay, I'll throw it away.

607
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,280
- So maybe he was having a tryst at that time?
 - No way.

608
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,170
- Just as you suspected, Seonbae.
 - Do you know who his extramarital partner is, by any chance?

609
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:21,450
 I wouldn't know that.

610
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:26,570
He is a bigger piece of trash than I expected. Let's hear what his excuses will be.

611
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,050
Mr. Kim Yun Cheol?

612
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,170
There he is!

613
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,480
There he goes.

614
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,820
Please speak to us, Mr. Kim Yun Cheol.

615
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,970
Just a moment, Mr. Kim Yun Cheol.

616
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Please give us a statement.

617
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:10,020
 24 Hour Pawn Shop

618
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:17,090
 No Chang Beom
 Pawn Shop Owner

619
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,640
So give it to me.

620
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:56,830
This dog... he's so crazy. This son of a bitch.

621
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,670
I'll call you.

622
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,300
Oh, the talk of the town.

623
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,970
What brings you to such a shabby place?

624
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:17,370
How do I get in?

625
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:29,370
 Let's see...

626
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,520
This place is a mess!

627
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,760
Here, have something to drink.

628
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,400
Did you do it?

629
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,940
It's really not me.

630
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:06,010
Brother-in-law, please help me.
  (T/N: husband of his sister)

631
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,770
What do I help you with? The abduction? Or your adultery?

632
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:12,100
Abduction?

633
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,950
I told you, I really didn't do that.

634
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:17,460
So you did commit adultery.

635
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,230
Anyone would say that you are the most likely suspect.

636
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,240
There is a footprint but the shoes have disappeared, so it's driving me crazy.

637
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,390
You are stuck between a rock and a hard place.

638
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:36,360
What do I do? What?

639
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:41,820
You know, it's harder to prove something that is true, than something that is false.

640
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,160
If it's difficult to prove your innocence

641
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:54,410
then your only solution is to find the real culprit.

642
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,790
The couple mugs.

643
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:11,770
I think the culprit was close enough to her that she would give him my mug.

644
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:16,650
Do you write your name on your mug? I'm sure she grabbed just whatever.

645
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:20,330
You do not know her, Brother-in-law. She would never just use any mug.

646
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:26,520
Every item must be in its place and only used for its intended purpose.

647
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,690
But you're the only one that she couldn't keep in its rightful place, aren't you?

648
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:36,740
So another man who a neatnik wife would bring into her home, huh?

649
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,940
We can't be sure it's a man.

650
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:43,750
Are you naive or shameless? You can have an affair, but your wife can't?

651
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,760
But you know that she would never do that.

652
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,430
I've investigated so much adultery that I am sick of it.

653
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:53,860
Between a married couple, "Oh, no way,"

654
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,140
simply does not exist.

655
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:01,210
No one you suspect?

656
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:06,180
Ex-boyfriend? Maybe a work colleague from the past?

657
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,690
My wife would never...

658
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:14,900
Something is right in front of the building since a while ago.

659
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,480
Huh?

660
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,760
It's definitely not the police.

661
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,370
Let's talk for a bit.

662
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:54,620
You... ?

663
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,600
Stop there!

664
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,860
Stop!

665
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:44,540
Who are you?

666
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,520
Why are you following me?

667
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:52,260
Calm down, please.

668
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,380
Calm down?

669
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:59,160
You did it, didn't you? You abducted her and you're trying to frame me, right?

670
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:03,070
Where is my wife?

671
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,570
Oh, your wife.

672
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,460
Are you even curious?

673
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:13,080
Tell me right now. Where is she?

674
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,220
I wonder what you're really curious about?

675
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,730
So she's alive, right?

676
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:31,570
What kind of answer do you want?

677
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:49,800

678
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:02,830
♫  Your bickering everyday is wearing me out. Damn  ♫

679
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:06,370
♫  The game is boring.  ♫

680
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:08,000
♫  After a long night  ♫

681
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,110
 My Dangerous Wife
 ♫  in front of me was  ♫

682
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:11,180
♫  another boring scene  ♫

683
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,270
 Someone is framing me as the culprit.

684
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:16,700
 I have to reveal who it is first.

685
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:22,860
 You do what I say, or you will become the one who put poison in the wine.

686
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:28,040
 What I'm leaving here is my faith in you.

687
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,750
 She's alive. I have to try and save my wife somehow.

688
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:36,560
 I chose you by staking my life on it.

689
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,930
 I want to find her.

690
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:42,510
♫  Firmly set at orange moonlight night   ♫
