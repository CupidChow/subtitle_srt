00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,830
Married Woman Abducted, Demand for 5 Billion Won in Ransom

2
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,690
My Dangerous Wife

3
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,240
Are you worried about your husband, or your plans being ruined?

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,520
Were you surprised?

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,350
I asked if you increased the dosage of the Adokicin!

6
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,760
Do we have to go this far? In a plan like this, you have to be more real.

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,200
I've been wiretapping Kim Yun Cheol's house. They just poisoned that Jin Seon Mi.

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,690
What happened?
Get 5 billion won ready. I know you killed Jin Seon Mi.

9
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:14,490
Someone is watching us and pretending to be N-31.

10
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,720
Mr. Yun Cheol. Kim Yun Cheol. Kim Yun Cheol!

11
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,660
Mr. Kim Yun Cheol! Kim Yun Cheol!

12
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,830
Where is Ms. Jin Seon Mi?

13
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,550
Because of me, she died.

14
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,360
No, I killed her.

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,120
Miss Jin Seon Mi?

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,560
You two plotted together to deceive me. Since when!

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,270
Did your wife know Sim Jae Gyeong?

18
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,820
What is this?
Get 5 billion won ready. I know you killed Jin Seon Mi.

19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,920
Is this an idea of your young husband?

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,390
No!

21
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,820
It's true, isn't it? That you were the one who killed my hoobae (junior), Song Yu Min.

22
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,290
Let's go to the police station together.

23
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,380
Why should I? It's all because of you!

24
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,520
Why is that because of me? Because of you, my poor junior friend died.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,890
You're the one who started all of this.

26
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,560
Marrying a trash-like husband, having an affair,

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
planning revenge, Song Yu Min dying, it's all because of you!

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,060
Why are you blaming others? If you hadn't planned such a stupid revenge,

29
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,160
we wouldn't have come to this.

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,180
Just divorce him. You could have simply divorced him.

31
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,030
Why are you dragging it out? Why are you making me and my husband get involved in this?

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,130
But you two aren't a married couple.

33
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,270
Omo.

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,090
If someone hears this, they're going to think that you two are really a married couple.

35
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,830
What are you so surprised about? Did you think that everyone didn't know?

36
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,580
Everyone knows that you two aren't a married couple.

37
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,170
Did you really hope that everyone would see the two of you as a married couple?

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,230
Oh my gosh, poor you.

39
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,300
If you don't have the courage to go the police station,

40
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,830
I can go in your place and tell them everything for you.

41
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,270
Thank you for the black tea.

42
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,210
In the end, you two are just tied by one piece of paper.

43
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:42,160
Our contract is much more real than your garbage oath!

44
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,770
What happened?

45
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,200
Jin Seon Mi didn't die. Jin Seon Mi is alive.

46
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,030
That means it's hopeless for us.

47
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,960
Now the end has been decided. Please Honey, follow my will.

48
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,620
We still are married.

49
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,170
Five billion. I will snatch it from you.

50
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,880
When that money is mine, let's

51
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,140
go renew our contract to a lifelong one.

52
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,910
How is it? It's alright with you, right?

53
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,950
Episode 15
Until death do us part.

54
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,180
Sim Jae Gyeong!

55
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,340
You come out and give an over-the-top excuse!

56
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,400
I kidnapped your wife. Get 5 billion won ready

57
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,470
If you contact the police, your wife will die.

58
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,670
Are they truly going to be like this to the bitter end?

59
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,770
Do you think I'll be played by such a prank?

60
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,350
Even to death, I will no longer be deceived!

61
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,780
Every corner of this house ...

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,060
Every single item

63
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,570
I'm sick and tired of everything you ever designed.

64
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,950
Clean up! Straighten up!

65
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,590
What? Are you hiding somewhere to observe me again?

66
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,710
You're driven crazy no? Come out and straighten these things now! Why don't you?

67
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,250
I told you to save me, as I'm beside you,

68
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,640
Yun Cheol.
He can't hear me.

69
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,920
Kim Yun Cheol.

70
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,390
We, all the time, are just as we've been.

71
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,760
♫ I see and trust only you ♫

72
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,980
Some fights, even though we know we will lose, we start them.
♫ There was a time like that ♫

73
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,310
Our marriage was such.
♫ A dream like time. ♫

74
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,440
The six years we had lived together, what were they?

75
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,770
Why have we walked down this path to here?

76
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,210
♫ Joining you was enough ♫

77
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,940
Was our marriage spanning six years
♫ in a love which would last forever ♫

78
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,210
♫ is something I don't have anymore ♫

79
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,310
a thing which was dying?

80
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,890
Are you marathon reading, "The Wife"?

81
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,050
I was just looking to see if there were any new uploads.

82
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,770
Maybe there might be some upload saying in truth, the mistress was alive. You know?

83
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,210
Is it you?

84
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,720
Beyond reasoning. You always go beyond reasoning.

85
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,510
I've been wronged. Because of your jumping to conclusions in your deductions, I'm busy always righting them.

86
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,720
So, I have no time to actually make my own focused deductions.

87
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,730
Then, I'll be still, so how about you make some deductions?

88
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,120
Who can go beyond reasoning?

89
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,330
One, two, three. Go.

90
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,390
Sunbaenim, let's go capture "beyond reasoning."

91
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,450
With what? Huh?

92
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,220
- Did you find something?
- Yes!
Cafe

93
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,230
You decided to meet the contact of the publishing author here, right? Even anonymous authors, when contracting

94
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,560
they must come directly. That's why I asked for the cooperation of the publishing company.

95
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,760
So you used a contract as bait? You put your brain to some use.

96
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,820
Hey, wait. Wait. My cell phone.

97
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,830
I'll go inside first. Second floor.

98
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,150
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

99
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,670
- Ow. Why are you being like this?
- What are you doing here?

100
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,730
What? Can't I have an appointment somewhere like this?

101
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,780
- What about the kids?
- They've grown enough that even if they're by themselves, they're fine.

102
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,850
If the kids are a bit older, they'll probably stay out all night.

103
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,370
What kind of appointment did you make today?

104
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,930
Just do as you normally do. Don't pay me any mind.

105
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,880
What! What are you doing!
Beautiful Publishing Chief Editor Kim Yeong Yun
Power off

106
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,260
Break your appointment today!

107
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,560
It's your cellphone, honey.

108
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,560
Yeah. Sunbae-nim, where are you?

109
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,320
I am going.

110
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,130
I think "beyond reasoning" has figured it out.

111
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,580
I can't contact this person and this person won't appear.

112
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,440
Yeah, I got it.

113
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,810
Let's see each other at home.

114
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,630
I was really curious

115
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,910
how can the author crack the case so perfectly?

116
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,610
Unless it's a police insider and that would be me or you, Sunbae-nim.

117
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,990
Sister-in-Law!

118
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,940
Don't you think your wife has information which is beyond reasoning?

119
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,960
She might know well.

120
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,380
Web novels and webtoons are all the trend nowadays. Their profits are tremendous.

121
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,140
Sunbae-nim, be good to Sister-in-law.

122
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,110
If a work (of hers) becomes a hit, your retirement will just be all rosy

123
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,260
and will keep speeding down that lane.

124
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,730
Huh? Sunbae-nim, you're strange.

125
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,340
About what?

126
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,780
What? Sister-in-law may start writing but

127
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,480
never has an end to what she does. She's always studying.

128
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,080
Her dream of being a writer is just that.

129
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,020
Did I say so?

130
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,830
You're so weird. I guess you had a big fight.

131
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,790
I don't know if I am fighting with her properly.

132
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,930
Seoul Jungam Police Station

133
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,370
Boss, the fingerprint comparison results have come out.

134
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,680
Fingerprint Analysis Results.

135
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,160
Evaluation

136
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,430
Testing Report (Contrasts)

137
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,650
What are you?

138
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,520
The fingerprints on the painting next to the fallen Song Yu Min and those of Ha Eun Hye were identical.

139
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,700
99.68678% identical

140
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,020
And the items Kim Yun Cheol brought as evidence seem to be items Ha Eun Hye threw out.

141
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,960
So the person who killed Song Yu Min was Ha Eun Hye.

142
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,750
We were looking far for someone so close. Let's arrest her immediately.

143
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,480
Yes.

144
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,050
Sim Jae Gyeong. You're listening in on everything, right?

145
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,650
Are you bugging me again?

146
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,950
Sure.

147
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:59,170
Do as you please. Bug as much as you please. Who the hell are you!

148
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:04,390
Is it so fun to make fun of me? Come out right now!

149
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,510
Are you listening to me?

150
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,420
The marriage cups you had so cherished.

151
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,630
How is it? The sound of your marriage breaking? Do you like it?

152
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,980
These cretins thinking themselves to be officers.

153
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,300
- Is something happening now again so late?
- It's Seo Ji Tae.

154
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,500
Do you know where Ms. Ha Eun Hye, your next-door neighbor is, Mr. Kim Yun Cheol?

155
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,640
Why should I know that?

156
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,590
The drawing that lay next to that of the deceased Song Yu Min had Ha Eun Hye's fingerprints.

157
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,420
I can't contact her and it seems like her house is vacant.

158
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,560
Are the lights normally out at this time?

159
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,880
I kidnapped your wife. Get 5 billion won ready.

160
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,490
Yes, talk please, Kim Yun Cheol.

161
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,540
Tell him that they're abroad.

162
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,650
Yes,

163
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,690
the next-door married couple, I think they are vacationing abroad.

164
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,950
Abroad? Abroad where?

165
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,440
I think they said Singapore?

166
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,320
Yes, I'll confirm that.

167
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,800
There's a possibility that Ha Eun Hye has escaped.

168
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,390
I'd like to request each carrier's outbound records and passenger list.

169
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:40,300
It's best for you not to think about other things, or else your wife will die.

170
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,080
I thought you strange from the beginning.

171
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,880
This is also a lie, isn't it?

172
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,750
Then did she plot with you this time? But what can be done? You've picked the wrong guy.

173
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,910
I'm regretting running around like a dog to save my wife.

174
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,370
I don't have a single drop of interest in you two.

175
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,480
You also aren't interested in each other, right?

176
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,600
The money was more valuable and you hoped to protect it, no?

177
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,380
Yeah. To Sim Jae Gyeong,

178
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,530
tell her properly not to have any false expectations.

179
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:28,120
When I look at you two, I think you're truly crazy.

180
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,030
Or are married couples really like that?

181
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,080
Forget it. The money?

182
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,740
Get on.

183
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,790
Open the trunk.

184
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,720
What? Are you still unable to grasp the situation?

185
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
I had put ... I really put it here.

186
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,630
So where did those money bags go?

187
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,530
Think hard with that brilliant brain of yours.

188
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Why did the two of you team up on the same side?

189
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,390
In the end, is it because of the money?

190
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,750
Jin Seon Mi had schemed together with my wife,

191
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,860
so she probably was compensated.

192
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,710
Old Crop

193
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,800
Temporarily Closed

194
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,170
That she didn't pick-up, means she has the money in her hands.

195
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,390
She's not going to give it up willingly.

196
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,800
Have you sided with Jin Seon Mi?

197
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,440
In this situation who would I believe? I am utterly alone.

198
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,990
No one but myself. Do or die. You don't know!

199
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,190
Don't come closer.

200
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,800
So you don't care what happens to your wife?

201
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,970
Wife? Yeah.

202
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,350
Whether you kill or let her live, do as you please!

203
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,520
Kim Yun Cheol that bastard escaped.

204
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,430
And the police are looking for you, Honey. The house is dangerous, so let's go elsewhere.

205
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,350
Here's an express delivery for you.

206
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,120
Work hard.

If something happens to me,

209
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:32,740
please give Kim Yun Cheol this letter and the entire truth.

210
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,710
And please tell him

211
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,100
that I was thankful for the past six years.

Identity blocked

226
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,580
Identity blocked

227
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,880
Hello?

228
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,610
Is this Mr. Kim Yun Cheol? This is Lee Jin Su.

229
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,510
What? Do we have any words to spare for each other?

230
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,630
Jae Gyeong sent something strange. I was worried. That's why.

231
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,320
Mr. Lee Jin Su. I can't believe you either. What scheme is it now?

232
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,410
Aren't you worried?

233
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,450
Sure.

234
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,660
What did she send?

235
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,240
Since she said it is in fact the last thing,

236
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,920
wouldn't it be the most precious thing?

237
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,480
Money?

238
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,920
I knew I shouldn't have had any expectations.

239
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,020
Don't pose and get to the point.

240
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,100
Furthermore, what are you anyway to keep telling me you have or not have expectations?

241
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,110
- Are you my tutor or something?
- Kim Yun Cheol, you failed.

242
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,650
What did I fail? Hello?

243
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,880
If you help me, I'll really give you five billion won.

244
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,080
Why are you going this far?

245
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,530
I want to be with my husband.

246
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:06,280
Our relationship is broken, but I will not give up.

247
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,690
It'll be better.

248
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,980
Is that all?

249
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,000
And moreover, I need Yun Cheol.

250
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,890
Whether you don't want to lose Yun Cheol, or whether you don't want to ruin your marriage, I'm a bit confused.

251
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,970
I will protect this marriage.

252
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,800
Geez. An outstanding marriage it is. Everlasting love? From the beginning, it is a nonsensical scam.

253
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,880
Because we promised this hard thing, it is precious.

254
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,240
And since we carefully maintain it, it is all the more valuable.

255
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,050
I request this of you.

256
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,850
I will keep this promise.

257
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,080
Why are you doing this? Why is it that you're protecting her so much?

258
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,190
I told you, didn't I? I don't like that there are variables.

259
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,510
Fine let's make a deal.

260
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:04,630
I'll let you know my plans, so let's have it that you tell me yours.

261
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,930
I anticipated that that woman, will erase what had been recorded.

262
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,990
You'll invite me?

263
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,460
Make sure to avoid everything else. But dipping the bread in the shrimp gambas sauce will be okay.

264
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,290
So I had prepared a hidden card.

265
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,950
It looks just like Chinese lacquer tree roots, but I had exchanged for different buds prior.

266
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,990
Something that'll be harmless even if distilled.

267
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:40,560
The poison, whose mouth it would go into, I couldn't trust anyone.

268
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,640
I didn't want to die even if by accident.

269
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,160
I wanted to be certain.

270
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,580
I had really intended to disappear.

271
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,470
In return, I wanted to expose the crazy deeds the two schemed to the world.

272
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,980
I wanted to expose the reality of the happily married couple.

273
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:22,100
You've been preparing like me for a long time, right?

274
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,960
A deal is a deal, so I'll tell you my plans in time.

275
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,380
Even if you give to me, I'll pass on it.

276
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,000
If I had the five billion, what would happen other than the cops tailing me?

277
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,350
I tend to filter out the jobs I take. If there is a big risk, I kindly decline.

278
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,630
Then for what reason,

279
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,910
the war isn't over yet.

280
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:29,780
Before I exit, I have something I need to know.

281
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,740
This! Isn't it curious?

282
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:43,800
The true relationship between Sim Jae Gyeong and Lee Jin Su.

283
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,110
I was waiting for you.

284
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,080
You knew Seon Mi didn't die. What is the reason you took me to the wild mountain while knowing?

285
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,730
The reason you put those shoes that aren't even my wife's saying it was evidence. Huh?

286
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,640
Sure. I'll take a hit from you.

287
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,950
Have a seat.

288
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,730
I don't know where I will explode, so you answer properly.

289
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,280
Is my marriage a scheme between you two?

290
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,060
Are the two of you...

291
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,110
Since when have you dated?

292
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,870
From the time you were a tutor until now?

293
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,980
You find it amusing, yourself no? Answer me!

294
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,270
Is that jealousy?

295
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,400
Jealousy?

296
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,570
I'll take care of the rest.

297
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,560
This is...

298
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:52,850
Carrying a bloody you while running away is a dangerous thing.

299
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,170
These aren't the proper locations for the candles.

300
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:05,120
It's you two that aren't in your proper place.

301
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,020
Now get away from this house and fly around a bit freely.

302
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,800
No,

303
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:18,830
I like our house.

304
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,800
Sure. Where you've

305
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,180
worked so hard to keep up, it'll now be your last.

306
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,940
It's beautiful, isn't it?

307
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,380
They met while working at a wine bar.

308
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,660
The wife really did love wine.

309
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,120
Especially that wine, L'amour Eternel.

310
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,650
You said you weren't interested.

311
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:59,650
At our business, we don't deal in stolen goods.

312
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,630
It looks like you only deal in stolen goods.

313
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,830
I don't.

314
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:07,210
Out of the items here, the one that has the most stolen stench is us.

315
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,590
But why did the wife of this person named Lee Jin Su die?

316
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,850
Well, they say she was sick for a long time.

317
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,930
He lost her to a disease?

318
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,830
It's known that way,

319
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,500
but there's a suspicious thing.

320
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,720
She had passed exactly two days after she fainted.

321
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,760
In the hospice room, an empty bottle of wine was discovered.

322
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,870
Now.

323
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,430
How can we understand this relationship?

324
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,580
The position of wife,

325
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,760
it's really not good.

326
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,620
Is this what Jae Gyeong sent?

327
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,730
Again, again. She's trying to control me with these things.

328
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,320
What is your (all) objective?

329
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,730
What are you trying to do by creating these situations?

330
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,140
From the beginning until the very end, you two plotted, didn't you?

331
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,680
N31, do you think I wouldn't know?

332
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,660
It's the initials of your former bar.

333
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,560
November 31, the wine bar that a married couple worked at.

334
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,890
Jae Gyeong probably frequented, pretending to be a regular, I suppose!

335
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,340
N31 is probably a memory shared between the two of you and a codeword.

336
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,650
Is what I am saying wrong?

337
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,560
Kim Yun Cheol,

338
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:08,860
N31 is my promise to you, Kim Yun Cheol.

339
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,730
Lee Jin Su and Sim Jae Gyeong were not lovers?

340
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,070
There was a kidnapping again during her high school days.

341
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,070
That also was fabricated by her?

342
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,010
We don't know.

343
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,880
Anyway, after that, she quit her tutoring immediately.

344
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,290
She prepared to study abroad.

345
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,700
They thought the tutor was behind the kidnapping of the high school girl.

346
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:42,110
Even when going abroad, she was insured under a K&R (kidnapping and ransom) insurance policy.

347
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:48,260
This Lee Jin Su couple ran a wine bar.

348
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,970
The name was November 31.

349
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:57,360
The 11th month on the 31st. They say that's the day that the two decided to get married.

350
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,490
November 31st?

351
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:03,680
November ends on the 30th though.

352
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,190
He proposed as the day was changing to the 1st,

353
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,960
so the name of the business became November 31st.

354
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,700
So that's why it was November 31st.

355
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:22,230
These two were quite the ideal couple.

356
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:27,780
She who grew up under cold parents, Jae Gyeong, while looking at the Jin Su married couple, resolved

357
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,540
that she too would get married and surely

358
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,760
live like that married couple.

359
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,320
It's a very outstanding marriage.

360
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,110
What is marriage? Everlasting love?

361
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,380
From the start it's a nonsensical scam.

362
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,430
It's precious because such a difficult thing was promised.

363
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,400
Because it was protected with great difficulty, it is all the more valuable.

364
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,100
I will keep that promise.

365
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,020
You are totally hopeless.

366
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,370
Seven years ago, after I lost my wife, I decided to fold my business.

367
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,460
You were married?

368
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Jae Gyeong comforted a depressed me after losing my wife a lot.

369
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:37,600
Saying that she will be doubly happy for our sake. Before getting engaged, she brought you.

370
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,040
You two were the last customers of November 31.

371
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:49,100
You probably don't remember but as the date changed from November 30th to December 1st,

372
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,120
your marriage proposal took place.

373
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,500
I don't know. I don't know!

374
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,430
Anyway, that was probably fabricated by both of you and Jae Gyeong.

375
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:04,000
So what do you plan after boiling and torturing me alive? Those emotional pleas don't work on me anymore.

376
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,870
L'amour Eternel.

377
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,800
What about the wine?

378
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,680
It's the wine my wife loved.

379
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,480
Of course, Jae Gyeong did too.

380
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,990
You probably forgot.

381
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,370
6 years ago

382
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,340
I love you.

383
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,150
I'm sorry I couldn't get an even more extravagant one.

384
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,740
I'm so happy.

385
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,520
I don't want anything else.

386
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,930
Just promise me one thing.

387
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,880
Whatever you want!

388
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,620
Until death do us part. Forever.

389
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,750
Until death do us part, forever.

390
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,850
I love you.

391
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,600
Me, too.

392
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,550
Cheers.

393
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,860
Shall we stamp the occasion with this wine?

394
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,180
This wine, L'amour Eternel.

395
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,870
Everlasting love.

396
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,980
It's a wine used when one proposes marriage.

397
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,190
Here. Let's swear here.

398
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,330
I'll go first.

399
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,650
Okay.

400
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,000
L'amour whatever, upon it, I swear.

401
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,430
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

402
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:35,390
Kim Yun Cheol, you failed.

403
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,540
What? What is it I failed at?

404
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,010
I honestly also couldn't protect my wife till the end.

405
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,220
That'll probably remain as a lifelong bruise.

406
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,330
So I hoped that you would remain as Jae Gyeong's true family member.

407
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,660
I had sincere expectations that you would.

408
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,000
When I first saw the kidnapper's messages,
N31

409
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,810
what would've happened if you had recognized the N31 insignia?

410
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,780
At the very least, it wouldn't have been like now.

411
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:28,150
Jae Gyeong really wanted to believe you till the very end.

412
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,990
She earnestly hoped her sincerity would reach you.

413
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:49,250
If something happens to me,

414
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:54,260
please give Kim Yun Cheol this letter and the entire truth.

415
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:02,000
And tell him that I was thankful for the last six years.

416
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,400
She had sensed the danger surrounding her.

417
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,190
Undertaking the danger, she entrusted this to me.

418
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,420
So Kim Yun Cheol, your wife.

419
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,010
You should protect her.

420
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:27,420
When I look at you two, I think you're both crazed.

421
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,530
Don't you care what happens to your wife?

422
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,780
Wife?

423
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,680
Whether you kill her or keep her alive. Do whatever you want.

424
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:53,670
If something happens to me, burn this incense.

425
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,210
7 years ago

426
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,560
I prepared what you've always drunk.

427
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,410
Thank you.

428
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,990
Your wife must be so happy

429
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,850
because you congratulate her every year like this without forgetting.

430
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,990
I'm so glad that she likes it.

431
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,340
- I'll prepare your side dishes.
- Ah!

432
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,700
You know? What I've always eaten.

433
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,190
I request it as November 31st.

434
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,340
Yes, customer.

435
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,920
♫ Your heart ♫

436
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,370

Until your 31st anniversary, you need to keep getting them, so

440
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,560
be prepared.

441
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,760
Again, again, you're crying on such a good day.

442
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,670
I'm not crying.

443
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,040
I laugh like this when I'm feeling happy.

444
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,880
That's how you smile?

445
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,390
Wow, look the candlewax is dripping. Drip drop.

446
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,960
Come, come and blow them out.

447
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,860

If I don't receive a response in three minutes, I am contacting the police.

Ha Eun Hye

463
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,430
Honey.

464
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,830
I'm sorry.

465
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,090
I'm really sorry for deceiving you.

466
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:04,390
I didn't want to lose you.

467
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,790
What I lost.

468
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:13,490
I wanted to get back what I lost.

469
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,100
Show me proof that you have the 5 billion won ready. If you're late, your wife dies.

470
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,030
There won't be a deal anymore.

471
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,800
Five billion ... Five billion ... Five billion.

472
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:48,090
Why do you keep phoning?

473
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,730
You took the five billion from my car, didn't you?

474
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,940
What are you talking about?

475
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,560
I'm begging. Please lend it to me.

476
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,100
Why? Are you trying to rescue your wife again with that money?

477
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,710
Yes.

478
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,700
- Jae Gyeong's been kidnapped.
- Are you kidding?

479
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:11,170
I think it's the neighbor and his wife.

480
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,640
This is the truth.

481
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,930
This time, she really really was kidnapped.

482
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,860
My wife ... may die.

483
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,260
Relax. Sim Jae Gyeong is safe. She is supposed to meet me here.

484
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,240
She said she's meeting you?

485
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,790
Hey, that's a trap.

486
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,120
Hurry and leave!

487
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,220
Hey Jin Seon Mi!

488
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,770
Yes. I understand. Thank you.

489
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,260
Sunbaenim, the Ministry of Justice contacted us.

490
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,140
There's no record of Jo Min Gyu or Ha Eun Hye leaving the country.

491
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,420
Let me see.

492
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:14,900
Detective. There's a report from near Old Crop restaurant.

493
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,110
A scream was heard from inside the restaurant.

494
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,900
- A scream?
Yes.

495
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,030
Hold on to this.

496
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,260
Sunbaenim. Sunbaenim!

497
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,020
Seon Mi!

498
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,530
Seon Mi!

499
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,460
Jin Seon Mi!

500
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,350
Seon Mi.

501
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,020
Are you okay?

502
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,190
Jo Min Gyu stole the five billion won.

503
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,500
I stabbed him in the leg with this.

504
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,190
He couldn't have gone very far yet.

505
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,100
- Let's go to the hospital first.
- No. Find the five billion.

506
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:33,580
I will lend it to you. With that, you can rescue Jae Gyeong.

507
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,630
All right.

508
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,570
You must return the money.

509
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,410
Why is the door open?

510
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,320
Isn't anyone here?

511
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,690
Go through the outside passageway. Hurry!

512
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,750
Sorry.

513
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,370
What's this?

514
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,200
What is this?

515
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,200
Are you okay?

516
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,090
Get up.

517
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,680
The five billion was stolen. The thief is Jo Min Gyu.

518
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,250
Jo Min Gyu?

519
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,760
- All points bulletin!
- Yes.

520
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:47,370
Five billion won. The money used in Sim Jae Gyeong's kidnapping case.

521
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:50,900
I was wondering whose hand it was. It was you after all.

522
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,390
Hold it tight.

523
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,800
I got the five billion! I have the five billion in my hands.

524
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,790
Is that so? Good job.

525
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:20,860
The next mission is to take the money and escape.

526
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,750
What do you mean?

527
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,100
Thanks for calling me. You didn't have to.

528
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,510
What do you mean?

529
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:33,800
You knew.

530
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:39,170
When I got my hands on that money, I didn't intend to come back.

531
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,640
Since I broke the contract first,

532
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,400
the penalty fee and severance pay is five billion won.

533
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:54,900
While it lasted, it was a good game, wasn't it?

534
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,690
Our marriage?

535
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:01,500
No, no ... According to whom is the contract breached?

536
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,690
Thanks for your hard work.

537
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:14,220
Even so, I was quite ...

538
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:18,660
in our marriage ... I was happy.

539
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:24,030
Hello, Dear, Dear ...

00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:29,380

548
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:48,530
My husband got the money.

549
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:52,490
Where is your idiotic husband and what is he doing?

550
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:59,600
The two wives who faked happiness should quit here.

551
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:05,520
Really, it's not a beautiful breakup.

552
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,410
This is driving me crazy.

553
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,160
Honey.

554
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,590
I'm sorry.

555
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,670
Just where are you?

556
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,780
It's lost.

557
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,360
Where the heck are you?

558
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,530
I really wanted to find it.

559
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:45,270
But it's all been lost like this!

560
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,610
I'm sorry.

561
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,350
I'm sorry.

562
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,800
I'm sorry.

563
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,320
It's our home.

564
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,420
It's our home!

565
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,850
That humming is mine.

566
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:31,770
Since I've been listening to you all day, am I starting to copy you?

567
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:34,570
Maybe we're becoming alike since we're neighbors.

568
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,690
You shouldn't be laughing at the end.

569
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:50,720
Because you always had a hard time laughing.

570
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,230
♫ A casually broken promise ♫

571
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:33,320
My Dangerous Wife

572
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,050
I was curious what happened to that married couple.

573
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,320
What are you doing?

574
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,810
I said not to laugh!

575
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,180
No!

576
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,280
From where did things go wrong?

577
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,000
Am I unable to keep the oath I swore at N31?

578
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,730
There is no such thing as a sudden death.

579
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:55,560
It's a conclusion that started long ago.

580
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,420
Because by Kim Yun Cheol, in the end,

581
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:03,050
the one who remained by his side is Sim Jae Gyeong.
