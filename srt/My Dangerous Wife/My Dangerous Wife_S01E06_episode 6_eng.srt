1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,910

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,500
 Married Woman Abducted, Demand for 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
 Till death do we part... forever.

4
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,010
 My Dangerous Wife

5
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,350
- Here.
 - Wooo.

6
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,650
Here you go, Customer.

7
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,490
- Please have a taste.
 - Oh, but eating at night makes me gain weight.

8
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,480
Just a little bit.

9
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,720
It tastes great.

10
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,290
But isn't it too much for just us two?

11
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,100
Why is this open? Do I need to get a new car?

12
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,150
Stop it!

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,730
You... you... Why are you doing this?

14
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,560
To set you free, Seonbae.

15
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,380
At least you should find freedom. It's all over for me, anyway.

16
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,580
But I won't go alone.

17
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,720
I will kill this piece of trash first.

18
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,970
I told you! Don't do anything on your own!

19
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,700
Seonbae?

20
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,220
I told you from the beginning,

21
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,810
I don't care if I get caught.

22
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,540
You just have to tell them that all you did was help me because I asked you to.

23
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,320
No, I did it because I wanted to.

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,260
I did it all on my own.

25
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,690
I don't want to cause you any more harm.

26
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,630
Yu Min, even if I get caught, at worst, it's obstruction of justice and fraud.

27
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,200
And I'll get probation, at worst.

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,570
Why are you obsessed with a piece of trash like that?

29
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,520
Why?!

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,130
You...

31
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,250
Honey!

32
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,470
Are you alright, Honey?

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,570
I forgot to retrieve the spare key from him.

34
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,560
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

35
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,760
So you planned this with him, too?

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,870
You two have both gone crazy.

37
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,950
That is really not true. That won't happen.

38
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,360
I will protect you and this house, don't worry.

39
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,100
- I will leave this house right now. 
 - No, you can't.

40
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,560
Please stop!

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,630
Do you think I can endure this any longer?

42
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,340
You have to. We are married.

43
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,410
Married? Are you joking? This is marriage?

44
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,740
You are a monster.  I cannot live with a monster.

45
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,110
You're the one who created this monster.

46
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,410
Are you blaming me now?

47
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,230
Everyone expects the woman to stay behind the man even if the woman is more talented, don't they?

48
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,520
So I stayed behind you and played being the perfect wife perfectly.

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,130
I've done all sorts of things, and even stopped you from committing murder.

50
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,100
Are you getting an idea now of how much effort I've made all this time?

51
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,450
Gosh, I'm so grateful.

52
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,440
Because you are a very high maintenance man.

53
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,220
You are insane. You are not normal.

54
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,590
No, I'm the most normal I've ever been.

55
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,930
I am more myself now than I've ever been.

56
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,610
And I'm more focused on you and me than I've ever been.

57
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,950
Do you know how long it's been since we've stood face to face like this?

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,510
Stop saying such futile things.

59
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,590
We are finished now.

60
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,120
- What will you do about the wine? 
 - Do whatever you want to!

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,080
I wasn't really trying to kill you.

62
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,190
So the person who committed the bigger crime can decide what to do. We'll each get punished for our respective crimes.

63
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,910
Then what about the five billion won?

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
You need that money. I have the five billion won.

65
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,040
- You can have the five billion won.
 - Stop joking around.

66
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,460
That money was the price of my life.

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,970
You really did try to kill me.

68
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,060
You can't tell me you didn't try, can you?

69
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,660
And how could it be that wine?

70
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,680
At the very least, it shouldn't have been that wine.

71
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,490
I did want to kill you. I was suffocating, so I wished you were dead.

72
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,490
So I died, just as you wanted.

73
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,880
Why didn't you just let me die? Why did you save me?

74
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,990
Because I didn't really want to kill you.

75
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,550
I want to believe what you just said.

76
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,660
How would it have been, if I trusted you?

77
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,210
If I drank that wine?

78
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,760
But you never did trust me.

79
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,720
No, I couldn't trust you.

80
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
You didn't kill me with poison.

81
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,620
That smile.

82
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,560
The moment I saw that smile,

83
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,190
the me who wanted to trust you died.

84
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,510
 Prepare 5 billion won. If you report to the police, your wife will die. -N31-

85
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,800
Whenever I see your face now,

86
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,990
I remember that smile. Do you know how horrible that is?

87
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,590
We are finished.

88
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,890
No, we will begin again where we ended.

89
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,140
Do you really not understand? This is the end!

90
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,100
This is the end of the line.

91
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,300
Do you know where the true end is? When we both give up?

92
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,400
But I haven't yet. We will go further.

93
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,430
Why on earth?

94
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,990
Because I want to.

95
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,060
 Episode 6
 The Wife Who Flies Above the Running Husband

96
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,580
Congratulations for being released from the hospital, Auntie.

97
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,120
Thank you, Chae Rim.

98
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,290
Stop! Stop this!

99
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,860
What are you doing?

100
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,750
Did that shock you, Honey?

101
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,050
Aren't you happy you came home early like I told you to?

102
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,100
I brought roasted chicken.

103
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,560
Without the wings.

104
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,380
Oh, Mother, thank you.

105
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,530
- I'm late in congratulating you.
 - Thank you.

106
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,420
Chae Rim said she wanted to invite her Dad.

107
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,030
Don't use me to make your excuses.

108
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,470
I was worried she didn't have another man to invite here.

109
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,170
So I ran here quickly.

110
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,460
Please sit, please sit. Hold on for a moment.

111
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,510
Omo, hello. What brings you here?

112
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,540
Ah, yes, I am bringing you some paella to congratulate you on leaving the hospital.

113
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,110
We really enjoyed eating that.

114
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,770
Can you teach me the recipe?

115
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,970
Uh, the recipe?

116
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,600
Please teach me, too.

117
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,570
Aigoo, Chae Rim, are you bringing Dad some?

118
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,730
Your tastes haven't changed, huh?

119
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,750
Oh my baby.

120
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,640
Chae Rim, come here.

121
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,220
Then I should...

122
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,330
Oh, please leave it, let me clean that up.

123
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,570
No, it's fine. I should get going.

124
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,300
It would have been nice if Unni Eun Hye could join us.

125
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,720
Well, my wife hurt her back a little bit, so she is resting.

126
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,880
Omo, that's terrible.

127
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,030
Then, I'll be leaving now.

128
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,970
Yes, please get home safely.

129
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,460
Take care.

130
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,250
Gosh, who is the woman living with that gorgeous man?

131
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,950
The CEO of an internet shopping mall in her late forties.

132
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,320
- She's got skills, huh?
 - Oh, I'm envious.

133
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,840
If I lived with a husband like that, I would want for nothing.

134
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,670
"You just take care of your looks, Honey."

135
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,050
What a great role model you are for our daughter.

136
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,610
Oh, who are you? I don't know you.

137
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,300
 I'm following Song Yu Min?

138
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,710
 Be careful, and don't overdo it. 
 - Yun Cheol, you come here, too.

139
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,190
Brother-in-law? Is there some problem?

140
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,370
Aigoo, why call him 'brother-in-law?'

141
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,290
Brother-in-law? Why are you so pale?

142
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,320
Just a little stomach ache.

143
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,870
I hear that a portrait of Jae Gyeong was found in Song Yu Min's art studio?

144
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,800
Yes, he stalked her.

145
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,380
- What is that?
 - It's nail polish.

146
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,710
So the stalker abducted her?

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,790
But what if ... he wasn't just her stalker?

148
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,490
What if he was her assistant instead?

149
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,960
So if we consider that she plotted all this, like you were thinking...

150
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,720
So if we say that is true, then what do you think about that?

151
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,710
Appalled, of course.

152
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,950
It is unexpected. But isn't it a good thing?

153
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,900
You gave and received, after all.

154
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,550
Think about it in a positive way. In a way that is more advantageous to you.

155
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,240
You just have to make sure to get what you need.

156
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,150
So what is it that you need right now?

157
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,420
Trust and love between a husband and wife? No, not that corny stuff, I'm sure.

158
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,150
 Team Leader Jin

159
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,390
Excuse me, I have to speak to one of our vendors.

160
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,640
Yes, Mr. Kim? I was going to call you, but some family visited us at home.

161
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,150
Good news?

162
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,110
Good news. I found his hideout.

163
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,450
I even confirmed his room number.

164
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,240
Okay, great.

165
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,540
With this, the five billion won is ours.

166
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,460
Don't stay there and go home for now. That crazy guy has a knife.

167
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,560
He tried to kill me with it earlier today.

168
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,680
He had a knife? You weren't hurt?

169
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,320
I did get hurt.

170
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,970
A very small cut. And thanks to this cut, I came to my senses.

171
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,120
He really is a maniac.

172
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,830
Now that I know where Song Yu Min is, you take care of her phone.

173
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,180
Got it. In fact, this is good timing.

174
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,020
Okay.

175
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,150
Since we've all gathered and it's been a while,

176
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,910
how about some wine? Some good wine?

177
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,490
I wonder what good wine we have?

178
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,230
Which wine did you pick?

179
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,400
Please pick the one you like, Honey.

180
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,590
This looks good.

181
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,320
Why is my cell phone here?

182
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,280
You are so out of your mind that you can't tell your phone apart from bread.

183
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,490
But what a relief that you found it.

184
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,690
As you wish.

185
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,600
This is the delicious wine that my wife selected. It's a very delicious wine.

186
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,530
 Calls from Song Yu Min, 4 missed calls and a voicemail message

187
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,700
Here, have some wine, Brother-in-law.

188
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,570
Oh no, there are not enough glasses.

189
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,360
Seonbae, do you know where I am right now? Please hear it for yourself.

190
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Was the paella a hit?

191
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,460
Yeah.

192
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,570
It's good to watch from afar, isn't it?

193
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,020
The light coming out of someone else's window

194
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,600
seems especially warmer, somehow.

195
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,470
When you don't know what's going on inside that home, of course.

196
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,660
So, this month—

197
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,680
I'll turn in first.

198
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,260
 This month's deposit is late. Please send it by tomorrow.

199
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,030
 I'm sorry, I will send it within a few days.

200
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,970
♫  Your bickering every day is wearing me out. Damn  ♫

201
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,390
♫  The game is boring. No ummm.  ♫

202
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,210
♫  After a long night, in front of me was  ♫

203
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,360
♫  another boring scene. No ummm.  ♫

204
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,800
♫  I giddily think whether I have it or not.  ♫

205
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,600
♫  Your eyes shine differently from the start, you are shaking again  ♫

206
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,940
 (she's deleting the recording of Yu Min's attack in the garage)

207
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,260
♫  Oh, love me like you do  ♫

208
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,500
♫  We are a wall which has lost the way  ♫

209
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,330
 (Deleting file)

210
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,390
♫  Tell me what you want now  ♫

211
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,250
♫  I'm sick and tired  ♫

212
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,680
♫  Even if it's something which will light a fire in your heart  ♫

213
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,010
♫  In the change of heart which no one was aware of  ♫

214
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,630
♫  I might be going crazy  ♫

215
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,760
♫  At last you want me.  ♫

216
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
♫  Firmly set at  ♫

217
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,690
♫  Orange moonlight night  ♫

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,930
♫  At last you return my side  ♫

220
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,080
♫  Return my side  ♫

221
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,050
♫  You’re locked inside my heart now  ♫

222
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,920
♫  Orange-colored moonlight  ♫

223
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,270
♫  At last you return my side  ♫

224
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,890
♫  Return my side  ♫

225
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,700
 Bar SUD

226
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,020
It was unexpected.

227
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,290
That Yu Min would do something so excessive,

228
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,670
I really never imagined that.

229
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,470
I warned you that not everything will go as planned. Maybe you should stop now.

230
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,830
No. I will take this to the end.

231
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,690
This is just the beginning.

232
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,600
I swear it to N31.

233
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,720
Then you should be thoroughly prepared.

234
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,790
So what should I do?

235
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,430
If it were me, I would ask him to die.

236
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,000
 Je Chong Art Supply Store

237
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,960
 Seonbae?

238
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,010
 This really is the last time.

239
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,060
 Thank you.

240
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,350
 A little scuffle, last night.

241
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,770
 You just have to tell them that all you did was help me because I asked you to.

242
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,000
 I will protect you in my own way.
 In July, on a bench with Seonbae
 Seonbae's beautiful smile

243
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,280
Is this Yu Min?

244
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,460
Yes.

245
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,880
Do you want to meet now?

246
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,280
How is your injury?

247
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,170
It's fine.

248
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,830
What you did today, it wasn't like you.

249
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,200
I don't regret what I did.

250
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,540
If you need me to, I can change even more.

251
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,360
Yu Min.

252
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,760
We must return to where we both were now.

253
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,610
If you ever need my help with anything, tell me.

254
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,100
You're the one who needs help, Seonbae.

255
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,360
Leave that home. Seonbae,

256
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,630
come to me.

257
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,720
Now, for me, my original place is with you.

258
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,070
Please listen well and make a decision.

259
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,940
Then you will know what this original place for you really means.

260
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,690
 So, what we were talking about ...

261
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,240
 Now this, suddenly?

262
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,510
Do you still trust your husband?

263
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,030
Do you really believe that he has changed?

264
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,540
He has to change.

265
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,340
You should as well.

266
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,220
Don't worry about me, worry about yourself.

267
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,580
- Seonbae.
 - Don't worry about me, I said.

268
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,030
Not sleeping, Honey?

269
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,900
Have you ever seen our neighbor lady drive before?

270
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,510
I don't think I have.

271
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,470
We should become closer to our neighbors.

272
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,670
There are so many things we don't know.

273
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,750
Are we close?

274
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,360
What more would you like to know?

275
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,040
Just,

276
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,960
it's nice to get along and not keep secrets.

277
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,800
What about you, Honey? Isn't there something you are hiding from me?

278
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,200
♫  We are travelling on the same train
 Both of us. Both of us  ♫

279
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,880
♫  Both of us. Both of us  ♫

280
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,370
♫  And we are going in the same direction  ♫

281
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,570
♫  Both of us. Both of us  ♫

282
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,220
♫  But I, I don't know you  ♫

283
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,590
♫  And you, you don't know me  ♫

284
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:59,280
♫  But in a short time, that will change  ♫

285
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,930
Didn't you say you will take that to the police?

286
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,890
You do it.

287
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,290
You do it. And tell them whatever is more advantageous for you.

288
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,960
So what do you plan to do now?

289
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,190
I just want an ordinary life with you.

290
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,550
Ordinary? Does that make any sense now?

291
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,410
Do you not realize that this is a chance for us?

292
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:40,280
Our last chance for us to start over.

293
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,790
 Or perhaps the only chance I have left to run away.

294
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,110
Have a good day at work.

295
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,400
Our neighbors aren't home.

296
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,550
I may not be able to come by the restaurant to help today.

297
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,830
Good thinking. Rest.

298
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,070
- You found this in your bedroom?
 - Yes.

299
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,100
We can only conclude that the abductor put it there.

300
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,480
Yes, probably.

301
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,720
Did you find this yourself?

302
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,660
No, my wife found it.

303
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,230
She said the angle of the outlet's wall plate was off, so she examined it,

304
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,950
and that's how she found it. My wife has

305
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,390
always been very meticulous and neat.

306
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,980
Did you install CCTV inside the home?

307
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,140
No, not yet.

308
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,680
If you had that one thing, everything would be solved.

309
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,630
Yes, I will discuss it with my wife.

310
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,600
I better go to work now.

311
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,210
Yes.

312
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,660
How meticulous is she that she can see that the angle of the wall plate is off?

313
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,330
It's certainly unusual.

314
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,140
But thinking back, the site was excessively clean.

315

 Invitation: Masterpieces from Unknown Artists Discovered Online

316

 I really hope that you will come, Seonbae.

317
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,790
 If you don't take care of this debt, there will be difficulties.

318
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,200
 Please take care of the principal balance and interest as soon as possible. 
-Gentleman Capital-

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,610
 Endure it. We are married.

321
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,440
Today we are having perilla seed porridge.

322
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,620
 My always-smiling wife, I can never know what she's really thinking.

323
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,650
What brings you here so early in the morning?

324
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,780
What if you catch me cheating on you?

325
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,470
What do you mean? I will kill you.

326
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,380
Oh, I see.

327
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,390
This tastes good. Let me eat.

328
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,410
Let me eat, I said!

329
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,910
 Let's breathe freely.

330
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,410
 We'll take revenge on your wife by stealing the five billion won.

331
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,690
 Standing by all day.

332
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,670
 My only hope.

333
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,780
 Jin Seon Mi, fighting.

334
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,830
 Masterpieces from Unknown Artists Discovered Online
 Museum of Mika

335
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,430
You've never met the artist while preparing for this exhibition?

336
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,980
No, this exhibition is for artists found on social media, so some have submitted their work anonymously.

337
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,670
You've never even spoken to him on the phone?

338
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,110
No, this artist is known for never showing his face, so we were hoping to meet him

339
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,460
at the opening of the exhibition, actually.

340
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,250
 #Buyeong-dong Abduction
 #Song Yu Min

341
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,260
It's that work over there.
  #The relationship between crime and art

342
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,290
- Ah, yes.
 - Please excuse us.

343
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,210
 The Wife

344
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,940
He's doing as he pleases.

345
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,460
We will have to hurry.

346
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,600
 July 10 Thursday

347
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,800
 I think he's finally moving!

348
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,740
 Wait until I arrive.

349
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,330
I made my last request.

350
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,450
He won't deviate from the plan again, will he?

351
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,580
Don't worry, things will go according to plan.

352

♫  I see and trust only you  ♫

353

♫  There was a time like that  ♫

354
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:34,560
♫  A dream-like time  ♫

355
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,040
♫  I know the next story which only you don't know  ♫

356
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,570
You really have nerves of steel.

357
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,690
Even coming to the exhibition of your abductor's artwork.

358
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,760
What do you mean, abduction?

359
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,060
I don't think of it that way.

360
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,440
I trust in him.

361
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,300
I see that is so.

362
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,520
It's the opening of his exhibition,

363
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,160
but apparently, the artist himself can't be here, right?

364
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,050
I would love to meet him, even by chance, Artist Song Yu Min.

365
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,070
- Excuse me?
 - Yes?

366
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,980
You haven't cleaned this room.

367
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,270
- I'm sorry, I'll do it right away.
 - Never mind, please just bring the fresh towels.

368
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,260
- I had left something behind.
 - I exchanged your towels.

369
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,620
- Thank you. Please clean this room tomorrow.
 - Yes.

 I'm almost there.

380
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:22,030
Just wait, I'm coming.

381
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,320
The green light is now on in my life.

382
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,450
Why won't she answer my calls?

383
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,980
What? Is she screwing me over?

384
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,470
Oh, you startled me.

385
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,430
- Why won't you answer my calls?
 - Kim Yun Cheol!

386
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,610
Why are you shouting at me?

387
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,780
I almost died because of you, do you know that?

388
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,170
What? What did I do?

389
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,950
Why would you send a text message at that time?

390
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:24,030
Did you ... did you go into that guy's room without me?

391
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,490
You're not trying to take the whole five billion won for yourself, are you?

392
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,700
Yes, sure, that's what I was doing.

393
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,890
We are so out of sync, could we even get five cents?

394
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,630
I'm obviously crazy. F*ck.

395
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,210
F*ck? Jeez.

396
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,930
Did you just cuss at me?

397
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,130
Oh, is my honey's pride hurt?

398
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,220
You're so slow, I had to step up.

399
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,210
You're always going here and there, we don't have time.

400
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,020
You can't do anything without me.

401
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,890
What did you say? I can't do anything?

402
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,150
And must I hear that from you, too?

403
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,510
If you don't like it, return.  Return to your perfect, psycho wife.

404
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,950
Jin Seon Mi, you are really...

405
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,450
Really what? ( room key card)

406
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,900
You are really

407
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,980
amazing. Wow.

408
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,470
Now it's your turn to show what you can do.

409
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,750
Don't worry and just trust in me.

410
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,300
- Which floor? 
 - 502

411
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,050
502, okay.

412
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,820
- What? 
 - Be quiet. Quiet.

413
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,800
- Song Yu Min showed up. 
 - What?

414
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:54,480
What? You said he left just a little while ago.

415
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,460
I know. He's going in and out so often.

416
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,560
What do we do now?

417
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,210
But for now, we have the key, so let's think this over.

418
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:24,490
For today, retreat. Let's withdraw.

419
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,370
 I have a request of you.

420
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,910
Yu Min.

421
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,010
Yes, Seonbae?

422
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,990
I saw your exhibition artwork.

423
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,840
You went?

424
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,980
Are you ready?

425
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,440
Yes.

 It should not have been that wine... that this wine would end my life, who could...

 L'Amour Eternel

00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,290
 Perhaps eternal love shouldn't be made carelessly...

433
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,790
 Till death do us part...

434
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,240
You're home?

435
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,900
What will you write before you give up again?

436
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,890
I am going to finish this one.

437
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,810
Genre?

438
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,380
A married couple thriller.

439
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,780
Content?

440
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,450
A wife is abducted.

441
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:46,280
But it turns out, she planned all of it herself.

442
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,180
Is the title perhaps

443
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,450
"Please Don't Look for Me?"
  (T/N: In Korea, the official title of the movie "Gone Girl" is "Please Look for Me.")

444
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:58,460
You're not uploading that somewhere or trying to enter some writing contest, are you?

445
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,500
I'm going to upload it to the police website and put your name down as the author.

446
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,230
Can't you just write it and keep it to yourself, like a diary?

447
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,110
You won't complain that no one is reading it or that you were rejected by the writing contest, and sink into hysteria—

448
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,780
Hysteria?

449
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:15,630
Looks like you misunderstood me. I'm talking about the  history  of your story...

450
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,840
I'm tired.

451
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,760
Mr. Seo Ji Tae?

452
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,730
How about putting that in the laundry basket?

453
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,120
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,100
Take your socks off, too. Don't turn them inside out.

455
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,560
Yes.

456
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,200
- Take a shower, too. 
 I will.

457

 Samoyed

458
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,370
You're home?

459
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,770
You seem so busy lately.

460
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:58,130
I had some things to take care of at the company.

461
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,600
Everyone's crying that they miss me there.

462
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,580
Is that a new product you're launching? Is that mine?

463
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,900
No, I charged this on a credit card, for myself.

464
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,790
I haven't shopped in a while, so I felt the itch.

465
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,610
Good job.

466
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,680
Sorry.

467
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,470
Let's go together for a shopping spree soon.

468
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,050
What did you do today, Honey?

469
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,010
Me?

470
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,450
Thought about a business plan.

471
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,960
I'm hoping that you can take a rest from work.

472
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,480
You can't work in another job.

473
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,820
But I should prepare to be on my own, too.

474
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,220
If you take another job, that will be in breach of our contract.

475
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,600
Be faithful to me only.

476
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,220
"Amour." (2012 film)

477
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,770
Do you remember that movie?

478
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:27,180
The husband ends up killing his wife who is suffering from dementia.

479
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,490
But it was like he was killing himself.

480
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,220
Could you do the same?

481
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,220
That's a movie.

482
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,940
It made me think that I could marry if it was for that kind of love.

483
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,760
To protect each other until the end,

484
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,710
and to entrust him with my final moment.

485
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,660
Isn't that so beautiful?

486
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,890
No thanks. I can't do that.

487
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,600
I can protect you until the final moment.

488
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,690
No thanks to that, too.

489
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,510
You can't refuse.

490
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,210
You swore on this wine.

491
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,790
L'Amour Eternel.

492
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:14,950
Till death do us part, forever.

493
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,400
 L'Amour Eternel

494
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,910
I'm going to keep that promise.

495
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,850
No matter what I have to do.

496
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,830
 L' Amour Eternel

497
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,260
Sit down.

498
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,210
But I'm a little tired.

499
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,180
Just one glass.

500
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,120
Alright, just one glass.

501
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,800
Alright.

502
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,690
Drink.

503
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,990
 The clinking of our glasses together.

504
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:56,580
 This is the last time.

505
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,430
Oh, my head.

506
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:36,160
 I'll go to work first and practice roasting beans.

507
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:17,900
 Old Crop

508
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,960
Here is a delivery.

509
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,390

 Old Crop Restaurant
 From: Coffee Mill
 Jongno-Gu

510
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:33,380
Sign here, please.

511
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:51,660
 Samoyed

512
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,660
 It's finally in my hands.

513
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,090
 Successful revenge.

514
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:06,240
 That there is infinite happiness hidden inside the black world of coffee,

515
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,760
 My husband said this.

516
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,840
 It is definitely just as he said.

517
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:31,180
♫   What can I do for your love?  Crazy every day, without you   ♫

518
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:36,060
♫   A silent cry, I'll let you go away   ♫

519
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,690
 I knew that my husband was secretly following me. 
♫   From me.  I know  ♫

520
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:42,080
 And that he was after the money, also. 
♫   You know, we know   ♫

521
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,790
 Don't look to the right.  My husband is following me.
 ♫   Nothing is eternal   ♫

522
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,000
♫   I know, you know, we know.  So far away   ♫

523
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,740
 That's why I showed him the money. 
♫   Far way, get away   ♫

524
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,990
 That there really was five billion won.

525
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:03,810
♫   Far away, get away right now  ♫

526
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,300
♫   Far away, get away   ♫

527
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,760
 You surprised me, Honey!

528
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,370
♫   Far away, get away right now   ♫

529
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:22,850
♫   Without you, without you   ♫

530
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,680
♫   Far away, get away right now   ♫

531
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,900
 Fresh coffee will get delivered early in the morning.

532
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,670
 Delivery Expected: 7/9/2020
 7:00 AM

533
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:35,080
 My husband, who has a bad hangover, will not be able to wake up at that time.

534
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,050
 When my husband has a goal, he becomes kind and close to my ideal man.

535
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:44,090
 I need this money to do things according to my plan.

536
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:49,350
 It's the lifeline that will tether my husband and preserve my marriage.

537
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,630
♫  I know you know we know  ♫

538
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,700
♫  I know it can't be undone  ♫

539
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:08,740
 An unopened bean bag is the best place to hide a secret. 
♫   I know, you know, we know.  So far away   ♫

540
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,940
♫   Far away, get away   ♫

541
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,640
 In the past, my husband used to tell me often about the charms of coffee.

542
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,080
 Though he kept talking about the same thing, I liked that face. 
♫   Far away, get away right now   ♫

543
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,360
  Because he seemed like a little boy.

544
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:27,500
♫   Far away, get away   ♫

545
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,050
 The true story starts now.

546
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:34,560
 Actually, I don't like coffee.
 ♫   Far away, get away right now

547
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,220
♫   Without you, without you   ♫

548
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,360
♫   Far away, get away   ♫

549
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:51,930

550
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,150
Please step back.

551
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,970
♫   Your bickering everyday is wearing me out, damn   ♫

552
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:14,570
♫   The game is boring, no umm   ♫

553
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:18,210
♫   After a long night, in front of me   ♫

554
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,660
♫   Was another boring scene   ♫

555
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,870
 Whatever the reason, not keeping a promise 
♫   I giddily think whether I have it or not   ♫

556
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:28,780
 Is unforgivable. 
♫   Your shining eyes are different from the start, you're shaking again   ♫

557
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,530
♫   Love me like you do.  We're a wall that lost its way  ♫

558
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:36,440
♫   Tell me what you want now.  Tell me what you want now  ♫

559
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,990
♫   I'm sick and tired  ♫

560
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:42,650
 A dead end. The edge of a cliff.

561
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,550
 The end of the line was not far away.

562
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:48,070
♫   At last you want me.  Locked inside my heart   ♫

563
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,830
 It's right in front of my eyes. 
♫   Orange moonlight   ♫

564
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:53,700
♫   At last you return my side   ♫

565
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,370
♫   At last return my side   ♫

566
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,890
♫   At last return my side   ♫

567
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,040
♫   You're locked inside my heart now   ♫

568
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,650
♫   Orange moonlight.  At last you return my side   ♫

569
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:13,320
♫   Our crazy relationship really is strange, like a psycho.  Struggling, you try to read my face   ♫

570
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:18,020
♫  Tingling Tingling you hope. The devil whispers to me.  ♫

571
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,300
♫   Tell me what you want right now   ♫

572
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,960
 My Dangerous Wife

573
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,300
 Did she...? Did my wife plan this, too?

574
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:31,730
 CCTV around this area, fingerprints, footprints, hair, make sure to scrape every last thing that may involve Kim Yun Cheol.

575
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,820
 You reported me?

576
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,360
 This is for your sake.

577
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,470
 We finally meet. You're curious how much we know, aren't you?

578
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:42,060
 I'm sorry.  I did something I shouldn't have.

579
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:47,160
 Bring me the money now, or I will kill you.

580
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,260
 Will you return it to me?

581
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,420
 My five billion won.

582
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,680
♫   At last return my side   ♫

583
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,320
♫   At last return my side   ♫
