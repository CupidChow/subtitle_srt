1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,120

2
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,060
 My Dangerous Wife

3
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,230
 You gave me a final opportunity.

4
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,710
 I will think of it as alimony and accept it gratefully.

5
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,430
 I'll give up my husband to you, you may have him. You two should try to do well together.

6
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,820
 There's an important clause - Until the divorce is finalized, she has requested that you don't go overseas or any place far where you can't be reached.

7
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,610
 What... did I...

8
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,410
 This kidnapping was planned to take revenge on the husband who was having an affair and his mistress.

9
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:13,660
 Ms. Sim Jae Gyeong, you are the culprit.

10
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,360
 That is your imagination, Detective.

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,780
 Do you know the man who was your wife's tutor when she was in high school?

12
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,690
 I investigated him, and he is currently operating a bar.

13
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,840
 N31. Then the culprit really is...

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,710
 My husband found out about our relationship.

15
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,330
 You are now getting ready to go to that man.

16
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,590
 You will have to make me a new poison to kill my husband.

17
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,910
 The most effective way would be a preemptive strike. A good defense.

18
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,140
 When you can't avoid it, counteroffensive is the only answer.

19
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,380
 I wondered if it could be true, and it is true.

20
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,260
 - What's wrong? Are you alright? 
 - I tried to poison you.

21
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:01,960
  No, no! If I tried to eat the poisoned spare ribs, you would have stopped me too.

22
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,150
I'm really sorry for involving you in something like this.

23
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,850
I'm really sorry for involving you in something like this.  We, as a couple, did truly bad things to you.

24
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,460
It's alright. This is how things turned out.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,800
What are you two up to right now?

26
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,920
Seon Mi.

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,190
Seon Mi!

28
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,800
Seon Mi, what's wrong? Seon Mi. Oh my god!

29
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,000
- Jin Seon Mi! 
 - Seon Mi.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,250
Oh my god Seon Mi. What do we do? Seon Mi.

31
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,610
- Seon Mi. What do we do?
 - JinSeon Mi, are you okay?

32
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,270
Seon Mi. What do we do, Seon Mi.

33
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,900
Seon Mi, come to your senses.

34
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,860
Seon Mi. What do we do?

35
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,440
Hey, Seon Mi. Jin Seon Mi!

36
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,160
Hold on a second.

37
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,640
There was poison in the potato?

38
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,510
You weren't trying to kill me, were you?

39
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,840
No, I was just going to put a little but you kept using it as salt and sprinkling it everywhere and—

40
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,880
So you planned this again against me?

41
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,500
Ambulance. The ambulance first.

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,000
Did you increase the dosage? I asked if you increased the dosage of the Adokicin!

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,450
What do we do? Then it's too late.

44
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,650
What are we going to do?

45
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,920
But,

46
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,880
you weren't able to kill me either.

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,160
You couldn't kill me either, right? And that's why you prevented me from eating it.

48
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,750
Right? Right?

49
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,190
- More than that, we should— 
- Answer me!
Yeah, you're right!

50
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,590
Yes, yes, you're right.

51
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,880
Since this already happened, we can't do anything.

52
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,060
We need to join forces and find a way.

53
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,570
What?

54
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,420
 Episode 13 - Accomplice Couple

55
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,930
- Why is Brother-in-law here so late? 
 - What do we do?

56
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,130
What do we do?

57
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,260
Don't open the door.

58
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,830
We can't. The lights are on in the house, so we can't pretend that no one is here.

59
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,810
- I'll take it from here, you take care of him. 
 - What are you going to do, there's still—

60
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,770
- Hurry! 
- Okay 
 - Hurry it up!

61
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,420
- Okay, I will. I will. 
 - Hold on, shoes.

62
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,670
- Shoes, shoes. Don't forget the shoes. 
 - Okay, shoes...

63
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,730
- Hold on. 
 -That's right.

64
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,420
What are you doing here? I heard you're getting a divorce from Jae Gyeong.

65
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,010
Oh, that... it... Ouch.

66
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,060
- What? Is something wrong? 
 - No,

67
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,150
- but what are you doing here? 
 - Jae Gyeong is home, right?

68
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,100
- Why?  
- I have something to discuss with her.

69
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,980
Wait a sec.

70
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,230
What's wrong? Do you have something to say?

71
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,690
Brother-in-law, do you want to go out and have a drink with me?

72
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,200
I came here because I needed to discuss something with Jae Gyeong.

73
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,550
Wait, hold on. Don't go in.

74
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,990
You were in the middle of dinner?

75
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,690
Where's Jae Gyeong?

76
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,950
She's out.

77
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,510
That's why I said, let's go out and have a drink together.

78
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,520
Shrimp, I miss you!

79
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,770
No, you can't!

80
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:48,810
It's... it's all cold so it's not tasty anymore. Did you not eat?

81
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:40,040
It works! I told you that I look exactly like Mom.

82
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,930
No, I look like Mom too!

83
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,390
- Hey, let's take a picture together.  
 - Okay!

84
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,840
- Are you going to keep staking out here? 
 - Hold on.

85
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,930
What's this?

86
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,630
You said that every time you see them, it looks like they grew. You raised them without lifting a finger.

87
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,580
What do you mean without lifting a finger. I raised them   by giving up my youth.

88
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,140
You should say it right. It's your wife's youth that went up in flames raising them.

89
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,900
 Booyeong-dong Kidnapping, Star chef's Wife Sim Jae Gyeong

 Sim Jae Gyeong - Victim of the Kidnapping Case

93
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,470
Shower time everyone, shower...

94
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,530
Hey, hey I told you not to touch your mom's phone, right?

95
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,680
Mom. Your Face ID works with my face!

96
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,510
Why doesn't it work with mine? I look more like you, Mom.

97
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,190
- You look like Dad. 
 - No,  I don't.

98
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,670
Don't fight, don't fight!

99
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,720
If you touch my phone without my permission in the future, you're going to be in big trouble, okay?

100
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,130
- Okay! 
 - Shower time then, go go.

101
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,910
Mom will shampoo you guys as a service, go!

102
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,460
What's wrong? Did your wife tell you not to come back home?

103
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,410
- What do you think about my wife? 
 - She's a savior.

104
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,540
She's someone patient enough to live with someone like you.

105
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,170
What's wrong? Is something really going on at home?

106
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,500
Well... maybe?

107
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,060
So you don't want to go home. You sure say that in such an evasive way.

108
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,680
Hey, what are you doing? Where are we going?

109
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,320
Today, you must go home early no matter what. I will give you a ride.

110
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,870
Do you know how this feels? You don't know what's going on, but you don't want to know?

111
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,240
Your wife is a bigger puzzle for me than you are, Seonbae.

112
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,840
How she can bear to live with a spouse who knows nothing except for work.

113
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,020
I am informing you that your time to return home is coming up.

114
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,970
Hey, hey!

115
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,490
I'm hungry. Buy me chicken.

116
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,900
Tomorrow, we'll eat some tomorrow.  Look at this. I told you to scrub it well.

117
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Come here, it's still there.

118
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,850
- What are you doing there?
 - Dad!

119
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,670
- Mom, did you buy shoes?
 - Dad, you're like the prince in "Cinderella."

120
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,680
Mom, see if that fits, try it on.

121
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,530
It's fine.

122
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,080
Boys, hurry and get dressed. You'll get a cold.

123
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,320
Stay in here, getting dressed, okay?

124
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,400
- Where did you get these shoes?
 - I bought them.

125
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,460
- This is a luxury brand and only a few were sold in Korea.
 - Why? Can't I have luxury brand shoes?

126
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,030
That's not what I'm saying, is it?

127
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,900
I bought it at a used luxury goods trading website. Okay?

128
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,050
Listen carefully. So you bought this at a used goods market. Fine.

129
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,580
Is the seller Sim Jae Gyeong?

130
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,900
Did you two arrange that? Are you two close enough to share shoes?

131
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,130
Did you know what kind of shoes these are when you received them?

132
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,270
I have no idea what you are saying.

133
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,730
Fine, you're researching the novel that you are writing.

134
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:16,100
But not with that woman. She is not someone you can deal with. She is very dangerous.

135
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,160
Honey, what are you imagining?

136
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,950
These shoes were worn by a suspect in a murder.

137
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,710
Sim Jae Gyeong is the suspect in Song Yu Min's murder, do you know that?

138
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,020
No. I'm sure that isn't true.

139
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,990
Just like you right now, Song Yu Min was used, and...

140
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,050
Let's talk about this later.

141
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,310
 To be honest, both of us,

142
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,850
 we no longer need that man, Kim Yun Cheol, do we?

143
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,980
 Sure, let's join hands.

144
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,240
There is a back story for our plan. I just recorded what we both just said.

145
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,080
- What do you mean?
 - Play this recording for my husband.

146
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:14,180
♫  I see and trust only you  ♫

147
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,580
♫  There was a time like that  ♫

148
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,070
♫  A dream-like time  ♫

149
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:35,550
♫  The next story that only you don't know, I know it well  ♫

150
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,980
♫  You and I are now  ♫

151
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,290
♫  make the perfect picture  ♫

152
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,330
♫  which I dreamed of  ♫

153
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:58,830
♫  Forever  ♫

154
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,830
You did it, didn't you?

155
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,060
You hid my shoes, didn't you?

156
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,850
 Only about 100 pairs were distributed for sale in Korea.

157
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,350
 We've confirmed that it was sold at a nearby specialty shop.

158
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,760
 Can we look in your shoe closet?

159
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,870
 But hasn't it been a while since you've worn such high heels?

160
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,540
 Yes, my ankles hurt.

161
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,090
So you already knew, didn't you?

162
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:26,490
Since when? Since when did you know?

163
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,200
Know what? What am I supposed to know?

164
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,740
I just put it away because I thought it might cause trouble.

165
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,780
Gosh, so many bothersome and troublesome things happen because of our next-door neighbors.

166
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,540
I'm going to rest now.

167
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,620
Jae Gyeong is late. She said she would return soon.

168
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,900
I know. It feels like she should have been back by now.

169
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,290
Where did she go, anyway?

170
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,010
Maybe something happened? Maybe we should report this?

171
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,480
No, you can't!

172
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,610
I can't? Why not?

173
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,520
Well, because...

174
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,590
I'll tell you honestly.

175
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,010
- What?
 - The truth is,

176
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,390
before the official meeting for our divorce,

177
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,150
we decided to talk about things over a meal together.

178
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,050
And?

179
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,200
But we ended up having a big fight.

180
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,160
A big fight, huh?

181
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,170
But you are not the one who left, but Jae Gyeong?

182
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,550
Yes, sorry. I think that maybe she won't return home today.

183
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,630
Then I'll come back.

184
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,020
Be careful on your way home.

185
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,210
See you again later.

186
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,220
 Husband

187
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,510
Where did you go, Sim Jae Gyeong?

188
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,370
♫  You wouldn’t know that I’ve got you now, in no time, you  ♫

189
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,590
♫  Without knowing  ♫

190
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,830
♫  You dare tear all my heart apart.  ♫

191
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,540
♫  Fearless you, right?  ♫

192
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,090
♫  the dark, endless night  ♫

193
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,220
 What are you two trying to do, anyway?

194
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,410
♫  I have put you in my hand  ♫

195
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,160
♫  You try to run away  ♫

196
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,080
 Seon Mi.

197
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,310
♫  You are circling in my maze  ♫

198
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,920
 Jin Seon Mi!

199
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,760
♫  You’re trapped alone in an endless tunnel  ♫

200
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,690
♫  Yeah no one gonna hide you now  ♫

201
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,110
♫  You better move. Run.  ♫

202
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,590
 Come to the garage.

203
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,860
What about Seon Mi?

204
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,190
Bring me the saw.

205
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,590
S-s... saw?

206
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,630
Let's cut it into the smallest pieces possible and put it in the regular trash.

207
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,150
Today is the trash pickup day.

208
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,890
Hold on.

209
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,270
This goes in the regular trash, doesn't it? Wooden chopsticks go in the regular trash.

210
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,050
Right?

211
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,660
Please take care of this.

212
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,080
What's wrong with you?

213
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,340
Are you not aware of this situation? We have to take care of this as soon as possible.

214
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,120
Fine, I'll take care of this. You clean the trunk.

215
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,020
Got it?

216
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,250
Here, take this.

217
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,470
There could be blood in there, so use the alkaline cleanser to thoroughly clean it.

218
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,810
When did you get this?

219
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,460
I bought it on my way there.

220
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,570
On your way where?

221
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,760
Do you really not know?

222
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,760
Honey, what are you doing?

223
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,230
Out of my way.

224
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,010
Honey.

225
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,990
Honey.

226
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,590
Yes?

227
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,490
Honey, how can you do this?

228
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,370
Honey, how can you act so normal?

229
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,540
I don't feel normal.

230
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,970
I'm scared, but it can't be helped, can it?

231
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,380
We...

232
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,930
No...

233
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,580
I...

234
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,250
I caused Seon Mi to die.

235
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,850
Honey.

236
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,400
I transported a dead body

237
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,030
so we are accomplices.

238
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,630
Moving a dead body...

239
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:20,890
Feeling scared, and feeling agony,

240
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,940
if we share those burdens, it will be easier.

241
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,400
So don't worry, Honey. Don't worry.

242
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:33,010
I will protect you.

243
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,390
Honey? Honey.

244
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,760
It's alright.

245
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,400
It's alright.

246
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,490
It's okay.

247
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
You take walks in the evenings, too?

248
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,920
Don't be involved anymore. With this house, or with me.

249
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,170
What does that mean?

250
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,690
When Sim Jae Gyeong was abducted

251
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,200
why did mail sent by the abductor end up at our home by mistake?

252
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,430
Things have gone wrong since then.

253
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,860
Stop your involvement.

254
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,720
It's not like that.

255
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,420
What are you doing?

256
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,080
I will protect you.

257
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,430
Whatever you had planned, stop right now.

258
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,530
It's too late.

259
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,480
So you already knew everything, didn't you?

260
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,770
That I

261
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,770
killed Song Yu Min— 
 - Song Yu Min committed suicide.

262
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,390
When did you know?

263
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,590
When you heard that her abduction was fake

264
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,200
you went to see Song Yu Min.

265
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,090
 Two days before Song Yu Min's death

266
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,960
 You!  Why are you doing this?

267
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,660
 To set you free, Seonbae.

268
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,530
 At least you should find freedom. It's all over for me, anyway.

269
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,290
 I told you! Don't do anything on your own!

270
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,070
 You just have to tell them that all you did was help me because I asked you to.

271
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,950
 No, I did it because I wanted to.

272
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,290
 I did it all on my own.

273
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,700
 Why are you obsessed with a piece of trash like that?

274
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,610
 Why?!

275
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,550
 You ...

276
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,030
 What will you do?

277
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,710
 This is fun, I'll just look a little bit more.

278
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,390
The next night, you came home late.

279
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,090
And then you left home again, early in the morning.

280
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,050
So I thought, "Something is going on."

281
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,390
 The day of Song Yu Min's death

282
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,560
And seeing your pale face that morning,

283
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,350
I realized right away that something really was going on.

284
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,560
 Don't over work. You're in poor shape immediately after.

285
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,670
 Suspect Mr. Song's corpse was found near his dwelling in Jongno-gu.

286
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:48,740
 The National Forensic Service is investigating with both suicide and homicide as possibilities—

287
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,940
 Why did you turn that off?

288
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,150
 It's disturbing, so...

289
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:59,520
The moment I saw the news that Song Yu Min died, I got a feeling.

290
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,420
I wondered if maybe you did it.

291
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,840
How did it happen?

292
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,490
I followed him until the the end.

293
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,740
Good news! I found out the location.

294
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,960
With that, 50 billion won is ours!

295
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,750
If it's money that's going to disappear anyway,

296
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,140
I thought that I could take the opportunity too.

297
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,170
I changed into clothes I had bought beforehand.

298
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,650
I got into clothes that looked like the mistress' so that she can be accused as the culprit.

299
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,260
As similar as it could be to look like hers.

300
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,790
The door was open.

301
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,850
What are you doing?

302
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,030
You're...

303
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,060
I know what you and Sim Jae Gyeong did.

304
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,260
What are you talking about?

305
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,970
I heard everything.

306
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,300
I heard it all.  I heard everything you guys talked about in the garage.

307
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,130
I just barely escaped...

308
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,160
If you want to protect both yourself and Sim Jae Gyeong,

309
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,520
then give me the five billion won.

310
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,890
You and I can both die.

311
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:32,740
I already sent in my suicide note, let's just end it all here.

312
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,250
No, no! Don't come near me!

313
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,730
No!

314
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,720
No!

315
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,580
Me ...

316
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,700
It wasn't me.

317
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,900
I wiped away my fingerprints and ran away from that room.

318
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,010
Why did you just keep your heels that would be evidence?

319
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,770
You don't care, do you?

320
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,010
But, why did you cover for me?

321
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,040
I told you, it's because I don't want things getting complicated.

322
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,840
Now it's over.  That's enough.

323
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,730
There's nothing worse that can happen.

324
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,230
So,

325
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,010
just pack your stuff up and leave immediately.

326
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:00,790
This is the end for us.

327
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,950
I don't intend to terminate the contract midway.

328
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,720
And after four more years,

329
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,150
it's the end.

330
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,570
You know, though,

331
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,850
that I don't have money anymore.

332
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:33,700
That's why we should find a way together.

333
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,690
Open that.

334
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,860
  I know that you killed your mistress last night.   Get 5 billion won ready

335
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,860
  and meet me at the park at midnight tonight.

336
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,060
I've been wiretapping Kim Yun Cheol's house.

337
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,670
Those people are truly a whack-o couple.

338
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,060
They just poisoned Jin Seon Mi.

339
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,740
Isn't this huge?

340
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,440
Are you okay?

341
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,880
Weren't you and Jin Seon Mi dating?

342
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,180
I only approached her for the goal of obtaining 5 billion won and using her,

343
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,150
but she only got used by that coupe and died.

344
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,380
Either way, you're going to help, right?

345
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,620
We're a married couple.

346
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:46,000
We're going to steal the five billion won.

347
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,170
Do it! Do it Do it!

348
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,240
Sir, why isn't Manager Jin here?

349
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,740
She left to see her parents and take a break.

350
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:46,900
You can't say it like you're reading the lines, you have to make it more natural.

351
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,890
If it's hard to say something, just beat around the bush and say you'll tell them more at a later time.

352
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,270
I...

353
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,380
I don't think I can do this. I'm not confident.

354
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,300
- Honey.
 - We should just turn ourselves in.

355
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,740
I don't think this is right.

356
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,710
What about your mother? Your sister? Chae Rim?

357
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:13,450
If you get arrested, what's going to happen to the restaurant?

358
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,270
Mother-in-law's chicken restaurant will have to close too.

359
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,070
This isn't just a problem between us.

360
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,610
Okay, okay.

361
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,370
-N31-

362
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,800
 Get 5 billion won ready. I know you killed Jin Seon Mi.  -N31-

363
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,750
Go inside. Go inside.

364
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,850
What's going on with them?

365
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,990
I didn't do it.

366
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,750
-N31-

367
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,870
What happened?

368
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,690
There is another enemy we do not know.

369
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:39,130
We are surrounded by enemies. Why?

370
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,550
And what is with this N31? Is this another trick you're playing?

371
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,910
No, no, no.

372
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,080
No, someone is watching us

373
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,800
and pretending to be N31.

374
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,500
So who? Why?

375
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,410
For now, you bring back the five billion won.

376
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:59,550
And go to the restaurant and do your work as usual.

377
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:04,230
Be careful. Someone else is after the five billion won.

378
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,600
It's alright.

379
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,830
We agreed to join forces.

380
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,810
So it will be alright.

381
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,080
We are safe.

382
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,740
That's great.  We can blow our noses without using our hands.

383
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,800
- We can just intercept the money in the middle. 
 - In the middle?

384
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,050
We don't know who did it, but someone threw the bait. And whether they take the bait or run, the money will move.

385
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,570
What will you do?

386
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:04,290
We have to find out where the five billion won is and intercept it.

387
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,420
Will it work?

388
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,510
It's fine.

389
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,780
If we work together, it's possible.

390
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,350
Do you want the cell phone?

391
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,570
I told you, don't touch Mom's things.

392
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,620
Please give it back.

393
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,200
The food is tasty.

394
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,410
 What brings you here so early in the morning?

395
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,290
 What if you catch me cheating on you?

396
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:26,770
 What do you mean?  I will kill you.

397
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,800
 This is tasty. Let me eat.  Let me eat, I said!

398
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:44,690
♫  On a single charge of losing my mind  ♫

399
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:56,360
♫  I am locked in eternal longing  ♫

400
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:06,560
♫  On the fringe of the spreading night  ♫

401
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,800
♫  like a very remote star  ♫

402
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:20,660
♫  I am losing my light and am left alone  ♫

403
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,400
I'm sorry about yesterday.

404
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,200
I had something to ask you.

405
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,500
 Get 5 billion won ready.  I know you killed Jin Seon Mi. -N31-

406
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,100
 Get 5 billion won ready.  I know you killed Jin Seon Mi. -N31-

407
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,250
I did not do that.

408
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,260
Think about what I went through to save my Chae Rim.

409
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,080
Right?

410
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,820
I'm sorry.

411
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,190
But it looks like something else is going on.

412
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,160
You didn't kill the mistress, by any chance, did you?

413
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,920
Your revenge is too straightforward.

414
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,160
Yun Cheol believes that it happened due to his mistake.

415
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,650
But it was my plan.

416
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,090
 What are you two trying to do, anyway?

417
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,630
 Seon Mi.

418
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,990
But someone found out?

419
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,240
I have to find out who that is.

420
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,200
Why do I have to hear this story?

421
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,990
It's sad to hear you say that.

422
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,460
We are family.

423
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,200
What an honor. Family. Our fates are entwined.

424
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,620
Will you lend me what I asked for?

425
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,910
Of course.

426
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,190
I've prepared it.

427
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,800
Thank you, Brother-in-law.

428
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,670
Yes, I did sell those shoes.

429
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:44,520
Did you sell it to this person?

430
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,690
Yes, it was her.

431
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,800
Were they your shoes?

432
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,420
No. I bought them at a flea market, but they did not fit me.

433
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,470
Not sure.

434
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:03,270
We don't keep personal information about all the people who donate items to the flea market.

435
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,070
But it's a rare luxury brand item.

436
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,590
Please excuse me, I'm quite busy.

 Buyeong-dong News

440
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,270
Didn't you say you didn't have these shoes?

441
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,200
Yes, that was true.

442
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,730
But I said I didn't have them at that time.

443
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:32,620
I never said that I never had them, ever.

444
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,700
This was very far in the past.

445
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:43,430
Is the fact that I donated these shoes related to this case?

446
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:48,190
Because all incidents are planned before they happen.

447
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,910
 Detective.

448
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:01,760
 Detective, do you trust your wife?

449
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,890
 My question wasn't precise.

450
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:07,780
 I meant is your wife a trustworthy person?

451
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,720
 Don't trust your wife too much.

452
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,600
 What you see isn't all there is.

453
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,820
 Do you know my wife?

454
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,050
Why are you curious about that now?

455
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:29,090
My wife has these shoes, too.

456
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:34,470
Oh my.  Then does your wife become a suspect, too?

457
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,660
Not everyone becomes a suspect just because they have these shoes.

458
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,600
Is that how it works? That is a relief.

459
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,020
For your wife, and for me.

460
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,360
I don't know about your marriage,

461
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,360
but I cannot forgive you using innocent people.

462
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,450
Especially, if you ever approach my wife again,

463
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:01,820
I will not stand for it.

464
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,880
Why

465
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,390
do you assume that I approached your wife?

466
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,200
The opposite could have happened.

467
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:22,900
 I imagined a story about the perfect world of an ideal woman collapsing.

468
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,450
 If I say that seeing this woman who made this imagination a reality

469
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:30,330
 gave me strength, would it be strange?

470
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,130
How much is this?

471
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,220
♫  A silent cry   ♫

472
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,370
♫  I'll let you go away from me   ♫

473
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,920
Welcome.

474
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,060
♫  I know you know we know  ♫

475
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,020
 You're doing such good work. I want to donate these. Can I?

476
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,170
  Of course, yes.

♫  So far away  ♫

478
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,220

 ♫  I will get away far  ♫

479
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,950
- Was the size true?

480
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,430
Yes.  I just had to slip them on.

481
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,500
Thank you.

482
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,440
♫  I will get away far right now ♫

483
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,760
Can't you let me have those shoes?

484
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,130
They are an important pair of shoes for me.

485
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,370
But I've been wanting these myself, too.

486
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,150
But these shoes are not just any shoes to me.

487
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,820
They are like a talisman to me, which gives me inspiration.

488
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:26,890
If I change my mind, I'm going to put it up on the trading website, so you can activate your alert.

492
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,130
What are you doing here at this hour?

493
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,800
I had some business nearby.

494
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,040
Well, that's unusual.

495
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,910
You haven't even called for so long.

496
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,480
Where is Noona?

497
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,680
Grocery shopping.

498
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,380
Thank you for sending us those vegetables.

499
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,850
And the tomatoes were so sweet and delicious.

500
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,790
Yeah?

501
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:23,950
Hey, you know that place, right?  The dry cleaner ajumma who took up farming by Bibong.

502
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:28,510
She said smelling dirt after smelling only laundry detergent was so nice.

503
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,210
He sent some saying it was a bumper crop in their garden.

504
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:35,220
Mom, you also should stop working and be resting in that kind of garden.

505
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,560
Why should I rest?

506
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,330
This is a busy season. I better work hard and repay your wife for all that she's done for us.

507
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:43,820
I'm sorry to you about that.

508
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,470
Why are you always so sorry?

509
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:50,490
Because, instead of helping you with your burdens, I've added to them.

510
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,090
I'll be leaving now.

511
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:55,620
You should eat lunch before you go. Chae Rim will be home soon, too.

512
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,330
I have to take care of my restaurant, too.

513
00:55:58,330 --> 00:55:59,870
Work hard.

514
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,730
And Mom, you should stop working so hard.

515
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,090
Owner, do you feel better now?

516
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,390
Yes, thank you.  Did you enjoy yourself?

517
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,590
Please come again.

518
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:40,590
You still don't look so good.

519
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,000
No, I'm alright.

520
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,840
Yes, I'm fine.

521
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,080
Team Leader Jin hasn't come to work.

522
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,000
She's not answering her calls, either.

523
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:01,620
She did contact me. She's going to her parents' house to take a break.

524
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,200
- Suddenly?
 - Nothing else is going on with her?

525
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,770
She didn't say anything.

526
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:37,770
 Sim Jae Gyeong

527
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:40,990
Detective Seo, I brought you the document you asked for.

528
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:45,160
 Ha Eun Hye's Business Records

529
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,410
 Writ of Foreclosure on Collateral 
 Debtor: Ha Eun Hye/ Amount: 341,300,400 won

530
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:52,160
After tracking the purchase records of the shoes

531
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,930
that were filmed in the CCTV,

532
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,390
regarding Sim Jae Gyeong's next door neighbor Ha Eun Hye,

533
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:59,120
we found some suspicious elements.

534
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,940
Isn't she the one who told people about the adultery?

535
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,020
Yes, that is her.

536
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,370
At one point, she was a respected female CEO, but now, she has a large amount of debt.

537
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:07,990
Her personal life is suspicious as well.

538
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,170
How?

539
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,420
Is it related to this incident?

540
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,050
They seemed like a very devoted couple on the outside, but it turns out, they are in a contracted relationship.

541
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,190
Contracted relationship?

542
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:20,630
They are not legally married. He was a husband hired for money.

543
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:23,870
So that is why she needed money, and so she killed Song Yu Min?

544
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:24,790
What about Ha Eun Hye's fingerprints?

545
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:27,180
We're running a match now to what was found at the scene.

546
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,320
We also have reports that Ha Eun Hye fought with a younger woman.

547
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,320
Was it with Sim Jae Gyeong?

548
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,260
No.

549
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:37,630
When we showed this photo to the informant, we were told that the young woman resembled this woman.

558
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,730

01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:42,120
Kim Yun Cheol.

560
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,560

561
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,370
Kim Yun Cheol!!

562
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,400
Kim Yun Cheol.

563
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,150
Has something happened?

564
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:16,890
 I'm going to kill my husband.

565
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,820
 You're going to invite me?

566
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,270
 Why me?

567
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:25,050
 The shrimp gambas will be the only food in which I do not sprinkle the poisoned salt.

568
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:30,610
 Make sure to avoid everything else. But dipping the bread in the shrimp gambas sauce will be okay.

569
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:36,130
 Your body will never be found, and the truth will be buried in darkness.

 The Last Supper

574
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:47,740
 It's been so long that she thought of her husband's face without resentment and anger.

575
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:53,150
 The wife decided to have a last supper with her husband before they divorced.

576
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:58,600
 The other name for this last supper for a beautiful farewell, was "the supper of murder."

577
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,620
 The question wasn't whether to live or die,

578
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,220
 but whether to kill or be killed.

579
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,200
 For this last supper that they prepared as a married couple,

580
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,100
 they decided to invite a special guest.

581
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:16,760
 But she never imagined that this woman would really come.

582
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:22,390
 She also never imagined that this woman would eat the poisoned gambas.

Where is Jin Seon Mi?

01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:31,000
Because of me...

585
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,960
she died.

586
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,950
Yes, she ended up dying.

587
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,330
No, I killed her.

588
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:54,890
I... to Seon Mi...

589
01:02:54,890 --> 01:03:01,010

590
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,040
I killed her.
