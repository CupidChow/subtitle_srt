 Married Woman Abducted, Demand for 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,020
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,420
 Don't move, Honey! You cannot go anywhere without my permission!

5
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,980
 This is my conclusion.

6
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,240
 We should break up now.

7
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,070
 In the end, it's this money!

8
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,770
 An illusion is a gift.

9
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,600
 Unfortunately, I will soon have to return it.

10
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,490
Episode 10 - If You Ask Why We Are Getting a Divorce

11
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,080
It's done!

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,220
We haven't had a time together like this in a while.

13
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,830
I think it's definitely better being at home.

14
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,850
Of course being at home is more comforting than being at a hospital.

15
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,320
Yes.

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,060
My memory will return too, right?

17
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,120
I hope your memories don't return.

18
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,260
Was our marriage that big of a mess?

19
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,590
I don't remember that well either.

20
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,990
That's good, let's hit reset together.

21
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,570
Cheers.

22
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,800
The five billion won wasn't burned, it was in that house.

23
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,360
 Samoyed

24
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,210
What are you doing?

25
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,990
Oh, I'm doing laundry. Is it okay to do laundry at this hour?

26
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,010
Of course, it's not. Just leave it and come back in.

27
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,970
Did you go to Buyong-dong two days ago?

28
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,160
- Here. 
 - To make kimchi?

29
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,510
You learn how to make kimchi and bring back the ones you made.

30
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,920
You went all the way to Buyong-dong to make kimchi?

31
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,130
Maybe it's because the dinner I had was a bit fatty,

32
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,270
I can't stop eating the kimchi.

33
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,230
How are you doing these days?

34
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,120
Is there anything interesting going on? Are you craving any food?

35
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,140
Are you on repeat?

36
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,990
No, I'm just asking how you're doing these days.

37
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,040
Since when were you so interested in me?

38
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,920
- Do you have another woman?
 - What?

39
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,880
Well, I heard that when a man is having an affair, he starts talking more to his wife.

40
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,720
Stop watching the morning Korean dramas.

41
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,630
You're going to slap my face with kimchi at that rate.

42
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,570
Okay! Was this your usual alcohol limit?

43
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,290
Are you sure one more bottle will be okay?

44
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,210
It's going to be a shame if we don't drink more on a day like this.

45
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,150
  Le Amour Eternel  
Yeah, that was really good back then.

46
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:40,490
♫   On a single charge of losing my mind  ♫

47
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,140
♫   I am locked in eternal longing  ♫

48
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,330
You have a puffed rice stuck... on your upper teeth.

49
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,900
♫   On the fringe of the spreading night  ♫

50
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,760
♫  like a very remote star  ♫

51
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,310
Oh, I'm hungover.

52
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,060
I want a refreshing fish soup.

53
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,350
It's bread...

54
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,310
Did I make a big breakfast until now? Bread is a no-no?

55
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,960
Oh, bread. It's okay, bread. It's really great.

56
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,660
It's chewy.

57
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,110
Bread is perfect for hangovers.

58
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,460
- Rest peacefully.
 - Okay.

59
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,260
Oh my, you guys are acting like newlyweds.

60
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,620
There's honey dripping from your eyes.

61
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,690
You two are more in a newlywed stage. There's no comparison to the honey dripping from your eyes.

62
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,060
What? Newlyweds?

63
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,150
I called him her son yesterday...

64
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,240
I'm so sorry, I made a big mistake.

65
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,070
It's okay, I will take it as a compliment for my husband.

66
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,100
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,410
It's okay, honey. It's a compliment when you call someone young.

68
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,850
I'll be back. Go inside.

69
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,820
In order to make my husband come back,

70
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,830
I remember planning something.

71
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,490
♫  Your bickering every day is wearing me out. Damn   ♫

72
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,120
♫  The game is boring  ♫

73
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,910
♫  After a long night, in front of me was, another boring scene  ♫

74
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,510
But where is the real money? 
♫  I giddily think whether I have it or not  ♫

75
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,400
♫  Your eyes shine differently from the start, you are shaking again ♫

76
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,860
♫  Oh love me like you do ♫

77
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,220
♫  We are a wall which has lost the way ♫

78
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,000
♫  Tell me what you want now ♫

79
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,980
♫  Tell me what you want now ♫

80
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,490
♫  I'm sick and tired, even if it's something which will light a fire in your heart ♫

81
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,180
♫  In the change of heart which no one was aware of, I might be going crazy ♫

82
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,590
♫  At last you want me, locked inside my heart ♫

83
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,350
♫   Firmly set at orange moonlight night  ♫

84
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,130
♫   At last you return my side ♫

85
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,180
♫   At last return my side ♫

86
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,430
♫   At last return to my side ♫

87
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,660
♫   You're locked inside my heart now ♫

88
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,350
♫   Orange moonlight ♫

89
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,820
♫   At last you return to my side ♫

90
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,400
♫   Gradually deepening emotion ♫

91
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,420
♫   A thick fog outside the window ♫

92
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,670
♫   covers our wounds ♫

93
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,830
♫   You are my one life. You want it too tonight ♫

94
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,110
♫  At last you want me. Locked inside my heart. ♫

95
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,260
♫  A firmly set orange moonlight night.  
I think I left my wallet, I'm coming back.

96
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,330
♫   At last you return my side ♫

97
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,260
♫  Orange moonlight night ♫

98
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,830
♫   At last you return my side ♫

99
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,810
I know I grabbed my wallet. I must have dropped it coming out.

100
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,250
It's here! I left it there while putting on my shoes.

101
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,200
I should have looked for it and brought it to you.

102
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,430
It's a good excuse to come see your face again.

103
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,060
Are you sure you're okay by yourself?

104
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm having a good time just relaxing.

105
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,090
Good idea.

106
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,800
You need to just rest peacefully.

107
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,210
I'll be back.

108
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,520
Have a good day.

109
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's do well today too, fighting!

110
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,290
How is your wife?

111
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,330
She's okay, she's getting better.

112
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,270
It's going to be hard for her to come back to the restaurant, right?

113
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,030
What if she doesn't remember us either?

114
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,470
I wanted to learn more of her recipes.

115
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,180
Oh! Did they catch the burglar?

116
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,330
Not yet. Get to work.

117
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,150
  I think I left my wallet, I'm coming back.

118
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,280
Why did she put on such a show?

119
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,590
Did the five billion won disappear along with her memories?

120
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,480
As of right now.

121
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,160
Why did you go give her that money in the first place!

122
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,800
I never gave it to her.

123
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,290
I just wanted to save Chae Rim.

124
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,280
And now all you're thinking about is your wife?

125
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,030
What? Since she lost her memories, you want to restart things with your wife?

126
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,070
That woman probably never lost her memories.

127
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,920
She's putting on a show to gain time.

128
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,870
Yeah. Why is she trying to gain time?

129
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,410
You're doubting it too, right?

130
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,860
From where to where were her plans?

131
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,800
And who has the five billion won?

132
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,660
Oh, my head.

133
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,430
The burglar is the one who knew that the suicide note was a fake.

134
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,700
The cooler box.

135
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,890

136
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,230
Where did the five billion won that was in the cooler box go?

137
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,840
So the one who killed Song Yu Min is the one who stole the money.

138
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,980
The burglar knew who had the five billion won

139
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,490
and went looking for it.

140
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,940
But the victim said there wasn't anything in particular missing.

141
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,880
Of course. To admit that the five billion won was stolen

142
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,670
would be acknowledging that they had the five billion won.

143
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,330
So where is the the five billion won now?

144
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,740
We have found it. The five billion won is evidence of Song Yu Min's murder.

145
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,930
If we solve this case well, it's hitting two birds with one stone. Okay?

146
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,730
So the conclusion is that we have to catch the burglar.

147
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,900
No, we have to find the five billion won.

148
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,500
Huh?

149
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,650
Seeing that you came here to see me, your memories have returned.

150
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,510
Why didn't you tell me when you came to see me in the hospital?

151
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,160
 How did you know I was here? It's really been a long time.

152
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,200
 How is your health?

153
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,640
 I'm fine now.

154
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,100
Because ignorance is bliss.

155
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,150
It didn't last long, but I think it really is bliss.

156
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,880
It wouldn't be bad to just forget everything and begin anew.

157
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,100
This wasn't a part of my plan.

158
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,310
Which was a part of your plan?

159
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,980
Ignorance? Bliss?

160
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,170
Was that the wrong question? I should ask which was not a part of your plan.

161
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,730
What's important is your future plan.

162
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,540
Five billion won.

163
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,300
You better solve that.

164
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,270
 "Kimchi lecture"

165
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,960
 "I went to a kimchi lecture in Buyeong-dong." - Mi Ja

166
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,450
 I attended because I wanted to learn new methods. ^^

167
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,910
"Cooler box"

168
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,090
Detective Seo, the first report we got about the burglary wasn't the neighbor.

169
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,490
- So it wasn't the woman living next door?
 - No.

170
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,790
The first report was from a man who didn't provide his name.

171
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,780
What? A man?

172
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,600
Okay, cream risotto for table three...

173
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,490
Are you all right?

174
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,230
Yeah.

175
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,940
Yeah, I'm fine.

176
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,290
Mr. Im Do Hyeon?

177
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,490
 OLD CROP

178
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,530
When you made the report, you hung up without saying who you were.

179
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,200
Yes, I was preoccupied.

180
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,900
Yes, I understand. That can happen.

181
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,940
So that means you were at Sim Jae Gyeong's home at that time?

182
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:06,340
Madam? Are you home?

183
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,290
Did you visit that home before, from time to time?

184
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,930
What is it that you want to say?

185
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,980
Why did you go to meet with Sim Jae Gyeong?

186
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,010
I am curious about that, too.

187
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,240
She just said that she had something to discuss with me.

188
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,570
 Closed

 OLD CROP

190
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,200
Madam, you're here?

191
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,420
Madam, what brings you here?

192
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,660
Did you remember this place?

193
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,300
I searched for it on the internet.

194
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,590
I was so curious about it.

195
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,700
Yes, I'm glad you came.

196
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,600
Are you feeling better?

197
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,760
Yes, I'm feeling great.

 Jin Seon Mi (torn name label)

200
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,020
So you lost your memories?

201
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,080
Not everything, but some. I'm working on it.

202
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,990
Then let me help you.

203
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,110
 Jin Seon Mi

204
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,720
What am I supposed to remember from this?

205
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,000
That there is no way my name will disappear from here.

206
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,750
Then I'll make sure to remember what happened today.

207
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,680
Team Leader Jin, I find you pitiable.

208
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,020
Why do you live your life that way, stuck in between a married couple?

209
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,600
Is it because you're still greedy for the five billion won?

210
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,720
 Please put this heavy bag down and speak to us briefly.

211
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,880
 Team Leader Jin, maybe you should go ahead of me?

212
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,990
 Shall I?

213
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,860
 I am so busy, I told you!!

214
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,760
 - What is it?
 - Just think of it as a fan letter.

215
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,840
 I know all about the kidnapping. I will be waiting at 9 PM at the Bar Classic in front of the Gangnam station.

216
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,140
What are you trying to do here now?

217
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,260
Maybe I should threaten you and ask for money?

218
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,480
Do you have the five billion won, Chef?

219
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,340
And if I did?

220
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,820
Will you end things with the owner?

221
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,750
What do you mean by that?

222
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,640
I told you, stop messing around between those two people.

223
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,620
That isn't your concern, Chef.

224
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,940
I really

225
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,840
cannot understand all three of you.

226
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,090
You don't have to try to understand.

227
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,980
Each person has their own reasons.

228
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,730
Everyone's acting this way because of the five billion won. And their so-called reasons are just excuses.

229
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,880
Aren't you interested in the money, too?

230
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,910
It's enough money to change your life.

231
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,860
You've come.

232
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,850
You seemed so happy by yourself.

233
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,010
I didn't want to interrupt.

234
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,690
What were you doing?

235
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,600
I remember Old Crop.

236
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,980
So you remember this place?

237
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,800
An employee told me

238
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,750
that if I came down here, you'd be here.

239
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,700
So what are your thoughts, after seeing this place?

240
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,730
It's very like you.

241
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,690
You were always very interested in coffee.

242
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,450
And you loved stocking up on coffee.

243
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,070
You don't really care for coffee. You were like that even when we dated.

244
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,740
That's true.

245
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,550
I liked you better than coffee

246
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,300
and that's why I attended that coffee lecture.

247
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,830
So our meeting

248
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,850
was not a coincidence?

249
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,480
It was a coincidence.

250
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,950
Because all inevitability requires coincidence.

251
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,080
What a coincidental fate.

252
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,300
I wonder if your memory loss was a coincidence or inevitable?

253
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,600
Which would you prefer?

254
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,230
Whether it's coincidence or inevitable,

255
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,320
you helped me remember what I'd forgotten.

256
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,910
 How lovable you are

257
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,900
 and also how dangerous.

258
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,020
 And although it was brief, life was so sweet for me.

259
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,840
I'm fine with the way things are. Are you okay with not recovering your memories?

260
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,490
Is there something I must remember?

261
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,380
No, you do not

262
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,170
have to recover all your memories.

263
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,910
But aren't you curious to know where it is?

264
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,520
Maybe it's in there?

265
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,660
Because that's where I hid it before, you won't look there again.

266
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,260
So isn't it the perfect hiding spot?

267
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,590
So you recovered

268
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,250
your memories.

269
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,110
Don't you want to confirm it right away?

270
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,060
Seeing that you're looking for it, too,

271
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,870
you're not the one who took it.

272
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,110
What are you saying? Me?

273
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,730
Are you suspecting me right now?

274
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,180
Because I remembered

275
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,550
what kind of person you were.

276
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,730
You're one to talk. You put on a show, fooling this entire nation

277
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,190
and even mess with the bags of money?

278
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,700
Because I wanted to make you stay.

279
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,300
Stop saying that. What you want back isn't me, but the money.

280
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,780
You're the one who took the money.

281
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,730
Do you really not know why I'm doing all this?

282
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,340
No, I don't want to know. What I'm really curious about

283
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,470
is what you've schemed. That's what I want to know.

284
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,010
I want to remember that, too.

285
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,680
Remember.

286
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,550
So did you really forget? By chance?

287
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,870
Losing my memories

288
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,980
was not part of my plan.

289
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,350
But thanks to losing my memories,

290
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,300
I was happy for a few days.

291
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,400
That happiness was false.

292
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,910
Just like our marriage.

293
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,930
No, it was real.

294
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,790
I felt your sincerity.

295
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,040
I put on an act because I didn't trust you.

296
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,000
Recovering my memories...

297
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,270
I wish I could take it back.

298
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,740
If only it was possible,

299
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,270
I would even give the five billion won for it.

300
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,680
I want to return to the past few days we had together.

301
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,260
Excuse me?

302
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,010
Yes, I'm coming.

303
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,900
You came to deliver the napa cabbages, right?

304
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,030
No, not napa cabbages.

305
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,630
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were a new delivery man.

306
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,940
Yes, well... I have a few questions for you.

307
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,710
Can I see the list of people who attended your kimchi lecture two days ago?

308
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,850
I don't really have a list.

309
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,810
Hold on.

310
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,260
I have a photo I took during the class.

311
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,620
 Twins' Dad

312
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,550
What are you doing, Honey?

313
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,640
What are you doing at home at this time?

314
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,470
Since when did you use this cooler box?

315
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,030
What is all this?

316
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,380
Do you know Sim Jae Gyeong?

317
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,600
The woman who was abducted?

318
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,180
Is there anyone who doesn't know her?

319
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,600
And since when have you ever been interested in my clothes or my things?

320
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,140
Don't change the subject.

321
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,820
Are you doing some cosplay after reading some silly web novel?

322
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,150
Can't you tell fantasy and reality apart?

323
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,420
Why do you care now what I do?

324
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,940
You've never shown any interest in me before!

325
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,470
Whether I got abducted or not

326
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,100
you probably wouldn't care at all.

327
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,180
Have you gone crazy?

328
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,610
Are you actually saying this?

329
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:54,730
Fine, get yourself abducted or whatever. Don't expect me to try to save you.

330
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,840
Same goes for you!

331
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,800
Don't expect me to return.

332
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,800
Again, everyone worked hard today.

333
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,760
- Thank you!
 - Thank you!

334
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,820
 Let's look for the money together.

335
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,120
 The five billion won must return to our hands.

336
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,210
 It's money that was allegedly burned up and disappeared, after all.

337
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,810
 Someone who would be after our money is definitely at this restaurant.

338
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,620
Won't all of you go home already?

339
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,180
 STAFF ONLY

340
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,970
What are the chances that my wife and Sim Jae Gyeong would meet each other?

341
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,040
What? Something they may have in common? Followers on Instagram?

342
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,610
But why are you asking that?

343
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,100
 But there was something strange.

344
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,670
 Someone said she would take that day's kimchi a few days later.

345
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,410
 She said she would come today to get it, so I thought I should tell you.

346
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,150
 Kimchi lecture?

347
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,160
 You learn how to make kimchi, then you bring home the kimchi that you made.

348
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,560
 Do you know Sim Jae Gyeong? The woman who was abducted?

349
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,170
 Is there anyone who doesn't know her?

350
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,280
Where are you going?

351
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,910
Home.

352
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,110
Wow, the sun will set in the east (pigs will fly).

353
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,170
- Let me have that.
 - No.

354
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,010
Give it to me.

355
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,890
Dad.

356
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,650
Where is your mom?

357
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,190
She said she had some sort of gathering?

358
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,590
Mom said she will be late getting home today.

359
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,240
Mom isn't home, so Dad came home early.

360
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,920
Alright. Hold on.

361
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,830
You wanna eat one?

362
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,370
Where did Mom say she was going?

363
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,130
I think she said she was going to get kimchi.

364
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,580
- Kimchi?
 - Yeah.

365
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,810
♫  I saw and trusted only you  ♫

366
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:46,290
♫  There was a time like that  ♫

367
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:50,640
♫  A dream-like time  ♫

368
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:57,020
♫  You were all I needed  ♫

369
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:02,380
♫  And it felt like it would last forever  ♫

370
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,200
♫  But that love has now...  ♫

371
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,220
♫  Forever  ♫

372
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,280
 Le Amour Eternel
 Cabernet Syrah

373
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,350
I'm home—

374
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,320
Surprise!

375
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,690
What? Why are you here?

376
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,480
Congratulations on our sixth wedding anniversary.

377
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,600
 Yun Cheol, Congratulations on our sixth wedding anniversary, Jae Gyeong

378
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,510
Congratulations on your anniversary, Sir.

379
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,460
How about blowing out the candle?

380
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,230
Were you surprised?

381
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,790
- Should we all take a photo together?
 - Yes.

382
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,160
Everyone gather.

383
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,710
Thank you, everyone.

384
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,980
I'll take the picture now.

385
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,840
One, two, three.

386
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,000
 Five hours earlier

387
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,520
I'm going to say that it's a surprise party to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

388
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,880
You just have to buy wine to celebrate, and pretend to be surprised.

389
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,220
We always drink this wine on our wedding anniversary.

390
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,620
It's our proposal wine.

391
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,650
You two are so romantic.

392
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,980
Thank you.

393
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:45,020
But I'm afraid Madam might get indigestion if she drinks this wine.

394
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,090
You've seen the articles about your abduction, haven't you?

395
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:53,210
And you should know they confiscated that wine from this home, too.

396
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:58,650
I read with great interest the article that said you, Jin Seon Mi, were the most likely suspect.

397
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,090
Then you should also know that I was acquitted.

398
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,030
But it looks like they were correct about other bad things you've done.

399
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,020
I thank all of you for joining us on such a good day.

400
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,490
Let's have a toast. Let's drink.

401
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,570
I don't remember it,

402
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:29,480
but knowing myself, I'm sure I would have just forgiven you.

403
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,400
So cheers.

404
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,540
But

405
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,590
could you drink this without any worry?

406
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:53,270
What would have happened if Romeo and Juliet got married?

407
00:38:53,270 --> 00:39:00,010
If they were married, and Juliet died, would Romeo also follow her in death?

408
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,380
Or after confirming his wife's death, he might have shouted "hurray!" in his mind, so no one will know?

409
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,530
He probably would. I'm sure he would.

410
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,660
What if Juliet is the one who shouted "hurray"?

411
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,790
What if she drank fake poison and pretended to die so she could leave Romeo?

412
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:29,160
She probably watched her husband cry fake tears by her empty grave.

413
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,160
Looks like marriage itself is the poison.

414
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,520
Knowing it is poison, yet drinking it like it's medicine.

415
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,070
That is marriage.

416
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,190
Yes, sometimes poison can be medicine, as they say.

417
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,930
To find out whether something becomes poison or medicine

418
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,030
you have to keep going.

419
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,260
Are you crazy? It's not right for you to come in here, is it?

420
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,200
Which one is your wife's bed?

421
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,020
The one on the right?

422
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,540
Get out of this room right now.

423
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:41,160
If you invited me to your wedding anniversary, weren't you at least expecting this much?

424
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,920
I'm plenty tortured right now without having to deal with you.

425
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,550
And I didn't come here to sincerely congratulate the two of you, either.

426
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,730
Oh, thank you.

427
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,920
Yeah, thanks.

428
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,260
You guys brought so many gifts.

429
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,130
Thank you, we'll enjoy it.

430
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,890
This is something that I like.

431
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,510
I like this scent.

432
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,060
- I picked that out, Sir.
 - Honey.

433
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,580
Ah... s-sto—

434
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,090
- What are you doing?
 - That's a massage gun.

435
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,290
It's called "gun?"

436
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,160
Wow so scary.

437
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,480
So it's for massage, huh?

438
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,130
Yes.

439
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,450
- Alright, thanks.
 - Doesn't it feel good?

440
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:13,390
Yes, how did you know my shoulders hurt from roasting coffee beans?

441
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:22,280
 You don't have to be concerned about this place. I'm keeping a watch on things.

442
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:41,900
 Please bring the 5 billion won in front of my home by 10 PM tonight. - Sim Jae Gyeong

443
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,730
 9:58 PM

444
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,790
Doesn't it feel good?

445
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,430
I better know how to use it before I try it.

446
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,770
But yes, I think it feels good.

447
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,430
- Cheers.
 - Me too.

448
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:33,880
It's alright, let me do that.

449
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,180
Are you all right? Let me go see who's here. Jae Kyeong?

450
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,810
I'm sorry.

451
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,370
- Who is there? 
 -  It's alright.

452
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,260
Let me go see.

453
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,620
Continue to eat and drink.

454
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,960
Who is it?

455
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,520
Planning to leave home?

456
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,330
No.

457
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,580
Is this what luggage looks like these days?

458
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,420
That's not what it is.

459
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,760
What is it? Let me see.

460
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,610
What is it? Show me.

461
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,760
L'Amour Eternel

462
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,170
What is this?

463
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,550
What are all these rocks for?

464
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:08,060
Everyone, I am really grateful you came to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

465
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,310
It's not the right place to talk about this

466
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:15,960
but someone has taken something very precious to me.

467
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,560
Five billion won.

468
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:26,330
I've planned this gathering to give that person a chance to return it.

469
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,930
I would like that person to confess right here.

470
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,920
If that person is not revealed,

471
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,790
then someone here will die.

472
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:53,000
So one bottle has enough for every glass except one, right?

473
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,420
So exactly one glass is from this other bottle.

474
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,180
The poisoned wine that the police never found.

475
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,380
 L'Amour Eternel

476
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,900
Of course, thanks to that, someone was acquitted.

477
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,130
Even after I forgave you, you still haven't given me a sincere apology.

478
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:26,790
And one of you drank the poisoned wine.

479
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,180
Madam, you are scaring me.

480
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,130
Isn't your joke too much?

481
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:45,730
If the person who stole the five billion won confesses, I will tell you who drank the poisoned wine.

482
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:50,480
So you have the chance to go to the hospital and not miss the "golden time" so you could survive.

483
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,040
Please stop joking around.

484
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,850
Who are you accusing of taking that money?

485
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,610
It could have been you, Chef.

486
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,370
Don't you want your own restaurant, Chef?

487
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,770
You said you wanted a luxury brand purse.

488
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,740
And you have a loan you need to pay off?

489
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,350
And you wanted to expand your business?

490
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,530
And you were just so greedy for the five billion won that you would even kill someone for it?

491
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,880
Are you drunk?

492
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,780
It was me.

493
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,360
I took the money.

494
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,370
Here. I stole the money.

495
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:43,560
Because I thought that my wife was deceiving me.

496
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,030
My wife, Sim Jae Gyeong,

497
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,900
planned a fake abduction with her now-dead hoobae

498
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:58,350
and even had the five billion won.

499
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,610
That's what I thought.

500
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,920
Look.

501
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,960
I stole money... that wasn't even there.

502
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,520
I got greedy.

503
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:34,330
You all believed that the money existed when it didn't.

504
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:39,630
Like this wine, you believed that it was poisoned when it was not.

505
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,360
Please be at ease.

506
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:58,570
The taste is killer, but it won't kill you.

507
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:01,000
I can't stand this.

508
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,410
Did you two really not know she was joking?

509
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:20,750
I knew it was like "Candid Camera," but I still totally felt scared.

510
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,560
 At the surprise party tonight, for our 6th anniversary,

511
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,450
 I'm going to do an event.

512
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,830
 Could you two help me with it?

513
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,630
Chef,

514
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,570
why didn't you say anything?

515
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,010
We've met here before, haven't we?

516
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:16,040
You pushed me, Chef.

517
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,670
Chefs should cover their arms, more than their faces.

518
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:26,620
Because the cut and burn marks become like their fingerprints.

519
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,640
I thought you'd be different, Chef. But the five billion won

520
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,380
was so tempting to you?

521
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,600
Madam,

522
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,670
you asked me to do it.

523
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,060
What... ?

524

525
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,170
 Chef Im Do Hyeon

526
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,450
 Madam Sim Jae Gyeong

527
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,760
Could you come here?

528
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,610
Do we really have to go this far?

529
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,970
I'm sorry. But since we're at it, we have to make it look real.

530
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,770
I can't do this.

531
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,480
Chef.

532
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,590
Five billion won.

533
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:51,150
Chef, will you keep the five billion won for me?

534
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,500
Does that money really exist?

535
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,300
I'm going to "get rid of it."

536
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,550
It's money that allegedly burned up and disappeared.

537
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,760
So a burglar came in here and took it today

538
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,420
after pushing me down the stairs.

539
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,180
What are you doing right now?

540
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,680
It's alright.

541
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,410
Listen carefully.

542
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,650
I can't remember anything, okay?

543
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,580
I can't even remember the burglar's face.

544
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:52,300
♫  What can I do for your love? Crazy every day without you  ♫

545
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,650
♫  A silent cry  ♫

546
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:57,760
I was continually confused.

547
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,450
Whether you had really lost your memories

548
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,430
or whether you were pretending.

549
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,940
♫  Nothing is eternal  ♫

550
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,390
The reason I kept your secret

551
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,630
was because you seemed so desperate.

552
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,830
♫  Far away, get away  ♫

553
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:21,180
But that desperation seems to have been erased from your memories as well.

554
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,940
♫  Far away, get away, right now  ♫

555
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,840
♫  Far away, get away  ♫

556
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:40,150
 Really losing my memories was an unexpected variable.

557
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:44,020
 And briefly tasting happiness...

558
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,660
♫  Far away, get away, right now  ♫

559
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:56,760
 And my heart fluttering at your boyish expressions.

560
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,430
 Those were also not a part of my plan.

561
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,600
Won't you stop there?

562
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:13,220
Why did you meet that woman? You better tell me.

563
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,710
I'm researching.

564
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:15,700
Research?

565
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,580
You keep forgetting this, but I am a novelist.

566
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,610
Did you become friendly with her after researching her?

567
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,210
Enough to do what she asks?

568
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,200
Can't I become friends with her?

569
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,570
Why would you meet that woman? Why? Hurry and open that.

570
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,040
I don't want to.

571
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,290
Are you not aware of what a dangerous woman she is?

572
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,610
She's not someone an ordinary housewife like you can handle.

573
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:37,560
So stop acting strange and quickly open it.

574
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,880
I am not acting strange.

575
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,190
I'm researching. I'm doing my work!

576
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:44,270
Research, my foot.

577
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:48,270
You are just being used. Do you know that?

578
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,580
Don't touch that.

579
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,610
Have you gone crazy?

580
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,920
Alright, fine. Do whatever you want.

581
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,570
What am I imagining, anyway?

582
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:03,370
If you are bored, make some more kimchi.

583
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:15,600
Here. Here's the five billion won.

584
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,600
Have I ever told you that I was looking for the five billion won?

585
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,890
I am sure you will like the anniversary gifts.

586
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,810
You even decided what the gifts would be?

587
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:00,590
Of course not, would I really do that?

588
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:10,220
I really didn't know that you would confess.

589
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:16,090
Once I saw the anniversary event you'd planned, I knew

590
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:20,170
that you were trying to find out who has the five billion won.

591
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,270
My husband is quite amazing.

592
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,830
Burglar?

593
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:28,690
There was never any burglar in here.

594
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,900
Isn't that right? And you lost your memories

595
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,790
or whatever?

596
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,420
Should we have a drink together to celebrate?

597
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,590
I will make the tofu-kimchi stew that you like.

598
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:50,800
The kimchi has ripened well, it tastes very good.

599
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,990
She is not in her right mind.

600
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:36,320
This is my 6th-anniversary gift to you.

601
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,250
 Alright, I'll take the picture now.

602
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,640
 Everyone smile.

603
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,120
 One, two, three.

604
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,880
 Take a look.

605
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,750
 Wow, that came out good.

606
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,750
 Please take good care of it.

607
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,320
 I will.

608
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,610
How did we end up marrying?

609
00:59:56,610 --> 01:00:00,420
How did we end up divorcing?

610
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:21,670
Congratulations on recovering your memories.

Here is my gift to you.

613
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:37,300
Among all the anniversary gifts you gave me

614
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,260
this is the best.

615
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:59,430
You also suffered memory loss.

616
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:09,260
You had forgotten all our happy moments.

617
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:14,830
Thanks to you, I remembered those good memories, and my heart fluttered for a few days.

618
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:20,210
But those few days have become memories that I most wish to erase, also thanks to you.

619
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,060
Couldn't you stay

620
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:27,390
to make new memories with me?

621
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,350
Do you know

622
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,080
why we can't live together?

623
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,730
Because I might really

624
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:16,990
kill you with my own hands.

625
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:24,830
But I will still trust you.

626
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,420
But I can't trust myself.

627
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,020

 Even if we divorce, I'll be the one to do it.

630
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:06,380
 This final opportunity you've given me,

631
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:09,260
 I'll think of it as alimony and accept it gratefully.

632
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:13,680
 The situation has changed. The police have figured out that your wife planned the fake abduction.

633
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,790
 You are the criminal.

634
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:19,550
 But isn't that your imagination, too, Detective?

635
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:22,880
 I'll let you have my husband. Good luck to you two.

636
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,940
 I don't need what you used and discarded.

637
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,930
 I better make a new poison.

638
