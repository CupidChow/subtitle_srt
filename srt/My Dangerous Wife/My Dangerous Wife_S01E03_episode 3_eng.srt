1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,500

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,400
 Married Woman Abducted, Demands 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,660
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,670
 She was a perfect wife in every way.

5
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,730
 I wish you would line them up properly.

6
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,050
♫  You are wearing me out  ♫

7
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,950
 Adokicin. If you put it in red wine, she won't notice.

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,890
 Oh! Honey?

9
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,730
 Honey?

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,090
 N31. Do you have any guesses?

11
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,940
 If he really kills her?

12
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,570
 The blood found in the trunk your car's trunk was confirmed to be Sim Jae Gyeong's.

13
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,490
 I have a delivery. It's addressed to Kim Yun Cheol.

14
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,730
 Oh gosh...

15
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,650
 My wife is alive.

16
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,860
 They are demanding a ransom.

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,580
 By 10 AM tomorrow, 13 hours from now I must prepare 5 billion won in cash in non-sequential bills.

18
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,670
 The point of contact has been changed.

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,070
 Put the black plastic bag into the fishnet.

20
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,460
 What the hell is on!?

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,310
 Seonbae knew everything.

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,390
 She even knew who you were having an affair with.

23
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,630
 I need money.

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,060
 If not, you will become the one who put the poison in the wine by yourself.

25
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,980
 We have a warrant.

26
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,370
 Are you the suspect's mistress?

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,150
 What I'm leaving to you is not an inheritance, but my faith in you.

28
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,710
 Until death do us part,

29
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,300
 I will love you forever.

30
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,980
 Look here? Come to your senses.

31
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,620
 If it was any ordinary day,

32
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,250
 I would have waited for my husband who, without a word, was late again.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,810
 To my husband who had brought home wine

34
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,920
 I would have clinked wine glasses with him, acting like I was happy,

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,350
 telling myself that I was happy with the way things were.

36
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,000
 If I had done that, could I have died in happiness?

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,020
 But an end like that was too easy.

38
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,060
 Episode 3
 My Wife's Bare Face

39
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,590
 The finger from which my fingernail was pulled out, and the wound on my head were painful,

40
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,550
 but they didn't matter.

41
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,610
 Patient's Name: Sim * Gyeong

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,630
 Did I win or lose with this plan?

43
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,210
 That answer was important.

44
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,560
 Oh, how can this happen on the same day?
 Two Years Ago

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,840
 I think everything began

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,170
 when my parents died.

47
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,610
 Undam Group will become a corporation focused on social issues.

48
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,630
 All the real estate and shares owned by the group

49
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,910
 will be donated to charity.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,840
 You're alright with this, too, aren't you?

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,720
 Oh, yes, of course.

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,010
 It's your parents' will. Of course, I must accept it.

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,030
 Hey, have you heard about their last will and testament?

54
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,830
 I was so shocked.

55
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,730
 I heard that the chairman wrote this a few years ago?

56
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,260
 Yes, he wrote it because he was opposed to his daughter's marriage.

57
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,230
 "If you marry that guy, you won't get a penny of my money."

58
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,590
 Yes, he was barking up the wrong tree, huh?

59
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,880
 If you were him, would you have still married her if you knew what the will said?

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,840
 Who knows? Maybe he married her because he really loved her.

61
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,180
 Hey, who would believe that?

62
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,310
 Even I don't believe it.

63
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,500
 Exactly.

64
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,620
 Look over there.

65
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,940
 What?

66
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,150
 Why didn't you tell me before?

67
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,520
 Because it wasn't an important issue to our relationship.

68
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,810
 Why isn't it important? It's about your life.

69
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,690
 Yes, I did stake my life when I chose you.

70
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,980
 But you should have told me.

71
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,490
 If you knew my parents were opposed to our marriage

72
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,770
 I thought it would hurt your feelings.

73
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,060
 It wasn't because you didn't trust me?

74
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,790
 What do you mean?

75
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,790
 I have to prove my love and prove my abilities as well.

76
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,960
 Can you understand my double-headache?

77
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,820
 I understand that you are stressed. But,

78
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,860
 you can be free now.

79
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,490
 I know already that you love me,

80
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,170
 so there is no reason you have to prove that.

81
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,760
 And the business you said you wanted to run,

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,460
 how about giving that a try?

83
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,730
 We can afford that.

84
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,720
 Thanks.

85
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,620
 Yeah,

86
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,450
 all I need is for you to believe in me.

87
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,490
 Of course I do.

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,270
 I believe in you.

89
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,650
Hang that just a little bit higher. 
 ♫  And we are going in the same direction.   ♫

90
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,600
That looks good, okay.

91
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,770
 My husband quit his former job as a chef

92
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,280
 and devoted himself to his dreams of running a business.

93
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,590
My parents were mistaken.

94
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,640
They should have just trusted you and left it all to you.

95
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,480
No, they did the right thing.

96
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,280
It's right for me to achieve success with my own skills.

97
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,300
You know that it's not because you are lacking,

98
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,600
but they just expected too much on my behalf.

99
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,490
Then they should have given it all to you. It's wasteful to give it away.

100
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,540
Are you happy living only as my wife?

101
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100
That's exactly what I want.

102
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,000
Look this way.
 ♫  Our hearts will not able to stay quiet anymore.   ♫

103
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,850
I made this to help you celebrate. Please try it.

104
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,880
- Wow, it looks so yummy.
 - Wow, it's great.

105
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,090
I made this at home. Please try some.

106
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,570
Wow.

107
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,510
It looks so tasty.

108
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,560
Please take good care of my husband.

109
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,640
Oh, please take good care of me.

110
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,320
And please visit our restaurant often.

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,070
- I will.
 - Alright, let's begin work now.

112
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,750
Did the photo come out well?

113
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,720
- Take a look.
 - Oh.

114
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,590
 I don't know when it began,

115
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,940
 but we became used to seeing only each other's backs.

116
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,820
 One Year Ago

117
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,390
It tastes good.

118
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,370
You know, about the loan.

119
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,010
Again?

120
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,240
You don't have to act annoyed without even hearing what I have to say.

121
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,570
Oh, sorry.

122
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,790
- I will listen.
 - Are you even curious?

123
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,860
Because I trust you.

124
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,240
Yes, that's great.

125
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,710
So trust me and lend it to me.

126
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,160
Just 2 or 3 billion won. It's not that much, is it?

127
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,160
It's also not... a small amount.

128
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,060
 We began to fight more as his business began to do poorly.

129
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,970
 But I still endured it.

130
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,090
 But after a while, and I'm not sure why,

131
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,490
 we no longer fought.

132
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,120
You're late.

133
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,190
Yes, you didn't go to bed?

134
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,100
You've worked hard today, too.

135
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,740
Maybe because that machine is old, but there was a problem with it I had to fix it.

136
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,170
 Every Friday night,

137
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,990
 my husband sprayed cologne on himself before he returned home.

138
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,810
 However,

139
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,850
 the scent of another woman

140
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,980
 couldn't be completely covered.

141
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,050
 I wanted my husband to return to the place where he belonged.

142
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,630
 In order for that to happen, I had to protect my place, too.

143
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,160
 Sometimes, I would boil over with anger,

144
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,690
 and then my anger would subside again.

145
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,050
 My body began to feel heavy.

146
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,230
- Everyone take care.
 - Bye.

147
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,870
 One Month Before the Incident

148
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,760
 Message

149
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,880
 Jin Seon Mi

150
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
 At least until I saw those messages...

151
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,970
 Today, you were the best ever.

152
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,940
 Are you going to the funeral?

153
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,150
 Yes, I will need to show my face.

154
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,520
 A funeral after just one year of marriage? Aigoo.

155
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,010
 You must be envious.

156
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,600
 Yeah, that guy has all the luck.

157
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,710
 Then you should copy him.

158
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:52,080
 Someone once said that the most beautiful farewell between a married couple is death.

159
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,270
 So shall I help you make it a beautiful farewell?

160
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,480
  Do you think there is a way?

161
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,630
 Just get ready for the funeral.

162
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,900
 How enthusiastic.

163
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,450
- You're here?
 - What?

164
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,090
Yes I'm here.

165
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,090
Aigoo, how can such a thing happen?

166
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,520
 Someone once said that the most beautiful farewell between a married couple is death.

167
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,940
 So shall I help you make it a beautiful farewell? Just get ready for the funeral.

168
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,570
♫  I only see you and trust you  ♫

169
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,950
♫  but even so, you forgot me  ♫

170
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,500
♫  those times that felt like dreams  ♫

171
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,780
♫  all I needed was you  ♫

172
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,980
♫  like an eternal flower  ♫

173
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:32,390
♫  but love no longer exists  ♫

174
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:44,350
♫  that perfect picture, forever  ♫

175
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,990
 One Month Before the Incident

176
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,450
Honey, water.

177
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,160
Thank you, I'll be back.

178
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,310
Be safe.

179
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,320
 I felt an urgency to prepare for what might happen.

180
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,520
Poison?

181
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,760
Yes. I can make it, too.

182
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,110
 Adokicin
 (Made from Toxicodendron vernicifluum, also known by the common name Chinese lacquer tree.

183
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,650
What? Are you going to make that and...

184
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,210
You will get caught.

185
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,090
It's okay.

186
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,720
It will be easy with Madam because she is so naive.

187
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,550
No, I mean the police.

188
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,960
Oh, it's like that?

189
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,900
- So it's like that, huh?
 - Of course.

190
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,920
 It's okay.

191
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,140
 It will be easy with Madam because she is so naive.

192
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,220
 I decided at that moment,

193
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,020
 that I will die, just like you want me to.

194
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,560
 Je Chong Art Supply Store

195
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:06,050
 I needed someone to help me with my tragic death.

196
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,830
 Framing, Mounting, For Professionals

197
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,810

198
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,680
 Je Chong Art Supply Store

199
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,910
Sunbae!

200
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,010
I was shocked but part of me is to blame.

201
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:40,770
I think my husband was suffocated.

202
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,960
I'm sorry for only talking about me. Let's talk about something else.

203
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,390
Sunbae, you're still the same.

204
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,790
Always neglecting yourself while taking care of others.

205
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,540
Was I like that?

206
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,150
Don't have a hard time by yourself. Talk to me.

207
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,650
I'll do whatever I can to help.

208
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,760
Thank you.

209
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,590
Every day I prayed while looking at him.

210
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:35,460
To make it all stop. To make me stop.

211
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,230
Money... more money...

212
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,900
She won't give me the money.

213
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,000
What do I do? I need money.

214
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,030
She's nagging me to death!

215
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,450
What do I do?

216
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,070
You're awake already?

217
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,260
I was going to make breakfast today.

218
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,700
I'll be off.

219
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:32,940
It's Friday. My husband will go to his lover's house today again.

220
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,410
 Three hours before the incident

221
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,900
I prayed that my husband would get off work early

222
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,700
and come home so we could drink hot cocoa together.

223
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,490
The person who drinks it dies within two days from organ failure.

224
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,370
She just gave him the poison.

225
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,100
 Seonbae Jae Gyeong

226
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,050
 DIdn't you say there was a red wine your wife liked?

227
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,050
What was the name of the wine again?

228
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:46,360
 But a sad premonition is never wrong.

229
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,170
 At the very least, it should not have been that wine.

230
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,600
 This wine, "L'amour éternel" means "eternal love.""

231
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,390
 It is a wine used for a proposal.

232
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,090
 Let's swear on it.

233
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,600
 Until death do us apart, forever.

234
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,760
 Yes, "L' amour... whatever," let's swear to it.  
  Till death do us part

235
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,060
 Two hours before the incident

236
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,430
♫  You wouldn’t know that I’ve got you now  ♫

237
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,730
♫  Without knowing, you  ♫

238
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,690
♫  You dare tear all my heart apart  ♫

239
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,690
♫  Fearless you, right?  ♫

240
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,430
♫  Because you who are wandering in the endlessly dark night  ♫

241
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,730
♫  have put yourself in my hand  ♫

242
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,280
♫  Even if you try to run away you will circle  ♫

243
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,410
♫  nside my desolate maze without any opening  ♫

244
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,460
♫  Who’ll ever gonna get you out?  ♫

245
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,180

248
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,000
Dear? Jae Gyeong!

249
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,840
Dear!

250
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,840
Dear.  Dear!

251
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,020
Dear!

252
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,610
Dear!

253
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,590
 Wife

254
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,660
 Prepare five billion. If you report, your wife dies. -N31-

255
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,920
 That's right. My husband isn't an evil person.

256
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,200
 My life is more important than 5 billion won— 
  (T/N: about $4.3 million)

257
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,710
Is this the police?

258
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,070
My wife

259
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,000
has disappeared.

260
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,270
 And that is how any hesitation I may have had disappeared.

261
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,250
 I decided that I would do anything to make my husband

262
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,860
 get down on his knees before me and repent.

263
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:30,180
 Instead of taking off my wedding ring, I pulled off my left ring fingernail.

264
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,730
 It wasn't a big deal.

265
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,660
 Compared to slicing off a chunk of my life.

266
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,110
 That's a fact.

267
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,030
 You called the police. Did you give up the easy route?

268
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,350
 Fine. I'll kill her.

269
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,780
 It was enough for me to merely be someone's wife,

270
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,030
 but that me has really died.

271
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,080
 Eun Hye (heart) Min Gyu

272
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,070
 One day after the incident

273
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,950
 My husband abandoned the wife.

274
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,390
 Why is he making a fuss when he cheated on her?

275
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,860
 People don't change. If she returns alive, she should dump him right away.

276
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,540
 Is your wife alive? Mr. Kim Yun Cheol?

277
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,080
 Please give us a comment.

278
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,860
 Kim Yun Cheol, is there anyone you suspect?

279
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,220
 I know my wife is definitely alive.

280
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,400
 So that my wife can be found, I request any information, no matter how trivial.

281
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,970
 I was at a loss for words.

282
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,870
 Laughter would've been better.

283
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,630
 So that my wife can be found, I request any information, no matter how trivial.

284
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,960
 At first, my tears were fake, but then I began to cry real tears.

285
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,520
 I was mourning my own death.

286
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,060
 But now it's my husband's turn to cry.

287
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,500
 I think lately they had some trouble.

288
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,290
 The suspicion against my husband will gradually grow.

289
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,680
 And the guilt he will feel towards the wife who treated his family well.

290
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,380
 Uncle, Auntie isn't dead, is she?

291
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,840
 She's alive, isn't she?

292
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,780
 Of course, of course your aunt is alive.

293
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,960
 It'll be okay.

294
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,510
 She's going to be okay.

295
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,430
 My husband will open the doors to regret and self-blame.

296
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,010
 Bank Account
 5,160,000,000 won

297
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,070
 Two Days After the Incident

298
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,650
 Husband of the victim, Kim Yun Cheol, who was the most likely suspect

299
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,130
 caused chaos by resisting arrest.

300
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,490
 Once the police began to apply force, a deivery addressed to Kim Yun Cheol arrived

301
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,370
  and it's assumed that it's from the abductor.

302
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,530
 The contents have not yet been revealed.

303
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,980
 - My wife is alive!
 - So Kim Yun Cheol

304
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,190
 is expected to no longer be considered a suspect

305
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,870
 of Sim Jae Gyeong's abduction.

306
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,870
 After seeing him like that, I became certain

307
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,520
 that it was all going according to plan.

308
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,130
 A nationwide effort for a hostage rescue drama is unfolding.

309
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,700
 In order to rescue Sim Jae Gyeong,

310
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,140
 a long line has formed by those who came to exchange their bills.

311
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,040
 Thank you. I will not forget this kindness.

312
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,940
 Seeing my husband work so hard to exchange bills so early in the morning was moving.

313
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,420
 At this rate, the needed 5 billion won will be exchanged on time without much difficulty.

314
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,000
 The police maintain silence on how this money &lt;

315
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,110
 will be delivered to the kidnapper...

316
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,970
 30 minutes later?

317
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:42,210
 I always loved watching my husband run.

318
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,760
 It was the last chance I would give him

319
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,650
 and the last thing I was expecting from him.

320
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,430
 Don't tell the police that you switched the sack! If you don't follow my instructions, your wife will die!!!

321
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,430
It's a new demand.

322
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,760
To go to Gangbyeon Marina, Gate 1, in 30 minutes.

323
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,880
 My husband, more than the five billion won,

324
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,730
 thought of my life as precious.

325
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,650
Watching the kids play so hard is making you emotional, isn't it?

326
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,800
No, my husband.

327
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,430
♫  What can I do for your love  ♫

328
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,760
♫  Crazy every day without you  ♫

329
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,270
 Now all that's left to do is wrap up.

330
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:48,930
♫  go away from me  ♫

331
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,430
♫  I know you know we know  ♫

332
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,520
The victim's husband, while in his car,

333
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,670
I saw him put something in the wine with a syringe.

334
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,420
♫  I know you know we know  ♫

335
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,560
♫  So far away  ♫

336
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,890
♫  Far away, get away  ♫

337
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,880
Good work. Congrats.

338
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,990
Can I come see you?

339
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,000
I have something to give you.

340
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,610
Of course. I'll be waiting.

341
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,430
♫  Far away, get away, right now  ♫

342
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,970
♫  Without you without you  ♫

343
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,830
♫  Far away, get away, right now  ♫

344
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:42,340
 Three Days After the Incident

345
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,600
 And then I rose to the surface.

346
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,290
♫  Without you  ♫

347
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,800
Now, start.

348
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,400
I think we've done enough.

349
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,790
Since this is really the last time

350
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,620
I ask of you.

351
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,650
Do it for me.

352
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,770
Thank you.

353
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,010
Wake up!

354
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,370
 What does my husband's expression look like?

355
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,260
 Will the affection that was once gone return?

356
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,350
 Will he look at me and smile like he used to?

357
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,460
 Did I really win or lose?

358
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,580
 This is the moment that I get the response I was waiting for.

359
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,530
Ho...

360
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,230
Honey.

361
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,620
Honey. I'm so relieved.

362
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,790
I'm so relieved.

363
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,650
I'm so relieved.

364
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,810
I am so relieved. Thank you. Thank you so much.

365
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,610
Thank you for being safe.

366
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,390
Thank you.

367
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,160
Were you really scared?

368
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,040
Thank you. Thank you.

369
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,370
 It's a good thing I came back.

370
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:50,350
 This is the Kim Yun Cheol I loved.

371
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,630
I'm glad you returned safely.

372
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,760
Thank you.

373
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,540
Did you see the culprit's face?

374
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,870
He wore a mask.

375
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,700
Was the culprit a man?

376
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,630
Only one person came in the house?

377
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,460
Do you remember where you were locked up?

378
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,260
I don't know.

379
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,930
I was tied to a chair and not even allowed to use a restroom.

380
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,470
Detective, that's enough for today.

381
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,310
Do you suspect anyone?

382
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,160
No.

383
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,300
- One more question. 
- Detective!

384
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,360
The couple set teacups that were on the sink, who were you drinking that with?

385
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:53,090
I made too much cocoa so I put them into two cups.

386
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,680
This should be enough to clear my name.

387
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,730
Not yet.

388
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,550
It's a shame she wasn't able to see the culprit's face.

389
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,810
We will need to look into it more.

390
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:28,330
I had an alibi. I was with someone else that day.

391
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,900
So adultery can be an alibi, too?

392
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,820
I'll figure that out myself and be punished by my wife for it.

393
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,880
Today I just want to focus on nursing my wife.

394
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:43,350
Nothing has changed regarding your charge for attempted poisoning.

395
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:52,610
So you poured the wine down the drain. But what about this cork that's absorbed that wine?

396
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,360
What do you mean poison?

397
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,540
I didn't put poison in there.

398
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,510
That we'll find out through test results.

399
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,100
If there wasn't poison in there, I don't think you would have attempted suicide.

400
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,800
You can't tell me that you tried to kill yourself because of your despair at your wife's possible death, can you?

401
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,820
When your wife came back alive

402
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:18,600
she could forgive your adultery if she finds out you attempted suicide.

403
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:24,250
And even if she didn't return alive, a suicide attempt would score you points in the court of public opinion, at least.

404
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,910
So if only you failed at your attempt,

405
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,210
it would be "killing two birds with one stone," right?

406
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,770
Sir.

407
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,970
The wine...

408
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,950
Just focus on nursing your wife for today.

409
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,980
They say no poison was found in the wine.

410
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,090
I see.

411
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,370
♫  Nous voyageons dans le même  ♫

412
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,820
The victim returned home safely, but there is no progress with the arrest of a suspect.

413
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,620
 The police are still waiting for more information from the public.

414
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,400
 However, her husband, Mr. Kim is no longer on the list of suspects.

415
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,880
 The victim Mrs. Sim does not know anything about abductor's location or any clues.

416
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,050
 The case is sinking into a maze.

417
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,680
 The police have concluded that Mrs. Sim's psychological condition is still delicate,

418
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,900
 so they intend to continue the investigation along with psychological treatment.

419
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:06,290
If you keep thinking about the incident and feeling uneasy, that is normal.

420
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,300
You don't have to try too hard to forget.

421
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:15,260
Please try to think about when you were happiest and when you felt the safest.

422
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,350
Your food is here

423
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,160
Try it.

424
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,260
Thank you for agreeing to a voluntary appearance.

425
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,180
Of course I should cooperate.

426
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,310
You didn't come just to see how much we knew, did you?

427
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,360
We found wine at Kim Yun Cheol's home.

428
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,360
 Purchase Receipt
 Kim Seon Mi

429
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,290
 Chinese lacquer tree

430
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:20,370
So I bought Chinese lacquer tree. What about it? Is something wrong with that?

431
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:24,410
Why you bought it is important.

432
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,260
Chinese lacquer tree has anticarcinogenic effects,

433
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,510
and it's also good for women's health. I guess you haven't heard.

434
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,300
No matter how healthy an ingredient is,

435
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,960
it can be medicine or poison depending on what it's mixed with. Like human fate.

436
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:47,230
You, Jin Seon Mi and Kim Yun Cheol,

437
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,770
how did you two become poison to each other?

438
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,010
What is it that you want to say?

439
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,390
Exactly how much of these events were part of your plan?

440
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,890
You wanted to use Kim Yun Cheol from the start right?

441
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,520
But this wasn't just for money.

442
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,860
It was to test the man's sincerity.

443
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,460
Is it me or the wife?

444
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,400
Who would he choose between the two?

445
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,870
So what did you two promise each other?

446
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,390
 I will catch up with you. Don't forget our promise.

447
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:53,150
You know Kim Yun Cheol's personality better than anyone.

448
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:58,290
Even if you gave him poison you knew he could never kill anyone.

449
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:02,550
Whatever the result, you would get 5 billion wons.

450
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,030
And you wouldn't need to share that money with Kim Yun Cheol,

451
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,290
so it would've been convenient for him to be the culprit.

452
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,100
We don't know each other.

453
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,400
Got it?

454
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,630
That's a good idea.

455
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,420
How much do you trust Kim Yun Cheol?

456
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:31,430
Must I trust him?

457
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,460
Look, I learned something new again.

458
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:43,130
But, the thing about a couple's relationship is, trust is very important.

459
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,020
Kim Yun Cheol couldn't get over his guilt and tried to commit suicide.

460
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,050
I'm curious.

461
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,950
What can the two of you learn from this incident?

462
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,060
Is he okay?

463
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,090
He's in the hospital.

464
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,330
He is passionately nursing his wife.

465
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,910
There was no poison found in the wine.

466
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,280
Too much!

467
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,190
Isn't this too big a twist?

468
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:48,850
From a thriller to a human melo (melodrama)?

469
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,160
Aren't you curious to know who the culprit is?

470
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,200
My wife's recovery is priority.

471
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,370
Are you okay?

472
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,960
I'm fine.

473
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,560
Okay. I don't understand.

474
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,630
Why the suicide attempt?

475
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,690
You weren't the one who drugged or kidnapped her.

476
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,250
To be honest, I have imagined it.

477
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,540
I thought it would be better if she disappeared.

478
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:30,760
I even joked that the most beautiful farewell for a married couple is death.

479
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,410
But it turned out, I wasn't joking.

480
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,890
I committed a grave sin against my wife.

481
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,220
To atone for what I did, starting now,

482
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,020
I want to do my best for my wife.

483
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,090
Before that, aren't you curious about the real culprit?

484
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:53,290
What's important right now is that Jae Gyeong is by my side.

485
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:59,700
I want to start a new life with my wife.

486
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:11,610
 Old Crop

487
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,860
There was no poison found in the wine.

488
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,660
A dinner for someone who is full? Or a dinner for someone who is hungry?

489
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,360
How did you get in?

490
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,410
You must've been deep in thought.

491
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:18,180
You didn't even lock the door properly.

492
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,130
You see...

493
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,930
I am the brother-in-law of the owner of this restaurant.

494
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,290
Well, the former brother-in-law, that is.

495
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,750
I've been here a few times.

496
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,520
What business do you have here?

497
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,680
I need to confirm a few things.

498
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,350
Confirm?

499
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,970
If you're the culprit of the kidnapping case or not.

500
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,720
If I had 5 billion won in my hands (~$4.3M),

501
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,780
do you think I'd be eating this crap?

502
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:59,210
Fierce hunger is usually a result of unfulfilled desire or anger.

503
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,970
Since you suffered humiliation,

504
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:04,270
you must find relief somehow.

505
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,020
What does that have to do with you?

506
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:10,960
I may have divorced his sister, but that doesn't mean I'm a total stranger.

507
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,820
Let's say it's a family issue.

508
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,920
Please leave.

509
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,230
See you again.

510
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,490
This is

511
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:34,200
dessert. It's really good.

512
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,440
 Forensic Chemical Analysis Report

513
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,790
Now you're fixated on the wine?

514
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,530
Based on the forensic analysis, there isn't anything unusual about this wine.

515
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:03,150
Instead of the evidence, sometimes the reaction to the evidence can be more probative evidence.

516
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,470
So that means he did put the poison in the wine.

517
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:13,450
So he put the poison in the wine, but they found no poison?

518
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,040
If he put the poison in, there's no way they won't find it.

519
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,660
But he definitely returned home with poisoned wine.

520
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,240
Is this a new piece of the puzzle?

521
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,700
So either there was never any poison,

522
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:32,320
or he got rid of it somehow?

523
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,520
I'm asking because I've suddenly become curious,

524
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,500
but I think it's better to not get married, don't you agree?

525
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,820
Go away!

526
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:49,000
 Victim of abduction found under a bridge after suffering serious external injuries...

527
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,710
- This way!
 - Oh, really!
  ... she still hasn't regained consciousness...

528
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,150
Chan! San!

529
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,350
- Dad!
 - Dad!

530
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,530
- Oh, I can't carry you.
 - Dad, let's play baseball.

531
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,660
What? Baseball? Didn't you kids play soccer?

532
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,710
- Did you catch the criminal? Who was it?
 - Why did he kidnap her, huh?

533
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,860
I wish I was abducted, too.

534
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,290
What?

535
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:13,890
- Dad, is this food?
 - No, it's laundry.

536
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,970
Oh, really.

537
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:24,350
 Ms. Sim is currently being transported by ambulance and her exact condition will only be known after an examination.

538
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:27,800
 The police are collecting any information about this abduction case

539
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,520
 And they said they will do their best to find the culprit.

540
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,620
I came home after a few days, and it's the same as when I left.

541
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,900
Is this some sort of civil war zone?

542
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,440
Ouch!

543
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,310
What are you doing?

544
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:53,480
Why won't you answer my phone calls?

545
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,330
Because I'm working.

546
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,890
And we don't have anything special to talk about anyway.

547
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,160
Flush the toilet, please.

548
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,350
So,

549
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:13,020
do you think you'll catch the culprit soon?

550
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,950
I will make sure that I do.

551
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,660
The culprit is always close by.

552
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,930
Oh, you startled me.

553
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,980
That was scary.

554
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:40,450
What? Hey! Chan's mom!

555
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,370
Auntie.

556
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,060
Chae Rim.

557
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,730
Sister-in-law.

558
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,700
Oh, Sister-in-law, you were hurt badly.

559
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,000
Goodness, thank you for returning safely.

560
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,730
- What...?
 - Oh, you.

561
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,940
Sister-in-law, I'm so sorry.

562
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,090
You knew what this pathetic guy was doing, didn't you?

563
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,100
Did you get on your knees and beg her?

564
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,960
- Yun Hui.
 - I think

565
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,980
I bear some responsibility, too.

566
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,440
No, we are sorry to you.

567
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,450
Mother, I

568
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:43,400
am just grateful that we are together right now.

569
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,680
Get down on your knees and beg right now.

570
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,410
Get down.

571
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,660
Aigoo, this boy.

572
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,440
I...

573
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,450
Jae Gyeong.

574
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:02,940
I will never make you upset again.

575
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,800
If you will only give me one more chance,

576
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,150
I will do really well.

577
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,920
From now on, I'll make you happy for the rest of my life.

578
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,980
 Yes, I will erase every memory from my head,

579
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,490
 and we will begin again.

580
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,530
After analyzing the CCTV video,

581
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,400
at the time the victim was abducted, her husband Kim Yun Cheol

582
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,320
was at his mistress, Jin Seon Mi's home.
  Exhibit 9: CCTV video from near Jin Seon Mi's home

583
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,820
So in this case, Kim Yun Cheol's footprints, and the blood found in the trunk of his car

584
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,670
were fabricated in order to make Kim Yun Cheol look like the suspect.

585
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:44,720
So have you been chasing an innocent person after falling into the trap of the real culprit?

586
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,290
There wasn't any poison in the wine, either.

587
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,270
But we did learn the movements of the real culprit.

588
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,690
There was a notable difference in time between the when the blood was put in the car and the blood that was found in the home.

589
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,310
And the more important thing is that, at the time of the abduction,

590
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:58,800
Kim Yun Cheol's car was at his mistress Jin Seon Mi's home.

591
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,580
So when was the victim's blood put into her husband's car?

592
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:04,010
After Kim Yun Cheol returned home.

593
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:08,410
Until that time, the culprit was hiding near the home.

594
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,320
Those actions are quite bold.

595
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,180
The culprit knew that Kim Yun Cheol would not return home until late.

596
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,360
The culprit also knew this couple's relationship well.

597
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:24,390
So it would mean that the culprit is deeply involved with these people.

598
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,560
Then?

599
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,170
So there is someone else involved.

600
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,920
After confirming that Kim Yun Cheol reported to the police that his wife was missing,

601
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,860
the culprit put Sim Jae Gyeong's blood in the car trunk and left the scene.

602
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:44,050
This shows intention to make Kim Yun Cheol into the criminal.

603
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,320
If they just needed money, these actions would not have been necessary.

604
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,570
It's someone who is trying to cause difficulties for Kim Yun Cheol.

605
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:52,940
There is a high possibility that that person is the true culprit.

606
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,820
So who is that?

607
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,770
We did a background check, and he is a college junior of Sim Jae Gyeong.

608
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,330
 Once the police began applying force,

609
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:05,670
 a delivery came for Kim Yun Cheol, and it was assumed that it was from the abductor.

610
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,120
The one who added comments about the abduction in SNS,

611
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,570
and the one who sent the abductor's video of the hostage,

612
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:13,240
there is a high possibility that it was Song Yu Min.

613
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,480
We are looking into the purchase records for the Hexa Copter drone that was used

614
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,020
to deliver the ransom money of five billion won and flight permits that were used.

615
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,160
While Song Yu Min was using the drone to distract the police,

616
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,170
the accomplice took the five billion won from the trash can at the baseball stadium.

617
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,610
But didn't you say that the baseball field CCTV showed that Kim Yun Cheol's mistress was there?

618
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:36,690
So are you saying those two conspired together?

619
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,180
 We received a request for cooperation with a police investigation.
 (text message from his college)

620
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:53,020
 So we sent your address and phone number that were in our alumni directory.

621
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,350
 We request your cooperation.

622
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,750
Is anyone home?

623
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,580
Are you home?

624
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,060
Hello?

625
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:58,330
Excuse us, but who are you?

626
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,120
We live there.

627
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,960
Ah yes.

628
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,160
I'm a relative.

629
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,960
Ah, I see.

630
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,020
These days, we are apprehensive whenever we see someone we don't know.

631
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,530
The culprit hasn't been caught yet, so we cannot relax.

632
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:18,820
If my wife got abducted or something, I would go crazy.

633
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,360
Don't be silly, we just met him.

634
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,440
- But it's the truth.
 - But still.

635
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,960
I couldn't live even a second without you.

636
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,560
In any case,

637
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,390
I wonder what happened with his extramarital affair?

638
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,220
 Welcome, Sim Jae Gyeong!

639
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,420
Oh, you've come?

640
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,850
Wow.

641
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:52,570
What a passionate welcome.

642
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,650
Of course, I should do at least this much.

643
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,380
She returned home alive.

644
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,910
Marriage is quite an amazing thing.

645
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:03,670
How is your girlfriend doing? Is she alright now?

646
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,220
I realized something due to recent events.

647
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,660
Who the most precious person to me is.

648
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:13,590
Hey, since you keep repeating yourself, it sounds almost sincere.

649
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,130
But everything has returned to its rightful place now.

650
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:20,210
So I just want to live a quiet life like none of this happened.

651
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:23,630
So you putting poison in the wine never happened, either?

652
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,950
I've never done that.

653
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,260
How lucky you were that the poison was not detected by the police.

654
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:40,290
Of course not. Because there was never any poison in that wine.

655
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:43,630
You should be honest with me, at least.

656
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,600
You can't deceive my eyes.

657
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,940
It's not that she's returned to where she belongs.

658
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,320
This is a chance.

659
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:58,310
You need money, five billion won.

660
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,460
So you better find it.

661
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,950
Let's find it, and you and I split it, 50-50.

662
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,660
You're acting like you know who the culprit is.

663
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,990
Can you find the money?

664
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,200
First, answer my question.

665
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:24,950
As the police suspected, you put the poison in the wine with a syringe, didn't you?

666
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,760
Did you do this in your car with the lights on?

667
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,580
No.

668
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:39,290
It's very hard for anyone to find out what you do in an unlit car late at night.

669
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:42,210
Did someone see this with their heart's eyes?

670
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,980
Or did they see what they already knew would happen?

671
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:54,310
Someone who already knew about the syringe with poison in it was monitoring you on the day of the incident

672
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:58,670
then leaked the information intentionally to the police.

673
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,130
Yes, there is someone who could have done that.

674
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:05,580
Jin Seon Mi?

675
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,750
I suspected her too, but the possibility is low.

676
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:13,010
She was involved with the poison from the start, and no way would she give the police

677
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,430
any information that could disadvantage her,

678
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,890
Then,

679
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:26,390
that only leaves one person. He's my wife's college junior or something?

680
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,830
- Junior?
 - He said he was her junior from art college.

681
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:31,550
He's been continuously following me.

682
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,950
Then he is the most likely suspect.

683
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:38,910
I better look into him.

684
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,840
Thank you.

685
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:46,040
Let's make one thing clear.

686
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:52,380
What we were chasing is not the culprit, but the 5 billion won.

687
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:59,930
I've always been unspeakably good at sniffing out money.

688
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:04,510
So good that my nickname was not "dog nose" but "money nose."

689
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:14,950
I will bet you ten cents that there is an accomplice.

690
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,970
The police even visited me at my art studio.

691
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,800
Really?

692
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:47,340
I may not be able to hide everything until the end.

693
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,850
It's alright.

694
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:53,850
Just tell them I told you to do it.

695
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:57,830
I'm not sure what I should do from now on.

696
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:01,230
Yu Min, calm down.

697
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:09,320
Seonbae, you should run away with me.

698
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,900
That guy tried to kill you.

699
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,480
Your voice is too loud.

700
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,390
What will you do now?

701
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:23,800
I have a plan.

702
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,670
I have plans, too.

703
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:33,490
I will make sure to protect you, Seonbae.

704
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:35,390
I realized something due to this recent event.

705
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:40,360
You are more important than art is to me, Seonbae.

706
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:06,820
Excuse me.

707
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,520
You said Sim Jae Gyeong suffered great heartache due to her husband's adultery, didn't you?

708
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,730
Was there violence, or any other notable things?

709
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,720
Well...

710
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,730
Please protect the privacy of the informant as well.

711
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,850
- Please give us one comment.
 - Put that away.

712
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:18,670
Please turn off your camera.

713
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,040
Please turn it off.

714
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,120
Just a moment.

715
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,390
Were you so close with our neighbor that you shared such secrets?

716
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,540
It was probably a secret that she wanted others to know.

717
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,200
What do you mean by that?

718
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,990
Nothing.

719
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:52,020
Are you still envious of those neighbors?

720
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:55,380
They're here!

721
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,830
Here they come.

722
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,420
Yes, it's them.

723
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,010
Excuse us, please.

724
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,780
- Excuse us, let us pass.
 - Please tell us how you feel returning home.

725
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,460
Please give us a comment.

726
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:21,460
Please excuse us, please let us pass.

727
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:25,620
Honey, just for a moment.

728
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:28,510
Will you be alright?

729
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:39,060
The police who made such efforts to save me,

730
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:42,500
and all those who exchanged bills to help us,

731
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:46,160
I would like to use this opportunity to give you my sincere thanks.

732
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:52,690
To my beloved husband who didn't give up and did his best,

733
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:59,200
and to my family, I am very grateful, deeply from my heart.

734
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,530
Everyone, thank you.

735
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,560
Please let us take a shot with both of your faces.

736
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,070
Yes, can you stand side by side?

737
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,460
Please look this way, too.

738
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,620
Please look this way.

739
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,000
- Please look this way.
 - This way.

740
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,060
Please look here.

741
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:15,860
Honey, they seemed like such an ideal couple.

742
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,620
But isn't this a total twist?

743
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,720
Aren't they putting on a show?

744
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:25,630
Maybe I shouldn't marry you. A husband can be a scary thing.

745
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:32,260
Honey? I'm more scared of a world in which you aren't there.

746
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,410
Shall we have a drink?

747
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:40,220
Oh, sorry. Let's order some more.

748
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:44,230
Can you suggest a wine for us?

749
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,620
 L'Amour Eternel

750
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:02,800
It's a proposal wine that is nicknamed, "Proposal Wine."

751
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:06,640
L' Amour Eternel.

752
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,690
Yes. It means eternal love.

753
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,430
 Welcome, Sim Jae Gyeong!

754
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:26,650
What is all this?

755
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:32,430
Welcome, Sim Jae Gyeong.

756
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,800
It's so pretty.

757
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,270
Thank you.

758
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,340
Do you like it?

759
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:43,610
I decided to cook for you, it's been so long.

760
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,290
How long has it been?

761
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:49,630
I really wanted to eat the food you made for me.

762
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,840
I will make it right away.

763
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:57,720
When it's ready, I'll come to get you, so rest up.

764
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:04,430
Hold on, what's that?

765
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,960
I'm sorry. When I thought something might happen to you...

766
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:16,050
Honey.

767
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,590
Even if I am born again, I would marry you again.

768
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,010
I'm so happy.

769
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:45,720
Be prepared... to become even happier.

770
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,100
Thank you.

771
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:50,210
So rest now.

772
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,860
It will be ready very soon.

773
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:15,380
 And all those who exchanged bills to help us,

774
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:20,770
 I would like to use this opportunity to give you my sincere thanks.

775
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:26,520
 To my beloved husband who didn't give up and did his best,

776
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,650
 and to my family, I am very grateful, deeply from my heart.

777
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:35,590
 Everyone, thank you.

778
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,260
 Please let us take a shot with both of your faces.

779
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,860
 Yes, can you stand side by side?

780
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,870
 Please look this way, too.

781
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,000
 Please look this way.

782
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,680
 Please look this way.
 - This way.

783
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,760
 Please look this way, too.

784
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,330
Sim Jae Gyeong.

785
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,450
So it was you?

786
01:09:54,990 --> 01:10:02,000

787
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:11,300
♫  What can I do for your love? Crazy every day without you  ♫

788
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,260
♫  I shout silently  ♫

789
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,960
 My Dangerous Wife

790
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,800
 Trust can be a matter of choice.

791
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:24,390
 Even if you gave me poison, I would still drink it.

792
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:27,000
 What we need is not facts.

793
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,760
 It's whether we survive or we get screwed.

794
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,130
 The person who tried to hide the poisoned wine. We have to find that person.

795
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,010
 Do you trust me?

796
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:37,720
 Were you looking for this?

797
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,130
 Do you know how apprehensive I was, as I looked at you?

798
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:44,020
 That you might make a mistake?

799
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,960
♫  Far away, get away  ♫

800
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,730
♫  Far away, get away right now  ♫

801
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,430
