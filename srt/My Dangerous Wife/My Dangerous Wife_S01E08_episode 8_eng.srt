00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,990

2
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,270
 Married Woman Abducted, Demand for 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,610
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,110
I just received a postcard in our mailbox.

5
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,500
It's from Song Yu Min.

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,780
There is a new cell phone number on it.

7
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,980
What are you saying?

8
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,190
I'm worried about you, that's why.

9
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,050
You're not worried about something else instead?

10
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,010
 Please be careful, Yun Cheol.

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,980
There is an enemy that we don't know about.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,920
I understand. Sure thing.

13
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,250
You're making me laugh.

14
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,820
Rather than trust you, I will trust in this money.

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,610
Why are you calling me so early?

16
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,090
Five billion won! It's in my hands now.

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,150
Five billion won!!

18
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,390
I found it in the coffee storage room.

19
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,470
We will take this money and run away together. Got it?

20
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,490
Hello?

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,100
Honey? Honey, what's wrong? Hello?

22
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,260
Sh*t, what is going on?

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,970
Hello?

24
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,050
 Yun Cheol? Hello? Can you hear me?

25
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,080
 Hello? 
 Team Leader Jin]

26
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,720
Money ...

27
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,040
Let's do it the way we previously agreed.

28
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,510
To split it in half, amicably.

29
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,570
I almost died just now. Consider what you did to me.

30
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,260
But we agreed that we'd split it 50-50 if we recovered the money.

31
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,560
And no matter what anyone says, you and I are family.

32
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,290
- Not anymore. 
 - Legally we are not. But think about familial affection.

33
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,020
Yes, affection. Yes, we have so much affection for each other.

34
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,800
Sorry, sorry.

35
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,170
I just ... don't want to live a shabby life anymore.

36
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,610
Please just leave it and go.

37
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,970
Oh, my back. Oh, it's killing me.

38
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,450
Take that!

39
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,040
Just half. Okay?

40
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,880
I'll throw you a little extra.

41
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,050
Stop there.

42
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,350
 Episode 8
 Dangerous Choice

43
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,030
Honey!

44
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,860
You did it!

45
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,350
Is this all five billion won?

46
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,190
It's only half.

47
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,390
Why?

48
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,860
My brother-in-law took the other half.

49
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,000
Why would he do that?

50
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,130
He premeditated it all.

51
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,310
How did he even know the money was here?

52
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,160
I know. That is what I want to know, too.

53
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,830
What?

54
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,270
Honey?

55
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,830
It's my wife.

56
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,890
♫  You wouldn’t know that I’ve got you now  ♫

57
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,070
♫  In no time, you  ♫

58
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,520
♫  You dare tear all my heart apart  ♫

59
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,950
♫  You have no fear, right?  ♫

60
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,130
♫  You who are wandering in the endlessly dark night  ♫

61
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,240
♫  I have put you in my hand  ♫

62

♫  You try to run away, but you can’t find a way out  ♫

63
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,970
♫  You are circling in my maze  ♫

64
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,980
Yun Cheol.

65
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,140
Yun Cheol?

66
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,420
Yun Cheol?

67
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Yun Cheol! Yun Cheol! Yun Cheol.

68
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,480
Yun Cheol, wake up, Yun Cheol.

69
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,270
Yun Cheol? Yun Cheol?

70
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,850
Are you all right? Are you awake now?

71
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,960
Are you all right?

72
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,920
Honey... Honey.

73
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,570
What happened?

74
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,330
I was roasting coffee beans.

75
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,000
And then someone suddenly attacked me from behind.

76
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,660
Who?

77
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,500
I don't know.

78
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,800
I felt a shock from behind. I fainted right away.

79
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,350
The coffee beans are all over the floor. Did you fight with someone?

80
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,160
No.

81
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,530
I'm so relieved that you are safe.

82
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,030
Do you think maybe the guy who attacked me is the one who killed Song Yu Min?

83
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,490
You could be right.

84
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,050
What do we do now?

85
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,130
Leave it to me. I think it's best if you rest for a while.

86
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,930
What do you plan to do?

87
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,860
I will get vengeance on your behalf.

88
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,030
Whoever it is, I must catch them.

89
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,720
 Coffee delivery label

90
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,070
The delivery label is gone.

91
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,110
 Empty Taxi

92
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,690
 CEO Kim Yun Cheol

93
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,610
- So you were here.
 - Where is that woman?

94
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,850
She left to find the attacker. Where's the money?

95
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,830
Honey, I'm sorry. That hurt, didn't it?

96
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,720
I thought I would really die.

97
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,200
But even so, wasn't it worth it?

98
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,470
I will acknowledge that.

99
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,960
What a shame I didn't get to see her face. I wonder what her expression looked like after having her five billion won stolen?

100
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,450
What are you doing? It was troublesome to pick all that up.

101
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,220
I've always wanted to do that.

102
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,320
Then why not do it before I picked it all up? Are you filming a movie right now? Or you could do it later.

103
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,630
Hurry and pick it up.

104
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,620
Don't be so scared. That woman is going after your brother-in-law, isn't she?

105
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,530
If my wife catches us, we don't know what might happen.

106
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,690
What? Will she commit murder again?

107
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,360
Yes, I am thinking that she is the one who killed Song Yu Min.

108
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,320
She is a scary woman who is capable of anything.

109
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,090
Your wife is certainly beyond my expectations.

110
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,030
Beyond imagination, you mean.

111
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,820
Let's go abroad, as far away as possible.

112
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,530
Sure. You'll give me time to pack, at least, won't you?

113
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,820
If we leave too abruptly, it can create suspicion. So spend today as we always would, and let's meet at night.

114
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,050
We're running away together.

115
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,680
Where should we go? South America?

116
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,420
Northern Europe?

117
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,330
As long as it's not here, anywhere is okay.

118
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,540
Do you remember, by any chance?

119
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,780
Someone who had a torn delivery label and asked you about it?

120
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,760
Well, I don't see him in this picture.

121
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,930
Then can you see if he's in this picture?

122
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,550
It's him. Yes, it's that man.

123
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,720
♫  Your bickering every day is wearing me out. Damn  ♫

124
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,250

My girl!

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,560
I will buy you the latest phone and notebook computer, anything you want.

142
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,870
 The more fury I feel, the more cool-headed I become.

143
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,720
 What choices do I have?

144
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,210
 In the end, there is only one answer.

145
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,560
 The one who took what is precious to me

146
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,480
 must be mercilessly eliminated.

147
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,010
 A lethal dose of Adokicin is 2 mg.

148
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,760
 Someone who ingests it will suffer organ failure and die within 12 hours.

149
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,260
 Perhaps among all emotions that humans can feel,

150
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,680
 is the desire for vengeance the one that is the hottest and the coldest?

151
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,850
 A tooth for a tooth. Poison for poison.

152
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,890
  I will use the poison that was going to kill me

153
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,910
 to recover my five billion won.

154
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,760
 Seoul Joongam Police Station

155
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,960
Let me see that frame again.

156
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,720
Seonbae.

157
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,240
The analysis of the fingerprints found on the motel handrail is done.

158
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,620
So what happened?

159
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,120
They analyzed the prints on the handrail and the position of the hand

160
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,910
and while he was still in the room, the hand motions indicate these movements, like this.

161
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,800
Like that, like his hand went around the handrail.

162
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,830
Went around? What, he was performing in a circus in there?

163
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,460
Someone pushed him, and he grabbed onto the handrail and resisted, like this.

164
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,210
And then he fell to his death?

165
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,300
Yes. It's definitely a homicide.

166
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,170
We also have a witness who was staying in the motel room next door.

167
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,350
They heard sounds of fighting from Song Yu Min's room, followed by the 'boom' sound.

168
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,650
Hold on, hold on, stop.

169
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,500
- Rewind that.
 - What is it?

170
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,440
There is someone who is running quickly away from the motel.

171
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,190
Stop.

172
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,400
Play from here.

173
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,800
Stop, stop.

174
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,730
Zoom in.

175
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,520
That matches the estimated time of Song Yu Min's death.

176
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,290
My cutie, who do you take after that you are so pretty?

177
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,160
It's me, Jae Gyeong.

178
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,260
Jae Gyeong, what brings you here?

179
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,430
Come in, please.

180
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,540
Welcome. Please come this way.

181
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,530
Oh, a mayfly?

182
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,710
Oh, please sit.

183
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,880
For you.

184
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,120
Goodness.

185
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,580
It's the first time I've ever had such a sumptuous boxed lunch.

186
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,060
I remember you telling me that you didn't even eat breakfast.

187
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,400
Let's eat this together. Hold on a moment.

188
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,190
Here.

189
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,340
Ladies first.

190
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,480
When my parents opposed our marriage,

191
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,510
I know that you helped us a lot, Brother-in-law.

192
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,420
Thinking back to that time, I am very grateful to you.

193
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,550
Wow, I guess I was helpful to someone at some point in my life, huh?

194
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,020
Of course, I had a proper job as a detective

195
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,590
as well as the credibility of a civil servant, at that time.

196
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,350
Yes, it was so dependable for me

197
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,660
to have such a family member like you.

198
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,990
That makes me feel a bit sorry that I am in this state now.

199
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,550
Once you are family you are always family. Does divorce change that?

200
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,400
I am so grateful to hear you say that.

201
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,690
We may be family, but money matters should be calculated exactly.

202
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,230
Will you return it to me?

203
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,580
My five billion won.

204
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,890
I don't know what you mean.

205
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,630
The day you came early to visit the restaurant,

206
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,390
you picked up the delivery label for coffee beans

207
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,890
and investigated by even going to the store, didn't you?

208
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,970
Such great investigative skills, worthy of a former detective such as yourself.

209
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,790
I have no idea what you are talking about.

210
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,390
If you return it to me now, I will forgive you.

211
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,560
There are usually two methods of getting a confession out of someone.

212
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,590
To present conclusive evidence, or to scare them and make them say it.

213
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,600
But presenting conclusive evidence

214
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,910
would be more of a disadvantage for you.

215
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,830
So, I plan to scare you a bit.

216
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,240
But what to do?

217
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,920
I've seen all sorts of things, and I've got nothing to lose.

218
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,570
And no matter how much you try to be scary, you are nothing but an ordinary housewife.

219
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,430
This is quite regrettable.

220
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,020
After all, wasn't that money used as a price for your life, Jae Gyeong?

221
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:36,040
So consider that money spent as a lump sum payment for your remaining life, and forget about it.

222
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,910
How did you get that wound on your face?

223
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,190
I was carrying a package I received and banged myself against the door.

224
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,460
Please be careful as you leave.

225
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,540
I see.

226
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,260
You should take care of yourself.

227
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,200
Enjoy the lunch box.

228
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,100
I didn't put any poison in it.

229
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,320
- Please give something extra to Table 3.
 - Yes.

230
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,760
 Brother-in-law

231
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,460
 Brother-in-law

232
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,800
Hello?

233
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,580
- Your wife just came by. 
 - What?

234
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,740
She directly asked me to return the money. Of course, I pretended to not know about it.

235
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,160
How does she know you took it?

236
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,230
You didn't accidentally let her know?

237
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,690
Are you crazy? Why would I?

238
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,380
She may even know that you took the other half.

239
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,000
 Your wife is no ordinary foe, I can tell you that.

240
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,830
 Brother-in-Law

241
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,460
 Missed Call from Wife

242
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:41,360
 The recipient is not answering the phone. Please leave a voicemail at the beep.

243
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,800
 Brother-in-law

244
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,190
We are accomplices now, so we have to work together.

245
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,760
You be careful. And do not mess me up.

246
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,220
Stay alert.

247
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,640
 Husband

248
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,420
 CEO Kim Yun Cheol

249
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,490
What's going on?

250
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,150
We have to leave now. Change your clothes right now.

251
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,900
- Why? 
 - I think my wife found out.

252
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,370
- How? 
 - I don't know either.

253
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,120
But that's what it feels like. We have to leave now.

254
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,020
I understand.

255
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,760
I've got some work to do off-site.

256
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,120
Is something the matter?

257
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,320
Just talking care of some trouble.

258
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,640
Oh, what?!

259
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,080
I think... there's something there.

260
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,590
Oh, it's fine. I'm just fine.

261
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,950
Is Team Leader Jin going with you, by any chance?

262
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,960
Yes, she's the one who did this, so I need to fix this problem with her.

263
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,170
Please take care of the restaurant.

264
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,670
Welcome.

265
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,020
Oh, Yun Cheol, I'm glad you are here.

266
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,190
Yes, what brings you here?

267
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,620
Oh, we have some urgent off-site business, so please excuse us.

268
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,930
What? What?

269
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,710
What's the matter?

270
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,410
Huh? Oh.

271
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,140
That woman, she's that woman from that time, isn't she?

272
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,490
Honey.

273
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,410
She's not as pretty in real life, compared to the TV.

274
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,900
Honey, let's go.

275
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,520
Please enjoy your meal.

276
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,980
Please seat them.

277
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,740
Hurry, hurry.

278
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:52,510
It should be a busy time for your restaurant, but both of you are going off-site?

279
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,240
Yes, we have some urgent business to take care of.

280
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,290
Our business is urgent, as well.

281
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,520
Please come back next time.

282
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,080
Please put down the heavy bag and speak to us for a moment.

283
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,330
But these are for our vendors.

284
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,300
- Team Leader Jin, maybe you should go ahead? 
 - Shall I?

285
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,620
Our business happens to be more urgent regarding Jin Seon Mi, actually.

286
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,630
Let's go.

287
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,630
Ah really! I told you we are busy!

288
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,310
Please show me that again.

289
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,880
- What is this? 
 - We estimate Song Yu Min's time of death as 5 am to 7 am yesterday.

290
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,870
But right at that time, near the motel,

291
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,620
we found this suspect who was running away.

292
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,330
This person in the video, she's a woman, isn't she?

293
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,460
Based on her clothing, yes.

294
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,990
 It's my wife.

295
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:20,090
 She did kill Song Yu Min after all. What a scary woman.

296
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,500
Where were you at that time?

297
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,450
- I was sleeping at home. 
 - Can you prove it?

298
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,470
I told you, I was sleeping at home.

299
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,720
You are the witness, Detective. You came to my home, very early in the morning, didn't you?

300
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,900
But that doesn't prove that you were at home all night long.

301
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,940
But you don't have any proof that I wasn't.

302
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,060
Are you sure you were home from 5 am to 7 am yesterday morning?

303
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,760
Do you have a warrant?

304
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,450
Can the police torment someone like this without any evidence at all?

305
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,050
You're not even letting us take care of business off-site.

306
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,090
Why are you investigating us?

307
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,430
Wasn't Song Yu Min's death ruled a suicide?

308
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,690
It's a homicide.

309
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,760
Homicide? Who...?

310
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,840
It seems connected to Sim Jae Gyeong's abduction.

311
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,630
Even after the death of Song Yu Min, the most likely suspect, that case is still under investigation.

312
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,930
Not to mention, Song Yu Min did not work alone.

313
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,640
What proof do you have?

314
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,010
At the time of the incident, Song Yu Min rented two unregistered cars.

315
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,040
It looks like he and his accomplice each drove one.

316
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,780
So you mean the woman in this video is the accomplice.

317
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,720
Do you have any clothes like this?

318
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,940
I do not.

319
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,930
These are very common clothes.

320
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,550
- Welcome. 
 - Where is Mr. Kim?

321
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,240
He just left to work off-site with Team Leader Jin.

322
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,920
Hey.

323
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,630
What?

324
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,250
I understand.

325
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,820
Jae Gyeong.

326
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,970
Omo, you've come?

327
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,660
We came to eat.

328
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,870
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

329
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,790
Jae Gyeong?

330
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,120
I was so shocked earlier.

331
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,170
His mistress still works here?

332
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,670
Did you forgive her?

333
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,620
Yes.

334
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,880
You're not even a woman. How can someone be so lacking in bitterness?

335
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,460
Please give this to Jin Seon Mi, will you?

336
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,810
What should I tell her about this?

337
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,230
Just think of it as a fan letter.

338
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,460
- Sure. 
 - Thank you for your concern.

339
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,050
Enjoy your date with your husband.

340
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,020
Does she really think they went to work off-site?

341
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,300
So where did they go, then?

342
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,760
Yes, go ahead and believe that things are just the way they appear on the surface.

343
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,820
Honey, do you think she's the woman in that video?

344
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,200
My wife definitely killed Song Yu Min. You better hurry if you want to live.

345
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,860
Okay.

346
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,840
 Turn off / Off

347
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,690
- What are you doing? 
 - We have to make sure she can't track us, so she can't follow us.

348
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,610
You turn your phone off, too.

349
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,990
Okay. We finally escape.

350
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,220
It's alright, just wait. I'm sure your wife will act calmly in front of me.

351
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,300
She won't want to reveal herself to me.

352
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,930
What do you plan to do?

353
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,120
Just watch.

354
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,870
♫  I see and trust only you  ♫

355
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,130
Yes, what's up?

356
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,320
I heard that you're working off-site. Where are you going?

357
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,850
Hello, Madam.

358
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,690
I think our restaurant is about to get some great news.

359
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,840
We will have a good meeting and return.

360
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,120
Ah, is that so?

361
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,940
Oh, right.

362
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,640
Let me return the severance pay you gave me before. I no longer need it.

363
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,200
Ah, I see.

364
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,660
Thank you.

365
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,750
Then we will return soon.

366
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,660
Please take good care of him.

367
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,270
I'll see you later.

368
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,330
Have a good trip.
 ♫  The pledge to be together for life  ♫

369
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,550
♫  easily fell apart  ♫

370
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,030
♫  In the slightest breeze  ♫

371
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,820
We finally escape.

372
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:12,190
I feel great. Did you hear her? She said, "Please take good care of him."

373
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,720
She said, "Have a good trip." But we will never return.

374
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,180
Honey, did you bring your passport?

375
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,350
♫  Love is something I don't have anymore  ♫

376
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,150
What's wrong?

377
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,090
Ah, passport.

378
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,450
You should have told me about this earlier.

379
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,420
Hurry and go.

380
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,150
Chae Rim?

381
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,710
Auntie.

382
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,050
- What are you doing here? 
 - You're surprised, aren't you?

383
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,450
Ta-da. I hope you like this, Chae Rim.

384
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,250
Why a gift for me, all of a sudden?

385
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,920
To thank you for congratulating me when I got out of the hospital.

386
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,790
Thank you.

387
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,920
I have one more gift for you.

388
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,050
Another one?

389
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,930
Want to get in the car?

390
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,230
Is this your car, Auntie? Did you get a new one?

391
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:16,230
No, I borrowed it. To prepare for your other gift.

392
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:24,210
- Want to eat this? 
 - Thank you for the second gift.

393
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,280
This is just a treat. The real gift is something else.

394
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,360
I'm looking forward to it.

395
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,160
 Text Message from: My Daughter

396
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,710
What is it, what is it?

397
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,310
 You stole something that is precious to me, so I will steal something that is precious to you. -N31-

398
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,000
 You stole something that is precious to me, so I will steal something that is precious to you. -N31-

399
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,950
 Call from: Chae Rim's Mom

400
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,810
What?

401
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,740
I got a text message from Chae Rim.

402
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,470
What?

403
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,200
You're with her right now, aren't you?

404
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,860
What did the text message say?

405
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,180
That she met you so she'll spend time with you before she comes home.

406
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:45,360
I won't stop you, but it's not convenient for me if you suddenly take her like this.

407
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,580
Next time, please contact me beforehand.

408
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,040
Make sure to bring her home by 7 pm, she has school tomorrow.

409
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,620
Okay, I understand. Got it.

410
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,070
I'll bring her home safely, so don't worry.

411
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,330
But what's with you, suddenly?

412
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,220
Why would you just take her at such a random time?

413
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,380
I got it, so I'll hang up now.

414
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,770
 Undam Frozen Goods
 Undam Foods

415
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,020
 New Text Message: My Daughter

416
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,560
 New Text Message: My Daughter

417
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,090
 Bring the stolen 5 billion won to Undam Foods Factory. We will make an exchange. No negotiations. -N31-

418
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:08,840
I think you are mistaken, but I did not steal anything.

419
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,610
And don't decide on your own what is most precious to me.

420
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,350
I don't care what happens to the child.

421
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,420
I was divorced, after all.

422
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,240
So do whatever you want to.

423
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,540
Whether she is precious to him or not, I will find out in time.

424
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,800
She's just bluffing.

425
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,850
What could she do to the child?

426
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,340
 Text message from: My daughter

427
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,850
Hold on, hold on.

428
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,430
What?

429
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:27,350
Let me see our babies one more time.

430
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,390
- Shall we?
 - Yeah.

431
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,620
Honey, can't we take just 100 million won more with us? ($90,000)

432
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,090
It will just be a burden.

433
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:43,320
When we finish spending what we took, we'll just come back and get more.

434
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,320
My honey is so smart at times like this.

435
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,190
Alright.

436
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,680
I'm done.

437
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,890
Yes, that's the earliest flight.

438
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,460
Should we upgrade to business class?

439
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,960
Why? Are you doing business with me?

440
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,610
Not first class?

441
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:26,460
I didn't want to say that suddenly, you might get indigestion.

442
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,910
If you sit in first class, you could even digest a rock.

443
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,830
Yes, I'm going to go for it. We will leave here without looking back.

444
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,420
Let me call my mom and sister.

445
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,010
 Brother-in-law

446
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,480
Yes, Brother-in-law?

447
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,610
Where are you!?

448
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,580
Well, I am about to—

449
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,200
Never mind. Bring the money right now.

450
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,870
What?

451
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:59,830
That crazy woman kidnapped Chae Rim.

452
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,400
Hold on. Would she really do anything to a child?

453
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,570
Could you say that after seeing that?

454
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,760
I sent it to you. Check it right now.

455
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,010
What is this?

456
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,970
 Hurry and bring the 5 billion won before what is precious to you becomes ruined. -N31-

457
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,160
I will kill that woman.

458
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,390
Brother-in-law?

459
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,500
Never mind!

460
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:48,830
Bring the money right now or I will kill you, too.

461
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,730
You're not really thinking of taking that, are you?

462
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,690
This is about them. We don't have to bring them our money, do we?

463
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,470
Sorry. What's wrong is wrong.

464
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,990
If I don't stop my wife now, everyone will be in danger.

465
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,600
No. No!

466
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,020
Don't go.

467
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:47,400
She's a child. She is not involved in this fight among adults. And she's still alive.

468
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,350
Do I need to explain further?

469
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,400
No!

470
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,880
 Uncle.

471
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,590
 Auntie taught this to me.

472
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:31,090
 If I'm having unhappy thoughts, hold the candy in my hand.

473
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:40,530
 If I don't feel better, then unwrap the candy and eat it.

474
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,130
 While eating it, try to let it melt slowly.

475
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,180
 Like this?

476
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,990
 Don't worry, Uncle.

477
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,460
 It will be alright.

478
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,190
 Thank you, Chae Rim.

479
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,630
This cannot happen.

480
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,100
 Undam Frozen Goods
 Undam Foods

481
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,860
This is the factory my father-in-law used to operate in the past.

482
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,230
Chae Rim!

483
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,560
Chae Rim!!

484
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,450
Chae Rim!

485
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,340
Chae Rim!!

486
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,100
Chae Rim!

487
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,420
Chae Rim!!

488
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,340
Chae Rim!!!

489
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,010
Chae Rim!

490
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,190
- Chae Rim!
 - Chae Rim!

491
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,350
Chae Rim!

492
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,630
Sim Jae Gyeong, you!

493
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,490
 You two came together?

494
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,810
 Yes, familial affection really is grand.

495
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,020
What are you doing right now?

496
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,190
What are you doing, to family!?

497
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,720
 I should be the one asking that question first.

498
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,260
You have really gone too far.

499
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,790
 This is wrong!

500
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:16,190
Is that so? But I want to go further.

501
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:20,780
Honey, how did you become like this?

502
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,100
When I was young,

503
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,290
I came here often to play.

504
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,360
They raised a goldfish in the office.

505
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,090
Oh, what was its name?

506
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,370
Hurry and return my daughter to me!

507
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:41,100
 Be quiet. Please concentrate on what I am saying.

508
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,820
Listen to my story!

509
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:51,220
 I think I came here often because my parents didn't allow pets at home.

510
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,970
I enjoyed feeding and taming something.

511
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,470
What is it that you want to say?

512
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,780
But if I think about it,

513
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,030
the goldfish wasn't very important.

514
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:10,240
It turned out, I wanted to see Dad.

515
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,190
 I enjoyed eating the snacks that Dad gave me.

516
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,860
And the goldfish... was me.

517
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,130
Chae Rim... where is Chae Rim, Ma'am?

518
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,380
"Where is Chae Rim, Ma'am?"

519
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,490
Why are you speaking formally to me, all of a sudden?

520
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,570
And what's with that desperate expression?

521
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,500
It's too intense for dealing with an ordinary housewife, isn't it?

522
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,400
I asked you where Chae Rim is!?

523
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,530
Money.

524
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,000
Show me the money first.

525
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,750
There.

526
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,090
Now show me Chae Rim.

527
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:10,620
 Over there, put it in that compartment.

528
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,610
 Then I'll tell you.

529
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,140
Chae Rim is safe, isn't she?

530
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,990
Do you know what kind of candy your daughter likes?

531
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,190
 On this candy,

532
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,660
 I put on a little bit of wine that I treasure.

533
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:46,200
 My only family member in this world, my husband,

534
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,830
 prepared this special wine

535
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:52,100
 just for me.

536
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,060
Adokicin?

537
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,610
Oh! No!

538
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,570
You... you didn't...

539
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,260
I didn't give her a lot of candy.

540
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,740
Because I loved Chae Rim, too.

541
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,230
 Sim Jae Gyeong, you...

542
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,200
Chae Rim asked me for more candy.

543
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,550
Maybe she'll get cavities?

544
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,810
 I will kill you. I will kill you!

545
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:57,250
 If you don't want to die, tell me where Chae Rim is! Now!

546
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,630
So hurry and put the money in the compartment.

547
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,450
Then I will tell you.

548
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:07,020
Hurry now. If you don't do it quickly—

549
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,690
I put it in. Now tell me where Chae Rim is.

550
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:26,600
- Now!
 - Stop this, already!

551
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,670
She's here.

552
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,030
- Oh.
 - Chae Rim!!

553
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,280
4th Floor. At the end.

554
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,770
At the end of the line.

555
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,580
You...

556
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,650
Chae Rim!

557
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,240
Chae Rim!!

558
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:16,080
Oh...

559
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,030
Chae Rim!!

560
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:25,620
Chae Rim.

561
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,720
Chae Rim?

562
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,450
Dad.

563
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,910
Chae Rim, are you alright?

564
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,320
Chae Rim, are you really alright?

565
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:21,250
I'm fine. I'm sorry for deceiving you, Dad.

566
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,180
I told Auntie all my worries.

567
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,530
That I thought you weren't very interested in me, Dad.

568
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,220
So Auntie said,

569
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,360
 How about experimenting with what we talked about before?

570
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,510
 Experiment?

571
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:41,210
 Yes. How much your dad cherishes you.

572
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:44,360
 That sounds fun.

573
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,040
Your fingernail?

574
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:58,570
The Cool Kids Nail Set. (toy) Don't you know about these?

575
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:05,500
You were really shocked, huh, Dad? I'm sorry.

576
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,540
You're my daughter

577
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,830
but this wasn't right.

578
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,780
But I deceived a detective,

579
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,620
so I really am your daughter, right?

580
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,090
I'm so happy you came for me.

581
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:28,930
I'll acknowledge that you are my dad.

582
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:31,640
Dad is sorry.

583
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,670
♫  Far away, get away, right now.  ♫

584
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:46,100
♫  Without you, without you  ♫

585
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,830
♫  Far away, get away, right now.  ♫

586
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,480
 Who did I live with for the last six years?

587
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,440
 The wife that I thought I knew... did not exist.

588
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,040
 Old Crop

589
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,260
Did something happen?

590
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,270
Are you alright? Take your time eating.

591
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,040
I just want to be alone, okay?

592
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,360
Someone asked me to give this to you, today.

593
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,940
Do you have any idea about what N31 is?

594
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,660
No, not at all.

595
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:32,260
I feel like the answer is there.

596
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,350
 Prepare 5 billion won. If you report this, your wife will die.

597
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,430
- N31 -

598
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,390
 -N31-

599
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,020
What your wife really wants,

600
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,710
and why she is acting so irrationally,

601
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,790
I feel like the answer lies with N31.

602
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,120
What she really wants?

603
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,620
Going this far to get back at a cheating husband?

604
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,530
All husbands in Korea would die of fear.

605
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,490
She must have some other purpose.

606
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,260
Another purpose?

607
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:00,630
- So what would that be?
 - I don't know.

608
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:02,920
I feel like we need more imagination, somehow.

609
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,260
One thing that is certain, this is not a simple crime.

610
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,230
It's really interesting, actually.

611
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,720
Gosh. I have a new opinion about your wife now.

612
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,600
I take back ever calling her an ordinary housewife.

613
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,330
Is this a dream or real life? I'm really scared to death now.

614
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,590
Even a ferocious dog won't bite its owner.

615
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:27,030
Appease her gently.

616
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,080
I'll investigate on my own, too.

617
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,790
So what should I do now?

618
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,480
In my line of work, I have met all kinds of married couples.

619
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,000
And there is only one thing that is important.

620
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,720
No matter what the circumstances are, in the end,

621
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,950
the spouses need to decide for themselves.

622
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,390
But there is one piece of advice I really want to give you.

623
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,240
What is it?

624
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,250
Be careful and don't die.

625
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:03,020
Because a ferocious dog will bite its owner when it is desperate.

626
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,680
Welcome.

627
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,190
I was worried that you might not come.

628
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:44,350
But I'm happy you came.

629
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:46,090
Have a seat.

630
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,850
- Lieutenant Seo.
 - Ah, yes.

631
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:12,200
You're still at it? I told you, wrap this case up already.

632
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,610
This isn't a simple suicide.

633
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:17,690
Won't you go home? Don't get kicked out of your family while taking care of someone else's.

634
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:21,230
Haven't you heard the saying, "When one's home is happy, all goes well." Don't become like me.

635
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:24,010
- Take care of your household. 
 - Yes.

636
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,850
- So go home. 
 - Yes, good night.

637
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,810
My household...

638
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,890
Household?

639
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,470
Wife?

640
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,690
Catch me if you can.

641
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,860
Don't run, don't run, don't run.

642
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,450
I told you not to run.

643
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,930
Clean up your toys. Put them in there.

644
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,760
Mom, why are you always packing everything up?

645
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,820
I have to clean it up so you guys have room to play.

646
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,180
I think our play area has become even smaller.

647
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,500
Look, look.

648
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,580
Like this. Clean.

649
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,420
If you clean up, ta-da. More space to play.

650
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,610
If you buy less stuff, won't you have less to put away?

651
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,070
Adults don't ever make sense. Do they, Hyeong?

652
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,080
Let's play.

653
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,940
Catch me!

654
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,680
Please don't run.

655
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,230
 Catch me if you can!

656
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,230
Are you trying to hit me?

657
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,750
 Samoyed

658
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:20,930
 Samoyed

659
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,650
It was you, wasn't it?

660
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,390
The one who killed Song Yu Min?

661
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:19,360
 Even though the fire burned the entire building, it did not burn this painting.

662
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:25,200
 It means there was either a great affection for this work of art or a great affection for the subject of the art.

663
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:49,360
♫  I see and trust only you  ♫

664
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:54,730
♫  There was a time like that  ♫

665
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:59,210
♫  A dream-like time  ♫

666
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:10,600
♫  I know the next story which only you don't know  ♫

667
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,220
 Do you know when the real end of the line is?

668
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,120
 When we give up.

669
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,980
 I haven't yet. We will go further.

670
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,750
 For what?

671
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,260
 Because that's how I want it.

672
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:25,020
♫  Forever  ♫

673
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,560
Welcome home.

674
01:00:55,530 --> 01:01:01,100
I thought it was strange from the moment I saw you passed out this morning.

675
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,790
You said you fainted after being shocked by the stun gun.

676
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:07,360
But a lot of coffee beans were stuck on the soles of your shoes.

677
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,600
So I knew

678
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,800
that you were continuing to lie to me.

679
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:31,620
Do you know how hurt and disappointed I was?

680
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,860
Were you only kind and warm to me because of money?

681
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,780
Did you endure me until you got the money in your hands?

682
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:43,990
If I say that is true?

683
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,820
Then you must apologize.

684
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,560
Do you really deserve an apology?

685
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,260
You lied to me from the start, too.

686
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:56,190
You said the money disappeared. This money,

687
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,430
you said you didn't need it.

688
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,800
I'm sure you're the one who killed Song Yu Min, too.

689
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,570
No, I told you that I didn't.

690
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:09,160
What is it that you really want?

691
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,260
Money. In the end, it's this money!

692
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,070
Isn't it?

693
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:23,050
Why? You thought you were pouring water into a bottomless jar, so you refused my request for a loan.

694
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:26,360
And then you faked getting kidnapped, using revenge against me as an excuse.

695
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,450
You used an innocent hoobae, even your young niece, all for the purpose of

696
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:31,930
holding onto that five billion won, that money, isn't it?

697
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:37,210
Yes, money! Because that is the reason you are staying by my side.

698
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:41,470
From the beginning, I was never enough for you.

699
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:47,170
Even now, didn't you come back home because you were thinking about that five billion won?

700
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,650
You didn't come home because this was your home, did you?

701
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,820
Or to see me?

702
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,560
I don't need money now.

703
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,900
This is my conclusion.

704
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,240
We should break up now.

705
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,100
We should have made this decision sooner.

706
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,550
 Divorce Petition

707
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:17,500
 The wasted six years from which I gained nothing.

708
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:22,730
 For me, this marriage began at a peak, and it was all downhill from there.

709
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,700
 For what must I stay and endure?

710
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:34,430
 Perhaps the only happy ending of a marriage is divorce.

711
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,110
 We've both done unspeakable things.

712
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:45,140
 Let us each receive punishment for our own sins.

713
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:51,710
Don't move, Honey! You cannot go anywhere without my permission!

714
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:04,630
 They were six years from which I gained nothing, but I am grateful for one thing.

715
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,100
 I learned one great thing, thanks to my wife.

716
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:20,410
 That there is only one thing left in life.

717
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:23,700
 And that is... money.

718

♫  You wouldn’t know that I’ve got you now  ♫

719
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:38,500
 Marriage is the exchange of resources. Since this money was once in my bank account, it is right for me to take it now.

720
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,200

 My Dangerous Wife
 Preview

734
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:30,830
 Forgetting everything and beginning anew wouldn't be so bad.

735
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,550
 But why am I in the hospital?

736
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,490
 Did she really lose her memories?

737
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:38,930
 Honey.

738
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:43,030
 If one of you is acting, the other one should act, too.

739
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,380
 We are surrounded by enemies, huh?

740
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:49,330
 I knew there was an accomplice.

741
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:54,020
 What I'm curious about is what you are planning now.

744
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,420
♫  But even that feels like you are in a play that’s already written  ♫
