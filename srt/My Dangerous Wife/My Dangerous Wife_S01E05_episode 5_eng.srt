1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:07,990

2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,700
 Married Woman Abducted, Demand for 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,650
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,650
 I trusted you.

5
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,120
 All I need is you.

6
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,600
 Kim Yun Cheol's footprints, and the blood found in the trunk of his car

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,190
 were fabricated in order to make Kim Yun Cheol look like the suspect.

8
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,530
 She loved you a lot.

9
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,130
 She knew that you were having an affair with another woman,

10
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,320
 but she couldn't let you know she knew.

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,490
 I would like to use this opportunity to give you my sincere thanks.

12
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,750
  ... and to my family,  ...

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,020
 If you gave it to me I would drink it even if it were poison.

14
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,900
 Suspicion is spreading like poison.

15
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,200
 What if this abduction was a self-fabricated scene?

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,250
 What if your wife did it?

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,600
 Has she been meticulously planning this?

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,060
 This was inside. What is this?

19
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,920
 The person who tried to hide the poisoned wine.

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,140
  We have to find that person.

21
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,390
 What else are you hiding?  Somehow, I thought there might be other keys.

22
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,820
 A wife full of unexpected twists.

23
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,590
 Are you looking for this by any chance?

24
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,100
 You should have trusted me.

25
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,390
 So, it was you, after all?

26
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,730
 Are you stupid or naive?

27
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,370
 Why do you think I would carry around such an important piece of evidence?

28
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,810
 I think Song Yu Min did all this.

29
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,760
 This case ...  I think this is just the beginning.

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,010
 There's definitely an accomplice. I think the accomplice did this.

31
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,150
We should have wine on a day like today.

32
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,900
We're finally drinking together.

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,440
"Forever until death do us part."

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,170
It's a vow that didn't make any sense from the start.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,810
But what should I do? I made a promise.

36
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,970
Do you know?

37
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,630
Revenge is a poison I drink in the hope someone will die.

38
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,570
We already drank the poison.

39
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,160
We are going to go until death do us part.

40
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,050
Shall we celebrate?

41
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,380
To our new start. Cheers!

42
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,170
It's okay.

43
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,160
It's not poisoned.

44
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,770
Drink.

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,120
Is it good?

46
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,170
Give me a straight answer.

47
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,490
I thought you would appreciate it.

48
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,060
 Episode 5.  A Bloody Married Life

49
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,390
That freaked me out. I thought it was a person.

50
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,810
But what does he do for a living.  To have stuff like this?

51
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,220
Sunbaenim. I heard gasoline was sprayed inside.

52
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,640
- What about a suspect? 
 - I don't think anyone was home.   I can't contact the owner.

53
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,330
Arson at this time.

54
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,500
Detective Seo. There's something strange here.

55
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,050
Isn't it a bit... scary?

56
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,850
It's almost religious.

57
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,190
Is this a temple?

58
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,330
 Will you two love each other until death parts you?

59
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,940
 - Yes. I will love him. 
 - Yes, I will love her.

60
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,350
 Groom,  put the ring on the bride's finger.

61
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,670
 Just a moment.

62
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,590
 It's your turn now.

63
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,950
Are you up already?

64
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,520
Yes. You're up early.

65
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,060
It will be done soon.  Wait a short while.

66
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,040
 In Mr. Song's studio, evidence of Ms. Sim's kidnapping was discovered ...

67
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,700
 Kidnapping Case and Arson Together Are A Mystery

68
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,060
 Most likely suspect Mr. Song burned all the evidence and disappeared.

69
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,390
You didn't kill her. If so, did you hide it somewhere else?

70
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,370
 Team Leader Jin

71
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,080
 Team Leader Jin

72
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,870
I am charging it.

73
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,030
Is that call not important?  I think you've been continually getting messages.

74
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,030
 Seon Mi:  It's important.  Call me immediately.

75
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,920
Right now, I am ...

76
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,160
 Did they take care of things, leaving nothing behind?

77
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,040
What are you doing?

78
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,370
I haven't polished my shoes in a long time.

79
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,370
Breakfast is ready.

80
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,290
All right.

81
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,410
Honey.

82
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,260
Eat the juk (rice porridge) while it's still warm

83
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,140
Okay.

84
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,760
 Actually, I hate juk.

85
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,760
 (TN:  The word for porridge "juk" is a homonym for the word death/kill.)

86
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,720
It's juk.  It's juk.

87
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,810
It's juk.

88
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,950
I

89
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,760
hate juk!

90
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,190
Juk, juk, juk, I hate it all.  Sim Jae Gyeong, I hate you more!

91
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,950
Honey, at this rate your juk will get cold.

92
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,560
It's delicious.

93
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,220
 I was wrong to try to find out about my wife.

94
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,980
 She is more dangerous than I anticipated.

95
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,330
You should drink yours too.

96
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,520
 How can I live in fear of my wife like this for the rest of my life?

97
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,330
It was for your face...

98
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,090
Honey.

99
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,000
- What's the matter? 
 - I'm going to wipe it again.

100
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,500
 Okay?  Let me try ...

101
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,560
It's the police again.

102
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,410
What should we do now?

103
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,220
What do you mean?  There are two of us.  We should handle the crisis.

104
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,500
We're a married couple.

105
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,800
Do you know Song Yu Min?

106
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,830
Yes.

107
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,720
His studio was burned by arson.

108
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,890
I saw it on the news.

109
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,450
Have you seen him recently?

110
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,850
Once or twice.

111
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,530
For what reason?

112
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,530
I consulted him about my husband's extra-marital affair.

113
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,100
Have you ever been to his studio?

114
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,300
No.

115
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,750
Then, you didn't know about the secret underground space beneath his studio?

116
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,720
A secret space?

117
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,730
Does this look like anyone you know?

118
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,470
Oh my god.  This is me!

119
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,810
Have you been a model recently?

120
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,630
No. I was a model once in college

121
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,550
No, this looks... how you look right now...

122
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,250
Then, is this painting made just from the memory of then?

123
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,720
Even though the fire burned the entire building, it did not burn this painting.

124
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,900
It means there was either a great affection for this work of art

125
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,230
or a great affection  for the subject of the art.

126
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,670
Honey, I'm frightened.

127
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,260
Could this perhaps be the person wearing the mask when you were kidnapped?

128
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,290
No. He's not the one.

129
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,900
Do the police suspect him?

130
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,400
Yes, for now. There is a possibility of other accomplices.

131
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,540
There are accomplices?

132
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,920
I want to return to the time when none of this happened.

133
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,990
The culprit will be caught.

134
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,960
I worry about that too.

135
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,650
It's so scary to find out who the culprit is.

136
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,920
You have a reliable husband.

137
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,340
Yes.

138
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,670
By the way, what did you two do last night?

139
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,670
 Give it to me.

140
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,610
To celebrate your safe return home, I wondered if you had a drink, even if it was wine.

141
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,160
Yes.  It wasn't the wine I wanted, but I enjoyed it.

142
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,900
Last night was a very special night.

143
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,910
It's a real relief you returned home without any major difficulties.

144
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,190
Why did he do it?

145
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,120
Why did he burn his whole studio

146
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:25,200
but leave just a painting that would be a disadvantage to him?

147
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,720
He wanted to express his mindset.

148
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,520
You mean to my wife?

149
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,220
If not, there would be some other motive.

150
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,160
Someone would be trying to frame Song Yu Min as the culprit.

151
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,870
Do you know who did that?

152
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,590
Don't worry too much.  The culprit will definitely be caught.

153
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,090
Please contact me immediately if Song Yu Min contacts or approaches you.

154
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,340
Yes.

155
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,690
What if he is not alive?

156
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:04,260
If Song Yu Min is dead, what's going to happen?

157
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,900
If he is dead, we will need to figure out why he is dead.

158
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,890
Jae Gyeong.

159
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,000
Are you sure the person on the news is the culprit?

160
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,780
It's under investigation now.

161
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,120
We'll live in peace the sooner you catch him.

162
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,820
I'm so sorry to make you worry.

163
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,380
Why are you so sorry?

164
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,490
I saw that person.

165
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,350
  He might be having an affair.

166
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,190
 - I wondered about that. 
 - An affair?

167
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,020
 Do you know with whom?

168
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,540
 Thank you.

169
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,540
 Thank you.

170
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,400
I thought he seemed suspicious. I should've reported him then, right away.

171
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,440
You will catch him soon, right?

172
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,720
With all of your cooperation, perhaps. Goodbye.

173
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,660
Bye.

174
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,550
- Come home safely.  
 -  I'll be back.

175
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,380
Wait a minute.

176
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,340
Huh?

177
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,860
Your allergy has disappeared.

178
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,690
Oh, that.

179
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,560
I'll be back.

180
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,530
 The allergy is scared, too.

181
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,870
 I knew my wife was a scary woman.

182
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,460
 She killed Song Yu Min

183
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,480
 and disposed of the body without a trace.

184
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,710
 What am I supposed to do with a monster like that?

185
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,900
 Get a grip.  Get a grip.

186
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,880
 Wait a minute.  Five billion. There was five billion.

187
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,030
 You're saying she still has the money.

188
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,950
 I'm going to find the hidden money and escape.

189
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,120
 That's the only way I'll live. Okay.

190
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,290
Hello?

191
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:57,900
President Kim, I'm Ha Eun Hye. The money I asked for...

192
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,080
Hello? Hel ...

193
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,840
- Darling. 
  - Oh, you startled me.

194
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,430
Is something stressing you out?

195
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,330
No.  There's nothing.

196
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,130
It's so terrible. 
  Most Likely Suspect Song Disappears With All The Evidence

197
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,170
It wouldn't harm them that you gave that tip.

198
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:40,170
They wouldn't have burned the five billion, would they?

199
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,930
I wouldn't do that.

200
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,070
Kidnapping?

201
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,820
No. Burning five billion.

202
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,200
 That is a purse she doesn't usually use.  To hold the money?

203
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,460
 No, that couldn't be it.

204
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,800
 Where is she going in disguise?

205
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,900
 Chamgwan Middle School Susaip-gu

206
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,540
-   Please follow the white taxi there. 
 - Yes.

207
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,720
Yun Cheol isn't answering the phone.

208
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,480
Ask him if he is doing well.

209
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,820
Are you doing well?

210
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,830
I'm fine. Call me later.

211
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,470
Would you like some chicken?

212
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,000
You have to sell the chicken. Why do you keep on telling me to take it?

213
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,610
Hang up.  I'm busy.

214
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,730
Hello.

215
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,860
Welcome. Kenyan beans arrived today.

216
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,070
- Is this it? 
 - Yes.

217
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,410
 Coffee beans? What's the hidden intent?

218
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,020
If you don't buy them, you will regret it.

219
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,310
The scent is nice.

220
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,880
 She didn't kill him.

221
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,120
 The two of them are still working together.

222
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,780
Why did you start the fire?

223
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,620
If your fingerprints were found by the police, you could get caught and—

224
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,990
I'm sure I wiped them off.

225
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,250
What are they talking about? I really need to hear this.

226
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,500
Even so, it's better to be careful.

227
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
I didn't want you to be placed in a difficult situation.

228
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,600
Thank you for thinking that.

229
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,040
But you shouldn't do whatever you want without consulting me.

230
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,360
I also will protect you in my own way.

231
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,830
What happened with the painting?

232
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,580
Did you meet the police?

233
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,910
Why did you leave such a painting?

234
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,560
No matter what  happens, I will be responsible.  I did everything by myself.

235
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,140
I left it as evidence.

236
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,730
Yu Min.

237
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,620
Actually,

238
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:15,100
The painting of you... I couldn't bring myself to burn it.

239
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,630
What shall I do with you?

240
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,110
Sunbae, I ...

241
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,690
The stuff.   Please check it.

242
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,950
 It's the money.

243
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,430
 I've gone through so much grief because of that money.

244
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,380
I will rely on you.

245
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,570
What happened to you?

246
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,920
We had a scuffle last night.

247
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,260
I really am going to kill that bastard.

248
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,470
It's okay, Yu Min.

249
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,190
If it weren't for him, both you and I would not have had to go so far.

250
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,360
It was my choice.

251
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,980
It was also mine.

252
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,870
No matter what happens, I will take care of you.

253
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,860
You startled me.

254
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,520
Honey, what are you doing here?

255
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,160
I came out to buy some coffee beans.  How about you?

256
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,400
Me too. I'm going to study. Study coffee beans.

257
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,420
In order to help you, I need to know everything.

258
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,360
I'm on my way back from the wholesaler.

259
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,600
How could this have happened?  It's so glad to see you, Honey!

260
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,110
Yeah.

261
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,340
So ...

262
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,520
I feel like we're on a date. It's been so long.

263
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,330
Wouldn't it be better for you to go home and rest?

264
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,860
Being together with you is relaxing for me.

265
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,450
Honey. Would you give me a coffee lesson?

266
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,560
- A coffee lesson? 
 - Yeah.

267
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,930
That's something you can learn at a cultural center.

268
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,210
Let's go to the restaurant.

269
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,990
How many years are you going to store these?

270
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,380
I can't say.  I won't be opening them for a while.

271
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,420
How old is this?

272
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:43,360
I had that in storage even before the restaurant was opened. In terms of age, maybe about four years old?

273
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,590
I wish I had made one as a souvenir of our wedding.

274
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,690
How would six year Old Crop taste?

275
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,250
It's probably toxic. A poison pill.

276
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,170
But...

277
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,400
do you really want to work here?

278
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,600
- Can't I? 
 - No.

279
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,560
It's not that it's not possible, but ...

280
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,190
Then don't look so tired.

281
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,360
There are lots of eyes watching.

282
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:34,300
You are a precious husband who is again catering to his wife who was kidnapped and returned.

283
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,590
Right now I'm in the middle of an affectionate coffee lesson.

284
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,530
Finished coffee looks the same on the exterior,

285
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,420
but there are many stories in a cup of coffee.

286
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,800
- When you're done, go upstairs. 
 - Yes.

287
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,000
An infinite number of flavors are hidden within the pitch-black world.

288
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,420
Secretly.

289
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,840
It's like marriage.

290
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,960
If you get married again, it looks the same.

291
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:25,460
But the stories inside are all different. Like us.

292
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,830
Why are you here?  At least give some notice that you're there!

293
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,810
Not only are there eyes watching, but there are also ears listening.

294
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,730
There are a lot of noses sniffing.

295
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:48,430
Honey, we should behave really well, shouldn't we?

296
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,120
It's so nice to see you outside.

297
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,820
My husband is kind and wonderful, too. It's quite refreshing.

298
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:07,340
This is why people prefer eating out more than eating at home, right?

299
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,560
 I will bear this until I get my hands on the money.

300
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,580
Is the madam going to be working together with him?

301
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,290
As I expected, Team Leader Jin is out.

302
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,790
As expected. It's undeniable.

303
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,700
- Don't say whatever you want. 
 - It's not what we want, it is what it is.

304
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,790
It seems like the madam isn't coming to work,  she's coming to watch the President.

305
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,730
Keep your nose out of  the President's private business and focus.

306
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,950
Now everyone. You haven't had lunch yet, have you?

307
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,350
Can I make something?

308
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:47,750
I'm just an ordinary housewife and it's nothing special,  but everyone please taste it.

309
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,380
Welcome back Sim Jae Gyeong.

310
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,590
It's no fun if you die easily.

311
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,620
 Old Crop

312
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,760
 Sim Jae Gyeong

313
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,460
It's perilla seed powder.

314
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,300
Put the noodles in.

315
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,120
We will enjoy it.

316
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,710
It's perilla seed powder combined with pasta.

317
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,260
- It's delicious. 
 - Yes.

318
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,470
It's so delicious.

319
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,760
Eat a lot.

320
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,680
Perilla seeds, well, sujebi, is delicious like that.

321
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,500
- It's really delicious. 
 - Isn't it delicious?

322
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,410
I'm so happy. As a housewife, I feel like everyone has acknowledged me.

323
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,040

Come out the back door.

324
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,160
Here.

325
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,380
What's up?  This is dangerous here right now.

326
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,500
There's something else here which is especially dangerous. Do you still not know your wife?

327
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,990
I know. She fabricated the whole scheme.

328
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,250
Darling, are we going to remain victims like this?

329
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,010
She kept the wine laced with adokicin as evidence.

330
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,780
- How did she? 
 - She switched it.

331
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,130
If the police find out, we will both be caught red-handed.

332
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,520
I stayed up all night thinking.

333
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,700
I can't bear being the victim any longer.

334
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,720
If not ...

335
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,660
Shall we return to the past?

336
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,390
Five billion. What do you think about us stealing the five billion?

337
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,910
Do you know where it is?

338
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,650
Her hoobae from art school.  The bastard is an accomplice.

339
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,040
The one who has gone missing?

340
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,770
He's crazy about my wife.

341
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,880
I confirmed he has it.

342
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,430
You have returned, Kim Yun Cheol.

343
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,240
 Staff Only

344
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,790
 Do you know the name of this ointment?

345
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,390
 Querencia.

346
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,980
 Bulls in a bullfight, before getting into the ring,

347
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,750
 the area where they stay to catch their breath is called "querencia."

348
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,960
 So please breathe as you live.

349
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,530
 Lidomaes? (she made up the name  "querencia")

350
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,050
Thanks to you, I can breathe a little easier.

351
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,680
Let us both breathe freely.

352
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,540
We'll steal the five billion won and get revenge on your wife.

353
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,440
But I was chasing that guy and lost him. I have to find out where he is.

354
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,330
I have some ideas.

355
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,170
You do?

356
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,950
 Sim Jae Gyeong

357
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,650
 Jin Seon Mi

358
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,980
- Coffee is done. 
 - Okay.

359
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,790
- Here is the coffee. 
 - Thank you.

360
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,160
  - Thank you. 
 - Please enjoy.

361
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,250
 Execution of operations complete. Things will turn out well, as we planned.

362
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,120
 Delete this message immediately.

363
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,800
How is it?

364
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,540
This tastes like... marriage?

365
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,290
It's delicious.

366
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,890
Wow.

367
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:19,090
He left behind the thing that he should have burned first?

368
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,130
He couldn't burn it, or he didn't burn it? 
  Exhibit 14: Portrait of Sim Jae Gyeong

369
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,370
I think we can interpret this to mean that he wanted to protect this, or he wanted to leave this for us, for a reason.

370
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,290
So why?

371
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,610
The items shown in his pictures are items that are in the victim's home.

372
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,470
So did these two people have a romantic relationship?

373
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:39,580
He could have drawn them from the photos that were on Sim Jae Gyeong's SNS.

374
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,070
So it's an intense obsession, huh?

375
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,590
Obsession does not always lead to crime.

376
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,570
There must be another, more conclusive motive.

377
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,310
This is the drone that was found at the fire site.

378
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:54,240
The model matches the eye witness statement, and we've also confirmed the purchase records of used drones.

379
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,490
After analyzing Sim Jae Gyeong's abduction video and a few of the household items we found at the fire site,

380
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:03,130
there is a high possibility that the items are the same ones found in the video.

381
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,490
What that means is that there is a high possibility that  Song Yu Min's studio was

382
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,050
the place where Sim Jae Gyeong was tied up and kept.

383
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,330
So you're saying that Song Yu Min burned the evidence and ran away?

384
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,000
The accomplice could be trying to frame Song Yu Min.

385
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,950
So does this accomplice really exist?

386
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,530
Or maybe he just exists in your mind, Officer Seo?

387
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,180
This accomplice will reveal him or herself soon.

388
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,800
So we just have to catch Song Yu Min and ask him, don't we?

389
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,810
Okay, so we will get an arrest warrant and change this into an open criminal investigation.

390
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,980
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

391
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,090
 Regarding the abduction of Ms. Sim in Buyeong-dong, the most likely suspect

392
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:42,650
 Song Yu Min, the victim's classmate in art college has been put on the urgently wanted list.

393
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,520
 The police are currently searching for all traces of Song Yu Min.

394
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,540
 As he does not have any previous criminal record, it is assumed that he had another motive besides money.

395
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,970
 Ms. Sim, the victim—

396
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,450
Thank you.

397
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,460
I am an artist, too, so I understand how this person feels.

398
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:25,260
You can draw something over and over again, yet you still keep wanting to. That feeling, you know?

399
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,460
Of course, can there be a limit to what the heart wants?

400
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,710
But I wonder why he had to go so far and abduct her?

401
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,200
I don't really know, but...

402
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,740
 If You Ask Me Why I Love

403
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,670
 "The Hall of Love"

404
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:44,120
... perhaps this was how he felt?

405
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,860
The Hall of Love.

406
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,730
Kim Seung Hui.

407
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,900
 "To love is a tremendously imposing thing.

408
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:01,480
 "What you see below you is the edge of a cliff.

409
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,030
 "You've come to the edge.

410
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,820
 "One more step off the edge,

411
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,590
 trying to step forward... you fall."

412
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:20,040
If Kim Yun Cheol and Sim Jae Gyeong's alibis for last night are true, then only two things can be true.

413
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,160
Song Yu Min set the fire himself

414
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,350
or his accomplice tried to kill him.

415
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,260
 Unknown accomplice / Seen on baseball field CCTV

416
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,570
 Sim Jae Gyeong (Age 37)

417
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,030
- No way.
 - Yes, this hypothesis is pretty out there.

418
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,790
We have to approach it with caution.

419
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:44,510
So you think that there is something going on between Sim Jae Gyeong and Song Yu Min.

420
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,530
One-hundred percent.

421
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,500
 Kim Yun Cheol (Age 39) – married – Sim Jae Gyeong (Age 37)

422
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,680
This is far beyond the scale of a common housewife.

423
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,310
Don't underestimate housewives.

424
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,710
So your wife could do something like this?

425
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,690
Say something that makes sense.

426
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,720
See? But she doesn't call you lately.

427
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,930
Is she angry? Try calling her.

428
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,690
Don't.

429
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,560
Seonbae.
  Twins' Mom

430
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,630
Hey, you!

431
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,070
This guy...

432
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,920
 Twins' Dad

433
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,060
Seems like she's not answering your call on purpose. It means her counteroffensive has begun.

434
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,960
Why would she? I haven't done anything wrong.

435
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,380
Maybe she's just putting up a defense?

436
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,190
What do you mean? Like this?

437
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,420
The game is over for today. Please leave.

438
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,990
Among the authors I like, there is one called Haruki (Haruki Murakami).

439
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:10,000
One day, after seeing a home run at a baseball field,

440
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,630
he suddenly realized that he could write a novel.

441
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,890
I feel like I've just seen someone hit a home run, too.

442
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,260
They'll close the doors soon.

445
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,100
- We'll be going home now. 
 - Good job, you've worked hard.

446
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,400
- You've worked hard.
 - You've worked hard.

447
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,990
Perhaps you should go home first?

448
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,240
But I wanted to go home with you.

449
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,290
Sorry, I just have some remaining work.

450
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,490
You must be stressed out. So much tension in your shoulders.

451
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,510
Financial pressure must be huge.

452
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:21,580
I think I could find a solution for you.

453
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,390
A solution? What solution?

454
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:37,650
The truth is, I have something to confess to you.

455
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,020
I know where the five billion won is.

456
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,190
What do you mean?

457
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:53,070
The truth is, I'm being threatened right now.

458
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,470
 I'll give you the money that your husband needs.

459
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,080
 Just come to me and be with me.

460
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,440
 You already know that cannot be.

461
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,600
 I can't let you return to him, Seonbae.

462
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,550
 And I never had any plans to keep this money.

463
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:11,410
 If I have to choose between the two, of course, I choose you.

464
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,580
I'm sorry for lying to you.

465
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,190
It was because I thought you would worry, Honey.

466
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,120
No, I'm sorry to you.

467
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,120
He didn't say anything else? I must report this to the police—

468
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,670
No, you can't.

469
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,680
If we report it, that doesn't assure us that we will get the money back.

470
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,330
So do you have any other way?

471
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,260
I might.

472
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,250
If you would only trust me.

473
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:55,490
If you trust me and wait for me, I can try to persuade him.

474
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,320
Persuade him? How?

475
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,000
To return everything back to the way it was

476
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,520
as if that incident never happened.

477
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,590
But it happened so vividly, how can we pretend it didn't?

478
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,330
We can make it so

479
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:20,870
if we work together. You won't be late coming home today, will you?

480
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,340
I cannot wait too long.

481
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,860
You're not scared of me, are you?

482
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,870
You better shave. It feels prickly.

483
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,370
Hello.

484
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,330
So you've come here to work again today.

485
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,050
Yes.

486
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,400
I was about to go home now.

487
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,060
Yes.

488
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,540
What is it now?

489
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:55,330
How about letting me escort you home safely, Madam?

490
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,330
What kind of hoobae was Song Yu Min?

491
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,510
Yu Min, all he knew was art.

492
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,210
How did you meet him again recently?

493
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,210
By chance.

494
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,310
By chance...

495
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,300
But it doesn't seem like chance on both sides.

496
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,770
Did Song Yu Min give you any difficulties or demand anything from you?

497
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,780
No.

498
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,920
Did you model for his artwork at any time recently?

499
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:35,710
How many times do you plan on asking the same question?

500
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,760
I'm sorry if you found that unpleasant.

501
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,810
Please look.

502
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:53,750
Based on expert's opinions, that painting was completed after many years,

503
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:57,370
and it was painted over many times before it was completed.

504
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:15,580
And it's possible that it is not yet complete.

505
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,360
Detective.

506
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,170
Detective, do you trust your wife?

507
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,330
I'm sorry that my question was not precise.

508
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,850
I meant, is your wife a trustworthy person?

509
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,480
Yes.

510
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:05,050
Where does your certainty come from?

511
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,430
Because that's what I want to believe. So I just believe in her.

512
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:18,310
Indeed, marriage is quite a tremendous thing, don't you think?

513
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,800
- Hello.
 - Hey.

514
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,100
Are the materials for the baseball field CCTV ready?

515
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,420
Did you get a photo of her back?

516
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,540
Hidden cameras are a crime.

517
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,710
We don't have any images of the trashcan from where they pulled out the bag of money.

518
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,430
So it's just someone passing by?

519
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,970
To her sons exercising in the heat

520
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:09,320
a mother bringing them cool drinks?

521
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:15,650
So there is money in there? Or beverages?

522
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,810
Look into everyone who was sitting in the bleachers.

523
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:26,510
What about your wife? Has she said anything in particular?

524
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,380
Why are you asking about my wife?

525
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,080
She was there, with the twins.

526
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,360
Do you two live apart or something?

527
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,270
Wait!

528
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,600
- Let's do this one! 
 - No, we have this!

529
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,430
Boys, it's time for bed.

530
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:56,170
- Didn't I tell you to clean up your toys?
 - We don't want to.

531
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,850
Oh, I will really punish you.

532
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,970
Chan! San!

533
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,960
- Dad!
 - Dad!

534
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,730
Have you been well?

535
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,050
Dad, is this food?

536
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,280
- Do you want to eat this?
 - Ugh, it's laundry again.

537
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,640
Why would you eat laundry?

538
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,950
Really? Why eat laundry?

539
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,430
I told you, I'll just have leftovers.

540
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,020
But you didn't say you don't want it.

541
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,000
Because I will eat it.

542
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,660
What is with you today, coming home so early?

543
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,460
Why? Aren't you happy to see me?

544
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,110
- I want some, too.
 - I want some, too.

545
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,690
Hey, don't use your hands. Didn't you eat dinner?

546
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,180
- Of course we did.
 - Of course we did.

547
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,250
- Chan, San.
 - What?

548
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,010
The day you guys went to the baseball field,

549
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:44,750
did you see an ahjumma treating the kids to ice cream?

550
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,110
Did you eat ice cream without me?

551
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,330
Did you?

552
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,540
Never mind, go. Go play.

553
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,310
That day, I heard you were there.

554
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:00,640
Well, their father should have been there, not their mother.

555
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,990
Well, um...

556
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:07,810
That day, did you see some woman pulling a cooler with her?

557
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:19,420
 Is your wife a trustworthy person?

558
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:25,030
 Even so, don't trust your wife too much.

559
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,190
 What you see isn't all there is.

560
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:31,540
I sure hope what I see isn't all there is.

561
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,780
But I think what I see is all there is, after all.

562
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,160
Oh, that startled me.
  Noona

563
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,710
You startled me.

564
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:02,200
Why? Did you do something wrong again?

565
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,640
What do you mean? Do I really do so many wrong things?

566
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,530
Noona, why do you always take Jae Gyeong's side? Are you really my sister?

567
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,880
Why would I take anyone's side? I just hope you two get along and live happily.

568
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,670
Don't become like me.

569
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,640
Looks like you're not home yet?

570
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,710
Hurry and go home early.

571
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,630
She probably still gets scared when she's alone.

572
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:23,450
I'm more scared, okay? Me!

573
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,820
Hanging up.

574
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,420
Hey.

575
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,350
What's with him?

576
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,200
Really...

577
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,360
Give me a signal, please.

578
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,670
But weren't you waiting for me?

579
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,570
Should I get out of your car or not?

580
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,620
 Should I get out of your car or not?

581
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,500
 Huh?

582
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,660
 You always leave work at a fixed time.

583
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:03,890
 The person going home and the person waiting at home, no sense of expectation at all for both of you, is there?

584
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,670
 You two as a married couple,

585
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:11,370
 you guys are so boringly perfect. So much that it's even suffocating for those around you.

586
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,020
 That is my choice.

587
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,820
 Sure, make your choice.

588
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:24,290
 So should I get out of your car or not?

589
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,680
We could have gotten along well if only that woman had gone along with our plans.

590
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,400
It's a relief that we both are even alive right now.

591
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,650
So you're scared of that woman, huh?

592
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,430
Of course, I am. How could I not be?

593
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,030
Scary? No, she's contemptible.

594
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,860
She has the five billion won, but she played around with you instead of helping you.

595
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,240
It's not as if we did anything right, though.

596
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,170
But our situation is different.

597
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:52,790
You are deeply atoning for what you did, and you almost died, too.

598
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:56,040
But we almost killed her.

599
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,350
If it wasn't for that money, things would not have become this twisted.

600
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,780
Why? Are you not confident, again?

601
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,820
What are you doing? Give that to me.

602
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,070
You stay out of it. I'm going head-to-head with your wife for one round.

603
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:13,180
Why are you acting like this, too? Really.

604
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,870
 call won't connect

605
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:21,680
The call won't connect anyway. I told you, I took measures.

606
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,120
Who will be most frustrated when the calls won't go through?

607
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,120
Since he can't call her, Song Yu Min is likely to freak out.

608
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:48,160
So he will hang around your wife trying to meet her in person.

609
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,960
You two women, you are both quite something.

610
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,150
If you betray me, I will kill you.

611
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,220
Betray? I may die before I do that.

612
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,870
Our opponent is quite formidable.

613
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,560
What? Do you have an interest in your wife that you didn't before?

614
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,650
Yes, I thought I'd take an interest so that I can live.

615
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:10,960
I must know my enemy so I can figure out how to survive.

616
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,310
Don't forget that I am on your side, Honey.

617
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,850
He took the bait.

618
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:28,580
Bait?

619
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:08,970
So, what we were talking about...

620
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,430
Now this, suddenly?

621
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,900
He's listening.

622
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,220
 Seonbae Jae Gyeong

623
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:53,190
 Seonbae Jae Gyeong

624
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,550
I reinstalled the voice surveillance equipment.

625
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,660
I told you

626
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,170
that I won't stand for just being victimized.

627
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,620
She'll hear this and get a bit angry, no?

628
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,210
 Seonbae Jae Gyeong

629
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,130
Where are you right now, Honey?

630
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:48,490
Where do you mean? The restaurant, of course.

631
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:53,740
You don't know what this phone number is?

632
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,790
Oh, you're calling me from the restaurant.

633
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:01,180
I came here because I thought I left my cell phone at the restaurant.

634
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,770
But you're not here.

635
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:08,850
Oh, I see. I had just left.

636
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,600
Do you want to come and take me home?

637
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,760
Yes, I'll be right there.

638
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:23,520
I'm leaving.

639
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,970
Should I return this to her myself?

640
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,360
 We can't return it to her until we know where Song Yu Min is.

641
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:40,640
What a great plan. It's like you're training a dog.

642
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,630
You didn't find your phone?

643
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:11,360
I think I lost it at home. I'll go home and look for it.

644
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:58,220
How nice to return home with you like this.

645
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,730
I know, right?

646
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,830
Why is this open? Do I need to get a new car?

647
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,080
What is this? What?

648
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:19,940

649
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,760
♫  I'm gonna return my side  ♫

650
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,420
♫  in the end, return my side  ♫

651
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:32,160
♫  in the end, return my side  ♫

652
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:36,900
♫  you’re locked inside my heart now, orange-colored moonlight  ♫

653
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,220
♫  in the end, return my side  ♫

654
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:41,900
 My Dangerous Wife
 Preview

655
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,370
 I will go until the end. This is just the beginning.

656
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:47,890
 I swear to N31.

657
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:51,430
 You've never met the artist while preparing for this exhibition?

658
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:55,050
 I told you, you shouldn't like me!

659
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,860
 I will protect you, Seonbae, no matter what.

660
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:59,500
 Don't worry. Things will go the way we planned.

661
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,100
 Don't stay there and go back. That crazy guy has a knife.

662
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,490
 Will you die?

663
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:06,540
 Can you die for me?

664
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,140
 You are a monster. I cannot live with a monster.

665
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,620
♫  setting fire to your heart  ♫

666
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,720
♫  no one will know how my heart has changed  ♫

667
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,630
♫  I might be going crazy  ♫
