1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,900

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,120
 Married Woman Abducted, Demands 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,160
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,610
Seonbae-nim, take a look at this.

5
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,390
When I was searching for documentation relevant to the bankruptcy, I found this.

6
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,040
Shoes
 wife, husband. 
cutting down...

7
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,980
- What is this? 
 - It's a web novel.

8
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,260
The serial started right after the Sim Jae Gyeong kidnapping.

9
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,470
It seemed like the kidnapping was the motif of the story. The title is "The Wife."

10
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,110
"She stared intently at her own feet that were thick with white calluses."

11
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,620
"If she could wear those shoes, never mind the calluses,

12
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,510
she would even trim her own feet to fit into them."

13
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:31,160
The keywords are the same. Wine, poison, adultery, even the death of an accomplice.

14
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,520
What?

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,610
 The Last Supper.

16
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,260
There's a new upload just today.

17
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,270
 It was not a matter of life of death, but whether to kill or allow to live. That was the question.

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,390
 We decided to invite a special guest to our last supper. I could never have

19
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,160
foreseen that she'd eat from the poisoned  gambas .

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,220
- Wow. I don't think you need to concern yourself too much with this. 
 - Why?

21
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,730
The plot development is too absurd.

22
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,010
The mistress died and the married couple are the co-killers.

23
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,200
- When did it get posted. 
 - It's newly released.

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,630
Uh, two hours ago.

25
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,930
It's fishy. A stench.

26
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,120
A dangerous stench.

27
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,110
 Yun Cheol... Kim Yun Cheol...

28
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,250
 Kim Yun Cheol!

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,160
Yun Cheol. Kim Yun Cheol?

30
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,110
Kim Yun Cheol!

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,180
Kim Yun Cheol.

32
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,980
Has something happened?

33
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,650
No, I'm just not feeling well right now.

34
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,320
Where is Jin Seon Mi?

35
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,610
We had a question for her, but we couldn't contact her.

36
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,080
 Episode 14: Guilty of Marriage

37
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,770
Why did Jin Seon Mi suddenly go to visit her parents?

38
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,860
She said she wanted a few days off to take a break.

39
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,620
She's not resting forever, by any chance?

40
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,290
Of course, she may have felt a bit awkward continuing to work here.

41
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,250
So when is Jin Seon Mi returning to work?

42
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,820
She deserved so much better.

43
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,510
She put herself through college and worked part-time,

44
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,300
and even graduated at the top of her class.

45
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,450
If it were not for me, she could have become a very successful researcher,

46
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,240
and met a nice man

47
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,960
and lived an ordinary happy life.

48
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,150
She could have lived a good life.

49
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,460
But because of me...

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,460
she died.

51
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,650
She ended up dying.

52
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,820
No, I mean, I killed her.

53
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,190
I... Seon Mi...

54
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,130
Seon Mi...

55
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,140
I killed her.

56
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,150
Kim Yun Cheol?

57
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,810
What is going on?

58
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,900
He says he will tell us the details at the station.

59
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,360
What happened?

60
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,080
Did you get the five billion won back? Good job.

61
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,840
Oh, have it delivered to me by courrier.

62
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,810
It's alright. That could be safer.

63
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,690
If I request it by courier, it should arrive in about 30 minutes.

64
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,600
Don't worry. I will make sure to receive it well.

65
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,270
 My Husband

66
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,520
- Fill it quickly. 
 - Yes.

67
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,670
Let me use the restroom.

68
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,220
Where are you going?

69
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,880
Kim Yun Cheol? What?

70
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,000
Sorry.

71
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,130
Hey, hey!

72
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,040
Ah, this guy, really...

73
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,160
Did Jo Min Gyu come to work today?

74
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,690
He did come to work today. One moment, please.

75
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,120
Kevin? Someone came here to see you.

76
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,430
We are the police. Can we ask you a few questions, Jo Min Gyu?

77
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,380
So on the morning that Song Yu Min died,

78
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,440
you were with Ha Eun Hye?

79
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,160
Yes.

80
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,050
- Are you sure?
 - That is when we wake up in the morning after a night of sleep.

81
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,200
Isn't it natural for a married couple to be together during those hours?

82
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,060
We already know that you are not really married to her.

83
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,670
You two sleep in separate rooms, so how would you know what she does? Isn't that true?

84
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,200
Even real married couples use separate rooms, you know.

85
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,610
You know that is not what I mean.

86
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,430
She and I take a walk together every morning.

87
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,260
And that morning was not different.

88
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,630
I guess it isn't?

89
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,800
Hello. Should I put it here?

90
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,460
Yes, please put it down here.

91
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,340
Thank you.

92
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,970
Gosh!

93
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,400
You're going to receive it for me?

94
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,190
Thank you so much.  You must have thought that I wasn't home.

95
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, no.  You were home?

96
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,600
Yes.

97
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,290
Are you waiting for a package?

98
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,460
 If I request express delivery, it should arrive in about 30 minutes.

99
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,980
 Don't worry.  I'll receive it.

100
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,820
 Yes, I would like to request delivery in 30 minutes.

101
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,520
 Yes.

102
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,850
No, I was just taking a walk.

103
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,210
Young people these days,

104
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,770
seem like they're suffering a lot because of delivery work.

105
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,350
So I wanted to be of some help.

106
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,030
As expected, your thoughts are deep.

107
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,620
That makes me self-reflect.

108
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,200
I should decrease ordering deliveries and go out myself, but I ran out of tissues.

109
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,820
I felt impatient.

110
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,800
I don't know about anything else, but I feel so anxious when I run out of tissues.

111
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,820
It makes me feel rich when I stock up on tissues.

112
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,520
I think I bought too much.  Would you like some?

113
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,350
No, I'm fine.

114
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,680
Take it.  Let's share it.

115
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,340
Th-Thank you.

116
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,390
Ugh, really.

117
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,030
Hello?

118
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,400
 This is Detective Seon Ji Tae.

119
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,640
Yes, Detective.  Hello.

120
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,150
By chance, do you know where your husband is?

121
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,910
He went to work this morning.

122
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,350
But why are you asking?

123
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,210
Kim Yun Cheol said that he had something to tell me, and then suddenly disappeared.

124
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,220
I'll try to contact my husband also.

125
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,150
As usual, there is a lot that the two of you don't know about each other.

126
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,390
 Yes, I understand.

127
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,160
 Husband

128
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,990
Wait, go back more.

129
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,840
Rewind it.

130
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,370
Go back.  Stop, stop.

131
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,450
Trace the car.

132
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,990
- Trace the car. 
- Yes.

133
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,010
542Ru

134
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,060
542Ru 0328

135
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,870
 Seoul
 Black

136
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,350
Sunbae, this looks like an untraceable car.

137
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,270
What do mean by saying that you know about Seon Mi's death?

138
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,150
 30 minutes earlier

139
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,600
 I know about Jin Seon Mi's death.

140
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,180
 - I know about Jin Seon Mi's death. 
- The black car straight ahead with emergency lights.

141
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,580
 The black car straight ahead.

142
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,160
 Emergency lights.

143
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,160
 We guarantee unadulterated and correct amount.

144
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,610
 I need to go to the bathroom.

145
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,520
 Oh, sure.

146
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,980
 Where are you going?

147
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,800
Where are we going?

148
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,990
It was you, wasn't it? Putting that threatening note in our mailbox this morning?

149
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,760
Ultimately, you were also after money.

150
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,560
My wife's money.  I got into the car by mistake.

151
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,770
Stop the car now!

152
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,690
Aren't you curious?

153
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,920
What did my wife and mistress have to do with each other?

154
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,780
If that's what this is about, I already know all about it.

155
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,090
You must not have suffered enough.

156
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,390
You still believe only what you see and hear.

157
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,390
 You'll invite me?

158
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,100
 Why me?

159
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,270
 Would it be very strange if I said that I wanted the three of us to have one last supper together?

160
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:57,600
 The shrimp gambas will be the only food in which I do not sprinkle the poisoned salt.

161
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,960
 Make sure to avoid everything else. But dipping the bread in the shrimp gambas sauce will be okay.

162
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,180
The shrimp.

163
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,450
Gambas.

164
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,490
 Since the body won't be found, Jin Seon Mi will fade into the darkness.

165
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,430
On purpose.  She fed it to her on purpose.

166
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,930
She killed her like that on purpose?

167
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,790
To Seon Mi?

168
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,180
 Old Crop

169
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,730
Kim Yun Cheol didn't call or come here.

170
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,830
What about Jin Seon Mi?

171
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,660
Her phone is turned off.

172
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,170
She hasn't gone to her family's home either.

173
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,460
Do you think something happened?

174
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,840
No way.

175
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,050
Kim Yun Cheol, this guy, really...

176
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,460
Is he training us like we are dogs?

177
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,730
Get in the car quickly!

178
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,620
 Wait a minute.

179
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,030
 This goes in the regular trash, right?

180
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,410
 Honey, how can you act so normal?

181
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,750
 I'm scared, but it can't be helped, can it?

182
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,590
Are you really sad?

183
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,090
Would you be that sad if I said that your wife was buried here?

184
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,520
It doesn't seem like the right situation for you to say that.

185
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,110
And what right do you have to say that?

186
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,920
It sounds to me like you're saying that you have the right.

187
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,820
Sometimes, more so than strangers,

188
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,250
family doesn't have the right.

189
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,690
What's your real reason for bringing me here?

190
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,010
I thought it was about time for you to become curious.

191
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,880
What should I be curious about?

192
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,700
So you still don't know why your wife had to go this far?

193
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,950
It's unfortunate.

194
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,720
 To be honest, we both

195
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,260
no longer need that man Kim Yun Cheol

196
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,430
do we?

197
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,600
♫   I see and trust only you  ♫

198
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,060
  With desperate efforts etched like tattoos, for a man who obviously had nothing.

♫  A dream like time  ♫

200
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,720
 If I wanted to shine, is that too emotional?

204
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,450
You didn't recycle properly.

205

Didn't you grab me so nothing gets reported? 
 ♫   The pledge to be together for life  ♫

206
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,250
I thought you'd need evidence.

207

210
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,740
I think this is a turn of events even my wife doesn't know about.

211
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,600
The only who can stop Sim Jae Gyeong is you.

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,700
 The phone is currently turned off and you will be transferred to voicemail.

215
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,440
 Please record your message after the beep.

221
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,300
Hello?

222
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,350
Did you find something out? You called earlier.

223
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,170
No, it's nothing.

224
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,100
Don't worry and keep watch.

225
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,810
Okay.

226
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,350
- Don't drink alcohol and focus.
 - Okay.

227
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,580
Yeah.

228
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,700
I can't contact my husband.

229
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,430
They say that he disappeared on his way to the police station.

230
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,080
You're confusing to me sometimes, and this is one of those times.

231
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,920
Are you worried about your husband or your plans being ruined?

232
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,600
Which alternative do you think it is?

233
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,760
I think that your husband going to the police was a part of your plan.

234
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,240
There is always a hole in plans.

235
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,940
There was a hole in our relationship too.

236
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,390
The police are keeping an eye on me.

237
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,460
They're going to find this place soon too.

238
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,130
For causing you an inconvenience,

239
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,650
I am sorry.

240
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,230
It's something that I chose.

241
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,990
Nobody knew that Yoo Min would die.

242
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,810
I killed him.

243
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,690
No!

244
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,190
What are you saying?

245
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,110
It was an accident.

246
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,700
No. It was on purpose.

247
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,140
No matter how many times you ask, my answer is the same.

248
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,630
I would have asked him to die,

249
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,870
before I killed him.

250

00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,050
Hello?

267
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,980
I don't think anyone is here.

268
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,370
Should we give him a call?

269
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,980
Oh, you were inside.

270
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,160
Why was the door locked?

271
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,070
I was getting ready to open.

272
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,750
We're going to take a look inside.

273
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,630
Who are you again?

274
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,360
We're from the Jungam Police Station.

275
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,880
I think my part-time worker yesterday was tired.

276
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,930
I see, we're going to take a look inside.

277
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,270
We're going to open soon,

278
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:56,490
if you have something to say, please say it quickly.

279
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,630
You know why we're here, right?

280
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,830
We were investigating Sim Jae Gyeong and found something odd.

281
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,390
There was an attempted kidnapping in high school.

282
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,020
A suspect during that time

283
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,290
was the tutor.

284
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,850
It wasn't enough that I got fired from my tutoring jobs because of that.

285
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,580
I was also expelled from the law degree program I was pursuing.

286
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:39,230
Even if it is already over twenty years, I didn't expect that I'd continue to be misunderstood.

287
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,010
You're cooperating for the first time, Lee Jin Su.

288
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,920
This is a picture of your wife that passed away seven years ago, right?

289
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,500
She passed away two days after collapsing.

290
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,570
Did you have wine with your wife as well?

291
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,960
In the care center that your wife was admitted to,

292
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,930
alcohol is part of the prohibited goods list.

293
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,280
Did your wife know Sim Jae Gyeong?

294
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,840
Do I have to answer that? If you're done with what you needed to do, please leave.

295
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,140
I'm hoping that what I'm thinking right now

296
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,130
is just a misunderstanding I'm having.

297
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,940
Thank you for your cooperation.

298
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,940
Did you see that he lit incense as soon as went in?

299
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,110
Yeah. It smelled nice.

300
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:26,130
No, it's not that. He covered up a different fragrance by lighting that up.

301
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,220
There was definitely someone else just here.

302
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,920
"Asking Why One Loves."

303
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,930
  Years Ago

304
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,050

306

♫   I am locked in eternal longing ♫

307
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:46,110
 Even if one's face is rotting away inside,

308
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:51,290
 loving is something magnificent like a sweet potato

309
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,400
 with violet flowers and green vines.

310
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:03,600
♫   I'm losing my light and am left along  ♫

311

  ♫ Your heart   ♫

313
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,570
 What I see below is most certainly an abyss.

314
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,570
 I know it is the edge of a cliff.

315
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,620
 Although it is the edge,

316
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,330
 I have the heart to move another step.

317
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,790
  ♫ No one can completely   ♫

318
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:43,630
One more step towards the cliff. 
♫  forget how to love   ♫

319
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,920
 The drop. The altar of love. 
   ♫  I am going to break down  ♫

320
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,720
 Until death do us part, forever.

 Seoul Jungam Police Station

"The conclusive moment was when I saw the small pearl hanging from the shoe,"

334
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,420
"I felt a shock."

"If I can only wear those shoes,

336
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:59,600
she thought that she would shave off the calluses on her feet and even her flesh if need be."

337
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,420
 Oh.  You scared me. What are you doing there, looking all scary?

338
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,210
 Are you recharging your own sense of romance through web novels?

339
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,630
 I'm recharging my fighting spirit with a married couple thriller.

340
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,150
 You're home?

341
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,910
 What will you write before you give up again?

342
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,770
 I am going to finish this one.

343
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,580
 Genre?

344
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,530
 A married couple's thriller.

345
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,890
 Married Couple's thriller ... Content?

346
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,550
 A wife is abducted.

347
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:45,110
 But it turns out, she planned all of it herself.

348
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,750
"I don't know how long it's been

349
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,300
since I was able to think of my husband's face without anger or blame."

350
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:04,800
"We decided to invite a special guest for the last supper prepared by us as a couple."

351
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,310
"She understood that the last supper before our divorce

352
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,880
was to be a stage set for my wife to kill me."

353
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,300
"The woman couldn't even imagine that

354
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,780
 she  would be the one eating the poisoned gambas."

355
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,100
It's totally the same, right?

356
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,920
Unless it's written by her herself, this is impossible.

357
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,610
Did you find out who the author is?

358
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:32,520
I talked to them but they themselves don't know the identity of the author.

359
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,310
All they know is that the nickname is 'Pas Tree',

360
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,130
and they don't know her face, name, or even her gender.

361
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,360
What if Jin Seon Mi really died like in the novel?

362
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,310
Hey, a novel is just a novel.

363
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,380
I don't know if the novel copied what happened in reality, or

364
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,300
if reality copied what's in the novel.

365
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,920
Look at it. This was posted last night. 
  jkyung37 Tonight's special dish ...

366
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,980
"She ate gambas and died."

367
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,770
It is gambas.

368
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,600
 She would be the one eating the poisoned gambas.

369
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,730
What in the world is going on...

370
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,280
What if it's true that Kim Yun Cheol tried to turn himself in?

371
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,660
What if he ran in the middle of coming here because he got scared?

372
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,460
Let's find out where Jin Seon Mi is first.

373
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,890
Kim Yun Cheol.

374
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,470
What happened?

375
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,930
Jin Seon Mi.... ate a poisoned dish...

376
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,340
and died.

377
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,140
So this time, it was Adokicin again?

378
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,470
What is this? For real?

379
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,510
Yes. My wife and I...

380
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,080
My wife and I killed Jin Seon Mi.

381
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,470
It wasn't enough that my wife killed Song Yu Min.

382
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:00,760
She killed Seon Mi because of me.

383
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,590
Right now, she's in that cold ground...

384
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,260
We can't continue to have any more tragedies.

385
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,060
Oh geez!

386
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,130
Both of these are your wife's?

387
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,030
Yes, and that's something that I threw out.

388
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,900
And my wife probably threw this out.

389
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,120
Are you sure this is your wife's heels?

390
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,650
Yes ... I am pretty positive.

391
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,100
You don't seem to have any interest in your wife

392
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,960
These are not her shoe size.

393
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,420
When I checked your shoe cabinet last time, I saw what shoe sizes there were.

394
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,050
What?

395
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,660
Then, this ... whose ...

396
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,680
These seem to belong to the real culprit who murdered Mr. Song.

397
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,400
Why is this... then together ...

398
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,900
There's a saying like this, "The suspect is nearby."

399
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,110
The owner of these heels is most likely a neighbor of yours.

400
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,020
Does your wife, by any chance, write a web novel?

401
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,800
What?

402
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,050
 The Last Supper

403
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,260
It seems you still have a lot of things you don't know about your wife.

404
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,550
I made a chiffon cake.

405
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,450
I'm home alone right now, do you want to come over and eat it with me?

406
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,480
Hurry up and pick up.

407
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,090
Why aren't you picking up?

408
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,050
 Mrs. Wife

409
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,660
 Old Crop Parking Lot

410
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,380
Hey, honey,

411
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,280
we have a big problem.

412
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,460
Uh, um ...

413
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,900
I think we've been caught wiretapping them.

414
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,390
I bought a chiffon cake.

415
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,080
Can you give me some tea?

416
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,950
 Wife: Voice Recording File

417
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,990
 Honey, we have a big problem.

418
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,810
 I think we've been caught wiretapping them.

419
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,850
 Mr. Husband

420
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,920
My husband's taste in music is luxurious, right?

421
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,550
Yeah. He seems to be a man that people would like.

422
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:09,720
You made this cake completely from scratch?

423
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,680
Yeah. I'm not sure if it will be delicious though.

424
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,640
Excuse me for a moment.

425
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,030
Yes, Chef.

426
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:29,460
The CEO hasn't come back yet since he left for the police station.

427
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,760
Is that so?

428
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,760
Since you're not asking what it's about, it seems you know something.

429
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,410
We are a married couple.

430
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:45,220
Then the two of you should take care of things between yourselves instead of putting others in a pickle.

431
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,200
Thank you for your advice.

432
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,740
Today you can close the restaurant early.

433
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,250
Mission failure.

434
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,360
Show yourself.

435
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,250
Is this the end?

436
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,690
Did something happen?

437
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,920
Unni Eun Hye. Can I call you Unni?

438
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,970
I've always wanted to call you that,

439
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:16,830
but I didn't have a chance. I think today is the day.

440
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:23,740
Unni, what do you think this is?

441
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,100
What is this? Huh?
  Get 5 billion won ready. I know that you killed Jin Seon Mi. -N31-

442
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,350
Read this.

443
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,690
Is this your idea, Unni?

444
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,530
Or is it your younger husband's idea?

445
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,200
Have you been wiretapping since last night?

446
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,370
Who put in the wiretap?

447
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,480
Wait, hold on. When did you even come and place it?

448
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,520
We're not even close neighbors.

449
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,030
What are you talking about?

450
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,320
The truth is,

451
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,750
I asked Jin Seon Mi to act like she died in front of my husband.

452
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,220
She's alive.

453
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,100
Nothing happened!

454
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,560
This is mind boggling!

455
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:36,730
We didn't do this!

456
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,750
 Five Hours before Gambas

457
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,420
You're...

458
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,450
I was recycling some garbage.

459
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,630
There was so much garbage in front of the house.

460
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,330
By the way, you edited this to manipulate it to your liking

461
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:09,320
to make it seem like the owner of this voice killed you.

462
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,960
What is it that you want to say?

463
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,170
I don't like it when things go sour in a deal.

464
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,630
A deal can only happen between people who trust each other.

465
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,800
I didn't want to trust that woman.

466
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,510
I couldn't let things happen the way she wanted.

467
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,540
You weren't curious about the truth behind that married couple?

468
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,290
Why are you doing this?

469
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,400
I told you,

470
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,470
I don't like it when things go sour in a deal.

471
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,930
You know that feeling.

472
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:48,020
When someone else is touching the prey that I called dibs on.

473
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,420
Jin Seon Mi?

474
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,470
Detective, you called me several times.

475
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,840
Why did you call me?

476
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,410
What's wrong with you?

477
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,400
Oh my gosh, who are you?

478
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,760
What happened?

479
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,820
What is wrong with you?

480
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,980
What happened?

481
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,900
Kim Yun Cheol thinks that you, Jin Seon Mi, died,

482
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,760
or that he killed you.

483
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,020
You were alive?

484
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,620
He must have thought I committed suicide.

485
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,920
Suicide?

486
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,660
He told me that he wanted to break up with me yesterday,

487
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,600
so I told him I was going to kill myself.

488
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,790
I turned my cellphone off on purpose so he could worry.

489
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:01,050
But I didn't think he would worry this much.

490
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,560
It's okay. Why would I die? I'm not that weak.

491
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,500
You called me because you were curious to see if I were alive?

492
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,690
Since we confirmed you're alive, we're good.

493
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,790
Since you're here anyway, we want to confirm some other things too.

494
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:25,730
Last night, I heard that Kim Yun Cheol had a big argument with you Ms. Jin Seon Mi.

495
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,570
What was it about?

496
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:33,180
Oh, that. Why is it

497
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,620
that married women get the wrong idea when they see people like me?

498
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,600
That I'm seducing their husbands.

499
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,730
And that isn't the truth?

500
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,740
Me?

501
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,820
I'm really disappointed.

502
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,820
Why is today turning out like this?

503
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,400
HEY! Let's just go eat.

504
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,440
Let's talk.

505
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,420
Why aren't you asking me anything?

506
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,660
I don't have anything to hear from you.

507
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,390
Really?

508
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,510
You're not curious how I'm alive?

509
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,660
As long as you're alive.

510
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,180
Yeah okay, let's hear you out.

511
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,190
What happened?

512
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,590
It's not what I'm thinking right now, is it?

513
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,240
I got a call from Jae Gyeong earlier.

514
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,810
that our plan was a failure so I should show myself to you.

515
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,470
Jae Gyeong?

516
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,760
You used to say 'that woman,' 'that woman' and now you're calling her by her name.

517
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,030
When did the two of you get in a relationship where you use each other's names?

518
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,810
It just happened.

519
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,900
The two of you made a pact and deceived me, since when?

520
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,360
 Have my husband listen to this.

521
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,130
 I recorded our conversation just now.

522
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,880
♫  What can I do for your love?  ♫

523
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,940
 You are going to end up dying. 
 ♫   Crazy everyday without you  ♫

524
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,340
 What are you talking about?

525
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,590
 We have to make it so my husband believes it.

526
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,070
 After making it look like I've attempted to kill my husband,

527
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,570
 you're going to end up dying instead in a twist.

528
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,620
 You and I have to make this work smoothly.

529
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,930
♫  I know you know we know  ♫

530
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,150
 What's wrong?

531
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,080
 Seon Mi, hold on, Seon Mi....

532
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,080
 Seon Mi...

533
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:57,450
♫  I know you know we know, so far away  ♫

534
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,760
 Seon Mi!

535
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,880
 Jin Seon Mi!

536
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,550
 I thought about it for a second...

537
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:06,820
♫  far away, get away  ♫

538
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,590
 but it really is what happened.

539
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:13,430
 It was all planned to have your brother-in-law come at that timing.

540
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,410
♫  far away, get away  ♫

541
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,230
 Why is brother-in-law here so late?

542
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,900
  - What do we do? 
 - Don't open the door.

543
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:27,280
 We can't. The lights are on in the house so we can't pretend that no one is here..

544
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,980
 I'll take it from here, you take care of him.

545
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:37,810
♫  Wash away your terrible memories with your tears  ♫

546
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:41,360
♫  Every night without you in which I am hurt by your lying words  ♫

547
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,910
Hand.

548
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,380
♫  without you  ♫

549
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,270
We worked very well together.

550
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,330
We didn't even have a rehearsal and got it right the first time.

551
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,100
Do I have to get inside here?

552
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,770
Of course, hurry.

553
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:15,530
While you weren't there, we made it look like the corpse was moved.

554
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,970
♫  Your bickering every day is wearing me out. Damn.  ♫

555
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:34,530
♫  The game is boring.  ♫

556
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:38,310
♫  After a long night, in front of me was  ♫

557
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,510
♫   another boring scene. ♫

558
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,790
♫   I giddily think whether I have it or not. ♫

559
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,720
Do we have to go this far? 
♫  Your eyes shine differently from the start,  ♫

560
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,220
♫  you are shaking again  ♫

561
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,260
That's the problem.
 ♫   Oh Love me like you do  ♫

562
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,820
In a plan like this, you have to be more real.
 ♫  We are a wall which has lost the way  ♫

563
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,220
Details are the life of this plan. 
 ♫  Tell me what do now  ♫

564
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,090
I didn't think that she would really dig a burial site. 
 ♫  Even if it's something which will light a fire in your heart  ♫

565
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,170
♫  In the change of heart which no one was aware of  ♫

566
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,450
I was a little nervous that at this point. 
 ♫  I might really go crazy now   ♫

567
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,940
♫   I could really go crazy. ♫

568
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,730
♫   Firmly set at orange moonlight night  ♫

569
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:13,780
♫   At last you return my side  ♫

570
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,420
♫   At last return my side  ♫

571
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,910
♫   At last return my side  ♫

572
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:24,920
♫  you’re locked inside my heart now. Orange moonlight.  ♫

573
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,390
♫  At last return my side. ♫

574
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,540
There are things you shouldn't play around with.

575
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,920
Both of you are insane.

576
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,920
Let me ask one thing.

577
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,850
Why did the two of you team up on the same side?

578
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,990
In the end... is it because of the money?

579
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:57,550
Since the beginning, your goal was the money, wasn't it?

580
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,240
I didn't even know that,

581
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,290
and I lived in self-guilt and was having such a hard time.

582
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,030
Do you know that?

583
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:15,770
Ask her yourself why I sided with her in that crazy plan.

584
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:21,310
Money? Yeah, that money that you like.

585
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,530
You can keep that money,

586
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,260
and live doing everything you wanted to.

587
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:58,490
♫   Because of you wandering in the endlessly dark night  ♫

588
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:02,120
This is our car's spare key. 
  ♫  I have put you in my hand.   ♫

589
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,270
I'll tell my husband to grab the money. 
♫  Even if you try to run away   ♫

590
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:08,100
Yun Cheol will probably put the money bag in the trunk, you can take it then.
  ♫  you can't get out   ♫

591
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,520
♫   You are circling in a maze    ♫

592
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,430
♫   Who'll ever gonna get you out  ♫

593
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:19,200
♫   Confined alone in a black tunnel   ♫

594
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,220
♫   Yeah no one gonna hide you now 
You better move

595
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:45,050
I did everything in my power.

596
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:50,570
But, it seems that this is the end for my husband and me.

597
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:55,120
I tried my best, but I think

598
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,650
we've come too far to go back.

599
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:04,310
So, you and your husband

600
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:06,750
should also reach an end.

601
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,180
It's you, right?

602
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:11,250
The one who killed my junior Song Yu Min.

603
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,930
What are you talking about?

604
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,830
You were showing it off to me,

605
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:22,780
that you received them from your husband for your birthday.

606
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,050
It's so pretty.

607
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:29,690
My husband gifted me these for my birthday.

608
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,960
These are from a luxury brand.

609
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,820
Yeah, they look different since they're a luxury brand, right?

610
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,900
They're so pretty.

611
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,360
I'm so jealous, really.

612
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:46,220
To be honest, this was a hiccup in the plan that I never thought about.

613
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,350
Because of a regular housewife like you,

614
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:53,230
my entire plan has been ruined.

615
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:58,890
This kind of turn of events is not to my liking.

616
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,230
Let's go to the police station together.

617
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,690
Why should I? It's all because of you.

618
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,830
Why is that because of you? It's because of you that my poor junior friend died.

619
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,220
You're the one who started all of this!

620
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,930
Marrying a trash-like husband, having an affair,

621
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,530
planning revenge, Song Yu Min dying.

622
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:25,920
It's all because of you!

623
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,760
Why are you blaming others? If you hadn't planned such a stupid revenge,

624
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,470
we wouldn't have come to this.

625
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:35,370
Just divorce. You could have simply divorced. Why are you dragging it?

626
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:38,460
Why are you making me and my husband get involved in this?

627
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:44,370
But you two aren't a married couple.

628
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:48,380
If someone hears this, they're going to think that you two are really a married couple.

629
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:52,360
What are you so surprised about? Did you think that everyone didn't know?

630
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,670
Everyone knows that you two aren't a married couple.

631
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:00,920
Did you really hope that everyone would see the two of you as a married couple?

632
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,360
Oh my gosh, poor you.

633
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:11,390
If you don't have the courage to go the police station, I can go in your place

634
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:13,960
and tell them everything for you.

635
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,490
Thank you for the tea.

636
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:40,720
In the end, you two are just tied by one piece of paper.

637
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,830
Our contract is much more real

638
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,330
than the garbage contract that you two have.

639
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:58,030

640
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,600
♫   A casually broken promise

641
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,290
 My Dangerous Wife

642
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,850
 I will take the 50 billion won.

643
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:18,490
 Are you having that much fun playing with me? Come out here right now!

644
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,090
 The person who killed Song Yu Min is Ha Eun Hye.

645
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:23,650
 I wanted to reveal the secret of the happily married couple.

646
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:27,800
 Jae Gyeong has been kidnapped. My wife can die.

647
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,360
 In the house that you worked so hard on,

648
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,790
 now it will be our end.

649
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,760
 It's best not to think of something stupid.

650
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,390
 Otherwise, your wife will die.

651
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:49,160
♫   I won't share with another no matter who it is   ♫
