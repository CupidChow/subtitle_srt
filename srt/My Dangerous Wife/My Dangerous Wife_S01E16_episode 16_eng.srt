1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:06,940

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,040
 Married Woman Abducted, Demand for 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,080
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,250
 From where did things go wrong?

5
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:11,190
 Am I unable to keep the oath I swore at N31?

6
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,820
 Until life do us part.

7
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,550
 Get 5 billion won ready. If you report the incident, your wife will die.

8
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,900
 I had hoped my husband would remember N31.

9
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,680
 Is... Is... this the police?

10
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,420
 My wife has disappeared.

11
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,190
 The promise that we had sworn.

12
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,590
 I wanted to set straight my husband who had made the wrong choice.

13
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,560
 Divorce Petition
 Name: Kim Yun Cheol

14
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:55,150
 But there were unanticipated variables I had to tolerate.

15
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,330
 I could only start a new plan. 
 Yun Cheol,

16
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,270
 The happiness I tasted during my memory loss,

17
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,440
 was experienced as even more bitter after my memory returned.

18
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,430
 I want to believe you.

19
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,710
 I can't believe in myself.

20
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,290
 Hand.

21
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,350
 Jin Seon Mi will now die.

22
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,710
 I need to make him believe it.

23
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,870
 Not only happiness

24
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,250
 but also misery is shared between a married couple.

25
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,040
 I wanted to let him know.

26
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,430
 But the plot was foiled.

27
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,720
 The money that was my lifeline

28
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,230
 was handed over with no regret.

29
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,200
 To the neighbors that had lost their innocence,

30
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,210
 I tried to recommend confessing.

31
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:10,630
 But I had totally underestimated my foe.

32
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:19,130
 As expected, wives are dangerous.

33
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,070
 This...

34
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,530
 may be a fitting last day for us.

35
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,530
 No. That's wrong.

36
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,830
 I prepared for a possibility like this

37
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,970
 and left a letter.

38
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,660
 If anything happens to me

39
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,760
 please give Yun Cheol this letter that contains the truth.

40
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,250
Nothing is working out.

41
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,320
Is it going to be all right?

42
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,970
Is it okay if you separate this way?

43
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,300
If you're unable to see your husband's face again

44
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,580
will you be okay?

45
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,930
Why wouldn't I be okay?

46
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,720
I mean it.

47
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,540
The contract. It's an excuse.

48
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,810
Should we make a bet

49
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,480
on whose husband will come?

50
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:38,080
Do you still expect anything from your husband?

51
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,160
Most certainly.

52
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,650
I trust my husband.

53
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,130
If you had trusted him, you wouldn't have started this.

54
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,870
If I hadn't started this,

55
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,400
wouldn't it have only made it worse?

56
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,450
How could it be worse than this?

57
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,480
You, too ...  no matter what happened ... didn't you want something to happen too?

58
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,920
I am different from you.

59
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,300
This is the last time so tell me what you really feel.

60
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,400
Why did you hang onto your husband

61
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,970
while you even yanked off your own fingernail and pretended to kill his mistress?

62
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,440
He is my husband.

63
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,330
That's your response, to the end.

64
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,170
Should I say it instead of you?

65
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,120
You've never loved Kim Yun Cheol.

66
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,240
You just needed a husband to have an ideal marriage.

67
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,820
An easy to handle a man who appeared to have everything:

68
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,800
good looks, talent and was naive.

69
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,090
No one knows what goes on between a couple.

70
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,950
A couple? Because of marriage vows?

71
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,950
Weren't you playing the roles of a happy couple

72
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,800
keeping an agreement, that scrap of paper, against your will forever?

73
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,400
That is like

74
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,020
talking about you.

75
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,360
I also should have acted like you ...

76
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,810
I was clutching my heart like a fool.

77
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,350
You have been laughing like that at me all of this time, haven't you?

78
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,190
We are identical now.

79
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,530
Do you know something?

80
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,510
I truly hated you.

81
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,820
When there was no difference between us,

82
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,510
I truly hated terribly seeing you

83
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,840
smiling as happily as if you had everything!

84
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,110
Honey, Jae Gyeong!

85
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,830
Don't move a muscle.

86
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,180
Honey. You did come.

87
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:42,520
You thought I was mentally deficient.

88
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,450
I won the bet.

89
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,890
Since you all are impatient because you can't be at each other's throats

90
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,900
can't you at least be honest?

91
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,050
Say "It hurt my pride to admit I chose the wrong spouse,

92
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,210
but I just, I just liked it like that."

93
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,230
Even if I say it, so what? Everyone lives like that.

94
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,150
Liking became disliking and disliking became disliking more, we lived together.

95
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,540
That's what a married couple is.

96
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,730
Honey, escape.

97
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,730
Hurry and run away.

98
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,810
I ran like crazy to rescue you.  Do you think I would leave you alone?

99
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,390
I don't have the strength to run away.

100
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,290
Never mind. Never mind.  Stop that. I don't want to listen to this.

101
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,430
I'm sick and tired of watching you acting happy every morning.

102
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:44,940
Alright, since this is the last time, why don't you say something that makes him cry?

103
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,340
I ...  For the last time

104
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,800
there is one thing to tell you.

105
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,700
Please. With your own hands

106
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,530
put your shoes in the shoe rack.

107
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,370
Those ...

108
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,510
are really tears.  Tears.

109
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,460
 I knew Sin Jae Gyeong was a perfect wife.

110
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,810
Why did you come?

111
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,030
- What are you going to do? 
 - Why are you here?  Go back.

112
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,580
We both won the bet.

113
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,110
Escape with this money.

114
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,540
It's yours.  Take it and escape.

115
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,530
- I'll take care of these two and follow you. 
 - What is this?

116
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,630
Are you going to turn everything around and take the blame for my wrongdoing?

117
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:24,950
Do you think I would go that far for you? It's okay, so go.

118
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,240
You can live if you have money.   I've lived fine without money.

119
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,260
So quickly leave.

120
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,290
Don't mock me.

121
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,370
- I said don't mock me! 
 - Don't!

122
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,350
Stop now.

123
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,130
It expires in ten years.  Keep your promise.

124
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:44,570
I've breached the contract.   Life freely by yourself.

125
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,460
I did all of this.

126
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,600
I did all this!

127
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,200
Are you okay?

128
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,110
Don't.  Don't.

129
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,860
Honey.  No. Honey.

130
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,500
- I ... I am sorry. 
 - Honey.

131
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,810
I am sorry.

132
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,510
I'm sorry for everything.

133
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,480
Honey. Honey.

134
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,470
 20 years ago

135
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,600
 Sim Jae Gyeong.

136
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,020

137
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,760
♫  What can I do for your love  ♫

138
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,410
♫  Crazy everyday without you  ♫

139
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,020
♫  A silent cry.  ♫

♫  So far away.  ♫

145
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,400
I would like this house to burn down.

♫  I will get away far right now ♫

152

♫  I will get away far right now ♫

154
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,930
Does it seem the butterfly is trying to fly away?

155
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,240
It seems to me

156
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,260
that it's not trying to.

157
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,920
No one may know how hard I'm trying

158
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,200
because I want to live a normal life.

159

163
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,950
 3 months later.

164
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,700
The coffee is here.

165
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,120
Someone needs to learn quickly how to roast it.

166
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,510
It's a waste for the machine to be sitting idle, right?

167
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,510
What person is going to relieve me of the task of  bean delivery in the future?

168
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,890
Jae Jeong, what do think about learning how to roast the beans?

169
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,120
- Really? Can I? 
 - Of course.

170
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,130
- Glad to meet you, Mr. Barista. 
 - I'll do my best, Boss.

171
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,610
Have some.

172
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,160
- Here's your order. 
 Yes, Guest.

173
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:58,040
Unfortunately, your husband is cheating on you again.   It's his hideaway.

174
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,500
That son of a —

175
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,050
It would be better if you had an affair.

176
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,800
Are you serious?

177
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:17,280
There was a case in which the husband and mistress tried to poison the wife.

178
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,910
- Really? 
 - That wasn't everything.

179
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,450
Come close. So then ...

180
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,560
This is top secret.

181
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,470
That's good.

182
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,090
Right foot. Slowly.

183
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,230
Left foot. Right foot. Let's take two more steps.

184
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,540
Good.  You're doing very well.

185
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,400
Right foot.  Left foot.

186
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,710
What's going on with Ha Eun Hye and Jo Min Gyu?

187
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,470
There have been reports of seeing two people resembling the couple.

188
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,030
There's no way the two of them are still together, is there?

189
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,410
Of course. They were bound to each other by money.  They weren't a real couple.

190
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,500
No. They are together.

191
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,700
- What happened to the money? 
  - Did it go up in flames?

192
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,340
 Dodang Pharmacy

193
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,770
I'm back.

194
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,200
- Good job.  
 - How is rehabilitation going?

195
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,340
If I do my best now in physical therapy for a very short time, I'll be walking without crutches.

196
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,060
Good for you.

197
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,700
Are you getting prepared already? I'll do it too.

198
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,930
No no.  Don't push yourself too hard.

199
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Oh my.

200
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,790
Are you okay?  Be careful.

201
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,200
Thanks, Honey. Have you come to make deliveries?

202
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,540
Yes.  I'm sorry.  I should have gone to the hospital with you.

203
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,940
No.  I can walk well.

204
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,200
Even so, next time,  don't go by yourself.  You must go with me.

205
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,890
Mom,  hold up a spoon there.

206
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,380
- Why? 
 - To catch the honey that is dripping.

207
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,650
A spoon for what?

208
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,050
 My husband who had been stabbed had some internal injuries,

209
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,480
 but he was able to save my life and had a safe recovery after.

210
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,710
 Right after the incident the media competed fiercely to cover us,

211
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,790
 but their enthusiasm quickly cooled.

212
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,720
- Yes. It will be delivered right away. There's a delivery.
  - Yes. Okay.

213
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,040
 The number of customers visiting the chicken restaurant has become just right.

214
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,600
-  Are you two still working here? 
 - Yes.

215
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,100
- Can we take a picture together? 
  - A picture?

216
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,840
 - Everyone has returned to their normal lives.  
 - One, two, three.

217
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,080
 After the incident, smiling increased for my husband.

218
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,740
Isn't it a little uncomfortable to be living in such a small place?

219
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:59,700
No, Mother-in-law. It is us making it uncomfortable for you and Sister-in-law. I'm sorry.

220
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,870
No, no. I like sleeping in Chae Rim's bed.  I sleep soundly.

221
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,840
Mom's talking in her sleep wakes me up often.

222
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,030
Could you talk less because you are damaging the time of growth hormone production?

223
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,100
- Can I sleep with Aunt starting today? 
  - Of course. Naturally.

224
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,150
Hey, hey.  Even your dreams are shrewd.

225
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,830
The room is too small with Aunt and Uncle.   It's so small they have to stick to each other.

226
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,600
You have to hug and sleep. Huh? You do that, right?

227
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,700
- Yes, of course. It is so small, I can't do anything else. 
 - Why, Mom?

228
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,790
- Something like that happens. 
 - It's so narrow I have to stay still.

229
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,280
  - Although I turned over the restaurant and lost five billion won,   
  - It's tasty, isn't it?

230
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,920
  I am not sad at all,

231
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,520
 because I found the husband I had lost.

232
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,030
You're intending to leave, aren't you?

233
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,320
Yes.  I've finished my work.

234
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,390
There is still something left to tell me.

235
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,300
 A  husband who was devotedly taking care of his wife whom he knew was suffering from a fatal disease.

236
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,330
 An ideal marriage.  Later I learned there was no such thing.

237
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,270
 When I went to see my wife, I hoped it would be for the last time.

238
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,920
 That's what I thought.

239
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:57,110
♫  If I  ♫

240
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,740
♫  had not lost you  ♫

241
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,540
♫  No one completely  ♫

242
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,000
 After I lost my wife,

243
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,630
 I realized what she meant to me.

244
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,830
 Those two wanted to make a different choice than I did.

245
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:32,210
 Jae Gyeong. If it's that hard, you can stop and put it aside.

246
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,940
 I want to go further.  Just what will there be at the end?

247
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,640
 Do you mean it about your husband?

248
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,940
 Those two are different. They didn't give up on each other.

249
00:24:53,100 --> 00:25:00,300
 When I saw my mother struggling, I decided not to become someone's wife.

250
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:09,360
 But I thought being someone's wife might not be a miserable status.

251
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,940
 After all,

252
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,650
 Sim Jae Gyeong  was the person who stayed with Kim Yeon Cheol.

253
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,600
I must find your owner.

254
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,470
Is it Cinderella?  Do you want to find her shoes?

255
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,950
 Ha Eun Hye. (52)

256
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,950
Sim Jae Gyeong.

257
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,320
Yes.

258
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,590
There's a thought which keeps returning to my mind.

259
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,660
You helped Ha Eun Hye and Cho Min Gyu get away, didn't you?

260
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,970
Are you talking about that again?

261
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:27,170
I can't understand it no matter how much I think about it.

262
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,570
Why you made such a mistake on that day.

263
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,120
Move aside.

264
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,470
 Wait a moment. Wait. Wait.

265
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,540
 What about Ha Eun Hye and Cho Min Gyu?

266
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,670
 In the house.

267
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,920
If you hadn't said that, we would have caught them immediately.

268
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,880
I've told you so many times.  I was not myself at the time.

269
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,020
Does a person like you make mistakes?

270
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,450
Gosh.  Aren't you giving me too much credit?

271
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,340
I am just looking at you just as you are.

272
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,820
I am just an ordinary housewife.

273
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,400
- I'm back. 
  - You're here.

274
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,560
- Honey, take this. 
 - What is it?

275
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,050
What's in front of you?

276
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,950
Yeong and Hwan Law Firm.  Isn't that a lawyer's office? But why send something to me?

277
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,840
Open it.

278
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,170
  Could it be ... divorce?

279
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,300
 Personal Safety Insurance Policy

280
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:07,490
It's the kidnapping insurance your wife's parents obtained 20 years ago when she was studying abroad in France.

281
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,900
It's been applied this time.

282
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,620
Did you know there was kidnapping insurance on you?

283
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,430
- Hello. Sorry to trouble you. 
 - Yes

284
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,650
I heard there are some new residents in the neighborhood.

285
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,520
Ah, these people? They live in the first house near that entrance.

286
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,510
Dear, hurry.

287
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,820
The kidnapper collected the ransom and escaped.

288
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,710
Sim Jae Gyeong sustained the serious aftereffects of an injury.

289
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,320
The house burned down.  So you will receive the full insurance policy amount.

290
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:25,140
The full amount? How much is the policy's full amount

291
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,200
- Twelve million Euros. 
 - Twelve million Euros?

292
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:35,160
At the current exchange rate, it is approximately 16 billion won.

293
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,020
Sixteen billion won?

294
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,460
It is SIXTEEN BILLION WON?

295
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,980
How many minutes do we have this time?

296
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,350
We have to escape in four minutes.

297
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,060
 You have to get out of here now!

298
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,420
 One moment please.

299
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,350
 Why don't we join hands?

300
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,790
 Move me and my husband to the balcony.

301
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,380
 Then call the ambulance. Then set this place on fire.

302
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,450
 I'll state that you were in the house.

303
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,920
 While the police investigate,

304
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,940
 you two can buy time for your getaway.

305
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,880
 Five billion, be sure to take it well.

306
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,080
Go by yourself from here.

307
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,800
To live on the run for the rest of your life

308
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,550
you have so many days of your youth ahead of you.

309
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,490
You said you wouldn't say those kinds of things.

310
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:11,890
Let's go.

311
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,610
The first benefactors of the insurance were listed as the parents of Sim Jae Gyeong,

312
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,670
but since the two have passed,

313
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,450
the contract was changed and a new article was added.

314
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,270
It's here. Nomination of beneficiary.

315
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,550
If we interpret the provisions of this clause

316
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,160
"the beneficiary of the policy is her spouse".

317
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,960
Spouse?

318
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:38,810
I am the spouse. So me?

319
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,020
Wow. Amazing, Honey.

320
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,190
Look. It's amazing.

321
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,250
Let me see.

322
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,190
Here.

323
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,080
Husband.

324
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,060
 N31 Nomination of Beneficiary
 Applicant nominates husband as beneficiary to receive the benefit payable ...

325
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:03,420
On the blank there's your name Mr. Kim Yun Cheol. Write your name and sign please.

326
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,470
Me?

327
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,410
N31. Nomination of Beneficiary.

328
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,610
Sixteen billion KRW.

329
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,480
 N31. Is this by chance?

330
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,430
  what  N31 is the abbreviation for?

331
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,390
 N31.

332
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,450
 Is this the real meaning of N31?

333
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,490
 There's an important condition.

334
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:34,740
 Until the divorce is finalized, she has requested that you don't go overseas or any place far where you can't be.

335
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,420
 She could not divorce me who was the recipient of the insurance.

336
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,150
 Thank you.

337
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,750
 She didn't need me, but a husband

338
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,200
 at her fabricated self-abduction

339
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,360
 Even her nonsensical acting.

340
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,720
 Do you know how anxious I felt while watching you

341
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,230
 that you might make a mistake.

342
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,630
 Maybe we should report this?. 
 - No.

343
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,670
 Is there another way?

344
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,370
 If only you believe in me, Honey.

345
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,210
 Do you know what the real end of the line is?

346
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,250
 When we give up. I haven't yet.

347
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,750
 We will go further.

348
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,730
 What for?

349
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,190
 Because I want it.

350
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,220
Aren't you going to sign?

351
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,870
Yes.

352
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,640
I must. I just felt nervous just now for some reason.

353
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,300
There's no need to be.

354
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,620
Now it's all yours.

355
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,510
Congratulations.

356
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,860
 Kim Yun Cheol

357
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,750
 Kim Yun Cheol

358
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,120
 What are my wife's true motives?

359
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,310
 I cannot dare ask. No. Rather. I cannot even imagine.

360
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,020
 Even if I spend my entire lifetime to understand her, it won't be enough to understand this person.

361
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,990
 My Dangerous Wife, Sim Jae Gyeong.

362
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,610
Okay.  Congratulations.

363
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,490
I guess we should be thankful to N31.

364
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,770
I heard the insurance benefit was tremendous.

365
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:46,740
Kim Yun Cheol was not the honteku ( Person using marriage to maximize financial benefit ).

366
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,000
Maybe Sim Jae Gyeong did it.

367
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Marriage.

368
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,690
She didn't need marriage but a husband.

369
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,460
I will never get married.

370
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,750
Will Kim Yun Cheol be safe?

371
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,760
You're great at using your knives.

372
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,290
The knife is great to handle.

373
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,870
Is that so?

374
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,620
Hello.

375
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,440
You've arrived?

376
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,560
Would I be able to get an empty room, by chance?

377
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,050
Do you want to be evicted from life?

378
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,710
Have a cup of coffee.

379
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,310
Leave the chicken feces removal to me from now on.

380
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,920
N31's significance.

381
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,900
I don't have any interest now.

382
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,960
November 31 and November 31st is not

383
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,080
Lee Jin Su married couple, but

384
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,890
Lee Jin Su and Jae Gyeong, the promise between those two.

385
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,600
Do you believe your wife?

386
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,460
I really was curious.

387
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,090
Jae Gyeong and Lee Jin Su's relationship.

388
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,760
Why did Lee Jin Su help Jae Gyeong?

389
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,690
I bet 10 KRW on the fact that it wasn't just financial.

390
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,150
 Gyeonggane Chicken

391
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,870
That's the technique.

392
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,900
 20 years ago

393
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,120
I'm not going to go home.

394
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,800
Let's turn on your cellphone and contact them. They'll pick you up. 
 Shinchon Driving Corp]

395
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,190
 Won't you kidnap me?

396
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,740
 Don't joke.

397
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,790
 Get today's lesson fees as a ransom.

398
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,830
 What?

399
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,780
You said you needed surgery fees for your girlfriend, Teach.

400
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,120
want to help.

401
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,560
 I want to remember.

402
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,910
 Today is November 31st.

403
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,740
A day that's not anywhere in the world.&lt;

404
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:26,360
 Thanks to today, I think I'll be able to live well and ordinarily.

405
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,200
 Bar SUD

406
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,220
 Until death do us part, forever.

407
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,980
 ...dinner was left.

408
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,830
 Seoul Jungam Police Station

409
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,960
Yes, the self-abduction

410
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,080
and the one who made Song Yu Min write a suicide note and confession

411
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,150
was me.

412
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,980
From Criminal Code Article 137

413
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,300
Obstruction of Performance of Official Duties by Fraudulent Means applies.

414
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,350
I know.

415
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,360
You must've done it even knowing. But why did you?

416
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,370
After her revenge on her husband was completed, perhaps you hoped that Sim Jae Gyeong might turn to you.

417
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,790
I was curious.

418
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,460
What would happen to that married couple?

419
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,790
Just because you two were unhappy in your marriage were you determined to ruin theirs?

420
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,280
Happiness wears the same exterior.

421
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,720
They say misery is varied.

422
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,600
It means that these issues need to be resolved individually.

423
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,530
Bar SUD. SUD.

424
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,660
It means south.

425
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,250
But there's another meaning.

426
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,600
SUD.

427
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,100
Sudden death.

428
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:24,230
Now you should reveal the death of your wife.

429
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,560
There's no such thing as sudden death.

430
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,040
It's just the conclusion of events started long ago.

431
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,320
What killed my wife

432
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,170
was the marriage.

433
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,880
Each meal felt like three outs.

434
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:16,140
My life felt like I'd never be able to hit the ball.

435
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:24,620
But I saw a homerun.

436
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,930
Homerun! 
♫  You wouldn’t know that I’ve got you now  ♫

437
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,700
♫  Without knowing, you hmm  ♫

438
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,190
♫  You dare tear all my heart apart  ♫

439
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,800
 I know who you are.  
♫  Fearless you, right?  ♫

440
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,250
 Ms. Sim Jae Gyeong!

441
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,260
♫  Because you who are wandering in the endlessly dark night  ♫

442
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:55,200
 It was a moment where my imagination became reality.

443
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,500
♫  Even if you try to run away you can't get out  ♫

444
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,790
 It'll be a good way to distract the police.

445
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:08,460
 Thank you for listening to my request.

446
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,530
 We'll both obtain what we wish.

447
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,290
♫  Who'll ever gonna get you out?  ♫

448
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:19,560
 I think I've already obtained it.

449
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,160
 Sim Jae Gyeong is

450
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,740
 stronger than I had imagined

451
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:43,570
♫  You wouldn’t know how I've got you now  ♫

452
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,340
Thank you.

453
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,640
Drink some.

454
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,770
I saw this on social media.

455
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,970
That you drink two cups of hot cocoa.

456
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,900
Yes, that's right.

457
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,760
But it's a married couple cup. Yet I have no need to use it with my husband.

458
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,030
They say married couples don't have or keep things as a couple.

459
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,110
That statement bothers me a bit.

460
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:15,190
A married couple doesn't do that. Family members don't do that.

461
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,340
It feels like we're giving up too much in our lives.

462
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,360
It's not that you give up. It just gets to that point.

463
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,940
It's not my decision.

464
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,550
No.

465
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:32,180
I won't give up through my decisions.

466
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,220
I, uh...

467
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,010
Thank you so much for agreeing to my interview.

468
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:45,730
I was curious about what kind of plot you were imagining.

469
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:51,650
I am interested in not fantasy, but reality.

470
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:59,350
 We needed a situation.

471
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:09,880
 I cheered her on, as she cheered me on.

472
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:24,120
Your novel was really fun!

473
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,090
But I wish you'd change your protagonist.

474
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:38,840
Not a housewife who wants to be a writer, but a housewife who already is a writer.

00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,990
 Thank you to our English editing team: cgwm808 (chief), joysprite, and hannalee123 (translation).

482
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,390
Scratch me there.

483
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,990
Inside.

484
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,390
How?

485
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,200
To the right.

486
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,000
I'll bet 100 KRW on that you're thinking of Dad.

487
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,850
It's not!

488
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,160
Should I go lower?

489
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,320
Don't worry, Mom.  I'll scratch your back.

490
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,630
I'm fine.

491
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,630
There?

492
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,760
A little higher.

493
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,190
 Safety?

494
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,030
 Can I live on faith?

495
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:40,520
 From time to time the shock passes through.  It's all right.

496
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,210
 Usually the most dangerous enemy is the one who is closest.

497
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:51,560
 I witnessed the real culprit of this incident.

498
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,700
 In the end, it was marriage.

499
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,940
 Tonight we will have some excitement.

500
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,230
 Clink!

501
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,160
 Umm.  I need to go to the restroom.

502
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,790
 President Ha. You're not running away are you?

503
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,430
 No.

504
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,080
Our boss is so naive.  She must only know about work.

505
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,650
Come in. Okay.

506
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,140
Partner. Puppy!

507
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,860
Is that all right?

508
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:44,320
 No, no.

509
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,730
 Don't hang around places like this.

510
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,190
 Thank you.

511
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,990
 Excuse me.

512
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,980
Then can you hang out with me?

513
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,770
 Shall we go to me house?

514
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,800
 This is a reversal.  Okay.  So what would you like to do?

515
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,350
♫  I don't think I forgot you yet  ♫

516
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,990
 Have you ever tried marriage?

517
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:28,010
♫  in countless past times  ♫

518
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:32,660
 I totally did not expect that.  
 ♫  In the days I loved you completely ♫

519
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,350
 Sorry.

520
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:40,030
♫   have become infinitely distant  ♫

521
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,510
 But I think it will be fun.  Let's go.

522
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,830
♫  The days I loved you completely  ♫

523
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,860
♫   have become infinitely distant  ♫

524
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,140
♫  Someday♫

525
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:58,640
♫  in a time in which we are tangled with each other  ♫

526
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,430
♫   when we are far apart  ♫

527
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,830
♫  will you be there for me  ♫

528
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:10,430
 1 year later 
 ♫  like the past?  ♫

529
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:14,720
Shall we plant herbs in the spring? You can use them when you cook.

530
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,450
Good idea. If you want anything to eat, just tell me. I'll make it all for you.

531
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,420
If you're making it, I want everything.

532
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,590
Could you look here?

533
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,070
Yes.

534
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,560
How do you feel about returning to work, Chef?

535
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:40,800
Yes.  It turns out  I think I'm happiest when I'm cooking for someone.

536
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,500
I heard one-table dining was your wife's idea.

537
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:49,800
Yes.  My husbands' food is too good for just me to be eating.

538
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,200
The husband's cuisine and the wife's table setting.   You two have great synergy.

539
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,250
The newly opened shopping mall is also very popular.  Please share your secret.

540
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:06,380
I don't think shopping malls are just for housewives.

541
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,960
It is a community center where the art of living is shared.

542
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,420
Was this cup repaired?

543
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:27,410
Yes.  I won't throw away a favorite and will fix it.

544
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,700
Yes.  I think it's good for the environment.

545
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:47,480
 As someone's wife, she becomes the fulcrum both inside and outside the marriage.

546
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,340
 I became her husband.

547
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,600
 Two years later

548
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,160
It's so nice.

549
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,940
We were here on our first wedding anniversary.

550
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,710
Do you remember?

551
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,700
We are here today because I wanted to prepare something special like the first.

552
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,770
Isn't that too much?

553
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:12,220
Can't I at least do that much?

554
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,200
I know.

555
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:29,850
 Congratulations on Your Wedding Anniversary!

556
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:34,680
Congratulations on your tenth anniversary!

557
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,400
Thanks.  It's already been ten years.

558
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,490
A lof of things happened, didn't they?

559
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,370
Wait a moment.  I'm sorry.

560
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:50,580
Can we drink the wine I brought?

561
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:55,730
It is a wine with special memories. 
  L'Amour Eternel

562
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,020
Yes, of course.

563
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,200
 L'Amour Eternel

564
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,560
L'Amour Eternal.

565
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,790
Wow, you finally learned it.  After ten years.

566
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,440
Is your oath still valid?

567
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,200
"Forever until death do us part."

568
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,380
The wine is stamped with our thumbprint.

569
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,470
It is.

570
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:47,030
But if there were an expiration date for marriage,  how many years would be appropriate?

571
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,050
Ten years?

572
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:53,420
Don't you think that would be sufficient?

573
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:58,300
I don't think I would have any regrets if it were at least that much.

574
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,190
Just if.

575
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:12,540
 No way.  To here  ...

576
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:27,090
 Still a coward.

577
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,990
 Am I useless now?

578
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,870
 Are you still doubting me?

579
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:38,200
 That's funny. Sim Jae Gyeong, you're going to do this to the end.

580
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,100
  You are really consistent.

581
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:48,600
 If there is a ten-year expiration date, will you renew it?

582
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,220
What about you?

583
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,750
Me, well. To be with you the expiration date is a thousand years.

584
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:58,340
Would you like another glass of wine?

585
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,360
Sure.

586
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,770
Til death do us part.

587
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,770
Life until death do us part.

588
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,130
Forever.

589
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,600
- Cheers? 
 - Cheers.

590
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,890
♫   You better move.  Run  ♫

591
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,300
Would you like to order your dinner?

592
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,900
- Acqua pazza. 
 - Acqua pazza.

593
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,140
I don't know who it is.

594
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,990
Dear, hurry and come.  What are you doing?

595
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,860
She keeps making me talk. I'm scared to death, Sunbae.

596
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,330
Dear, come quickly.

597
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,130
Quiet. What?

598
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:50,360
You must listen to her.  I have to hang up.

599
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,810
My wife is ready to do the closing.

600
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,210
You're so noisy.

601
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,380
Sorry.

602
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,590
It's a cold-cut sandwich, Mom.

603
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:10,560
We'll wash the dishes, so just write.

604
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Oh, my cuties. It's really yummy. I'll enjoy it.

605
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:22,390
- Here, Americano. 
 - Thank you.

606
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,800
- It looks good. 
 - Did you see it?

607
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,500
- The plot? 
  - Thrilling.  Like walking on thin ice.

00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,630
♫ At last return my side ♫

640
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,060
♫ At last return my side ♫

641
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,700
 Marriage is a place of constant struggle.

642
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,350
♫ Firmly set at orange moonlight night ♫

643
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,200
♫ At last return my side ♫

644
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,390
 Sometimes it takes more strength to surrender than to triumph.

645
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,150
 I simply misunderstood that the life span of love is short.

646
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:22,390
 Perhaps the life span of love may be longer than that of a person.

647
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,360
 Marriage is the hardest way to love someone.

648
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,760
 I love this way.

649
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,640
 Still yet.

650
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:57,840
♫  I see and only trust you  ♫

651
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:03,470
♫  There was a time like that  ♫

652
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:07,860
♫  A dream like time  ♫

653
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:14,100
♫  Joining you was enough  ♫

654
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:21,720
♫  in a love which would last forever  ♫

655
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:27,670
♫  is something I don't have anymore  ♫

656
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:35,640
♫  The pledge to be together for life  ♫

657
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,700
♫  easily fell apart  ♫

658
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:45,370
♫  in the slightest breeze  ♫

659
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:56,900
♫  Should I hold you who are hesitating?  ♫

660
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,410
♫  I don't have any love  ♫

661
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,900
♫  left  ♫

662
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:13,190
♫  A causally broken promise  ♫

663
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:17,230
♫  You have to risk everything  ♫
