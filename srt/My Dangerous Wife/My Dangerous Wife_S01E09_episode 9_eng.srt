 Married Woman Abducted, Demand for 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,180
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,760
 No way, my wife? Did my wife plan this, too?

5
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,070
 CCTV around this area, fingerprints, footprints, hair,

6
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,070
 make sure to scrape every last thing that may involve Kim Yun Cheol.

7
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,240
 Did you report me?

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,260
 ... if you can stay silent until 4 o'clock, your innocence will be proven.

9
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,420
 ... please deliver this letter to Sim Jae Gyeong.

10
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,730
 Along with the money that made you miserable,

11
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,900
 From this world, I will disappear.

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,060
 Was this your hidden card?

13
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,280
 You really are perfect, Sim Jae Gyeong.

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,660
 Please could you let me work here again?

15
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,670
 5 billion won! It's in my hands now!

16
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,550
 A tooth for a tooth. Poison for poison.

17
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,760
  I will use the poison that was going to kill me to recover my five billion won.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,430
 If you don't do it quickly ...

19
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,580
 Bring the money right now.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,100
 That crazy woman kidnapped Chae Rim!

21
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,940
 This is wrong!

22
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,720
 You have really gone too far.

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,230
 If you don't do it quickly—

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,000
 Perhaps the only happy ending of a marriage is divorce.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,240
 You cannot go anywhere without my permission!

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,050
 Good bye Sim Jae Gyeong,  my dangerous wife.

27
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,290
 When you are a husband

28
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,220
 there's no place to escape your wife.

29
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,590
I am free!

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,390
 I know all about the kidnapping. I will be waiting at 9 PM at the Bar Classic  in front of the Gangnam station.

31
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,970
What are you doing now?

32
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,030
It was you, right? The one who killed Song Yu Min.

33
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,700
The official cause of death is the fall. Did he die before falling?

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,240
What are you trying to say?

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,300
I saw everything.

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,940
I was following Song Yu Min because I thought he had the five billion ransom.

37
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,310
While you were in the process of stealing the money, you killed him.

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,320
If I did, what are you going to do about it?

39
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,900
Should I threaten you and ask for money?

40
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,170
I neither killed anyone nor do I  have 50,000 won in my wallet.

41
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,230
So you pay the bill.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,930
 I'm sorry for leaving you alone.  I'm going home now.

43
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,020
 I'm sorry for leaving you alone.  I'm going home now.

44
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,330
I think we can make a good team.

45
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,500
Seonbae, Seonbae. Seonbae. Seonbaenim.

46
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,660
There is a report that Song Yu Min met a woman.

47
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,030
- Where? 
 - The pier in the vicinity of Hyeonjang.

48
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,430
- The pier? 
 - Yes.

49
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,590
There was something unusual on the ring finger of his left hand.

50
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,580
His ring finger?

51
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,470
Ring finger.

52
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,380
 My Dangerous Wife 
 Ferocius Battlefield: Asking Why Are You Getting Married.

53
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,430
You are stopping now, right?

54
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,790
Is the concept that you're going to sleep with me?

55
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,110
Are you really drunk or are you pretending to be really drunk?

56
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,810
Would I act like a drunken fool in front of a suspicious man?

57
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,360
Well, you succeeded in conning  Kim Yun Cheol. What are we doing next?

58
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,440
I never offered to team up with you.

59
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,570
I can't believe this.

60
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,260
 Yun Cheol:  Where are you?

61
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,570
Aren't we already on the same team?

62
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,620
 I'm sorry, I just saw this.

63
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,410
 I'm not in good shape today, so  I want to be alone.  I'll contact you again tomorrow.

64
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,610
Jeez.

65
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,100
 I'm worried the guy with you is in good shape.

66
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,650
She wants me to tell you she doesn't want to see you now.

67
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,600
What are you guys doing?  And since when?

68
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,660
In what capacity are you asking?

69
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,270
Capacity?

70
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,410
You're pretty confident.

71
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,560
What's not to be confident about.  In any case,  it's the kettle calling the frying pan black.

72
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,110
How dare you use the idiom?  Do I look anything like you?

73
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,710
Shall we just call the police to decide instead of arguing with metaphors?

74
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,070
Who did more wrong?

75
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,940
Take this off. If you continue, it will be only to your loss.

76
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,080
Goodness, I made a mistake. What are you going to do about it?

77
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,810
The enemy is everywhere.

78
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,350
I'll store that in my memory, Mr. Next-Door Neighbor.

79
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,920
 Happy House 
 Eun Hye ❤︎ Min Gyu

80
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,080
Hello.

81
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,320
Are you going somewhere?  Are you on your way home?

82
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm on my way out. Is something wrong?

83
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,910
We received a report of a mugging.

84
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,890
A mugging?  Where?

85
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,700
 Petition for Divorce

86
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,030
Seonbaenim! Seonbaenim! Here.

87
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,600
H--h--honey!

88
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,500
- Ms Sim Jae Gyeong. 
 - Honey, what happened?

89
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,490
- Call 119. 
 - Yes.

90
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,890
- Honey! 
 - Ms. Sim  Jae Gyeong.

91
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,780
- Aren't you getting in, Guardian? 
 - Ah yes.

92
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,490
Hurry and get on.

93
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,940
119 Emergency Services

94
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,300
Honey. Please come to your senses.

95
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,420
 Geoseong University Hospital

96
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,350
What needs to be done for my wife? 
   Take fall precautions

97
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,980
Breathing, BP, Heartbeat are all normal,

98
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,670
so you shouldn't worry much. She'll wake soon.

99
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,520
 1501 
 Sim * Gyeong

100
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,860
It..looks like you're going somewhere?

101
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,280
Yes, because they said she needs absolute bed rest.

102
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,380
I need to go home and get some of my wife's things and change my clothes too.

103
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,300
- It's a bit weird? 
 - Pardon?

104
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,450
Isn't the timing of the burglary strange?

105
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:24,930
All of the nation's citizens know that this is a residence that lost 5 billion KRW to save Ms. Sim Jae Gyeong.

106
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,750
But I think the culprit's thoughts are different on the matter

107
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,100
because he was convinced that it was at your residence, Mr. Kim Yun Cheol.

108
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,470
Exactly. That's weird and doesn't make sense.

109
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,010
Unless Mr. Song Yu Min's suicide note was fake.

110
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,860
We received a tip that before Song Yu Min died that he had met a certain lady.

111
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,010
That there was a bandage on her left ring finger.

112
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,310
I'm home.

113
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:12,210
I hope something would happen to us, too.

114
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,770
Kidnapping or a burglar.

115
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,920
There was a burglary next door.

116
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,230
The owner was rushed to the hospital.

117
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,280
What did the burglar steal?

118
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,210
I can't say.

119
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,390
- I'll be out. 
 - Where are you going so late?

120
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,090
We had promised not to interfere with each other's private lives.

121
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,320
 There was a burglar.

122
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,470
 What? Who?

123
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,960
Who else would know that there's something worth taking here.

124
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,180
What a commendable action.

125
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,750
So who said to call like this?

126
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,590
Team Leader Han.

127
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,370
I never--

128
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,560
 Seoul Central Metropolitan Police Agency

129
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,950
There are two sets of tableware.

130
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,120
It was a dinner for two people.

131
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,220
Since there was a struggle at the table, there also needs to be food stains on the clothes.

132
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,250
But rather than there being any traces of a physical struggle,

133
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,670
it looks like everything was swept off the table like in a marital spat.

134
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,690
Ah... you have swept the table a ton so you must know.

135
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,010
That's not it.

136
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,170
What's the relevance between a marital spat and this case?

137
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,560
Check Kim In Cheol's time off work, and check for consistency in his statements.

138
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,890
- Sunbae-nim, you should stop. 
 - What?

139
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,220
Continuing to suspect him, is too much isn't it?

140
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,890
But they're a couple and family, no?

141
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,520
A married couple and family is all the more reason to suspect him.

142
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,300
Honey, you're really something. You didn't give up and succeeded.

143
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,000
You should leave it to me.

144
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,160
Who are you again?

145
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,730
I guess something's fun.

146
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,470
You're so cute, Honey. Me keeping it is safe.

147
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,760
If you keep it, is there any suspect other than you for the burglary ?

148
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,460
It looks like because i have some money on me, you're looking at me in a new light.

149
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,830
Honestly, I did. I thought you had knelt completely in submission to your wife.

150
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:20,130
Speak for yourself, I saw you again. Your taste in men is quite defined.

151
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,930
My taste in men? Whether it be the bleeding married man next door...

152
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,440
I was at least born with great vision you know.

153
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,490
Don't misunderstand me. I was drunk so I don't remember anything.

154
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,300
You're my everything.

155
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,320
Don't say things that aren't even worth saying.

156
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,070
But how did you learn about this situation? Did that jerk tell you?

157
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,620
This. There's my share here too. I'm going to take charge of my portion.

158
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,450
We need to argue that too.

159
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,400
This money, I'm not losing it again.

160
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,330
- It's mine. It's mine. 
 - Let go. Why are you like this!

161
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,960
 I was caught once again by my wife. 
Declaration of Marriage Vows
 Groom Kim In Chul 
Bride Sim Jae Gyeong

162
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,820
 Declaration of Marriage Vows

163
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,310
Kim In Cheol, when will you be above your wife, huh?!

164
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,630
Drat!

165
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,990
You Sim Jae Gyeong you really!

166
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,620
Honey

167
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,640
Are you okay?

168
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,210
Yeah.

169
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,050
I can never forget the deeds you committed!

170
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,630
 I can't completely be taken over by my wife.

171
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,370
 I must escape as soon as possible.

172
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,560
Hello, welcome.

173
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,900
You've awakened.

174
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,220
Have you regained a bit of consciousness?

175
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,000
Can you recognize who he is?

176
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,230
Honey, Honey.

177
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,490
There.

178
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,730
Do you remember what happened last night?

179
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,690
Yesterday

180
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,350
Yesterday nothing out of the ordinary happened.

181
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:56,090
All I did was wait for my husband to get off work.

182
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,440
But..why am I in the hospital?

183
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,130
Why are things like this?

184
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,220
After being tazed, she seems to have taken a tumble on the stairs.

185
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,940
Due to blunt external trauma, there is a subdural hematoma but there's no brain damage.

186
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,200
Then why

187
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,660
It's seems like psychogenic amnesia.

188
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,630
Ordinarily dissociative disorders exhibit as post-traumatic stress disorder.

189
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,150
Amnesia?

190
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,780
I'm done eating.

191
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,580
I want to eat what you cook, Chef Kim's cooking.

192
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,060
It's been a long time since I stopped cooking.

193
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,510
But, why?

194
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,800
What's been going on? Why are there so many changes?

195
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,240
Did you change too?

196
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,950
Do you really not remember anything? We ...

197
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,210
got married also.

198
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,170
We did get married. You know we are newlyweds.

199
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,960
Soon it will be our first anniverary

200
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,520
This year we will have been married for six years.

201
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,510
Oh, this is driving me crazy.

202
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:56,270
Ridiculous.  Are you saying it's been six years?

203
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:01,380
Wait a sec.  I'm a newlywed. Then, what about you?

204
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,870
How could this be? I'm seriously going crazy.

205
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,300
- Aunt! 
 - Chae Rim!

206
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,710
- Oh my, oh my.  Who? 
 - I'm Chae Rim.

207
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,300
You are Chae Rim? You were a little four-year-old.

208
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,970
What in the world?

209
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,010
- Elder Sister-in-law. 
 - Aunt.

210
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,390
- Yes? 
 - Have you really forgotten everything for several years?

211
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,200
Don't you remember the key you left with me? And also the I Spy game?

212
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,220
What are the key and the I Spy game?

213
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,700
Should we use a talisman? There are too many bad things happening recently.

214
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:47,100
I am sorry. Eomeoni (Mother), did something else bad happen to me?

215
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,600
No, no. Happenings? There aren't any. What bad things?

216
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,200
Of course.  What bad thing could have happened? There aren't any.

217
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,300
- Ahjumeoni (ma'am), didn't you come with her? 
 - What?

218
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,960
- Mom. give me this. 
 - Yes.

219
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,730
Can I get more details about what you reported last night?

220
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,660
I said everything when I reported. That was all.

221
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,320
Well, I could hear them arguing.

222
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,430
And there was a loud thumping sound. That was it.

223
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,070
Because of that, I was afraid so I reported it right away.

224
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:25,600
Did you perhaps confirm the man you witnessed left the house?

225
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,800
I didn't see where he went.

226
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Oh my, oh my, Ajubeonim (Mister). How could you bring something like this?

227
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,900
How sweet of you.

228
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,200
This is the lunch box you gave me.  Don't you remember?

229
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,410
Me?  This lunch box?

230
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,360
Oh, yes. I do.

231
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,510
No one but you cared that I was living alone.

232
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,290
Is it true you are living alone?

233
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,260
Then, in the end, did you get divorced?

234
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,340
Well, you're accurate again.

235
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,500
- I'm sorry. 
 Why are you sorry? Eat something.

236
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,450
I will do so.

237
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,140
Try this.

238
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,910
There's candy underneath.

239
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,970
It looks delicious.

240
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,060
I wanted something sweet.

241
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,710
It's tasty.

242
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,640
Darling, want to eat some?

243
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,990
I can't eat sweet things because of the sugar. Don't you remember?

244
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,380
I'm going to eat it all by myself.

245
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,300
 I promise to love you till death do us part.

246
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,760
Her answer to the petition for divorce was the marriage vows.

247
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,620
Amazing.

248
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,620
It means she did it in advance and also thought of getting the money back.

249
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,070
"I am a wife over a defeated husband."

250
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,490
The amnesia ...

251
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,830
What the heck does it mean?

252
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,820
Does she mean to forget everything and to start over again?

253
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,860
While keeping these promises as a couple.

254
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,420
Where is the money?

255
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm not interested.

256
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:02,440
Instead ...I'm interested in something else.

257
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,950
I wonder about

258
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,350
the ordinary housewife.

259
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:29,000
 If one side takes action, the other side has to also.

260
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,210
 You should return to your honeymoon too.

261
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:37,160
 The couple should act in the same happiness together.

262
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,340
Are you feeling any discomfort?

263
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,530
Are you okay?

264
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,000
I  an hurting here.

265
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,400
- Where? 
 - There.

266
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,470
 Are you feeling me out? What is that?

267
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,380
 Just let me catch the man.  I won't let him go.

268
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,000
Kim Yun Cheol's car. 
   7/13 Mon

269
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,090
This is one hour before the incident happened.

270
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,900
- Something fishy. Fishy. 
 - Is this leading to a fight between the couple?

271
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,380
- Yes.  I didn't smell it. 
 - Huh?

272
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,500
Usually after leaving work you prepare food, right?

273
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:44,100
But the food was cold and the kitchen did not smell of food.

274
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,570
It is evidence there was a gap in time between the table being messed up and the robbery report.

275
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,060
Did Kim Yun Cheol leave work before the incident?

276
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,490
I don't know what it was over but the two people had a big fight before eating.

277
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,600
And Kim Yun Cheol left in anger, and returned for some other purpose.

278
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,460
Don't say.  It was because of the five billion won.

279
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,440
If Sim Jae Gyeong was involved in Song Min Yu's death

280
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,480
the suicide note was fabricated, and the five billion was not burned,

281
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,690
then the money was in the house.

282
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,100
That's what the robber was after?  Is the robber Kim Yun Cheol?

283
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,600
- Bingo. 
 - But then why is he still with his wife?

284
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,000
He should have taken off before.

285
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,060
Why would you run away if you won the lottery?

286
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,190
To be less suspicious, you have to maintain your daily routine.

287
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,410
 CEO Kim Yun Cheol.

288
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,920
Team Leader Jin, I ...

289
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,500
- Are you two here? 
 Yes. I needed to check on something.

290
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,350
By the way, is the madam okay?

291
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,590
If the boss is not coming out, she must he in a poor condition.

292
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,190
Don't talk nonsense.

293
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,780
If the boss doesn't come back, sales will fall.

294
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,880
HIs wife's care is more important than the restaurant.

295
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:20,000
We will take care of the restaurant. Shall we end our break and get back to work?

296
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,080
Team Leader, shouldn't you go to visit the madam at the hospital?

297
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,200
- Please go as our representative. 
 - Why would I go there?

298
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,200
- Thanks so much for coming.  
 - Not at all.

299
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,960
Yes?

300
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,380
Jin Seon Mi?

301
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,580
Gosh, welcome. Come in.

302
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,420
- Here. 
 - Oh my.

303
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,970
Thank you. It smells nice.

304
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,640
I guess you really can't remember anyrhing.

305
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,930
That's not it but ...

306
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:31,830
I can't remember several years.

307
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,080
But I remember Jin Seon Mi.

308
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,570
So fragrant.  Thank you.

309
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,420
Oh, do you two know each other?

310
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,070
Of course. We do.

311
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,830
I can't say.  I don't think I know you well.

312
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,900
She is a regular at our restaurant. You know her well.

313
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:02,030
Restaurant? Seon Mi works with you at Old Crop?

314
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,540
Yes. The President and I maintain the best partnership.

315
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,930
We are one family.

316
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,070
All the staff are like family. It's a family atmosphere.

317
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,930
That's what you wanted.  Like a family restaurant.  A family like atmosphere.

318
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,350
That's what I say.

319
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,810
You shouldn't do this because I am jealous.

320
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,490
Because you two should not be pointlessly misunderstood.

321
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,160
Even if the staff is family, you should be discrete with the female staff, Honey.

322
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,950
Of course, discrete.  Well, I should be.

323
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,570
Of course.  It's perfect for being misunderstood.

324
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,650
You should be discrete.

325
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,650
But I don't know why only woman should be discrete.

326
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,990
Husbands should be discrete first. It's not a sin to live alone.

327
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,540
Of course, of course.

328
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,500
Men should be discrete first. Husband should behave well.

329
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,570
That way, misunderstanding won't occur. Please don't worry.

330
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,610
I think the amnesia is due to medication and not an illness.

331
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,290
Jae Gyeong, don't try to remember.

332
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:44,100
Because whether it's something you can forget or something you wan to forget, it's been erased, hasn't it?

333
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,530
Yes.

334
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,620
Now I'm going to let my mind be calm.

335
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,500
Don't think about anything now and relax.

336
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,460
Dear, can you arrange these prettily in a vase?

337
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,990
Oh, sure, sure. I'll do in my own style.

338
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,950
Thanks.

339
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,000
Take a look.

340
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,180
Sim Jae Gyeong?

341
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,610
I looked carefully but she's not there.

342
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,560
This is a picture of the pedestrian overpass going toward rhe pier.

343
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,610
Wait, wait. This is Sim Jae Gyeong, right?

344
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,990
Because it's far away you can't see her face well, but it's her clothing.

345
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,900
- Next.  
 - Here. If you look,  right?

346
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,670
Song Yu Min rode the elevator which goes only  to the pier. 
  07/10 Fri

347
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,160
Sim Jae Gyeong walked up the pedestrian overpass.

348
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,550
Then that means they met two days before he died.

349
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,590
But, Seonbaenim, by saying that the two met, what's the difference?

350
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,620
Before he died, couldn't Sim Jae Gyeong have wanted to see him?

351
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,830
But it seems you are the only one who really wants the couple to break up.

352
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,240
Understand the genre correctly.  This is an investigation, not a melodrama.

353
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,510
- Are you having a cold war with me? 
  Do you want to shoot a horror movie with me?

354
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,350
Dear.

355
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,830
Thanks.

356
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,540
I feel strange.

357
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,890
Just don't worry too much.  It may be a temporary phenomenon.

358
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,870
I only know you and don't know five years.

359
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,830
During that time, what were we like?

360
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,700
How was our marriage doing?

361
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,160
Everyone lives like that.

362
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,260
Really?

363
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,520
Then that's good.

364
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,220
Being with you is enough for me.

365
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,420
Emotional stability is important for her memory to return.

366
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,590
Staying at home will be more beneficial.

367
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:41,300
- Yes. 
 - Thank you.

368
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,430
They are still not answering.

369
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,900
Who?

370
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,150
Mom and Dad.

371
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:57,470
No matter what, they should be called when their daughter is sick.

372
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,710

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,130
It's strange that the two of them are side by side.

379
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,850
What do you mean?

380
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,710
During their lifetimes, they never even ate at the same table.

381
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,400
But only after death are they close like a couple.

382
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,300
I see.

383
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,390
The two seemed to get along well, but ...

384
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,600
In my eyes, they maintained the marriage in order to harass each other.

385
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,950
I had to fulfill their expectations as a reward for their suffering.

386
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:22,860
Our marriage was the only thing I did because I wanted to.

387
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,110

I hope our marriage as such is happiness for each of us.

392
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,800
As I think about it

393
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,640
you are my only family in the world now.

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,730
- You're already discharged? 
 - Yes.

405
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,450
Are you all right?  I worried a lot.

406
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,540
I'm sure you have lots of other things to worry about than to be worried about us.

407
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,290
Your son is really handsome.

408
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:54,200
You're too sweet. Are you going on a walk with your mom? So sweet.

409
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,720
They say she needs some time.

410
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
- Huh? What do I need?

411
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,980
- This isn't the time.  Let's go into the house. 
  = Yes.

412
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,030
Yes.  It's so nice to see them.  What a son!

413
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,070
Wow! What is this?

414
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,330
This house is nice.

415
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,120
So impressive.

416
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,890
Sim Jae Kyeong your housekeeping is impeccable!

417
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:35,100
Look, look. Not a speck of dust. Not a speck.

418
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,440
After I asked an ajumma to help, it was quickly cleaned.

419
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,800
Oh, really, a helper? No wonder.

420
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,920
It would have been more perfect if you had done it.

421
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,990
Me?

422
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:56,220
It seems I've been living as  a trembling neat freak all this time?

423
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,780
- Neat? 
  I think I liked you too much.

424
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,270
For six years I've been nervous.

425
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,010
You're making me feel bad.

426
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,510
That means living with me was uncomfortable.

427
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,840
Let's be honest from now on.

428
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,560
It's good to be home.

429
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,890
Home is best!

430
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,090
What's the matter?

431
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,120
Are you crying?  Are you hurting?

432
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,020
No. Were you surprised?

433
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,760
All I need is you.

 Don't over work.  You're in poor shape immediately after.

437
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,220
 - What did you do today? 
 - I did some business planning today.  We're trying to prevent problems.

438
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:27,000
Wow, Chef Kim. It's been a while since you personally cooked.

439
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,570
For your sake, I can't take a break from cooking.

440
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,100
It will be delicious.

441
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,160
I can eat Chef Kim's cooking.

442
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,440
Don't overdo it.

443
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,290
I'll give you something to eat, so relax.

444
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,160

Are you okay? Are you okay?

448
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,820
I remembered something.

449
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,310
On the stairs, someone... to me...

450
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:50,010
You remem... ? Let's go upstairs and rest.

451
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,030
My head hurts.

452
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,240
I don't remember the face.

453
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,030
Don't remember. It doesn't have to be remembered.

454
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,750
How shocked you must be. Don't think about that day and rest.

455
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,720
Oh, why do we have two beds?

456
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,350
Were we a relationship where we use separate beds?

457
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,810
It's what you wanted saying that you want to keep the tension even between a married couple.

458
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:22,610
I did? I..

459
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:26,150
I..why did I do such a thing?

460
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,360
Don't think.

461
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,520
There sleep deeply, a bit.

462
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:41,220
Are we truly... that nothing happened between us right?

463
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,510
Of course.

464
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:48,350
I don't remember, but my heart feels frustrated.

465
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,560
It'll be better after you sleep.

 2013 Among the most critical of the variables concerning flavor during roasting is

469
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,650
 the bean type and the environment.

470

 in a pristine high elevation environment, 1400m above sea level

471
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,260
 it is possible to taste premium taste, from a premium blend of high quality beans.

 Have a taste.

00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,060
 a  high quality, bean.

475
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,170
 Now that we've concluded, how about we start tasting from here.

476
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:57,370
 She looked more brilliant than anyone else.

477
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,860
 You don't look too good today.

478
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,820
 There are times you can realize while meeting someone.

479
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,620
 That she's someone I had been searching for all my life.

480
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,280
 Wow he's completely smitten.

481
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,240
 Haven't I told you?

482
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,610
 That it's forbidden to flirt in my lectures.

483
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,990
 Would you like to be evicted, or would you like to leave now?

484
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,070
 I heard the lecture really well, lecturer.

485
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,590
 You look like you need to intently listen until the end.

486
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,720
 The coffee that I had brewed was so terrible.

487
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,000
 Coffee is too difficult, so let me excuse myself.

488
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:48,190
 I'll head out too.

489
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:05,610
 But suddenly, marriage needed me to act out love.

490
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,210
 Just like us.

491
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,430
 Petition for Divorce

492
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,160
Who said to come to me on your own will.

493
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,680
We need to retrieve it together, the 5 billion KRW.

494
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,760
It sounds like the 5 billion is precisely somewhere. I wouldn't know.

495
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,890
So you have no interest.

496
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:47,830
Well that can't be helped, but I'll let you be.

497
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,090
Who said I wasn't interested.

498
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,370
Honey, I'm going to go to the restroom, so you go inside first.

499
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,120
Sure.

500
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,170
Nice to meet you.

501
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,360
Be careful.

502
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,920
There was another accomplice, as expected.

503
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,770
It's not certain?

504
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,160
Well we can confirm.

505
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,870
You're something. Acknowledged.

506
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,220
"That's a disease."

507
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,890
A disease of endless cleaning and endless nagging.

508
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,860
What is this chicken? Honey, you just ate two plates of pasta.

509
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,770
And isn't that my shirt?

510
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:40,790
It's stained so I was gonna throw it away.

511
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,340
Your complexion looks good, but you're not sick somewhere, are you?

512
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,010
Omo, that is so funny.

513
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,830
It's so itchy.

514
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:54,930
Honey, here, here.

515
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,800
Scratch for me.

516
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,880
Scratch?

517
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,730
- There. 
 - Here? 
- Yeah

518
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,130
There!

519
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,030
- A bit below. 
 - Here?

520
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,650
A bit below. Left. Left!

521
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,800
Below, left! left! Stay still right there.

522
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,830
I'll do it.

523
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,790
There. A little harder.

524
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,300
I'll do it. Stay still.

525
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,800
It's there. How relieving.

526
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,020
It's there.

527
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,580
Honey

528
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,300
I just remembered.

529
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,620
What?

530
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,140
Just a bit to the right.

531
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,580
Below, below.

532
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:50,810
It's great to be married. There's someone to scratch my back.

533
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,320
It's good right?

534
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,030
Is only your back itchy? What about elsewhere?

535
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,680
Here?

536
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,500
Anywhere else?

537
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,000
- It must itch here too. 
 - Oh Honey!

538
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,360
♫  All I needed was you  ♫

539
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,530
♫  with love that felt like it would be forever  ♫

540
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,650
Wait.

541
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:21,760
♫  But that love is  ♫

542
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,100
Look, Honey
 ♫  no more  ♫

543
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,070
They said you can't strain yourself, so

544
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,200
your back is itchy too.

545
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,990
I'll clean this up.

546
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,830
♫  The pledge to be together for life  ♫

547
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,320
♫  fell apart so easily  ♫

548
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,320
You're done eating this chicken, right? Wow, you ate a lot.

549
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,660
♫  In the slightest breeze  ♫

550
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:49,890
♫  When you are hesitating  ♫

551
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:55,260
♫  should I hold onto you?  ♫

552
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,690
♫  I don't have any love left  ♫

553
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:02,340
 What is this? Why does my wife look so lovable?

554
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,340
A fly. Oh.

555
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,850
A mayfly...

556
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:13,150
Maybe because of this chicken?

557
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,510
Oh, you scared me.

558
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:23,330
What are you doing there, looking so scary?

559
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:28,480
Stop staring at your phone. That's an addiction.

560
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,260
I'm reading a book.

561
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,120
Recharging your romance with web novels?

562
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,520
No, I'm recharging my fighting spirit with a married couple thriller.

563
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,430
Want to read it, too?

564
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,790
Reading investigative reports are hard enough.

565
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:57,940
You said you were writing a story about a housewife who fabricated her own abduction.

566
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,820
How is that going?

567
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,680
Even if that was real, would anyone believe it?

568
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,410
No, never mind.

569
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:31,850
Why are you getting home so late?

570
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:34,760
Are you acting this way because I didn't deposit your money yet?

571
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,110
Isn't that obvious?

572
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,540
So then I'll deposit the money.

573
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,760
All at once.

574
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:50,440
Can you even do that?

575
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,890
Are you worrying about me?

576
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,970
What is with you?

577
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:09,350
It's me. Ha Eun Hye.

578
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,110
 You can't stand that I'm being so disgusting right now, can you?

579
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,010
- Should I go over there? 
 - What? What?

580
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,030
What? What?

581
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:15,260
I better sleep here.

582
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,290
There is a draft over there.

583
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,210
Draft?

584
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,580
I better sleep this way.

585
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,180
This bed is a single.

586
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,000
But it's roomier than I thought.

587
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:42,760
 I think the saying goes, "Love makes you blind, but marriage opens your eyes?"

588
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,640
 Maybe marriage is about seeing things and ignoring them?

589
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:52,600
 Should I trust you or ... not?

590
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,840
Want another drink?

591
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,430
Again?

592
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,300
There was a wine I wanted to drink with you.

593
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,290
What? Which one?

594
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,170
But I think it will be hard to find.

595
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,380
Why?

596
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,000
You hid it.

597
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,260
I did?

598
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,750
I did? Did we play a treasure-hunt game or something?

599
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,560
I just could not find it.

600
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,130
But now you can't remember it, either.

601
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,210
I will try.

602
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:37,230
I don't have the memory, but I know myself best.

603
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,640
So if it was me, where would I have hid it?

604
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,660
Wine, wine, red wine.

605
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,080
Red wine...

606
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,190
Here? No.

607
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,070
The wine that I hid.

608
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,400
Here? No.

609
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,710
Here?

610
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,430
 Did she really lose her memories?

611
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,400
 My wife seems like she's become someone else.

612
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,370
Remember, remember, remember... where?

613
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,740
- I found it.
 - What?

614
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,710
Was this what you were looking for?

615
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,170
Is it?

616
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,190
Yes!

617
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:08,850
When did we begin playing treasure-hunt games?

618
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:11,670
It's childish, but it's super fun.

619
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,910
Do you remember this wine?

620
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,560
Of course.

621
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,420
How can I forget something so important?

622
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,140
It's our proposal wine.

623
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,890
L'Amour Eternel
 Cabernet-Syrah Pays D'Oc 2009

624
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,660
Shall we drink it now?

625
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,150
Do you remember?

626
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:14,070
Until death do us part,

627
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,160
forever.

628
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:28,180
 I dare you to keep this act up, by drinking the poisoned wine and dying.

629
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,190
 See if I blink even one eye.

630
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,360
Don't drink it.

631
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,030
Huh? Why?

632
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,450
The wine has gone bad.

633
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:02,020
The wine has gone bad?

634
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,830
The smell, it's gone totally bad.

635
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:07,780
Really? I think it smells fine.

636
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:31,060
Thank you, Honey.

637
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:34,690
I was a bit worried, to be honest.

638
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:39,910
I worried that that there were some problems between us.

639
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,930
But I'm not worried anymore.

640
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:47,370
Even if I don't remember everything, I just need to remember one thing.

641
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,820
The reason I married you.

642
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:02,280
Can I ask you that reason?

643
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,560
That reason is...

644
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,990
... what reason would it be?

645
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,840
I want to be with you.

646
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,180
I just love you.

No, you can't.

01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:52,740
I will make sure you don't get a drop of water on your hands.

652
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,060
Gosh, not a single drop of water?

653

There, it's almost done. Please relax comfortably.

 In order to make my husband come back, I remember planning something.

672
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:33,220
 Where did the the real money go?

673
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,370
 Why did she put on a show like that?

674
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:39,000
 What am I supposed to remember with that?

675

 Why would you meet that woman? Why?

01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,420
 Someone took something that was very precious to me.

677
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,470
 5 billion won.

678
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:50,590
 I think I might really kill you.

679

 Even if we divorce, I will be the one to do it.
