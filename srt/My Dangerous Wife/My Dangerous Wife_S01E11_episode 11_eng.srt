1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:12,140

2
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,400
 My Dangerous Wife

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,140
  - the time the robbery report was received ...
 - Sunbaenim, here!

4
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,980
 Isn't the timing of the burglary strange?

5
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,670
 - It's mine. 
- Let go

6
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,290
 I was caught once again by my wife. 
Declaration of Marriage Vows
 Groom Kim In Chul 
Bride Sim Jae Gyeong

7
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,700
 Do you remember what happened last night?

8
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,280
 Did she really lose her memories?

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,560
 In order to make my husband come back, I remember planning something.

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,760
 Where is the real money?

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,490
 What have you been doing here since earlier?

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,850
 There were enemies all around.

13
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,000
 What am I supposed to remember from this?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,840
 So there was another accomplice after all.

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,430
 Isn't it for sure? Well, we can always confirm.

16
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,860
 Please bring the 5 billion won in front of my home by 10 PM tonight.

17
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,830
The five billion needs to disappear for it to be ours.

18
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,890
We need to make it disappeared money.

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,360
 Why did you meet that woman? Why?

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,610
 This is my 6th-anniversary gift to you.

21
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,080
 ... your memory or whatever?

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,230
 Really losing my memories was an unexpected variable.

23
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,820
 And briefly lasting happiness

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,620
 And my heart fluttering at your boyish expressions

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,820
 was not planned either.

26
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,240
Do you

27
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,920
know why we can't live together?

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,900
Because I might really kill you with my own hands.

29
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,910
But I will still trust you.

30
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,820
But I can't trust myself.

31
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,570
I'm sorry

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,140
that we aren't able to have a beautiful couple break up.

33
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,010
Because I am alive.

34
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,650
What would have happened that day

35
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,050
if I had not disappeared,  had waited for you and drunk that wine?

36
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,830
We're already finished.

37
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,180
Even if get divorced, I'm going to do it.

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,350
We already broke up a long time ago.

39
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,310
That is so.  For many years prior

40
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,700
you've been only been playing the role of husband.,

41
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,610
At some point you didn't even do that.

42
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,970
You weren't any different.

43
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,740
Do you think what you schemed and fabricated makes any sense?

44
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,580
You should have trusted me.

45
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,520
I wanted you to forgive me

46
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,450
for the kidnapping, amnesia, whatever I did and start over.

47
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,190
Would you have trusted me if I was forgiven like that?

48
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:20,410
You always pretended to believe me, but you didn't believe me at the crucial moment.

49
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,180
What we look like now is proof.

50
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,500
So are we tied?

51
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,640
No, we've both lost.

52
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,660
I should take my gift.

53
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,860
It was yours from the start.

54
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,250
The only thing I needed was to catch you.

55
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,970
Yes, I'm going to clear it away for you.

56
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,770
Don't you want to check what's inside?

57
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,130
You're the one who believes what you see.

58
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,130
However, while looking at everything which was obviously liked and disliked,

59
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,440
I've liked that.

60
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,340
Don't you have any other choice except to leave?

61
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,570
That's all right. I can leave.

62
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,010
I'm giving you a final opportunity.

63
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,310
Yes, you gave me a final opportunity.

64
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,670
Thank you for the alimony I received.

65
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,750
This is real love. Right.

66
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,240
Yes, this is 3-72 Buyong-dong. I'm going to the downtown hotel

67
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,910
I would like an express arrival, please. Double double!

68
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,170
 Episode 11:  My Husband I Wanted to Kill

69
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,540
 Marriage and home were the same to me.

70
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,630
 A safe and kind space that was filled with what I wanted.

71
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,950
 Except for one thing.

72
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,810
 As I thought about it, was it strictly necessary?

73
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,250
Yes, it's Sim Jae Gyeong.

74
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,290
I am requesting a favor.

75
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,180
- Wow! This is what I like. 
- Me too, me too.

76
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,300
If I like it, you like it too.

77
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,180
This is fun.

78
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,740
Excuse me, Honey. Are you going to continue not talking to me?

79
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,950
This is really yummy.

80
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,620
It's so yummy.

81
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,740
Cheap food.

82
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,100
Oink oink taste.

83
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,590
Eat slowly, slowly.

84
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,690
 I believed everyone believed the money is missing.

85
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,190
Like this wine, you all believed it is poisoned when it is not.

86
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,060
Even if it wasn't really poisoned, wasn't something added to it?

87
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,310
 From Min Gyu

88
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,160
 Min Gyu:  I took it.

89
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,010
 I stole it.

90
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,450
 I thought my wife Sim. Jae. Gyeong.

91
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,900
 would have taken the money, five billion won, the money too.

92
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,050
What are you guys really?

93
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,340
Do you have a moment?

94
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,810
May I sit down?

95
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,350
Why did you come all the way here?

96
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,670
Since it's an important matter, I came to tell you in person.

97
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,720
Don't be nervous, since it's good news.

98
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,490
I will yield my husband.

99
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,400
You can have him.

100
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,590
You can have the restaurant, also.  I want the two of you to make it work together.

101
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,920
 Hello, is this Yun Cheol?

102
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,070
What is it?

103
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,490
You were so concerned about your important wedding anniversary, and now what are you doing?

104
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,660
What are you talking about?

105
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,720
What's going on with you and your wife?

106
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,630
Did something happen after we attended your party?

107
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,710
What are the two of you planning?

108
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,650
I don't know.

109
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,940
Where's the money?

110
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,050
I don't know either.

111
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,060
Where are you right now?

112
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,960
Never mind.

113
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,640
Don't call me.  I want to be by myself.

114
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,400
Really.

115
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,770
 I wasn't planning on spending my whole life with Kim Yun Cheol since the beginning.

116
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,960
 Undam Foods
  Food Science Development Lab

117
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,950
 It started seven years ago.

118
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,350
 I got through college with scholarships and part-time jobs, and graduated.

119
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,340
 I was working as a researcher and making payments towards my educational expenses and loans.

120
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,630
 That's when I saw that woman.

121
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,800
 It's Sim Jae Gyeong.

122
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,790
 She always looks pretty.

123
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,000
 She was the woman who was the boss' daughter working in the public relations department.

124
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,250
If we focus on that point...

125
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,960
 Racing down easy street from birth.

126
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,540
 I hated that kind of woman to death.

127
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,620
Which proposal do you like?

128
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,130
 I think chocolate would appeal to the female customers.

129
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,910
 In order to show men this woman's bare face,

130
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,730
 I set a small trap.

131
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,800
 Yes, I will take a look.

132
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,020
 I'm sorry.

133
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,790
 Oh no.

134
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,680
 Are you alright?

135
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,930
 That woman broke my expectations.

136
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,220
 You didn't get hurt?

137
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,230
 You must have been surprised.  I was surprised also.

138
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,690
 What are you doing?  Just move.

139
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,120
 - Take this.
 - Thank you.

140
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,460
 If it's alright, take this.

141
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,360
 I'll borrow it for a moment, then.

142
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:22,990
 Right then, a black stain formed on my heart that couldn't be erased.

143
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,730
 I can't be the only one with a stain.

144
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,060
 I'm sorry.

145
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,790
 I'm going to take your mask off someday.

146
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,190
 Clean up with this.

147
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,420
 I hate kindness from poor people the most.

148
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,630
 It's alright.

149
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,770
 But that precious daughter married and left the company, and also left the stage of my revenge play.

150
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,230
 When I was discouraged that her world was getting further and further from mine,

151
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,060
 he came to find me.

152
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,340
 Jin Seon Mi?

153
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,740
 Traditional Italian Cuisine Restaurant Business Plan

154
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,760
 You're Jin Seon Mi, right?

155
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,890
 Yes, that's right.

156
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,100
 You're the same as I remember.

157
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,430
 Do you know me?

158
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,920
 Is there anyone in the world who doesn't know Jin Seon Mi?

159
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,520
 You're capable and beautiful.

160
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,250
 I'm sure all the subcontractor companies know you, too.

161
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,660
 - But why are you here? 
- Ah.

162
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,360
 I'm preparing to open a restaurant.

163
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,540
 The main menu is going to be traditional Italian food.

164
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,540
 The interior has already been decided as well. But having some difficulties with developing the menu and finishing things up.

165
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,310
 I've only worked on developing the taste of food.

166
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,920
 It's my first time operating a restaurant, so...

167
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,820
 I was told that there was someone who could help with both areas.  My wife told me about you.

168
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
 Look here.

169
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,670
OLD CROP

170
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,760
 I became his business partner.

171
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,530
 I made these at home.  Try them.

172
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,160
 It looks really delicious.

173
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,680
 And please take good care of my husband.

174
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,640
 Sim Jae Gyeong.

175
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,490
 My ultimate motive was to get close to that woman.

176
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,580
 Thank you.

177
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,770
 To the only woman that I had tasted defeat from.

178
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,050
 I'll borrow this.

179
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,060
 It was easy to approach her husband.

180
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,230
 Adokicin.

181
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,740
 To a husband in crisis, his wife was not his partner, and more like his enemy.

182
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:45,900
 That woman would die at the hands of the husband she loved.

183
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,810
 There were some unexpected variables in my plan, but I believe that the ultimate "toast of celebration" would belong to me.

184
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,250

185
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,850
 But I completely lost my second battle, too.

186
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,070
 I underestimated the hidden bare face behind the mask of the ideal wife.

187
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,720
 I really want to win.

188
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,030
 I want to see that woman look angry.

189
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,490
 Fine.  Let's do this.

190
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,680
♫  You dare tear all my heart apart  ♫

191
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,690
 Could you let me work here again?

192
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,910
 What are you doing?  Your legs must hurt.

193
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,060
 Get up.

194
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,660
 Please continue to take good care

195
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,060
 of our restaurant.

196
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,390
 Thank you.

197
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,150
 You need to keep the most dangerous enemy closest to you.

198
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,520
 She had the same thought as me.

199
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,310
 The husband that she threw away no longer had any value.

200
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,950
 Now I must think of a different way.

201
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,790
♫  Run  ♫

202
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,690
 A way to take off that woman's mask and make her kneel in front of me.

203
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,030
 Because winning against that woman is the only way to improve my life.

204
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,300
You can leave it there.

205
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,890
Enjoy your food.

206
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,650
Just a moment.

207
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,360
Thank you.

208
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,530
How old are you?

209
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,190
I'm 26 years old.

210
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,380
- You're 26? 
- Yes.

211
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,890
Twenty-one, two, three, four, five, six...

212
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,600
Seven.

213
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,810
I'm giving it to you because you remind me of myself when I was young.

214
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,820
Work hard.

215
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Thank you.

216
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,200
If you need anything else—

217
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,690
Do you think I would need anything?

218
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,550
Thank you.  Enjoy your food.

219
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,030
Alright.

220
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,580
♫  Mais moi, je ne te connais pas  ♫

221
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,260
This is what breakfast should be like. What's with all the porridge?

222
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,600
♫  Pourtant dans peu de temps ça changera  ♫

223
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,510
Hello?

224
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:19,110
We consulted with our VVIP client Sim Jae Gyeong regarding her divorce.

225
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,420
She said she does not mind divorcing you, Kim Yun Cheol.

226
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,290
She also said that she will not provide any alimony.

227
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,550
Home, land, car, the ownership of the restaurant, and cancellation fees for insurance.

228
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:40,200
We will need to negotiate the division of assets.

229
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,380
 Consensual Divorce Intention Confirmation Document

230
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,450
What is it?  Is there a problem?

231
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,730
No, not in particular.

232
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,770
However, there is one important condition.

233
00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,070
Until the divorce is settled, she has requested that you don't go overseas or any place far where you can't be reached.

234
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:06,560
If you don't agree to these conditions, we plan to use other methods of persuasion.

235
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,760
What do you mean by other methods?

236
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:19,880
My client has sustained injuries that will require two weeks of recovery time.

237
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,510
She said she was attacked with an electric taser.

238
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,920
This is a clear case of injury affliction.

239
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,400
If you do not keep that promise, she said she is willing to file criminal charges.

240
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,270
So you will agree with that condition, won't you?

241
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,390
That is all I have to tell you. Goodbye.

242
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,800
But,

243
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:46,050
what brought my wife to accept this divorce?

244
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:55,100
You were careless with her money, you committed adultery, and in the end, you were violent towards your spouse.

245
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,670
Wouldn't anyone want to divorce a spouse like that?

246
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,740
Please excuse me.

247
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,140
Two weeks to recovery? File criminal charges?

248
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,820
That's for me to say...

249
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,590
I almost choked to death when she put me in that head lock.

250
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,470
I only escaped that due to my superhuman powers. Otherwise, I would have died.

251
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,240
Ugh! Oh, I startled myself.

252
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,470
We needed an incident between us.

253
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,630
Is an incident something you encounter?

254
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,050
Or something that happens?

255
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,580
Oh, I wish I could erase my life, too.

256
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,680
I know who you are.

257
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,130
Sim Jae Gyeong.

258
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,490
I am not interested

259
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,480
in what is in there.

260
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,550
All I want is for my husband

261
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:52,230
to make an effort, for my sake.

262
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,130
I want to see that.

263
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,010
So how can I help you?

264
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,910
My husband is the detective in charge of this case.

265
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,390
I have a few memories that don't seem like they are mine.

266
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,390
If asked to make this choice again,

267
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,980
would she have made another choice?

268
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,200
If only she could choose, she has a few

269
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,920
memories that she would like to erase.

270
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,450
You are just being used, do you know that?

271
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,210
 Fine! Here is the five billion won!

272
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,730
I'll buy a cake after work today.

273
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,010
Oh, really? Thanks.

274
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,920
- What kind do you want to eat?
 - Whatever you want.

275
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,770
Your choice is always correct.

276
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,290
Alright, I'm going to work now.

277
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,230
Um,

278
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,810
what did you do in the evening, two days ago?

279
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,080
And what about last night?

280
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,080
Evenings are my personal time, and my private life is mine, too.

281
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,750
Right.

282
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,810
I'm sorry. But these are still your work hours.

283
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,190
So smile.

284
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,410
I'll be back.

285
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,570
Please don't forget the deferred wages and interest.

286
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,180
You've waited a while.

287
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,640
I'm sorry, Customer.

288
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,360
You do not meet the requirements for a loan this time.

289
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,760
So I don't think it is possible.

290
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,790
Not even with my house as collateral?

291
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,920
It's in foreclosure. Were you not aware?

292
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,680
I understand, thanks.

293
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,820
 Everything looks nice.

294
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,300
Is there anything you like?

295
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,130
 This looks expensive.

296
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,380
 It's alright, try it on. Try on everything.

297
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,860
 My Husband

298
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,400
 My Wife

299
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,040
Kevin?

300
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,060
So you did a background check on me or something?

301
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,670
I didn't feel like going to work today,

302
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,910
so I followed you on your way to work, that's all.

303
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,070
Then you must also know that this place is expensive.

304
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,770
I can afford this much.

305
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,050
So what is it that you do?

306
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,920
What do you mean?

307
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,240
This is the true me.

308
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,180
How many characters do you have?

309
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,850
A young husband with an older wife. A hyena after five billion won.

310
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,710
And Kevin working at a host bar. So which one is your main character?

311
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,030
Then what about you?

312
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:36,390
Team Leader at a restaurant. Mistress. An accomplice who is after the five billion won.

313
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,370
Which is your main character?

314
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,030
Who knows? I'm looking for that answer myself.

315
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,780
So I won't make any drunken mistakes again.

316
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,980
What if it was teamwork this time, not a mistake?

317
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,130
Does your wife know what you are doing right now?

318
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,380
She probably won't want to know. Whatever happens, I just have to wear a suit and go to work.

319
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,300
Sometimes as a model. Sometimes as a Team Leader of marketing and publicity.

320
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,930
But all that is just external.

321
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,020
My real self is a mayfly.

322
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,920
Is it because you are really laid off from your job

323
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,270
but you don't want your wife to find out?

324
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,800
Something like that?

325
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,600
So the secret is something else.

326
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,730
I am not married.

327
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,070
We are a fake married couple.

328
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:54,250
A host who makes house calls, you might say?

329
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,400
I signed a long-term contract, you see.

330
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,250
So why does she go this far?

331
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,390
For the sake of image.

332
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,970
She's surrounded by happy couples.

333
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,960
Oh, hello.

334
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,000
She doesn't want to appear as a middle-aged woman living alone.

335
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,470
She was a really successful female CEO.

336
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,470
Before her divorce, she was an ordinary housewife.

337
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,480
But after her husband's adultery, she divorced, and succeeded in business, as if to throw it in his face.

338
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,450
And she made some good real estate investments, as well.

339
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,760
But when her husband remarried to a young woman,

340
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,680
she picked an even younger husband for herself.

341
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,950
So what is the young husband doing here, like this?

342
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,700
I guess because your wife isn't paying you?

343
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:55,100
She was conned so she lost her company. And some tax evasion problems, too.

344
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,540
She hasn't paid me my wages for months.

345
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:02,350
So at this particular time, when I was thinking that my time playing husband was coming to an end

346
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,430
I hit the lottery.

347
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,670
A chance to get five billion won.

348
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,380
So I revealed everything about me. Want to join hands with me?

349
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,710
Why should I?

350
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,890
Because I think of you and me as the same type of people.

351
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,440
And you're also my type.

352
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,590
So you'll do what by joining hands with me?

353
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,960
Who knows? Let's think about that in due time.

354
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,390
Seeing how all you got was a pile of rocks,

355
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,050
I don't find you all that reliable.

356
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,920
But didn't you come here because you could get something from me that you can't from Kim Yun Cheol?

357
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,730
Maybe that's true, maybe it isn't.

358
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,360
But it looks like Kim Yun Cheol doesn't expect anything from you anymore.

359
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,830
Seeing as how he left his home but still hasn't come to you.

360
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,100
He left his home?

361
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,070
Sim Jae Gyeong.

362
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,420
Because of you, I had a well-intentioned heart

363
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,580
and didn't even have any strength to use!

364
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,630
Large batting practice bull pen.

365
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,770
It's all so cool.

366
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,910
What is it?

367
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,710
What are you doing Kim Yun Cheol?

368
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,840
No, no, no. That's not it.

369
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,650
No.

370
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,210
That's not it.

371
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,040
No, it's not.

372
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,370
You look very tired nowadays.

373
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,950
It's because I haven't slept.

374
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,510
Sunbae, is it, by chance, menopause?

375
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,820
You look like you've rapidly aged.

376
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,890
This was my face since I was in primary school.

377
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,850
Yesteday, I was very thankful and also sorry.

378
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,490
Thanks to you, Chef, I was able to recollect the memories from that day.

379
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,770
Then have all of your other memories also been restored?

380
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,850
If they are memories that are needed, I'm sure they'd come back.

381
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,780
But, why is the CEO...

382
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,010
I gave him some vacation.

383
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:59,010
Maybe he was a bit embarrassed by yesterday's confession.

384
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,540
Now, how about we do our best by ourselves today.

385
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,000
Yes!

386
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,960
Today, with joy, fighting!

387
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,210
You look relaxed.

388
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,160
Have all of your memories returned?

389
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,150
Thanks to you.

390
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,040
So it wasn't a burglar?

391
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,880
It was because I had slipped on the stairs.

392
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,130
The neighbors mistook Chef Im for a burglar.

393
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:42,800
I heard that you had something to say to Mr. Im Do Hyeon, and so you had asked him to come to your home.

394
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,130
What did you two have to talk about?

395
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:49,400
I was getting advice on the catering for my wedding anniversary.

396
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,300
It's really great that your memories have returned.

397
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,010
Then you must remember this day too.

398
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,310
Two days before Mr. Song Yu Min had died, he met you, Ms. Sim.

399
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:11,660
I remember that you said you hadn't gone when he had confessed, saying it was dangerous.

400
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,360
That your husband had gone instead to that motel. You, do remember?

401
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,820
Of course. I remember.

402
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,290
But still, I thought meeting him personally to convince him would be the most appropriate.

403
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,560
That persuasion didn't work though.

404
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,070
Not that you decided to be rid of him because the persuasion didn't work?

405
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:37,310
We had an interesting testament.

406
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,760
At that baseball field where the ransom for you was left.

407
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,030
In the bleachers near first base, wearing a black hat and sunglasses,

408
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,820
 there was a woman with a large cooler.

409
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:03,900
 For this situation around 100 police officers were called.

410
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,820
 But they

411
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,240
 seemed to have been used like props for a marriage conflict.

412
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,770
 This kidnapping was planned to take revenge

413
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,830
 on the husband who was having an affair and his mistress.

414
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:32,450
 Since it's difficult to do it yourself, you used a junior who listened to you well.

415
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,530
Now the picture has become clear.

416
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:47,490
Ms. Sim Jae Gyeong, you are the culprit.

417
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:54,870
That is your imagination, Detective.

418
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,820
If that were something I created,

419
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,640
is that a big crime?

420
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,310
What are you saying?

421
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,980
Because of you specifically, we suffered immensely.

422
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,580
As expected, you're not a slacker.

423
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:19,670
Because you took your own money, your husband's threats of extortion don't work. I know that well.

424
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:25,850
Well, it'll just be probation for impeding official duties via kidnapping.

425
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,930
But this is different. One person had died.

426
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,340
Someone who tried to protect you,

427
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,160
Song Yu Min has died.

428
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,290
Those consequences will be heavily weighed upon you.

429
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,790
Do you really think I killed that person?

430
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,430
You made him write a suicide note, I suppose.

431
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,520
Made it a suicide and requested he hide his whereabouts.

432
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,410
You had the fabricated suicide note sent to the investigation control center,

433
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,560
and you killed Song Yu Min who is no longer of any use.

434
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,310
You put all the crimes on him,

435
00:37:54,310 --> 00:38:00,000
then you, you became a damsel in distress and acted.

436
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,360
That's also from your imagination, officer.

437
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,750
Soon it will become a reality.

438
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,060
It'll be good for you to be mentally prepared.

439
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,690
You have been through a lot, but you're good at adjusting.

440
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,560
Even helping in your husband's restaurant.

441
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,950
Because I trust and believe in my husband over all else, so it's a certain thing.

442
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,980
I'll see you again.

443
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,960
An accomplice.

444
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,650
Is there someone you suspect?

445
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,660
Ah no.

446
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,080
Seonbae, I re-evaluated my views on you.

447
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,760
They say that they don't have photos of one's wife on the phone.

448
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,450
You're unexpectedly a romantic.

449
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,710
You really are going through menopause, acting differently than you used to.

450
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:26,550
I heard that if husbands change so suddenly, wives hate it. Acting affectionate after getting old.

451
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,570
Kevin cheated on you?

452
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:58,380
I let Kevin work here and even gave him an advance on his wages because I trusted you.

453
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,110
But if he cheated on you, you two are finished now.

454
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,200
So how do I get paid for my losses?

455
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:11,940
So subtract what my husband took from you as an advance.

456
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,630
Can you give the rest to me in cash?

457
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,290
This... this...

458
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,520
Wow, these things? Let me see.

459
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,870
These are all no longer trendy anymore.

460
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,640
What am I supposed to do with these?

461
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,420
Oh, really!

462
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,340
Hey, Kevin. It's been a long time.

463
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,370
Have you been well?

464
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:36,260
What are you doing today? Want to play with us?

465
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,210
That's cheating.

466
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,990
It's fun to play in a trio, isn't it?

467
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,490
Fine, let's do that.

468
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,280
You really are the best.

469
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,660
What is with you, lady?

470
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,260
Don't touch my husband.

471
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,540
What?

472
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,920
Husband?

473
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,100
Leave this place now.

474
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,110
I'm working.

475
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,340
Let's go.

476
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,380
- It's been a while, let's go inside.
 - Who is she?

477
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,050
So I finally got the money in my hands

478
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,330
but nothing much has changed.

479
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,760
And I'm not having fun.

480
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,090
You have five billion won but you're not having fun?

481
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,600
What?

482
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,220
Want to ask me to split it in half with you?

483
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,600
No. The situation has changed.

484
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,680
The police have figured out that your wife faked the whole thing.

485
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,020
Are you sure?

486
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,530
They'll probably suspect that Song Yu Min's suicide noteis fake, too.

487
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,050
That means the 5 billion won that was thought to be burned up exists in this world again.

488
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,860
So having that money is too much of a risk.

489
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,000
I don't deal with such dangerous "genres."

490
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,210
At my age, is there any reason for me to go to "school" (prison)?

491
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,220
That's true. So the money...

492
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,220
What do I do with it?

493
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,350
This isn't the time to be worried about that.

494
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,420
The bigger problem is your wife.

495
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,410
My wife said she will divorce me.

496
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,190
Do you really think she'll let you go that easily?

497
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,880
She is now the suspect of Song Yu Min's murder.

498
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,490
I thought it was weird how she handed over the money so easily.

499
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:05,120
Just imagine, I lived with someone like this, all this time.

500
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,960
There could be another possibility.

501
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:16,160
It's farfetched for a woman to throw a man holding a knife out of a window.

502
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,090
So who did it?

503
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,160
I will bet you ten cents that there is an accomplice.

504
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,590
Another accomplice?

505
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:24,130
Do you know the man who was your wife's tutor when she was in high school?

506
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,940
A tutor?

507
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,720
He was fired after a few months.

508
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,230
They even filed a restraining order against him.

509
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,990
So I investigated,

510
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,790
and he's currently operating a bar in Samseong-dong.

511
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,300
 Lee Jin Su

512
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,270
Lee Jin Su?

513
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,820
Where is Lee Jin Su?

514
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,920
He went to a province to buy some property, they said.

515
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,320
Maybe he knew that we might come?

516
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,160
Ah, I noticed that your bar's sign had been knocked over.

517
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,020
Oh, is that so?

518
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,220
What are you doing?

519
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,250
Keep watch.

520
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,710
What?

521
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,610
Oh, right.

522
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,880
Brother-in-law, he's coming.

523
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,750
Hurry, hurry.

524
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,110
The wind is harsh today, isn't it?

525
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,590
Our bar sign was fine.

526
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:45,590
Is that right? Maybe someone picked it back up?

527
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,680
Yes, I'm sure that is what happened.

528
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,600
Did you find something?

529
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,560
Here.

530
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,000
November 31. What is this?

531
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,430
Apparently, a bar that's been closed.

532
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,810
So what about that bar?

533
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,460
November 31.

534
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,920
Look here, 
  November 31

535
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,680
and here.

536
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,670
 Prepare 5 billion won.

537
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,060
 If you report, your wife will die.

538
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,960
 -N31-

539
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,870
 Fine, I will kill her.

540
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,460
 N31M

541
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,960
N... 31...

542
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,170
N31!

543
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,210
So the real accomplice...?

544
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,400
Look at this photo.

545
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:56,050
I just took this photo at that bar.

546
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:02,080
This bar he's operating now opened about five years ago.

547
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,530
So that means they met each other even after she married you.

548
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:08,270
Hold on. What does that mean?

549
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:12,020
Why would a high school tutor get fired suddenly?

550
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:17,400
Then they even filed a restraining order against him. They probably forced her to go study abroad.

551
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,560
When she returned to Korea, they probably met again, don't you think?

552
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,130
And even after she married, they continued to secretly meet—

553
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,810
Stop, stop.

554
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,920
How can she do this?

555
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,430
Do you have the right to be upset? Didn't you cheat on her, too?

556
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:40,930
I told you, there is never "Oh, no way" when it comes to married couples.

557
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:45,350
But this is a bit different, isn't it?

558
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,830
Lee Jin Su.

559
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,360
Why must you go this far?

560
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:04,800
Why? Do you want to tell me to stop?

561
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,490
I'm just trying to understand.

562
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,050
And I want to understand, too,

563
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,300
why I want to go this far.

564
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,310
Can you handle it, all the way to the end?

565
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:00,940
Quit your job right away.

566
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,710
Which job?

567
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,770
My real occupation, or my playing a married man?

568
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,090
I paid all the money you received from here in advance.

569
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,440
Where did you get the money?

570
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,420
That's not your concern.

571
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,630
Indeed, my wife is so capable.

572
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,150
But I'm going to continue my side job.

573
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,930
I should begin re-planning my life now.

574
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,520
Our contract period is ten years.

575
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,850
So in four years, you can get what you want.

576
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:34,610
But I can't be assured that you can pay me the agreed amount upon the end of the contract.

577
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:37,950
You don't have another reason?

578
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:42,960
Are you seeing another woman?

579
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,200
The contract is still valid. Keep up your duties.

580
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,620
Oh, right.

581
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,880
We were a happily married couple, right?

582
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,420
 Team Leader Jin

583
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,960
 I really want to see you.

584
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,960
So you two aren't over yet, huh?

585
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,500
Aigoo.

586
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,030
He was carrying two large bags.

587
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:13,060
Those bags probably weren't filled with his things, were they?

588
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:26,320
What's up?

589
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,870
I heard that you moved out of your home.

590
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,050
I didn't move out, I left. Who did you hear that from?

591
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:35,620
You know me. I'm alert to what you do 24 hours a day, so of course, I would know.

592
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,620
You're the same as ever.

593
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:47,480
I felt really terrible yesterday. I wanted to just give up on all this.

594
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,180
I couldn't help it, either.

595
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:55,260
But hearing that you left your home, I feel instantly better.

596
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,820
I don't know why you would feel that way because I left my home,

597
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,310
but it was because there wasn't any reason for me to remain there for even one more second.

598
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:02,950
Yes, good job.

599
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,990
Let's go to my house.

600
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,270
What about your stuff?

601
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,490
I left it at the hotel.

602
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,890
Hotel?

603
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,250
Can you just leave important things there?

604
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,190
What are you expecting?

605
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:30,640
Well, I just assumed that you didn't leave empty-handed, that's all.

606
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,430
The money. You got it, right?

607
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,940
Do you have a nose for money, too?

608
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,810
Nose for money?

609
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,880
Can I really trust you?

610
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,690
Of course. I will never betray you, Yun Cheol.

611
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:56,320
I am on your side no matter what.

612
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:18,650
I was wondering what I should do next. So for now, sure, I will trust you.

613
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,900
What a capable man.

614
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,390
But,

615
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,390
we can't spend this money right now.

616
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,530
Huh?

617
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:57,770
The police have figured out that the abduction was fake and my wife is the suspect for Song Yu Min's murder.

618
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:02,330
When everything is revealed, this money will be revealed first.

619
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,360
We can't let them take it from us like that.

620
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,160
And...

621
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,210
And?

622
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,640
Look at this.

623
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:22,500
 I will give up my husband to you.

624
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,210
 You may have him.

625
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,590
So that was why.

626
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,120
What?

627
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,890
 Sim Jae Gyeong: Want to have a cup of tea with me?

628
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:41,020
I'll wait for you at the restaurant.

629
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,340
Why would you two meet?

630
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:52,350
 CLOSED
 When one door closes, another opens. All you have to do is walk in.

631
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,140
You came just in time.

632
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,150
The cocoa I was making is done.

633
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,660
It's a bit thick. Maybe we should add ice to it?

634
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,350
Please use this.

635
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,600
It's alright.

636
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:43,750
Hurry and come.

637
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:44,920
Ah, yes.

638
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,950
This is the chef who will advise us on new products.

639
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,030
Hello. My name is Kim Yun Cheol. Please take good care of me.

640
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:55,740
His desperate efforts were engraved on his body like tattoos. With just one look,

641
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,080
you could see that he was a man who had nothing.

642
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,360
The man whom you didn't give a second look at.

643
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:08,650
I wanted to make him shine. Is that too sentimental?

644
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:12,300
So when you suggested that he work with me, was that all part of your plan, too?

645
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,810
Of course not.

646
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:16,260
Show me your sincerity, even just once.

647
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,020
What sincerity? When I need an excuse or I'm at a disadvantage,

648
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,170
then I reveal my heart to make myself feel better? That kind of sincerity?

649
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:27,500
Listen well. To me, sincerity is not a cause, but a result.

650
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,660
Why I'm doing this, or what I want. Don't be curious about that kind of sincerity.

651
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:35,630
What I'm trying to protect. Look at the result.

652
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,520
So why did you say that I can have your husband now?

653
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,640
I thought telling you that would be helpful to you.

654
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,560
Helpful?

655
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,810
Didn't it help you become more honest with yourself?

656
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:15,590
You didn't really love Kim Yun Cheol, did you?

657
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:20,880
You didn't intend to spend the rest of your life with him, did you?

658
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,700
What is it that you want to say?

659
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,470
Did you kill Song Yu Min?

660
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,360
You're the one who killed him.

661
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,390
No, I didn't do that.

662
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,610
I knew you would say that.

663
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:46,530
The one who actually did it was your other man.

664
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:49,970
Lee Jin Su, the owner of Bar SUD.

665
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:56,430
You're the one who doesn't sincerely love your husband.

666
00:58:56,430 --> 00:59:02,000
The truth is that you want to live with your first love whom you couldn't be with in high school.

667
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:08,020
Your parents aren't around to object and you have your inheritance, too.

668
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,880
You only have to get rid of your husband now.

669
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,020
But rather than leave you,

670
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:17,280
your husband planned with me to kill you. So you had to punish him.

671
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:25,230
You killed the hoobae you used like a tool and made it look like a suicide.

672
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,150
And since your husband was thoroughly punished, he left on his own.

673
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:36,200
And now you're getting ready to go to that man.

674
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,550
How did you find out about him?

675
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:41,760
People who commit adultery are all the same.

676
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,360
They are all under the delusion that no one else knows.

677
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:50,050
But their spouses are always the first to know.

678
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,750
So did you hear about this from my husband?

679
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,620
Whom else would I hear about this from?

680
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,070
I see.

681
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:07,030
Then for various reasons, I have no choice but to ask this of you.

682
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:12,350
You will have to make a new poison for me.

683
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:18,150
Increase the dosage of the adokicin, as much as you can, so that it can cause instant death.

684
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,770
How will you use it?

685
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:25,290
To kill my husband.

686
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:34,920

687
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,700
♫  Your bickering every day is wearing me out. Damn  ♫

688
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,280
♫  The game is boring. No, ummm.  ♫

689
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,120
♫  After a long night, in front of me was  ♫

690
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,260
♫  another boring scene.  ♫

691
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,610
♫  I think I have it, but then I don't  ♫

692
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,460
 My Dangerous Wife
 Preview

693
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,090
 Find whatever you can from your house.

694
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:57,630
 Proof of her adultery. You are the spouse more at fault right now.

695
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,330
 You are at a disadvantage in this divorce.

696
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,820
 My husband found out about our relationship.

697
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:02,790
 How much?

698
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:06,790
 I was scared, I thought you were my wife. What are you doing here?

699
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:09,570
 She firmly believes that I am on her side.

700
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,310
 When will he die after drinking this?

701
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,860
 When you can't avoid it, counteroffensive is the only answer.

702
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:17,210
 Is she really trying to kill me?

703
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:20,540
 For me to survive, there is no other choice.

704
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,260
♫  At last, return my side  ♫

705
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,820
♫  At last, return my side  ♫

706
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,030
♫  you’re locked inside my heart now  ♫
