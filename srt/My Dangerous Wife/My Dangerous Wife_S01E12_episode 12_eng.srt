1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:08,210

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,320
 Married Woman Abducted, Demand for 5 Billion Won in Ransom

3
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,150
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,930
You will have to make a new poison for me.

5
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,230
Increase the dosage of the Adokicin as much as you can, so that it can cause instant death.

6
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,520
How will you use it?

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,800
To kill my husband.

8
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,750
During these past six years, he crushed my pride and everything I've been protecting.

9
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,620
He even tried to kill me with poisoned wine.

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,130
He even used an electric taser on me to take the five billion won.

11
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,420
No revenge would be enough. It's best that he disappears.

12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,750
I'm not expecting you to do this and receive nothing in return.

13
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,080
I will give you the five billion won and the ownership of the restaurant.

14
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,420
You finally revealed your true face.

15
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,350
The true face of the witch behind the kind and elegant face.

16
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,760
That's a compliment, not an insult.

17
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,780
It's the first time I am seeing you act like a genuine human being.

18
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,430
And I've been looking forward to seeing your human, true face.

19
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,210
That means you will consider my proposal favorably?

20
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,380
No, of course not.

21
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,240
You're just trying to use me. I won't let you deceive me anymore.

22
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,270
Once Kim Yun Cheol dies, you will blame everything on me

23
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,270
and you will take back the five billion won and this restaurant, too.

24
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,310
Oh, what to do?

25
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,570
Be at ease. I no longer need that money.

26
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,760
I got a life insurance policy for my husband for five billion won.

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,300
Of course the beneficiary is me, his wife.

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,990
And this is a suicide note I made before.

29
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,430
I used a piece of paper that already had my husband's thumbprint on it

30
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,340
and wrote his confession of Song Yu Min's murder

31
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,280
and alluding to him committing suicide.

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,390
Leave the body disposal to me.

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,820
I guess you'll be doing that with that man, Lee Jin Su, the bar owner.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,070
In any case, once my husband dies, I will get new funds.

35
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:09,270
And Song Yu Min's murder case that the police are working on will be completely taken care of.

36
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,790
To be honest, we both

37
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,110
no longer need that man, Kim Yun Cheol,

38
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,530
anymore, do we?

39
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,470
We are now at the same level. We are both holding each other's weaknesses in our hands.

40
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,470
How about it? Isn't that a great deal?

41
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,580
Sim Jae Gyeong, you were indeed a tremendous monster.

42
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,570
You too, Jin Seon Mi.

43
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,690
Alright, let's join hands.

44
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,480
 Episode 12: The Last Supper

45
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,680
This is a fruit tart made with seasonal fruits. This is pistachio mousse. Both are your favorites.

46
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,890
Which one do you want to eat first?

47
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,180
I will quit my other job.

48
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,080
It won't be easy to do it right now, but I will, soon.

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,660
I will eat both.

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,420
Great. Let me make some black tea.

51
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,910
You know...

52
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,600
Yes?

53
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,120
The truth is, a few days ago,

54
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,100
this was in our mailbox.

55
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,180
Kim Yun Cheol's timid revenge.

56
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,870
So is this real?

57
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,530
Why, are you jealous?

58
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,310
Of course not. Why would I be?

59
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,110
Right?

60
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,930
But you don't have to worry about it.

62
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,620
I will make sure it doesn't affect my main job.

63
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,210
 You go home and find whatever you can.

64
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,020
 What do you mean?

65
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,900
 Proof of her adultery. You are the one at fault in this marriage right now.

66
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,830
 You are at a disadvantage in your divorce.

67
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:58,020
 That woman's plan is to give you the five billion won only to steal it back.

68
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,690
 Don't you think they met each other again after she returned from her study abroad?

69
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Yun Cheol?

70
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,160
I freaked out thinking you were my wife.

71
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,070
Why are you here, anyway? You cannot be here.

72
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,810
It's alright. I just spoke to Yi Rang on the phone and she said that woman is busy at the restaurant.

73
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,220
- But who knows when she might return home? Let's just leave for now.
 - Hold on.

74
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,770
I have to tell you something.

75
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,810
I found out something really important.

76
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,040
Sim Jae Gyeong's true goal.

77
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,660
 In any case, once my husband dies, I will get new funds.

78
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,490
 And Song Yu Min's murder case that the police are working on will be completely taken care of.

79
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,990
 To be honest, we both

80
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,310
 no longer need that man, Kim Yun Cheol, anymore, do we?

81
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:56,000
 We are now at the same level. We are both holding each other's weaknesses in our hands.

82
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,040
 How about it? Isn't that a great deal?

83
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,660
 Sim Jae Gyeong, you were indeed a tremendous monster.

84
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,380
 You too, Jin Seon Mi.

85
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,470
 Alright, let's join hands.

86
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:18,030
Of course, I was lying. If I really joined her side, why would I be playing this for you?

87
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,420
 Text message from Wife

88
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,580
 Let's talk before the formal divorce settlement.

89
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,040
 How about dinner at our home tomorrow?

90
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,120
"How about dinner at our home tomorrow?"

91
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:42,320
The timing, wow. Look at this woman.

92
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,670
The date on your suicide note was tomorrow.

93
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,750
Suicide note?

94
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,230
She even already wrote your suicide note.

95
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,310
When you eat dinner with her tomorrow, she's going to poison you.

96
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,040
 How about dinner at our home tomorrow?

97
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,530
I will report this to the police immediately.

98
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,650
What's the use of that?

99
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,570
Is it a crime to just say you will kill someone?

100
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,070
Then what do I do? I can't just do nothing, can I?

101
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,910
I'm sure the police will believe the guy who put poison in wine to kill his wife.

102
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,310
Did I make the Adokicin?

103
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,190
You're the one who made it!

104
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,880
That's not what I'm talking about. If you report to the police, you're caught in the act.

105
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,800
Your wife can say that she just said that out of anger, and it's over.

106
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,740
Please think.

107
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,400
So what am I supposed to do?

108
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,140
You just have to get even.

109
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,310
That woman believes I'm on her side right now.

110
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,570
This is a great opportunity for us to get vengeance against her.

111
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,730
It's best to not deal with her. Do you avoid poop because you're scared of it...

112
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,540
A disaster should not be faced,

113
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,090
it should be avoided.

114
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,070
No.

115
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,070
If it's unavoidable, counteroffensive is the only answer.

116
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,790
♫  You wouldn’t know that I’ve got you now  ♫

117
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,990
♫  In no time, you  ♫

118
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,380
♫  You dare tear all my heart apart  ♫

119
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,850
♫  You have no fear, right?  ♫

120
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,030
♫  You've been wandering in the dark, endless night  ♫

121
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,110
♫  I have put you in my hand  ♫

122
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,730
♫  You try to run away, but you can’t find a way out  ♫

123
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,350
♫  You are circling in my maze  ♫

124
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,230
 I'm not trying to protect Kim Yun Cheol.

125
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,950
 I only wanted to completely crush that woman.

126
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,060
 But after thinking about it, I've gone too far in my pursuit of that one goal.

127
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,600
 And I've taken big risks.

128
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,230
 But I don't regret anything.

129
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,190
 Life Insurance Policy

130
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,930
 Because that woman was bait beyond my imagination.

131
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,880
 Insured: Kim Yun Cheol

132
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,160
 Beneficiary: Sim Jae Gyeong
 Will receive 100%

133
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,180
 It was very satisfying to catch a big fish after a lot of hardship.

134
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,390
 I'm leading in this game board right now.

135
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,480
 I will play this game until the absolute end.

136
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,910
 And the final winner will be...  Ah!!

137
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,960
Won't you stop! Ah, really! Ah!

138
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,530
Honey, Honey, what's going on? Where have you been?

139
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,120
Just talking a walk... a walk...

140
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,300
A walk?

141
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,300
Why did you come back? Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

142
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,310
What are you doing with that? Why?

143
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,520
- This ahjumma attacked me.
 - What?

144
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,410
She hit my arm with that.

145
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,130
Did you really do that?

146
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,130
What's with you people?

147
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,810
How sincere you look, considering you are a fake married couple.

148
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,800
- Fake married couple?
 - Yeah.

149
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,940
They're not really married.

150
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,760
This ahjumma bought a husband with money.

151
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,950
She's not even your real wife. So why is she doing this, anyway?

152
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,270
What the heck did I just see?

153
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,840
She has misunderstood that you and I are seeing each other.

154
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,020
How would she know that?

155
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,910
Yes, I shared some news with her. What about it?

156
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,930
Tell this clearly to that old woman of yours.

157
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,020
To look in the mirror before getting jealous. What does she think I am? Really.

158
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,380
And you, never come near me again.

159
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,150
Hey, neighbor guy. I'll overlook this one time because we are neighbors.

160
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,960
But it's the second out at the bottom of the 9th inning. Better be careful from now on.

161
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,450
Fake married couple?

162
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,030
That must hurt. It's bruised.

163
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,950
We can't just leave that ahjumma alone.

164
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,240
It's fine.

165
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,600
Our priority is to take care of your wife.

166
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,190
So we have to make more Adokicin.

167
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,140
Adokicin...

168
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,080
Why did you do that?

169
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,420
You hired me for money, so it shouldn't matter what I do.

170
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,520
Adultery was not a term condition of the contract.

171
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,570
And there was no contract term that allowed you to punish the mistress, either.

172
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,680
You two mocked me for being a pathetic woman, didn't you?

173
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,760
It wasn't like that.

174
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,380
Our contract is over now.

175
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,000
You violated the clause requiring you to keep this a secret.

176
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,630
But I want to maintain this contract.

177
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,230
What's with that look in your eyes?

178
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,530
Don't act arrogantly as if you're looking down on me!

179
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,920
Chinese lacquer tree and its berries. Even touching it will cause skin rash, so be careful.

180
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,360
You still have this?

181
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,920
No need to share new purchase records with the police, is there?

182
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,730
♫  Your bickering every day is wearing me out. Damn  ♫

183
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,270
♫  The game is boring.  No, ummm.  ♫

184
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,130
♫  After a long night, in front of me was  ♫

185
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,640
♫  another boring scene.  ♫

186
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,430
 Finely grind the Chinese lacquer tree and its berries

187
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,900
 add solvent and ethyl cumene,

188
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,650
 and mix and stir.

189
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,130
♫  Oh, love me like you do  ♫

190
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,480
♫  We are a wall which has lost the way  ♫

191
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,290
♫  Tell me what you want now  ♫

192
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,310
♫  Tell me what you want now  ♫

193
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,170
♫  I'm sick and tired, even if it's something which will light a fire in your heart  ♫

194
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,720
 Extract the toxin which has been separated

195
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,760
 and use the Liebig condenser and heat what was distilled.

196
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,550
♫  Firmly set at orange moonlight night  ♫

197
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,650
♫  At last you return my side  ♫

198
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,500
♫  At last you return my side  ♫

199
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,750
♫  At last you return my side  ♫

200
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,920
♫  you’re locked inside my heart now  ♫

201
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,590
♫  Orange moonlight  ♫

202
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,120
♫  At last you return my side  ♫

203
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,430
♫  Gradually deepening emotion  ♫

204
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,650
 Once all the moisture evaporates, a white powder remains.

205
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,750
 And this is is Adokicin.

206
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,310
The dosage must be raised to cause immediate death.

207
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,950
 I never imagined this conclusion when I married.

208
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,640
 But this is no time to hesitate.

209
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,730
♫  At last you want me  ♫

210
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,590
 The best defense is an offense.

211
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,550
♫  At last you return my side  ♫

212
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,600
 If I don't act first, I will be the victim.

213
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
♫  return my side  ♫

214
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,870
♫  you’re locked inside my heart now  ♫

215
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,850
♫  Orange moonlight  ♫

216
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,870
♫  At last you return my side  ♫

217
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,650
Yun Cheol?

218
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,320
 Sim Jae Gyeong

219
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,040
Ah yes, hello.

220
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,360
Sorry to call you so early in the morning.

221
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,290
Ah yes, what is the matter?

222
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:31,390
You investigated Jin Su and told Yun Cheol about it, didn't you?

223
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,790
Gosh,

224
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,740
I have no idea what you're talking about.

225
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,390
Indeed, you are something, Brother-in-law.

226
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,220
Then you must also know that N31 is the name of his previous bar.

227
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,680
Then you must also know what N31 means as well?

228
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,560
Well, yes.

229
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,470
But I haven't told Yun Cheol about that yet.

230
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:08,470
How about turning over that investigation report to me?

231
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,260
I will give you ten times the amount you are thinking of.

232
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,420
Sounds good.

233
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:24,530
Then please take good care of me, Brother-in-law.

234
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,860
 Biographical Information: Lee Jin Su

235
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,740
I'm off to work.

236
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,590
What time will you come home?

237
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,910
You will return, won't you?

238
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,360
Of course, I will, this is my home.

239
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,830
Let's go watch a movie tonight.

240
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,720
 Seoul Jungam Police Station

241
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,720
This is the woman who was running away near where Song Yu Min died.

242
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,810
So you are saying that this is Sim Jae Gyeong?

243
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:14,250
These shoes are handmade and only 100 pairs were made for distribution.

244
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,340
They were only sold in a few specialty shops.

245
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,740
That's worth looking into.

246
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:27,780
These shoes will be definitely be in Sim Jae Gyeong's shoe closet.

247
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:09,060
 I'll go to meet your wife. This food is not poisoned, so relax and eat.

248
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,650
Team Leader.

249
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,590
Team Leader Jin Seon Mi, welcome.

250
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,400
Do you feel better now?

251
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,700
Yes, I'm all better now.

252
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,260
We're so glad you are back. It was a real emergency since Owner wasn't here, either.

253
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,520
Oh, you've all been doing well. You're all amazing.

254
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,310
Chef, you must have had the hardest time.

255
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,160
Your absence was felt acutely, Team Leader Jin.

256
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,760
Now that Team Leader Jin Seon Mi has returned,

257
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,140
we have no more worries, do we?

258
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,030
This is the herb tea I like.

259
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,570
When this becomes your restaurant, you can change the menu, too. Isn't that nice?

260
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,670
Oh, you won't drink it?

261
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,570
Well, I don't completely trust you yet, Madam.

262
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:31,890
Oh, you should drink it before it gets cold. You really are very suspicious.

263
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,750
What about the Adokicin with the higher dosage?

264
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,330
How long does it take before the person dies?

265
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,550
Pretty much instantly.

266
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,170
I'm going to use it for dinner tonight. There shouldn't be any problems, right?

267
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,020
How will you feed it to him?

268
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,280
I'm going to put it in curry spare ribs that he likes.

269
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,420
I will be using a very special seasoning.

270
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,100
Would he eat the food that you make for him, Madam?

271
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,180
That's true. He is very cowardly.

272
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,870
He may not eat anything, and only eat what I eat.

273
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:25,550
So I better invite you, Jin Seon Mi.

274
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,120
You'll invite me?

275
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,390
 Have a seat.

276
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:35,110
 I invited her because I wanted the three of us to eat together one last time.

277
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,420
 Thanks for the invitation.

278
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,480
 Oh, thank you.

279
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,770
 Le amour eternel?

280
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,110
 What a perfect gift for this occasion.

281
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,780
 And it's such a meaningful wine for all three of us.

282
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,570
 Should I congratulate you two in advance?

283
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,700
 Aren't you two going to have a wedding?

284
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,310
 I really want to be invited to your wedding.

285
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,540
 I will congratulate you more than anyone else.

286
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,960
 I should congratulate you first on your divorce, of course.

287
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,030
 Thank you.

288
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,650
Let's split this in half between us.

289
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,320
You and I are armed with the same weapon now.

290
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,990
And after he dies?

291
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,940
I will bury him in the mountains and tell the police that he went missing.

292
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,970
Once the police find the suicide note in which he acknowledges killing Song Yu Min, then...

293
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,040
The body will never be found and the truth will be buried in darkness.

294
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,940
And all you have to do is take the five billion won and this restaurant.

295
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,790
Alright.

296
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,960
Excuse me.

297
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,410
Can we get a list of the people who purchased these shoes?

298
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,680
If they used a credit card, we can find their names, but not if they used cash.

299
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,890
 VIP Membership

300
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,070
How many of these VIP members do you have?

301
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,150
About 300 customers are registered.

302
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,300
Can we get that list, please?

303
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,180
Well, that's a bit...

304
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,990
We really need it for our investigation. Please.

305
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,780
My husband found out about our relationship.

306
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,550
How far?

307
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,670
He knows that we've known each other for a long time, at least.

308
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:59,150
Sometimes, I dream about returning to that time.

309
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:06,030
If we never met, how would we be now?

310
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,610
 Enrollment Certification / Name: Lee Jin Su 
 Date of Birth: 1979.11.27 / Major: Law

311
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:21,860
 Jae Gyeong, greet your new tutor.

312
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,130
 He's a law student and gifted at math.

313
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,240
 You must study hard from now on.

314
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,610
I don't regret it.

315
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,260
It's not regret.

316
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,730
I just wonder if there was a different path,

317
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,900
that maybe we've come too far.

318
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,640
I believe that our choice was correct.

319
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,300
I was able to live an ordinary and safe life because I pledged to N31.

320
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,350
Yes.

321
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,390
 I'm going to make the curry spare ribs that he likes.

322
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,620
 I will be using a very special seasoning.

323
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,170
 Would he eat the food that you make for him, Madam?

324
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,180
 That's true. He is very cowardly.

325
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,570
 He may not eat anything, and only eat what I eat.

326
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:16,680
 So I better invite you, Jin Seon Mi.

327
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,980
 You'll invite me?

328
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,220
Ah, I'm going insane.

329
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,970
She thinks I'm on her side.

330
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,360
We have the advantage now that she let her guard down.

331
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,910
But how do I feed this to her?

332
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,080
She's being vigilant of me, just as I am of her.

333
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:53,080
The most effective way would be a preemptive strike.

334
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,700
A good defense.

335
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,040
Have you been well?

336
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,370
Of course.

337
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,230
I've only gone one day without seeing you,

338
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,300
but I was a bit nervous seeing you again.

339
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,880
Yeah, I'm pretty nervous, too.

340
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,980
It reminds me of our first date, too.

341
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,620
I don't remember that, actually.

342
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,440
Hold on. Don't move.

343
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,110
Spread your legs, too.

344
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,940
What are you doing?

345
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,220
Okay.

346
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,060
I don't want to be tased again.

347
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,690
Alright, my turn.

348
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,640
Inspect me.

349
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,940
It's fine.

350
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,160
Oh yeah? Then look inside my bag.

351
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,040
Check my bag.

352
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,270
Satisfied?

353
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,700
We sure are a weird couple, aren't we?

354
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:24,120
I'm sure there is no other couple who gives each other security screenings as soon as they meet up.

355
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,280
Shall we be on our way now, since we screened each other?

356
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,150
Okay.

357
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,450
Can't believe this, really...

358
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:39,140
Honey. Omo, I shouldn't call you that, it's a habit.

359
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,520
You know, anyone else would think we are an affectionate couple.

360
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,670
They would never know that we're about to divorce, right?

361
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,730
Yes, probably.

362
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,800
Do you think those people are like that, too?

363
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,750
They seem so loving on the outside.

364
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:57,840
Did you know this? They say that adulterous couples are caught most often at the supermarket.

365
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,070
Was it like that for you, too?

366
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,730
Someone might think we're an adulterous couple, too.

367
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,470
Yes, if you keep doing that, they would.

368
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,290
What should we eat today?

369
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,550
How about spare ribs as the main menu? You like the curry flavor.

370
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,180
Sounds good?

371
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,850
Curry? Yes, good, curry.

372
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,150
Then let's go buy meat.

373
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,580
Please give me two.

374
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,990
 She really is trying to kill me.

375
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,300
 So in order for me to survive, it can't be helped.

376
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,500
Thank you.

377
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,090
Let me make something, too.

378
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,200
You will?

379
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,720
Yes, it could be our last supper together.

380
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,790
And it could be the last food that I cook for you.

381
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,400
What would you like?

382
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,050
If so, then how about acqua pazza?

383
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,130
Okay.

384
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,340
Thank you.

385
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,000
 I knew you would say that.

386
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,770
 It's the food I made before, for all our celebrations.

387
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,190
Should I use scallops?

388
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,460
How about clams?

389
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,030
How about Gambas al Ajillo? Shrimp?

390
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,060
 A preemptive strike.

391
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,330
 Seon Mi should be making her moves right now.

392
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:35,890
 She will be putting the poison in the salt mill.

393
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,800
 When making acqua pazza

394
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,650
 I make sure to use that salt to enhance the flavor.

395
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,140
 So I will use acqua pazza to end you.

396
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,460
 Good.

397
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,810
 All I did was use this salt like I always do.

398
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,230
 There is no way I will get caught.

399
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm looking forward to acqua pazza so much.

400
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,540
Eat it while it's warm.

401
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,690
Thank you, I will enjoy it.

402
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,900
You should eat, too.

403
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,790
 Spare ribs.

404
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,810
It smells great.

405
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:29,910
 You won't smell it. You're probably relying on the poisoned wine that Seon Mi is bringing, your "hidden card."

406
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,830
 Regrettably, you will be finished before the wine arrives.

407
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,540
 Finished by acqua pazza.

408
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,700
 Looks like I will have one more occasion to celebrate in the future.

409
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,420
 What's wrong? Why?

410
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,550
 Honey!!

411
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,750
Today is a special day, so  L'Amour Eternel?

412
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,590
Of course, we must.

413
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,420
But white wine goes better with acqua pazza.

414
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,820
Which one should I get?

415
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,220
Why not get both?

416
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,830
Sure.

417
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,490
 Loan Payment Requests

418
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,660
 Annual bank payment...

419
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,480
That won't work.

420
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,880
I changed the lock.

421
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,330
We are now strangers, after all. We should be clear about these things.

422
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,590
You can just throw that away.

423
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:40,660
So quick and fast. Are you a Chinese restaurant?

424
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,190
 Maybe because the locks have changed, but this house feels unfamiliar now.

425
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,840
Is that so? I don't think anything particular has changed inside the house.

426
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,380
It just feels like coming home after a very long time.

427
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,760
Alright, so where do I start?

428
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,800
I'll begin making the salad and appetizer.

429
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,820
Then I'll begin making the acqua pazza right away.

430
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,890
Okay.

431
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,180
Your mother sent vegetables and side dishes to me today.

432
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,680
Oh, did she?

433
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,650
So you haven't told her yet?

434
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,400
In time.

435
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,870
The food your mother sends me is always fresh and delicious.

436
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,090
Want to taste one?

437
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,340
Taste one.

438
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:15,040
 In order to make sure she doesn't find out that I'm betraying her, I need to give her the real Adokicin.

439
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,380
 So suspect all the other food, too. Not just the spare ribs.

440
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,930
 You really can't eat anything, okay?

441
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,780
Are you sick somewhere, Yun Cheol?

442
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,440
No, I'll eat that.

443
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,230
- Why are you washing that?
 - Huh?

444
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,550
I already washed that earlier.

445
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,510
You did?

446
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,570
It tastes good?

447
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,440
Taste it.

448
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,010
It's fresh and delicious. Is it organic?

449
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,920
Isn't it?

450
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,620
What? What's wrong?

451
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:40,770
This is the salt that I use to make acqua pazza.

452
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,700
But I thought it would go well with the Gambas al Ajillo I'm making, too.

453
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,280
Can't I use some of that?

454
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,190
No, it is precious salt to me, that's why.

455
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,840
Sure, just use a little bit.

456
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,780
Thanks.

457
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,480
 That should be enough.

458
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,480
 Is that poison, too?

459
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,460
 You just have to come at 9 PM with the wine, as we planned.

460
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,650
 Don't be late.

461
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,660
 I wondered if it could be true, and it is true.

462
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,660
 She's practically dancing.

463
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,480
 So you really put the poison in the food, Sim Jae Gyeong.

464
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,450
 Having so much fun, aren't you?

465
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,110
 I'm going to die?

466
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:49,180
 No, you die. You.

467
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,140
Who could that be?

468
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,710
It's the police.

469
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,270
What will we do?

470
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,150
What do you mean?

471
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,720
Brother-in-law told me that the police are suspecting you right now.

472
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,800
But I've done nothing wrong.

473
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,810
Come in.

474
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:24,960
 Welcome.

475
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,630
 We're sorry to come by so late at night.

476
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,290
It's alright.

477
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:32,230
It smells good. You must be having dinner.

478
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,200
We're still preparing the food.

479
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,280
You haven't had dinner yet, have you? How about joining us for dinner?

480
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,000
The acqua pazza Yun Cheol makes is really amazing.

481
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,430
Isn't it?

482
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,990
It's alright, you don't have to be concerned about us.

483
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,310
But what brings you here at this hour?

484
00:45:54,310 --> 00:46:00,020
This person was running away from the site of Song Yu Min's death at the suspected time of his death.

485
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,320
She appears to be a woman, doesn't she?

486
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,520
Yes, she does appear that way.

487
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,200
Does this woman look familiar to you, by any chance?

488
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,350
No. I have no idea.

489
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,740
These shoes are rare, only about 100 pairs have been sold in Korea.

490
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,300
We confirmed that they were sold at a shop nearby.

491
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:37,300
And you were on the VIP list of that shop.

492
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,450
Right here.

493
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,110
 Sim Jae Gyeong

494
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:54,410
Excuse us, but can we look in your shoe closet?

495
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,350
As much as you want.

496
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,730
Are you finished looking?

497
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,500
I do not have shoes like that.

498
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,360
I'm  home.

499
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,910
You're very late.

500
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:06,120
Something urgent came up.

501
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,670
We're sorry to bother you at such a late hour.

502
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,790
Yes, it is quite late.

503
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,660
Ah yes, sorry.

504
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:32,780
We have a few things to ask Madam.

505
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,370
Me?

506
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:40,380
Have you seen Sim Jae Gyeong wearing these shoes?

507
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,490
Not sure. In the past, they used to say that people knew how many pairs of chopsticks their neighbors had.

508
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,490
But these days, what shoes their neighbors have in their closets,

509
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,460
how can anyone know?

510
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,050
Isn't that right, Honey?

511
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,380
Of course, I don't even know what shoes I have.

512
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,400
But these shoes are very noticable.

513
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,560
They were sold at a clothing shop nearby.

514
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,160
And your name was on the VIP list of that shop, Ha Eun Hye.

515
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,270
Right here.

516
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,690
If you will excuse us, can we look in your shoe closet?

517
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,860
Go ahead.

518
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,860
Excuse us.

519
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,260
But Honey, hasn't it been a while since you wore such high heels?

520
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,400
They hurt my ankles.

521
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,050
Yes. Thank you for your cooperation.

522
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,590
We are sorry for bothering you.

523
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,240
Yes, please don't bother this again.

524
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,120
Ah yes.

525
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,270
Ta-da.

526
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,720
Okay.

527
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,800
"Today's special cuisine."

528
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,720
"The most special food in the world made by my husband."

529
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,980
"And the best of all is acqua pazza!"

530
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,490
"To remember today with."

531
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,360
Must you upload that?

532
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,720
Of course, today is a day I really want to remember.

533
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,290
Alright, we're done.

534
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,940
 This...

535
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,920
 And this...

536
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,810
 And this... too?

537
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,410
 Are they all poisoned?

538
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:42,730
It's a bit too much for both of us, right?

539
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,100
But they all look delicious. Let's eat.

540
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,060
Thanks.

541
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,190
What shall we toast to?

542
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:00,620
You know, that...

543
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,240
Le Amour... whatever.

544
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,260
L'amour eternel.

545
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:08,720
So you really just can't memorize that, can you?

546
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,960
Eter... well.

547
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,200
- Cheers.
 - Cheers.

548
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,060
It tastes good.

549
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,920
Which one should I eat first?

550
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,690
It's good.

551
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,360
Aren't you eating?

552
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,270
I will.

553
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,580
It looks good.

554
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:19,060
 Ham. Safe.

555
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:23,210
Should we discuss our asset distribution? What should we do?

556
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:29,070
Let's talk about that after we eat all this food.

557
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,590
Do you want the spare ribs now?

558
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,320
Eat it while it's warm.

559
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,100
Thanks.

560
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,880
I'll eat some, too.

561
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:16,080
 So you're going to eat the part without any sauce on it to put me at ease?

562
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,530
You should go ahead and eat that.

563
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,210
Sure. Yeah.

564
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,410
 Should I eat the part with the salt and pepper on it?

565
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:40,170
 Safe.

566
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,240
It's really tasty.

567
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,060
You made it better than any chef would.

568
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,920
What a relief.

569
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,680
 You're annoyed that you can't kill me, aren't you?

570
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:57,090
You should have some of this while it's warm, too.

571
00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:00,650
Acqua pazza. I'm looking forward to it so much.

572
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,400
Thank you, I'll enjoy it.

573
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,630
 This time, it's my turn.

574
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,700
Smells great.

575
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,910
It will taste so good.

576
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,550
 Eat.

577
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,800
 Yes, hurry and eat it.

578
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,830
 This is how it ends.

579
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,230
 You will eat the Adokicin after all

580
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:29,090
 and 'goodbye, my wife.'

581
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,250
You know,

582
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,190
do you remember?

583
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,000
When you made this for me for the first time?

584
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,200
We drove to Byeonsan, and at the Chaeseokgang Cliff,

585
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,180
we walked and walked, not even aware that the sun was setting.

586
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,540
Don't you remember that?

587
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,290
Oh, did we do that?

588
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:51,700
We walked for a long time, and the tide came in.

589
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,110
Oh, that was so scary, I was trembling.

590
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:59,460
Yun Cheol, you took your socks and shoes off and carried me to safety on piggy back.

591
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,650
 Fine, that's nice, so eat it already.

592
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,340
We finally reached dry land, and we were both so hungry

593
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,390
that both our bellies grumbled.

594
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,480
And we had no time to go to the fish market

595
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,120
so when an ahjussi who was fishing by the sea went to the bathroom

596
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,200
you stole a fish and made this for me.

597
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,310
I think it was a rockfish?

598
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,820
 Seems like she's not eating that on purpose.

599
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,930
 Maybe she knows?

600
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,770
Ah,

601
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:25,980
at that time,

602
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,750
 Alright, stop reminiscing about the past and just eat it!

603
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:33,300
 Hurry and eat it and let's get this over with already!

604
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,720
 Eat it!!

605
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,620
What's wrong?

606
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,820
Are you all right?

607
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:01,150
I'm sorry.

608
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,360
Do you want to know the real reason I married you?

609
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,520
 She's definitely not normal.

610
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,620
I wanted simple happiness.

611
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,760
With you. But I failed.

612
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,730
 So she does know?

613
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:21,690
Looking back, it was happiness that was too good for me.

614
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:27,160
But I really don't understand how things have become so ruined between us.

615
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,370
I tried to poison you.

616
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:37,800
This curry spare ribs has Adokicin in it.

617
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,160
I hated you so much and I was so angry, so I joined hands with Jin Seon Mi

618
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,560
and planned to kill you.

619
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,270
Jin Seon Mi will come here too, in a short while.

620
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:50,000
The wine she will bring as a gift has poison in it, too.

621
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,890
Make sure to not drink it.

622
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,750
Why are you telling me now?

623
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,460
I cannot kill you.

624
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,930
How can I do that? There is no way.

625
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:13,910
I'm sorry. You once made such delicious food for me.

626
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:18,460
No, no, no!

627
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,240
Why not?

628
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,610
It's cold.

629
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,680
Let me reheat it.

630
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,800
You talked so much, so...

631
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:34,490
Thanks. But I can just eat it that way.

632
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:43,040
But aren't you angry?

633
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,740
I tried to kill you.

634
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:58,340
You just said it. But you weren't really going to do it.

635
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:03,550
If I tried to eat the poisoned spare ribs,

636
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,960
you would have stopped me, too.

637
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,200
What will you do now?

638
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,630
I'll try to explain it to her.

639
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,730
Come in.

640
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:50,630
Madam invited me. That the three of us had something to talk about.

641
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:56,340
I'm sorry. I told him all about our plan.

642
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:01,090
I couldn't go through with it.

643
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:04,230
I'm really sorry for involving you in something like this.

644
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:06,840
Seon Mi, in a way, you are also a victim.

645
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,140
We, as a couple, did truly  bad things to you.

646
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,840
It's alright.

647
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,160
Now...

648
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,660
this is how things turned out.

649
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,850
What are you two up to right now?

650
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,890
Seon Mi.

651
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,820
Jin Seon Mi.

652
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,350
Seon Mi.

653
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,130
Why... oh!

654
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,710
Seon Mi? What's wrong?

655
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,590
Seon Mi!

656
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,290
Jin Seon Mi!

657
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,120
Seon Mi!

658
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,500
Jin Seon Mi!

659
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:36,320

660
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,970
 My Dangerous Wife
 Preview

661
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:48,900
 - Yun Cheol. 
 - Did you increase the dosage?

662
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,360
 I'm asking if you raised the dosage of the Adokicin!

663
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,280
 I killed Seon Mi.

664
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,890
 Team Leader Jin didn't come to work, and she's not answering her phone.

665
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:01,120
 Those people just poisoned that woman, Jin Seon Mi.

666
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,820
 There is another enemy whom we do not know.

667
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,790
 Looks like something else is going on.

668
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:12,230
 Yun Cheol thinks he made a mistake, but it was all part of my plan.

669
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,560
 But someone found out?

670
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:19,390
♫  I don't think I've forgotten you  ♫

671
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,200
♫  After those many days  ♫
