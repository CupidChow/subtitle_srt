1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:08,110

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,500
 Married Woman Abducted, 5 Billion Won in Ransom Demanded

3
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,120
 My Dangerous Wife

4
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,740
Even if I were born again, I would marry you again.

5
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,930
I'm so happy.

6
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,200
 What does it mean to live as a married couple?

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,350
Stay here and rest.

8
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,410
 Episode 4
 Sleeping With the Enemy

9
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,910
 Four hours earlier

10
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,210
Does something like this even work?

11
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,030
- Oh?
 - Shhh.

12
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,220
Who would put a voice surveillance device here?

13
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,600
Let's leave it there as bait.

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,940
Who would do this?

15
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,880
- Perhaps... 
 - Perhaps?

16
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,970
So we're thinking the same thing right now?

17
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,790
Ah... no. That makes no sense.

18
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,170
- So who were you thinking of?
 - I wasn't thinking.

19
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,840
Do you want me to tell you whom I was thinking of?

20
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,930
- Let's go now. 
 - Go.

21
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,940
Sim Jae Gyeong?

22
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,920
So it was you?

23
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,110
 Thinking back, I did not have the confidence

24
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,520
 to face my wife's face.

25
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,380
 What my wife's expression might look like

26
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,950
 I couldn't even imagine it.

27
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,270
 I'm so happy.

28
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,380
 It was like being cut open on the operating table

29
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,840
 and just covering up the heart again.

30
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,020
Oh! I asked you to rest.

31
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,740
I'm all finished, so I was coming to get you.

32
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,110
I'm scared to be alone.

33
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,860
It's alright.

34
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,540
The wall socket was crooked

35
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,000
so I was trying to straighten it, but something was strange.

36
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,090
So I opened it, and

37
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,490
this was inside. What is this?

38
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,190
Who would put something like in there?

39
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,420
Honey, I'm scared.

40
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,540
The culprit hasn't even been caught.

41
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,490
Can we continue to live here?

42
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,610
I'm scared.

43
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,100
Don't worry. I'm here. I'll take this is to the police.

44
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,680
Thank you.

45
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,330
I only trust you.

46
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,840
Wow.

47
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,700
I'm looking forward to your cooking.

48
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,340
It's almost finished.

49
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,840
Please wait at your seat.

50
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
Yes.

51
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,330
Wow, this is amazing.

52
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,930
It looks so tasty.

53
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,350
You even have LAmour Eternel wine.

54
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,200
Honey, you really are the best.

55
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,640
Here.

56
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,950
 I wonder what would have happened if you had drunk the poisoned wine?

57
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,670
 I would have felt sorry

58
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,670
 and remembered you for the rest of my life.

59
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,710
It's delicious.

60
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,180
Putting poison in wine... How unthinkable.

61
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,640
How can the police say that?

62
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,020
Trusting such nonsense information?

63
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,690
Just makes us uneasy about our wine.

64
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,900
I know, right?

65
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,510
Do you trust me, Honey?

66
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,050
Of course, I do.

67
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,550
Why?

68
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,010
Because I want to.

69
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,750
So that means you don't actually find me trustworthy.

70
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,810
I trust you.

71
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,000
If you gave it to me,

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,910
I would drink it even if it were poison.

73
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,940
 Suspicion is spreading like poison.

74
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,330
I feel like I've been reborn.

75
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,140
I'm so grateful that you rescued me.

76
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,090
But of course I would.

77
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,520
So let's say we've both been reborn.

78
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,690
Yes. A new start.

79
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,620
 Someone once said

80
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,960
 that the purpose of hanging the wedding photo on the wall above the bed

81
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,560
 is because you want the frame to fall on your spouse's head.

82
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,640
 Groom Kim Yun Cheol

83
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,160
 and Bride Sim Jae Gyeong

84
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,350
 promise to be together for better or for worse

85
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,790
 and vow to become married in holy matrimony.

86
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,370
This isn't too awful to look at, is it?

87
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,280
Of course not.

88
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,080
That must have hurt a lot, right?

89
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,480
Even if all ten fingernails were pulled out,

90
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,010
I would have been alright

91
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,070
as long as I could return to you.

92
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,110
 Is she really the person that I knew?

93
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,490
 Do I dare to know her better?

94
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,080
Eat it before it gets cold.

95
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,320
Yes.

96
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,540
 Trust is also a matter of choice.

97
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,390
 So I chose to trust my wife.

98
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,650
For now, don't do anything and rest well.

99
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,340
I've rested enough already.

100
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,940
I should do what I need to.

101
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,070
If you have anything you need to do, you should ask me.

102
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,330
I was so scared that something bad might happen to you.

103
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,420
Thank you for your concern.

104
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm sorry for having said something unnecessary.

105
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,880
I was so worried that something would happen to you

106
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,830
so I just couldn't think.

107
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,120
Thanks to you, he and I

108
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,920
decided to begin anew.

109
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,860
I really respect both of you.

110
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,830
You've both gone through life and near-death together.

111
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,450
Oh no, you are both more impressive for always maintaining your closeness.

112
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,440
You don't know how envious I've been of you both.

113
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,520
 Trust was not a matter of choice after all.

114
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,930
 All I can do is choose to pretend to trust.

115
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,450
So did she take the bait?

116
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,170
It's not my wife.

117
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,120
I never said it was her.

118
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,880
So what can I help you with?

119
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,560
I want to know more about my wife.

120
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,400
I feel like I didn't know her very well, all this time.

121
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,480
And I want to recover our relationship, but I'm not sure how.

122
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,880
This is so interesting.

123
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,790
You're not asking me to find the culprit

124
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,230
but to do a background check on your wife?

125
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,670
Not an investigation. Just a gathering of some information.

126
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,310
There are only two types of husbands who request a background check of their wives.

127
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,590
The innocent, romantic types, who hope that what they suspect is not true,

128
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,620
and the realistic types, who hope that what they suspect is true.

129
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,750
Which one are you?

130
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,820
Let me ask again. What do you need more?

131
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,770
Recovery of your marital happiness or to have the winning "card" in your hand?

132
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,350
What if this abduction was a self-fabricated scene?

133
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,150
I'm asking, just in case.

134
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,080
What if your wife did that?

135
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,400
What if...

136
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,510
Yes, so what if she did?

137
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,690
If she did, you need to go back to the point of origin and examine it.

138
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,450
Why would she plan such a thing?

139
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,690
So at the point of origin, why would she pretend to have been abducted?

140
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,230
With people who plan things like this, what they want is usually very clear.

141
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,320
Eight out ten do it for money.

142
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,810
But Jae Gyeong doesn't need money.

143
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,220
It's not as if she is you, right?

144
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,970
That means she wants something besides money.

145
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,070
For example, "revenge."

146
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,970
Revenge.

147
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,470
Would she really plan such a terrible thing just to punish a husband for having an affair?

148
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,290
Yes, most wives don't make this much effort to get revenge on their husbands.

149
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,370
They find the situation dirty and petty, but most wives just bury it and live their lives.

150
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,730
So that means there is another motive.

151
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,020
Maybe, my wife...

152
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,570
 Seonbae is too good for you.

153
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,740
... so that college junior bastard?

154
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,010
That's right. A common housewife cannot plan something like this by herself.

155
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,860
My wife? No.

156
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,030
My wife is not someone who would do that.

157
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,010
Why? You can have an extramarital affair, but your wife can't?

158
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,520
That's not what I am saying, am I? What if...

159
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,640
I'm just wondering, what if she did...

160
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,290
Look here.

161
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,890
Yes, I too,

162
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,160
am just saying, what if?

163
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,830
I'm just telling you, be careful.

164
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,870
Don't let your wife find out everything.

165
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,670
Because she will be watching you closely.

166
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,590
My wife... would she really...?

167
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,710
Would she really have gone that far?

168
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,960
 You just don't want to believe it's true.

169
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,240
 You just can't believe it.

170
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,330
 You have to take the lead in this situation now.

171
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,140
 Yes?

172
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,510
Thank you.

173
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,620
Are you alright now?

174
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,520
What a relief.

175
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,590
We worried so much about you.

176
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,480
Exhale and round your back in the cat pose.

177
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,270
Inhale and pull in your chest...

178
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,430
 But what is it that you want?

179
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,450
 Is it to verify your wife's innocence

180
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,010
 and live happily ever after with her?

181
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,710
Move your body into a triangular position.

182
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,130
A little lower, and exhale.

183
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,310
 Seoul Jungam Police Station

184
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,800
Song Yu Min was not among the list of issued permits for the drone.

185
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,650
So would the abductor get a permit in his name to fly the drone?

186
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,690
There is no way he would be such a  model citizen.

187
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,730
I looked into the drone usage website,

188
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,450
we did get information that someone was seen flying a drone at the time of the incident.

189
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,480
We are examining the credit card transactions list to see if we can confirm the purchase of the drone.

190
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,300
We're also looking into second-hand purchases.

191
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,420
We must look more into the relationship between the victim Sim Jae Gyeong and suspect Song Yu Min.

192
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,630
For now, we've confirmed that they attended art college together.

193
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,770
So have you interacted with Song Yu Min?

194
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,130
No. He hasn't appeared in his art studio for several days.

195
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,410
So are things becoming obvious now? We are busy with other violent crimes.

196
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,030
The media has died down, too, so let's wrap this up now.

197
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,330
 Sim Jae Kyeong Case 3rd Briefing

198
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:24,740
Sim Jae Gyeong went to study abroad in her junior year in high school and returned to Korea to attend college.

199
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,090
Song Yu Min entered many art competitions while attending school,

200
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,850
and he received a lot of praise for his talents.

201
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,260
But he disappeared before completing his work for his graduation thesis, and no one knows the reason.

202
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,550
Song Yu Min's first love is Sim Jae Gyeong.

203
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,090
That is what I think.

204
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,990
So your conclusion is that this is a tragedy caused by unrequited first love?

205
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,150
But why is he dealing with his love from his past now?

206
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,000
"You abandoned me and this is all your life amounted to?" Something like that, maybe?

207
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,710
This case... I think this is just the beginning.

208
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,490

 Following: painter: Yu Min's atelier

210
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,220
 Should I wipe it like this?

211
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,900
 It's good to hide what you want to,

212
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,950
 And clearly reveal what the other person wants.

213
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,020
 If the wiretapping device has been removed, it means that no further information is needed,

214
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,300
 Or it means that they want to block out all the sound heard from this place.

215
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,330
 That guy will hear it.  I'm sure it will be passed on to my wife.

216
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,450
 I decide what will be done in the future.

217
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,830
 This is your phone and listening devices.

218
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,510
I don't need it anymore, so throw it out.

219
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,770
Yes, what do you need?

220
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,350
We are from Jungam Police Station. We contacted you earlier.

221
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,480
What? Jungam Police Station?

222
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,580
There's already someone here, but more of you came.

223
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,190
You said you are from Jungam Police Station?

224
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,090
Who is he?

225
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,030
Wow, we meet here of all places, Lieutenant Seo.

226
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,990
Greet him.  This is violent crimes division legend, Sunbaenim No Chang Beom.

227
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,160
He was probably forced to retire due to accepting bribes.

228
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,720
It was all thanks to the information from a hoobae (junior) whom I raised well.

229
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,950
What did you hope to find by coming all the way here?

230
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,220
I guess your pawn shop isn't very busy, so you are out personally investigating.

231
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,250
It can't be helped when you are a sole proprietor like I am.

232
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,530
I have to do all the work on my own to make a living.

233
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,960
Did you find anything?

234
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,300
They picked the location because they figured out that the security cameras were broken.

235
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,930
That means they're extremely meticulous.

236
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,070
Has this icebox been found?

237
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,980
We couldn't find it anywhere.

238
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,710
So they messed around with a drone to distract you, then they took the money.

239
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,900
Why are you so overly interested?

240
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,030
It's a family matter for me, isn't it? And let's not forget our past friendship.

241
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,910
Hey, this isn't Jin Seon Mi, right?

242
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:46,180
Yes.  The sunglasses and hat look the same, but the clothes are different.

243
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,610
Someone must feel really frustrated.

244
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,590
How could you not call me even once?

245
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,230
- Let's talk about it later.
 - Do we even have a later?

246
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,990
Were you really going to die because of that woman?

247
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,750
If I had died back then, would I have been at peace?

248
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,530
You know something, don't you?

249
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,740
There's only one person who would do something like this.

250
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,550
The one who got rid of our photo and the adokicin (poison) is definitely her,

251
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,910
to take revenge on us.

252
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,370
There's no evidence that my wife installed it.

253
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,280
Wait a minute.  So what are you saying?

254
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,120
Are you saying that you feel reassured or disappointed?

255
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,530
Tell me.  Which truth do you want?

256
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,100
What we need right now is not facts.

257
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,580
The question is whether we survive or not.

258
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,560
Let's just say that my wife did everything.  Then what does that change?

259
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,920
No, it changes.

260
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,260
Your choice would become clear.

261
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:18,430
It can't be... that you actually like the role of a husband who saved his wife.

262
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,020
Are you pushing me away?

263
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,930
What do you think about taking a break for the time being?

264
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,500
Why should I?  Did I even do something wrong?

265
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,170
Sorry, I'm late for work.

266
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,260
At the very least, I have a clearer conscience than you and your wife.

267
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,400
Hey, don't you think our store is going to be really successful?

268
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,650
Our boss is the second coming of Jeon Seong Gi?

269
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,910
It's fortunate that the boss' wife returned safely.

270
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,000
Is it really fortunate?

271
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,420
- Boss, you're here.
 - Yes, you were all worried, weren't you?

272
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,270
Until the fake news dies down,

273
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,630
I told Team Leader Jin to rest for the time being.  Don't worry too much.

274
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,520
I'm fine, though.

275
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,170
It will be more suspicious if I'm not around.

276
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,800
But you should rest for a few days-

277
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,590
What are you all doing?  Aren't you going to work?

278
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,280
Yes.

279
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,910
Boss!

280
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,920
Yes.

281
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,490
Boss, you need to come quickly.

282
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,370
What is it now?

283
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,280
Please bring me another one.

284
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,270
Please bring me another one.

285
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,470
Please bring me another one.

286
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,200
Ma'am, we've already given you several plates.

287
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,070
What should I do?  For some reason, the pasta smells weird.

288
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,940
What kind of smell?

289
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,500
The noodles are so shameless, you see.

290
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,820
Should I say that they have no morals?

291
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,220
I don't eat food if it's not kind.

292
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,800
I'll bring you another one.  A pasta that is very moral and kind.

293
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,140
Excuse me.  Would it be possible to order a raw egg for dessert?

294
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,000
I'll treat you to one.

295
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,700
Why don't you add another raw egg?

296
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,170
I don't think it's a gift that I should receive by myself.

297
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,530
Oh gosh!

298
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,170
You should manage your employees properly.

299
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,370
I'm leaving since the raw egg would be a waste.

300
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,820
Fine, I'll get lost.

301
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,130
Please enjoy your food.  I'm sorry.

302
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,870
That table needs to be cleared.

303
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,620
I think it will be best for you to leave using the back door.

304
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,730
Why? Did the owner's wife come here or something this time?

305
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,230
What brings you here, Honey?

306
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,490
Were you surprised?

307
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,770
I'm so glad you came.

308
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,910
I was leaving work early, so we were short-handed, Madam.

309
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,830
Yes,

310
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,070
don't worry about the restaurant and please go home and rest.

311
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,360
Thank you.

312
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,930
We have more customers thanks to you.

313
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,390
I would really like it if you rested comfortably

314
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,490
and recharged yourself.

315
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,360
I want to help you in any way I can.

316
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,710
You spent such a large amount of money because of me

317
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,190
and you were having financial difficulties already.

318
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,040
No, I'm alright. And that money?

319
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,300
I don't regret using it at all.

320
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,650
Thank you.

321
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,360
Can't I just work here?

322
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,530
The truth is, it's a bit frightening to be at home alone.

323
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:02,460
And you did ask me before if I wanted to work with you.

324
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,320
Well, if you're here, people will

325
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,370
make you uncomfortable, and—

326
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,870
I'm alright. Thank you.

327
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,410
It's busy, isn't it? Let me pitch in.

328
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,510
No, it's alright.

329
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,450
You were released from the hospital recently.

330
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,690
Please go home to rest.

331
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,190
No,

332
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,790
I know all of you worried so much about me.

333
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,490
I want to help you in any way I can.

334
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,200
Excuse me.

335
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,710
 Jin Seon Mi

336
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,700
 Jin Seon Mi

337
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,800
Thanks to Madam, we have more customers.

338
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,620
No, it's thanks to you, isn't it?

339
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,480
Here is the coffee.

340
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,600
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

341
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,470
The coffee drip machine is still running, so please have more.

342
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,390
- Thank you.
 - Weren't you uncomfortable when the customers kept taking pictures of you?

343
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,470
Yes, you should have stopped them.

344
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,810
Yea, why did they do that?

345
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,260
Wow, he really isn't coming.

346
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,120
You would think that by this time, Song Yu Min would come out at least once.

347
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,960
It wouldn't do to just run with the money.

348
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,530
No.

349
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,400
To an unknown artist, money is more important than love.

350
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,530
Here, stop, stop, stop.

351
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,310
Rewind that.

352
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,920
What is that?

353
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,190
Try contacting her.

354
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,610
Let's see...

355
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,900
You help out every time.

356
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,450
You two really are "neighbor cousins" (close neighbors).

357
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,110
Yes, much better than distant relatives.

358
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:33,190
Well, we will only be at ease when the culprit is caught, after all.

359
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,730
Oh right, your husband looks so much younger than you are.

360
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,160
I first thought that he was your son—

361
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,020
I meant, you two look so good together.

362
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,460
It's not that he looks very young,

363
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,580
he is very young.

364
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,010
Ah, yes.

365
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,990
I copied the files.

366
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,500
  2020 - 07- 08 (Thu)  10:03:03

367
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,030
So this is fun.

368
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,100
  2020 - 07- 08 (Thu)  10:28:47

369
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,960
What brings you here?

370
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,150
There are some things we need to confirm.

371
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,030
Your wife may become uncomfortable.

372
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,600
Then please come this way.

373
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,710
Go home first and wait.

374
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,080
So your wife will now help out at the restaurant?

375
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,470
Yes, it's what she wanted.

376
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,950
So how should we interpret this?

377
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,750
I was worried about her

378
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,210
so I did spy on her for a bit.

379
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,690
It's not because you didn't trust her?

380
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:15,200
We are looking for the person who took the five billion won from the trash can at the baseball stadium.

381
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,810
I assume that person is the accomplice of Song Yu Min.

382
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,520
Does your wife own clothes that look like this?

383
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,230
Are you suspecting my wife?

384
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,440
Sorry to visit you so late.

385
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,410
When did my wife speak to you about my affair?

386
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,390
I was curious to know how long she knew about it.

387
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,790
It was about a month ago.

388
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,330
 A month ago.

389
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,770
 When did Auntie leave this with you?

390
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,570
 Mmm, it was around my birthday,

391
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,100
 so two months ago?

392
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,310
 Has she been meticulously planning this?

393
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,000
She loved you a lot.

394
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,110
Ah, yes.

395
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,180
Your wife loved you a lot, I just told you.

396
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,570
Huh?

397
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,850
She knew that you were having an affair with another woman,

398
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,520
but she couldn't let you know she knew.

399
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,580
That is how much she loved you.

400
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,510
That shows how much she wanted to stay with you.

401
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,580
Husbands never know what their wives go through.

402
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,800
She's probably worried about you right now

403
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,180
and is waiting for you.

404
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,150
But why do wives endure all that?

405
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,490
Because he is her husband.

406
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,080
You shouldn't try too hard.

407
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,230
I'm sorry?

408
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,470
I know too since I've tried as well.

409
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,000
The first sign is when the husband begins to come home late.

410
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,250
If you put too much effort, is that really a family?

411
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,100
If not, you should break up.

412
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,380
Divorce isn't hard to do in this day and age.

413
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,980
Is divorce really the answer?

414
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,600
I liked divorce better than marriage.

415
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,280
Getting remarried was better.

416
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,020
You can't fix people

417
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,190
I recommend a "new model."

418
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,000
I still like marriage more.

419
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,400
Isn't it that you like being married more than your husband?

420
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,460
Let's be honest.

421
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,960
If there aren't any sparks left, just throw it out.

422
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,390
Throwing away what is old and useless isn't just for things.

423
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,280
Throwing it out isn't always the answer.

424
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,250
True minimalism

425
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,130
True minimalism is to keep what is truly necessary.

426
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,180
So you need your husband?

427
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,030
 My Husband

428
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,190
 My Wife

429
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:52,180
 Husband Kim Yun Cheol and Wife Sim Jae Gyeong had a dramatic reunion.

430
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,900
It would've been better if she hadn't returned.

431
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,880
Huh?

432
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,510
Who is it?

433
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,180
That woman.

434
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,090
I

435
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,850
saw that woman.

436
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,430
 The story we reported about the love between the heiress of a wealthy family

437
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:32,760
and the "dragon from a stream" chef has gained lots of interest.
 (T/N: someone who achieves a lot despite humble origins.)

438
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,370
 We look forward to what this couple will do next after earning the interest of the entire nation.

439
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,580
 Seeing the children work so hard is touching, isn't it?

440
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,980
 No,

441
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,770
 my husband is.

442
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:40,640
I guess she didn't want to throw out her husband yet.

443
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,960
Honey, I'm home.

444
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,400
Okay, I'll be out soon.

445
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,700
To be honest, there are quite a few things that are weird about this case.

446
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,270
We received a tip that you put poison in the wine,

447
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,500
but the results came out saying there was no poison in the wine.

448
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:02,030
why did you throw away the wine?

449
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,390
Wasn't it because you didn't know if there was poison in it?

450
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,980
I told you I don't know anything about poison.

451
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,240
Then, why were you so happy at the hospital?

452
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,030
Like this?

453
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,740
Yes, to be honest, I was relieved.

454
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,850
Because there was one less thing that could cause a misunderstanding.

455
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,290
I think it's too early for you to feel relieved.

456
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:33,630
If the poisoned wine still exists somewhere,

457
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,760
that means someone interfered and took it.

458
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,210
In conclusion, it's one of the two.

459
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,580
The poison or the wine bottle

460
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,120
is in Kim Yun Cheol's hands,

461
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,910
or the person who is trying to frame you has it.

462
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,770
Are you

463
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,540
talking about my wife?

464
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,560
Why do you think that?

465
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,560
Because it feels like that's what you're thinking.

466
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,310
I have never thought that.

467
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,520
What about your thoughts?

468
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,550
My wife isn't that kind of person.

469
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,380
 Dear Yun Cheol...

470
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,400
 Till death do us part, forever.

471
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,580
Did you really leave this letter like your last will and testament?

472
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,620
You never know what will happen.

473
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,050
Give it to me so I can hide it again.

474
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,010
What else are you hiding?

475
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,560
What does that mean?

476
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,160
Somehow, I feel like you are hiding other keys,

477
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,690
a wife who is full of unexpected twists.

478
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,810
I'll bet a wife who doesn't have any twists doesn't exist.

479
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,450
But isn't everyone like that?

480
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,940
They aren't really interested in knowing their wives,

481
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,040
or they pretend to not know.

482
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,090
Which side do you think I'm on?

483
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,040
Which side do you want to be?

484
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,910
Let's see.

485
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,080
Which side am I on?

486
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,750
I am the type that wants to know more.

487
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,130
It's been a while, hasn't it?

488
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,670
I'm sorry.

489
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,960
I've made you too lonely these days, haven't I?

490
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,380
I trusted you.

491
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:11,460
Let's start over slowly.

492
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,170
All I need is you.

493
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,870
Is there really a need to start over slowly?

494
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,470
What are you doing?

495
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,290
Looks like my wife

496
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:55,810
has also been drinking alone.

497
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,970
Don't you think you're coming home too late these days?

498
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,880
Then my work hours will begin now.

499
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,960
Where did you drink so much?

500
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,790
As you know, my job doesn't have regular work hours.

501
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,660
I'm a bit anxious.

502
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,960
And the company I work at doesn't feel secure to me  lately.

503
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,950
Your wages won't be paid late, so don't worry.

504
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,000
Honey.

505
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,270
Don't worry too much. We're a couple.

506
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:43,600
Yes. We're a happy couple too, right?

507
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
Of course.

508
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:53,230
If you look from that house, we look like a happy couple too.

509
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:29,750
 If someone hid the conclusive evidence of the poisoned wine,

510
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,480
 that means they have another message.

511
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,610
This case is still ongoing and that means the culprit is watching.

512
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,410
At first, we suspected Jin Seon Mi.

513
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:44,720
But... the alibi doesn't work out.

514
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,860
And we can't find a connection between Song Yu Min and Jin Seon Mi.

515
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,080
A person who wants to hide the poisoned wine.

516
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:56,040
We need to find that person.

517
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:24,560
Are you looking for this by any chance?

518
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,250
What's wrong? You're making such a scary face.

519
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:40,610
Did you want to drink the wine we couldn't drink that night?

520
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,920
You should've trusted me.

521
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,320
Why do you keep going down the difficult path?

522
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,980
So, it was you, after all?

523
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,680
Why did you do all this?

524
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,310
I— To take revenge on me for cheating on you?

525
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:22,170
I wanted you to be in pain.

526
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,970
I bet you were laughing while fooling me.

527
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,970
You laughed too!

528
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,590
What?

529
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,970
This was the only way to forgive you for that laugh.

530
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,860
What are you saying right now? Are you in your right mind?

531
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,890
Forgiveness? How am I supposed to forgive you?

532
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,930
You're supposed to forgive me?

533
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,640
I'm calling the police.

534
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,430
- I'll call them first. 
- You really!

535
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,750
Do you know how anxious I felt while watching you?

536
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,290
That you would make a mistake.

537
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,110
Must have been nice.

538
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:12,090
Watching me run all over the place carrying your ransom money.

539
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:15,790
And everything turned out the way you wanted, so you must be so happy.

540
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,970
You did something crazy.

541
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,190
Adokicin.

542
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:36,480
You also know what's in here, don't you?

543
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,760
No, I don't. The wine bottle that the police took as evidence was clean.

544
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,810
Why do you think they didn't find poison in the wine?

545
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:48,190
Weren't you also curious about that?

546
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,830
 Jae Gyeong!

547
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,730
I saved you.

548
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,950
You're a husband who is very high maintenance.

549
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,830
You can't do anything without me.

550
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:34,370
If I give this to the police, it's over for you.

551
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,560
For attempted murder.

552
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,050
 A wife with a twist? No such person exists.

Why do you think I would carry around such an important piece of evidence?

564
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,110
I just brought that so we could celebrate.

565
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:30,450
I hid the real wine with the poison somewhere else.

566
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,170
If you shut your mouth, I'll do the same.

567

Let's keep each other's secrets.

Don't you think we'll get closer?

You fooled the entire nation, does that make sense?

570
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:54,010
If I say it doesn't, will you believe it?

571
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,540
It'll be easier for you if you do.
