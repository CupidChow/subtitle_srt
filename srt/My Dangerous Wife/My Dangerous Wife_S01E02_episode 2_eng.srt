1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:13,090

2
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,090
 My Dangerous Wife

3
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,360
You tell me.

4
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,600
What did you do with my wife?

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,410
I'm looking for Seonbae, too.

6
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,310
Seonbae?

7
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,970
 A Month Before the Incident

8
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,250
Seonbae?

9
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,610
Song Yu Min?

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,790
That was a month ago.

11
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,600
And after that, a few times...

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,770
You even came to our home?

13
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,660
You dare to smile after abducting someone?

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,800
Does everyone look like trash just because you are trash?

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,050
Seonbae knew everything.

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,080
She even knew who you were having an affair with.

17
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,590
 Episode 2: The Wife I Want to Save Again

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,000
At first, it was a huge shock.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,380
But I think I bear some responsibility as well.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,900
It's likely my husband may have felt frustrated.

21
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,950
A woman who fools around with a married man, isn't it obvious?

22
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,570
I'm sure she had a purpose.

23
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,430
 Did your wife say she will give you the money?

24
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,720
What did you do last night? In front of our home?

25
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,870
I followed you.

26
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,530
So why did you do that? To frame me?

27
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,950
You must also have a purpose when approaching a married woman, don't you?

28
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,820
Maybe my naive wife will fall for it easily, but I won't. I'm not easily fooled.

29
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,020
I just monitored you because I was worried about Seonbae. Because you're more suspicious than I am.

30
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,090
And you exceeded my expectations.

31
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,470
How can you meet with your mistress again after your wife went missing?

32
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,250
When you don't even know if your wife is alive or dead?

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,970
What did you do after meeting your lover?

34
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,770
Maybe you two discussed how to rescue your wife?

35
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,610
You are trash among trash.

36
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,890
Even now, you're only thinking about how you're going to survive!

37
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,020
You are the one who killed your wife.

38
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,320
Seonbae said her life didn't feel like living.

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,940
So you are the real culprit.

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,380
Stop making up stories, you bastard.

41
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,270
After listening to my wife's worries, you realized that this was a good chance for you.

42
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,680
Get the money you need and a perfect opportunity to frame me for it, right?

43
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,560
Just remember this one thing.

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,880
Seonbae was too good for someone like you.

45
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,030
Oh, and when I followed you that day...

46
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,370
it wasn't just me.

47
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,700
 Reporters chasing Kim Yun Cheol as he runs away

48
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,320
He must have run away because he's hiding something.

49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,390
- He still won't answer our calls?
 - It's been turned off.

50
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,930
Mr. Kim Yun Cheol. 
    Reporters chasing after the fleeing Kim Yun Cheol.

51
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,420
What are you up to right now? 
   Reporters chasing after the fleeing Kim Yun Cheol.

52
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,700
Please do it quickly and leave.

53
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,020
Yes.

54
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,200
Where is Kim Yun Cheol?

55
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,610
He didn't go to his parents' home and he's not at his restaurant.

56
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,080
I'm sure he will come crawling back. Whether it's the bank account or inheritance,

57
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,930
he has to protect his spot in this house in order to get that money.

58
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,470
Maybe he ran away with his mistress?

59
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,630
Hello.

60
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,770
- Hello.
 - Yes, hello.

61
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,410
Is the owner here, by any chance?

62
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,020
He didn't come to work here?

63
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,810
You've worked hard.

64
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,020
Go home safely.

65
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,440
- Yes.
 - Everyone get home safely.
 - Yes.

66
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,220
Good night.

67
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,840
- I'm sure they know something. 
 - Did you find anything?

68
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,460
How can you come here? What if someone sees?

69
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,370
Will we be okay?

70
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,650
Of course.

71
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,190
If things with your wife go as planned.

72
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,970
As planned?

73
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,950
Seon Mi.

74
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,570
Why did you follow me?

75
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,620
What do you mean?

76
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,020
I was worried about you.

77
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,990
You were worried I wouldn't take care of it properly?

78
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,340
I trusted you.

79
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,630
But who knew things would get so twisted?

80
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,390
Can you actually smile right now?

81
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,260
I'm about to become the culprit.

82
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,110
Calm down.

83
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,610
Darling, that is not what is important right now.

84
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,570
Do we embezzle the 5 billion won or do you get it as your inheritance? That is what is important.

85
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,710
Do you want me to explain it to you again?

86
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,230
If she returns alive, you will inherit nothing.

87
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,110
So we need to make a plan to get the 5 billion won into our hands.

88
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,430
What if...

89
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,220
what if

90
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,180
she is already dead?

91
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,310
Well, if she would do that for us,

92
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,990
then the 5 billion won we don't give as ransom comes into our embrace.

93
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,670
You and I should just prepare to act very sad.

94
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,670
But why did the abductor request exactly 5 billion won?

95
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,320
It's the exact amount that I need.

96
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,300
Maybe the culprit is the loan shark?

97
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,110
Since your wife won't hand over the money,

98
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,310
maybe he intends to get it from her directly.

99
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,040
That makes sense, doesn't it?

100
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,750
Of those who know that I need 5 billion won,

101
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,800
aside from me and the creditor,

102
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,500
there is one more.

103
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,280
So let's say I kidnapped your wife.

104
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,390
Then why would I give you that poison?

105
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,850
Because you needed a sacrificial lamb to accuse me of the crime

106
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,060
and take all of the 5 billion won for yourself.

107
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,860
Why is that smart brain of yours only kicking in now?

108
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,080
This late timing is regrettable.

109
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,580
You tell me honestly.

110
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,810
What's with you?

111
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,850
Do you suddenly want to become a good husband?

112
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,690
It's useless.

113
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,020
It's already too late.

114
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,080
Someone thankfully solved this problem for you already.

115
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,420
And we are accomplices now.

116
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,180
You can't escape now.

117
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,390
If I were her, I would want to die

118
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,860
because I would be so embarrassed to be your wife.

119
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
 July 4

120
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,960
 Wife

121
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,940
 The recipient's phone is turned off, so you will be connected to voice mail...

122
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,240
 ... at the sound of the beep...

123
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,290
 Due to the default on your loan, it will be transferred to a debt collector on July 10th.

124
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,370
 It's a good opportunity to just steal the 5 billion won.

125
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,560
 Do you really want your wife to return alive? After giving 5 billion won to the abductor?

126
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,080
 I'm being framed as the culprit so I have to find out who he is first.

127
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,720
 No, taking the 5 billion won comes first.

128
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,440
 Think only about your original goal. You need money.

129
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,350
 Isn't that you?

130
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,920
 Yes, I need money.

131
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,430
 So you better do what I say

132
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,000
 or you will become the one who put poison in the wine by yourself.

133
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,670
 Whether my wife was abducted or drank the wine that night,

134
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,340
 I've unavoidably become the suspect.

135
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,420
 Noona

136
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,030
What? What now?

137
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,560
Uncle, it's me, Chae Rim.

138
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,340
Auntie had left something with me.

139
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,560
Kim Yun Cheol appeared at his family's home.

140
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,500
This... look, Mom.
  Kim's Kitchen

141
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,880
- This boy... oh! I cannot believe you!
 - Hey, why are you doing that?

142
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,780
- Mom.
 - You crazy boy. 
 - What's the matter with you?

143
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,450
- This crazy boy!
 - Why are you doing this?

144
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,500
You've lost your mind. I should never have fed you chicken wings.

145
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:02,100
Mom, leave him to me. It hurts you. You come here.

146
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,810
Oh, really! You...

147
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,970
I cannot believe you! Seriously!

148
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,660
- Hold on, hold on.
 - You come here.

149
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,190
- Today... 
 - Are you nuts?

150
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,730
You actually cheated on your wife?

151
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,780
- Really.
 - This is not the time to be doing this.

152
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes, that's true, we don't even know if she's alive or dead.

153
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,380
So how is that going?

154
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,290
I don't know either.

155
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,760
Oh, really, we are so worried about you.

156
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,300
Mom saw the news and she cannot do anything anymore.

157
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,860
Oh, what to do?

158
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,860
Goodness, there is no one like Sister-in-law in this world.

159
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,120
What do you mean by that?

160
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,750
- A few months ago, Mom got sick from enteritis 
 - Please drink this.

161
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,660
and Sister-in-law came every day to take care of Mom.

162
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,850
Your chicken is ready. You waited a long time, didn't you?

163
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,580
She did housework and even helped out at the restaurant, too.

164
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,790
She even took care of Chae Rim.

165
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,750
And she only spoke about you.

166
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,490
That you're having a tough time with your business, but you will solve the problem because you are so diligent and sincere.

167
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,360
She trusted in you so much and praised you so much.

168
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,430
So we thought that you married so well.

169
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,750
Jae Gyeong said that?

170
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,040
That's not all.

171
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,130
 Mr. Engineer, can you remove this gas range? We will move it.

172
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,400
 How long will it take?

173
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,190
 Please put it here.

174
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,680
Other restaurants are all closing because of the skyrocketing rent.

175
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,970
Why did you think we were able to last?

176
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:53,240
We found out later that Sister-in-law met with our landlord and solved the problem for us.

177
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,720
Were you even curious about how we were living?

178
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,120
You only come to see us once in a while, as if you don't have a choice.

179
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,290
Compared to you, your wife felt more like family to us.

180
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,050
 ♪ Happy birthday to you.

181
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,930
 ♪ To our beloved Chae Rim.

182
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:23,160
 ♪ Happy birthday to you.

183
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,670
 You should make a wish.

184
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,860
 - I wish I had a younger sibling.
 - Hey.

185
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,960
 How can I make a younger sibling for you?

186
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,550
 You must be dreaming, Mom. You are too old.

187
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,760
 So Auntie, you can make a younger sibling for me?

188
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,880
 Omo.

189
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,480
 I'll make an effort.

190
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,160
 You're adorable!

191
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,260
Aiyoo, if you were my husband, I would have killed you with my own hands.

192
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,290
It wouldn't be enough if you carried your wife on your back every day. But you cheated on her?

193
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,050
Aigoo, Sister-in-law, you have to be alive, please.

194
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,470
Even if she returns alive, if she finds out you cheated on her...

195
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:21,930
You better find her, even by staking your life on it. That's the only way you can make up what you did to her, even just a little.

196
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,790
I want to find her, too.

197
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,300
I want to find her.

198
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,280
Aigoo, aigoo, I'm about to go crazy.

199
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,380
Uncle.

200
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,090
The truth is

201
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,290
I wished that you and Auntie were my parents.

202
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:12,180
That you left me here because there was a situation that you couldn't tell me about.

203
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,690
What I mean is, that is how much

204
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,670
I liked Auntie.

205
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,530
Ah... oh...

206
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,290
Is this it?

207
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,920
Auntie said, just in case,

208
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,470
if she died before you did, to give this to you.

209
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,830
To give this to me if she died before me?

210
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,070
Auntie and I made a promise.

211
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:56,380
I believe she's alive, but I still thought I should give this to you.

212
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,110
Thank you, Chae Rim.

213
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,170
- Uncle.
 - Yes?

214
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,990
Auntie isn't dead, is she?

215
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,300
She's alive, isn't she?

216
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,850
Of course, she is alive.

217
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,990
It's alright, don't worry.

218
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,870
It's alright.

219
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,240
Auntie is alive, I'm sure.

220

227
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,760
 I'm writing this letter which I cannot send.

228
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,990
 - Aigoo.
 - How do you like it?

229
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,660
 - It feels nice.
 - Isn't it comfortable?

230
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,540
 I think the fabric one was better.

231
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,670
 Hoping that you will know my heart someday,

232
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,130
 all the things you could have accomplished with your abilities,

233
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,880
 I began to feel that

234
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,540
 the things I had were interfering with what you could have achieved.

235

236
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,110
I love you.

237
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,500
I'm sorry I couldn't get you a fancier one.

238
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,340
I really do not want anything else.

239
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,980
Just promise me one thing.

240
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,410
Yes, anything.

241
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,240
 Until death do us part, forever

242
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,640
"Until death do us part, forever."

243
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,450
I love you.

244
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,080
Me too.

245
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,980
 Until death do us part, forever

246
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,340
 I trust you.

247
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,630
What I'm leaving behind here is not an inheritance

248
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,680
 but my faith in you.

249
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,220
 I love you.

250
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,600
 Shall we put our seal on this? Using the wine?

251
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,360
This wine, "L'amour éternel" means "eternal love."

252
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,520
I think this is the wine used for proposing.

253
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,580
Let us take our vows, too.

254
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,460
I'll go first.

255
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,750
I will vow, too.

256
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,540
Until death do us part...

257
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,030
Forever.

258
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,850
- I love you.
 - I love you.

259
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,390
 Can you promise me?

260
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,850
 That until death do us part?

except for those of Sim Jae Gyeong and Kim Yun Cheol.

266
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,010
Yes, the fingerprints that don't need to be erased.

267
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,700
- It's probably one person?
 - So let's ask that one person

268
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,990
where the other person went.

269
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,320
Hello?

270
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,970
Yes.

271
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,550
What?

272
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,110
Are you certain?

273
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,760
I understand.

274
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,210
- Let's go arrest Kim Yun Cheol.
 - What?

275
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,440
Wait.  Look, you should at least tell me the reason.

276
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,570
Where is the detective?

277
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,060
Why must I be arrested?

278
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,990
Mr. Kim Yun Cheol, the blood found in your car's trunk

279
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,230
was confirmed to be Sim Jae Gyeong's blood. Put him in the car.

280
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,730
No, no, something is wrong. Wait.

281
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,560
I have to find Jae Gyeong!

282
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,450
I have a delivery.

283
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,120
It's addressed to Kim Yun Cheol.

284
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,220

 I'm sure that my wife is alive.

289
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,260
 So that my wife can be found, any information, no matter how trivial,

290
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,000
 I request everyone, please.

291
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,310
 - What did they demand in exchange for releasing your wife?
 - How is the police investigation going?

292
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,640
It's a video that was filmed today.

293
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,210
Yes.

294
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,870
She's alive.

295
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,860
She's alive.

296
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,200
My wife is alive.

297
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,680
How can they do that to someone?

298
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,240
 Prepare 5 billion

299
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,970
 Prepare 5 billion won in cash with non-sequential bill numbers. Put the money in a black sack

300
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,930
and bring it alone to Starlight Wedding Hall tomorrow at 10 AM.

301
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,980
If we see the police, our deal is over immediately. Your wife will die.

302
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,430
We only have 13 hours left.

303
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,020
It's not possible to prepare 5 billion won in cash with non-sequential bill numbers.

304
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,820
 I'm sure that my wife is alive.

 So that my wife can be found, any information, no matter how trivial,

 I request everyone, please.

307
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,930
 - What did they demand in exchange for releasing your wife?

308
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,790
 - How is the police investigation going?
 - Are they demanding something from you?

309
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,170
Jae Gyeong.

310
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,580
He's coming out?

311
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,480
The culprit...

312
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,050
We received a message from the culprit.

313
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,830
My wife is alive. They are demanding a ransom.

314
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,830
Until 10 AM tomorrow, 13 hours from now, I need 5 billion won in non-sequential bills.

315
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,610
I will withdraw 5 billion won from the bank tomorrow.

316
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,280
Please exchange my money for the bills you have.

Please come to help save my wife!

322
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,670
3- 72 Buyeong-dong, Jungang-gu.

323
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,510
Please come!

324
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,680
Please come to 3- 72 Buyeong-dong, Jungang-gu!

325
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,160
Calm down, please.

326
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,500
Kim Yun Cheol.

327
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,890
Why are you acting unilaterally?

328
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,900
They demanded 5 billion won in non-sequential bills. Isn't this the only way?

329
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,440
You are still a suspect.

330
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,940
- But it's been proven that someone else is the culprit.
 - And the culprit can have an accomplice.

331
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,100
What if you planned this fabricated scenario with your mistress?

332
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,860
I did not.

333
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,610
You can always entice the culprit using fake money.

334
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,480
What is your reason for going through all this trouble to prepare this cash?

335
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,200
Am I the only one who is curious about that?

336
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,170
Is money important right now? Someone's life...

337
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,110
I have to do whatever I can to rescue my wife.

338
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,870
 Husband of the victim, Kim Yun Cheol, who was the most likely suspect

339
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,270
 caused chaos by resisting arrest.

340
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,570
 As the police began to apply force, an envelope addressed to Kim Yun Cheol

341
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,600
 was delivered, and it appears to have been sent by the culprit.

342
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,520
 The contents of that envelope have not yet been confirmed.

343
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,090
 Whether Kim Yun Cheol can now escape from being the most likely suspect of the abduction of Sim Jae Gyeong...

344
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,940
Look at me, nyah nyah.

345
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,510
Look at me, here, here.

346
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,580
Go play outside!

347
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,480
Please!

348
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,880
This late at night? You told me to not break other people's windows

349
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,050
and play inside.

350
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,650
Mom, pass the ball to me.

351
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,680
Oh, I have two sons,

352
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,830
but where is your father and why am I dealing with all this?

353
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,310
You didn't suspect anything?

354
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:26,790
Well, it did seem strange, but I assumed that they were in a desperate situation.

355
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,510
I opened the locker number that they told me, and as they said, there was an envelope and the fee for the delivery.

356
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,490
Plenty of money.

357
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:52,100
They put an item and money into an unlocked locker

358
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,250
so that means they put them in right before the delivery person arrived.

359
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,270
They could have just told us, "Put the 5 billion won at the place I tell you."

360
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,380
During going-home rush hours? Why make it so complicated?

361
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,220
They didn't decide on this time because it was during rush hours.

362
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,250
They synched the time that Kim Yun Cheol would be arrested.

363
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,400
Hello. This way, please.

364
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,230
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

365
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,670
Thank you.

366
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,870
 An unprecedented hostage rescue drama is taking place.

367
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,780
 A long line has formed since early this morning in order to rescue Sim Jae Gyeong.

368
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,430
 So far, currency totaling 1.5 billion won has been exchanged,

369
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:21,140
 and at this rate, the needed 5 billion won will be exchanged on time without much difficulty.

370
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,990
 The police maintain silence on how this money will be delivered to the kidnapper...

371
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,320
Five billion won.

372
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,280
 Team Leader Jin:  12 missed calls

373
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,190
Thank you.

374
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,940
Your wife will return safely.

375
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,160
Thank you.

376
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,200
Thank you.

377
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,510
 I'll catch up with you. Don't forget our promise!

378
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,920
She even gave me a message of support

379
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,660
There are a lot of people to be grateful to.

380
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,330
Thank you.

381
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,200
- We will communicate through this receiver starting now. 
 - Yes. I understand.

382
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,190
We will check your movement in real-time.

383
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,560
Go by yourself starting now, as naturally as possible.

384
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,020
  - Can you hear? 
 - Yes.

385
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,900
Please don't even think of doing something stupid.   I'm watching you continuously.

386
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,740
- How's the GPS reception? 
 - Reception is satisfactory.

387
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,470
Hey, step on it!

388
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,160
He is almost at the destination.

389
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,930
 Starlight Wedding Hall Entrance

390
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,530
 Starlight Wedding Hall

391
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,930
Kim Yun Cheol has arrived on the site.

392
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,430
Team 1 has marked him.

393
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,870
Check.

394
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,030
Kim Yun Cheol, what does it say there?

395
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,970
 Wait for the next alarm.

396
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,990
Wait for the next alarm.

397
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,820
 Kim Yun Cheol suddenly started to follow a model car.

398
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,370
Wh-What are you saying?  Following what?  Hey, don't let your guard down.

399
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,600
Everybody focus!

400
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,320
 After 30 minutes the stand at entrance 1 of the riverside baseball field.

401
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,900
 After 30 minutes the stand at entrance 1 of the riverside baseball field.

402
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,350
What's that sound?

403
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,320
It's a fire!

404
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,010
It's a fire! It's a fire!

405
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,390
Kim Yun Cheol, what's going on?

406
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,200
 A fire alarm went off and it's chaos! Kim Yun Cheol ran outside.

407
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,360
Kim Yun Cheol, what's going on?

408
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,380
 Kim Yun Cheol.

409
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:52,760
 After 30 minutes the stand at entrance 1 of the riverside baseball field.

410
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,360
There was an order by the suspect to change the point of contact.

411
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,340
 After 30 minutes the stand at entrance 1 of the riverside baseball field.

412
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,180
Everybody move out.

413
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,670
Out of the way. Get out of the way!

414
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,480
 Riverside baseball field.

415
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,400
 Team 2 is on Seongsan Bridge.

416
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,010
Hey, when will you reach it?

417
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,900
Only half the squad can be deployed there.

418
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,290
Damn, this is a calculated plan. How far has he gotten?

419
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,020
He's almost arrived at the destination.

420
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,210
- Speed it up! 
 - Yes.

421
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
I hear the alarm.

422
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,120
Where is Kim Yun Cheol?

423
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,040
 He just arrived.

424
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,010
- Ah...
 - What is written there?

425
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,620
It's a new instruction.

426
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,300
What does it say?

427
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,590
 Exit 7

428
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,800
Change in contact point. Han River Marina in 30 minutes. That's Han River Marina.

429
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,990
Team 2 should not come here, go directly to Han River Marina for a stakeout.

430
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,640
Let's go.

431
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,740
 Han River Marina

432
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,350
 Gate 1

433
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,120
 A

434
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,820
Each station, report.

435
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,380
Team 1 arrived nearby.

436
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,370
Standing by in the northern direction.

437
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,300
Team 2 is standing by above the bridge.

438
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,550
Team 3 is standing by at the access road.

439
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,390
Everyone be on guard.

440
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,300
What is that?

441
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,830
 Put the black plastic bag into the fishnet.

442
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,310
It says to put the black plastic bag into the fishnet.

443
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,520
Put it in, along with the smartwatch.

444
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,080
Okay.

445
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,100
The ransom was put on the drone.  It's currently moving toward Seongsan Bridge following the Gangbyeon Expressway.

446
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,440
It's black.  It's carrying the sack of money in the bottom net.

447
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,430
 Team 3 check.

448
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,820
Check each team's monitor and follow cautiously.

449
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,890
It's flying toward Donjak Bridge.

450
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,110
- Get going. 
 - Okay.

451
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,100
- Have you verified the drone model?  
 -  I'll check immediately.

452
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,060
Ask for more support.

453
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,510
Yes, I understand.

454
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,700
It's stopping. It's below the Domul dock.  Surround it.

455
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,320
 Domul Dock

456
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,550
Someone is approaching traveling west.

457
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,090
Grab him. Grab him.

458
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,980
Stop!

459
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,600
What's the matter with you? Let me go.

460
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,120
What's wrong?

461
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,380
What's wrong?

462
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,380
Can you hear me, Kim Yun Cheol?

463
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,820
Yes.

464
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,500
What is going on?  What the hell is going on?

465
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,830
You switched it, right?

466
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,570
Yes.

467
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,780
You.  Don't move.  Stay right there.

468
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,470
What, in order to save your wife?

469
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,780
Just as I suspected, I knew you were a scumbag.

470
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,680
You were aiming for the money, weren't you?

471
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,800
The money.  Where did you switch the money?

472
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,700
 The first trash can on the left side of the aisle to exit 7.

473
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,150
 Exchange the sack in which the money has been placed with the garbage bag.

474
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:36,670
 Come to column A6 by Gate 1 at  the riverside marina in half an hour.

475
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,080
 Don't tell the police that you switched the sack!

476
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:55,700
 If you don't follow my instructions, your wife  will die.

477
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,430
Yes. Yes.

478
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:04,130
Sunbaenim. The sack of money is not in the trash can at the baseball stadium.

479
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,620
As expected, there was an accomplice who picked up the money.

480
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:18,280
Appearing to run quite desperately was a perfect show to entertain the people watching.

481
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,060
Right?

482
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,790
That's enough.  I'll return this.

483
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:34,430
I will go home and wait for my wife.

484
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,200
Are you wishing she returns?

485
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,540
 Couple

486
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:13,210
 Mistress?

487
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,790
 Old Crop Restaurant Employees

488
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:49,400
 If you don't follow my instructions, your wife will die!!!

489
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,750
Have you found her?  Is she alive?

490
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,000
- We got an anoynmous tip. 
 -  A tip?  What is it?

491
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,020
The tip is he witnessed you in a car putting something with a syringe into a bottle of wine.

492
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:35,370
 You need money.  So do as I say,

493
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:40,030
 or you will become the one who put poison in the wine by yourself.

494
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,680
Who?

495
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:47,370
It's a warrant.  We will execute a search and seizure right now.

496
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,150
Start now.

497
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:02,760
Where is the special wine for that day?

498
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,400
Ah.  I couldn't sleep that night so I drank it all by myself.

499
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Is that so? You said you were going to drink it with your wife.

500
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,980
- This. 
 - Yes.

501
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,730
There.

502
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,990
We will recycle it for you.

503
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,560
Wait a sec.

504
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,560
You drank wine but there is no empty bottle.

505
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:27,570
I drank a whole bottle by myself but I don't remember where I disposed of it.

506
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,480
Kim Yoon Cheol.

507
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,780
Speaking of the wine ...

508
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:59,230
I mean that wine.

509
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:18,290
Ah ...  This, it came out here.

510
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,700
 L'Amour Eternal. Cabernet Syrahh

511
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:30,460
Your wife wouldn't like it if a wine bottle rolls around like this.

512
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,130
Oh, were you destroying evidence?

513
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:44,150
Even if it is wine, but with this cork that's absorbed that wine ...

514
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,750
what should be done?

515
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,150
The kidnapping case has a new twist. 
  Husband Kim Yun Cheol is the most likely suspect.

516
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:58,070
Police conducted a search and seized a large amount of wine.

517
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:01,000
While Sim Jae Gyeong is living or dead is still unconfirmed,

518
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,530
 her husband Kim Yun Cheol is under suspicion again.

519
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,150
 It's confusing whether this kidnapping case arises from a couple and his mistress in an illicit affair

520
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:15,100
 or from the a third party's involvement for a huge sum of money.

521
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,780
What did you put in it?

522
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,670
I don't know what this is about.

523
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:22,360
Did you get if from your mistress?

524
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,050
There's no such person.

525
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:40,430
Graduated at the top of her class majoring in food chemistry from Seongmyeong Women's College. Began working at Wundam Foods planning and developing department.

526
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,950
You scouted her while working on opening your restaurant.

527
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,310
Was that when your relationship with her began?

528
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:49,810
This woman is your mistress, isn't she?

529
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:54,700
She is just a work colleague.

530
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,190
Oh, is that so?

531
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:01,490
 Sir, have you seen this person in this apartment building?

532
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,530
 Yes, I think I have.

533
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,030
I was told that you visited her home every Friday.

534
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:18,500
We've confirmed that Jin Seon Mi purchased poison ivy extract by her credit card transaction record.

535
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:24,450
You know that it's an ingredient in making a lethal poison, don't you?

536
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,900
 Purchase Receipt
 Jin Seon Mi
 Seoul, Mapo-gu
 Poison Ivy

537
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,170
I know nothing about this.

538
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:52,390
 I will catch up to you. Don't forget our promise.

539
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,340
 She even gave me a message of support.

540
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,580
Did you both plan together to screw us over?

541
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,310
Well, this—

542
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:14,010
Or maybe only you were supposed to be screwed over?

543
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,710
 07/05 Sun

544
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:50,590
The reason you need to get cash together even by holding a bill exchange event for the whole nation.

545
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:04,410
There is some misunderstanding... Detective, I only thought about rescuing my wife.

546
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,320
Rescue?

547
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,180
Kill her, then rescue her. How easy, isn't it?

548
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,580
If I tried to kill my wife, why

549
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,160
would I have abducted her? And if I did,

550
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,750
why would I try to kill her?

551
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,680
They both do not make sense, do they?

552
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,190
You are trying to turn what doesn't make sense into your alibi.

553
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,140
The final winner is Jin Seon Mi.

554
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:31,090
Let me give you advice as a fellow married man. Don't live this way.

555
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,420
Let's go.

556
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,860
Wait, Detective. I am sincerely hoping that my wife is alive... no.

557
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,060
I'm sincerely hoping that my wife returns alive.

558
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,470
They received their ransom so there is no reason to keep her.

559
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:45,530
And if they released her, we should have heard from her by now.

560
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,740
I will wait here until the end.

561
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,770
Can't you stop with this act already?

562
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,660
Act?

563
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,170
- How dare you say that?
 - Come to your senses!

564
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,550
Please.

565
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:03,190
Please, I request you.

566
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:07,160
Until the culprit contacts me, at least, I will stay here.

567
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,810
Please allow me to.

568
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,540
That should give you some time to come up with more schemes.

569
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,030
Only until midnight.

570
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,290
Do you know this?

571
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:26,210
If poison is found in the confiscated wine, you will be formally arrested.

572
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:31,160
Even if your wife returns alive, you will be charged with attempted murder.

573
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:36,500
Then... your life is over.

574
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,160
Are you the suspect's mistress?

575
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,960
No, I am just his work colleague.

576
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,930
Then what is this photo?

577
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,550
Please give us a comment.

578
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,130
What is your relationship with him?

579
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,460
We are the police.

580
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,800
You are the primary witness for Sim Jae Gyeong's abduction. You must accompany us to the station.

581
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,060
Let's go.

582
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,400
Please look this way.

583
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,670
Let go of me.

584
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:39,800
Did the husband conspire with his mistress?

585
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,630
I know, right? This is so scary.

586
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:45,440
So bold.

587
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,890
I wonder how this woman is feeling right now?

588
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,960
Well, she's receiving divine punishment.

589
01:00:57,230 --> 01:01:00,460
You did well. Congratulations.

590
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,030
Of course.

591
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,010
I will wait.

592
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:17,980
I'm sorry but someone reserved the entire restaurant for tonight.

593
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:20,250
So can I request that this be the last call?

594
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,340
Let's go.

595
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,910
Please let me change my clothes.

596
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:33,630
 Groom, put the ring on the bride.

597
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:43,600
 Therefore, we pronounce the groom Kim Yun Cheol and the bride Sim Jae Gyeong a lawfully wedded couple.

598
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,660
 Bride and groom, seal the vow with a kiss.

599
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,150
Let's try going upstairs.

600
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,060
Kim Yun Cheol? Oh. Darn it.

601
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,430
Grab him. Hold him.

602
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:50,900
Call 119.

603
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,940
Oh, it's 119.

604
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,380
Down there. That way.

605
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,590
Careful. Hold on.

606
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,170
Hey, come to your senses.

607
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,740
The number is 3-72.

608
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,990
It's Buyeong-dong. It's an emergency.

609
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:34,900

610
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:38,660
♫  Your bickering every day is wearing me out. Damn  ♫

611
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,350
♫  The game is boring. No, ummm.  ♫

612
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:44,620
♫  After a long night, in the end, in front of me  ♫

613
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:48,570
 My Dangerous Wife

614
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:52,450
 I'm not sure when, but we

615
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,580
 became used to seeing each other from behind.

616
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:59,280
 Have you seen the suspect's face?

617
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,390
 I will begin anew with her.

618
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:03,730
♫  Tell me what you want now  ♫

619
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:08,570
 I think marriage can be a very amazing thing.

620
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:10,710
 I want to know more about my wife.

621
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,860
 I will do this until the end.

622
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,750
 This is only the beginning.

623
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,620
