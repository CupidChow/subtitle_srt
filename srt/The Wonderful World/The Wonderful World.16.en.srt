1
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,540
[Zhejiang Q81256]

2
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm leaving now,

3
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,450
keep an eye on the store.

4
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,079
Xiaoyue.

5
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,320
Manager Fang.

6
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,200
Uncle.

7
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Just this suit?

8
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,760
Yes,

9
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,280
it's Diandian's engagement party today.

10
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,079
Manager Fang,

11
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
this is my best suit.

12
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,340
It's quite expensive.

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,560
Manager Fang,

14
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,600
which car should I take?

15
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,240
Take the one in the back,

16
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,680
her father's car.

17
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,120
Okay,

18
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,180
see you in a bit.

19
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,010
See you soon.

20
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,690
My cousin

21
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
is waiting for me.

22
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,840
Let's go.

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,300
Come on,

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
let's get moving.

25
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,140
Hold it steady.

26
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,410
Don't put this sofa in the bedroom,

27
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,060
can we put it in the guest room?

28
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,490
Okay.

29
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,850
This way,

30
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,250
take it slow.

31
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,810
Careful.

32
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,180
Your paranoia is acting up again.

33
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,090
What's that?

34
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,080
Hyacinths.

35
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,410
They bloom only once a year,

36
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,920
for just about two weeks.

37
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,200
The rest of the time they look like this,

38
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
with long green leaves

39
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,840
that resemble water plants.

40
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,900
When do they bloom?

41
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,880
Everything's been moved.

42
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,360
Please go downstairs to sign the papers.

43
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,800
Okay.

44
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
I'll go sign them.

45
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Where are the qipaos?

46
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
The ones my mother

47
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,370
made for Teacher Jia Sulan,

48
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,040
those two dresses?

49
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,840
They're in the fitting room downstairs.

50
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,240
Good.

51
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,580
Mom's health was deteriorating.

52
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
The year Leifeng Tower was rebuilt,

53
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,410
she passed away.

54
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,000
Mom told me

55
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
if one day she's no longer by my side,

56
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,050
it just means she's waiting for me in another dimension,

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,860
where there's another her and me.

58
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,010
I've finished my homework.

59
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,570
Teacher Jia has the same illness as my mom.

60
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,159
She's sick too.

61
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,480
After that performance,

62
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,580
she never showed up again.

63
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,000
Thank you.

64
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,930
You're welcome.

65
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,080
Xu Tian,

66
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,160
mom's here.

67
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,720
Diandian.

68
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,320
Diandian.

69
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:19,920
Mom.

70
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,920
Grandpa.

71
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,600
Don't all crowd here.

72
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,120
Come in.

73
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,280
Take a look at the new place.

74
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,340
Come on, everyone.

75
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,760
Dian Dian's father is here too,

76
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,160
waiting for us at the hotel.

77
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,960
No need to introduce Mr. Fang, right?

78
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,490
Mr. Fang.

79
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,159
Aren't you going to change how you address him?

80
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,920
In a couple of days when Dian Dian and Mr. Fang

81
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
return from Guangzhou,

82
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,640
you'll get your marriage certificate,

83
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,480
and we'll have the wedding banquet,

84
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,680
and celebrate properly.

85
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,480
That's right!

86
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,600
I'll pay for the banquet.

87
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,360
And there will be a dowry too.

88
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,890
Mr. Fang,

89
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,960
I should be the one

90
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,200
paying for the banquet.

91
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
It's not that much money anyway.

92
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,440
Let's not block the hallway,

93
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,840
go upstairs to see the new place,

94
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,880
and then head to the hotel for dinner.

95
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,480
Dian Dian,

96
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,320
please take

97
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,450
everyone upstairs.

98
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,700
Uncle, please go up first.

99
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,300
Finally, finally.

100
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,160
Big auntie, little auntie!

101
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,600
Little auntie loves Diandian the most.

102
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,240
Come on,

103
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,600
don't block the way. Go upstairs

104
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,730
and see the new room.

105
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,640
Be careful.

106
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,340
So annoying

107
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,180
with all these people.

108
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,330
They're all family.

109
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,840
Wait,

110
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,200
I'll take you

111
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
to get something.

112
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,920
What?

113
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,560
You'll see when we get there.

114
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Tomorrow mom and I are going to Guangzhou.

115
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,040
I'll be back in three days,

116
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,570
but she'll stay for a month.

117
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,320
At the hotel,

118
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,650
mom wants to have a talk.

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Should I come too?

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,460
It's not really a lecture,

121
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,809
just a heart-to-heart with us.

122
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,159
Well,

123
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,290
should I be nervous?

124
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,890
That's up to you.

125
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,410
Go upstairs and keep them company.

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Stop it, stop it.

127
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,640
Let's talk business.

128
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,680
Yang Yun has already been

129
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,760
to the station for questioning,

130
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,420
what else is there to discuss?

131
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
Did you talk

132
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,080
with Yang Yun?

133
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,600
No.

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,720
You're the director,

135
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,850
a senior artist.

136
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,200
The direction of the show

137
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,860
should follow your guidance.

138
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,720
Senior.

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,130
That sounds creepy.

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,000
They

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,520
are all your juniors.

142
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,760
Yang Yun has recovered

143
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,360
and is full of energy.

144
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,580
The theater troupe

145
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,160
needs to decide whether to revive 'White Snake'

146
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,220
or produce 'Jin Se'

147
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,200
today.

148
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,720
"Jin Se"

149
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,090
You're new here?

150
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,760
You need to register your name and phone number to enter.

151
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,160
My name is Qiao Guanghui.

152
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
No exceptions.

153
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,760
This register used to be a mess,

154
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,000
I've organized it now.

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,260
Who are you here to see?

156
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,440
No manners,

157
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,250
making me register.

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,120
Li Shangyin's poem

159
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,520
"The Ornate Zither."

160
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,400
That's the name I've chosen for our new production.

161
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,680
We'll only perform

162
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,400
the "Broken Bridge" and "Boating on the Lake" scenes from "Legend of the White Snake."

163
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,120
The relationship between Bai Suzhen and Xiaoqing.

164
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,400
I mentioned it to you before the incident in October.

165
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
So you'll direct,

166
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
you'll choreograph,

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,260
right, Director Yang?

168
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,040
The bureau

169
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,960
is encouraging

170
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,020
the development of artistic talent.

171
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,060
Will Qiaomi still play Xiaoqing?

172
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,580
Will Yin Ye still play Xu Xian?

173
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,410
Do we still need Xu Xian?

174
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,000
We definitely need him, right?

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,260
What about Bai Suzhen?

176
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,880
Me.

177
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,480
So

178
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,240
you write, direct, choreograph,

179
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
and perform.

180
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,160
If you've already decided everything,

181
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,000
then why are we

182
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,660
even having this meeting?

183
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,520
Let's vote by a show of hands.

184
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,250
Unanimously approved.

185
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,400
Only then will everyone be motivated.

186
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,840
The experienced should guide the newcomers,

187
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,900
and new productions need the director's guidance too.

188
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,200
Those in favor of restaging

189
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,300
"The Brocade Zither," raise your hands.

190
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,680
Where is Wen Xiaoyao?

191
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,880
Haven't heard from her these days.

192
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,440
The perfectly fine "Legend of the White Snake"

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
was ruined because of her, wasn't it?

194
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,400
Xiaoyao has already danced through three premiere performances

195
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,520
without any regard for her artistic career.

196
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,400
Please don't talk about careers.

197
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,640
I won't agree to this.

198
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,170
I object.

199
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,520
Even if objecting is useless, I still object.

200
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,240
Just go ahead with your rehearsal

201
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,370
I can't direct this.

202
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,250
Where's Xiaomi?

203
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,050
You must sign in.

204
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,560
Let go of me

205
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,520
did you hear me?

206
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,320
I'm in a hurry.

207
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,740
Tell this idiot to take his hands off.

208
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,100
Insisting I sign in

209
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,480
do you know who I am?

210
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,920
You still need to sign in.

211
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,020
Director Yang.

212
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,920
Director Qiao is here.

213
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,580
I'm here to pick up my daughter

214
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
where should I go?

215
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,200
Sign in.

216
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
Sign in.

217
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,000
To hell with your sign-in!

218
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,720
Sign here.

219
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,220
Information incomplete.

220
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,680
Xiao Yao,

221
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,760
today is the seventh day of the lunar month,

222
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,490
Dad's coming to take me to Babaoshan to visit Mom.

223
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,730
Thank you and Uncle Hui.

224
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,850
I live near Leifeng Pagoda,

225
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,420
tomorrow I'll go there

226
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,220
and pretend I'm visiting Mom.

227
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,980
What are you doing?

228
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,600
Going to class

229
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,930
to teach children how to dance.

230
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,440
Let me tell you a joke.

231
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,410
When I was in school,

232
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,840
my dream was to become a scientist.

233
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,650
Then I realized,

234
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,050
some people wanted to be painters,

235
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,840
others wanted to be writers.

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,730
Do you know what my dream is now?

237
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,640
What?

238
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,660
To build a family with you.

239
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,970
Funny, isn't it?

240
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,440
Hello.

241
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,850
My name is Xu.

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,560
I ordered

243
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,280
a ring here earlier.

244
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,280
Please come this way.

245
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,600
When did you order it?

246
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,520
On the 10th

247
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,600
of last month.

248
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,200
Try it on.

249
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,400
We've already paid for it.

250
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,200
The deposit has been paid,

251
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,760
Mrs. Xu.

252
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,100
Why don't you try it on?

253
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,720
How is it,

254
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,840
Mrs. Xu? Does it fit?

255
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,120
I'm not Mrs. Xu yet.

256
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,720
Isn't it a bit too big?

257
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,860
It fits perfectly.

258
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,600
I think it's a bit big.

259
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,160
Please wait a moment,

260
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,420
I'll adjust it for you.

261
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,560
Isn't it too expensive?

262
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,720
Not at all,

263
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,490
it's once in a lifetime.

264
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,740
I should be the one paying.

265
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,600
Of course it should be me.

266
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,090
Let's return it.

267
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
Do you like it?

268
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,960
I do like it.

269
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,760
Come, Mrs. Xu,

270
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,820
try it on again.

271
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,280
Excuse me, I'd like to ask

272
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,200
if I can

273
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,800
return this?

274
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,800
This is a custom-made item

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,859
I'm afraid not.

276
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,119
Can I exchange it for something else?

277
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,880
Yes, of course.

278
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,119
Please take a look at which style you'd prefer.

279
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,380
Maybe check these out.

280
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,690
This one.

281
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,490
This one.

282
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,250
This one.

283
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,370
And this one too.

284
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,540
Please take a look at all of these.

285
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,920
This one here,

286
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,440
simple yet elegant.

287
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,420
This one

288
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,810
can also be customized specially for you.

289
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,280
Look,

290
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
inside the ring,

291
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,320
we can engrave your names,

292
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,450
anniversary dates,

293
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,880
fingerprints, and more.

294
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
However, this one

295
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,920
It's even cheaper than the deposit.

296
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,380
How about this?

297
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,280
Just a moment.

298
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,480
This is the best I can do,

299
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,540
no more discounts.

300
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,720
Dian.

301
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,720
Diandian is here.

302
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,180
Ms. Shi.

303
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,720
Xu Tian.

304
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,540
Please have a seat,

305
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,010
make yourselves comfortable.

306
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,060
They've sent over all this random stuff.

307
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,400
Let's chat for a bit

308
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,480
while everyone waits for drinks.

309
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,140
Have a seat.

310
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Please, sit down.

311
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,000
Today is

312
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,920
December 10th,

313
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,940
and you two met on October 9th,

314
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,850
exactly two months ago.

315
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,000
We met in June,

316
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,240
the first time was in summer,

317
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,880
introduced by my granduncle.

318
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,520
Should I listen to you or what you told me?

319
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,040
Mr. Fang,

320
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,970
please go ahead.

321
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,400
Xu Tian.

322
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,840
Do you love Diandian?

323
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,690
Yes, I do.

324
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,860
What do you love about her?

325
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,440
Being with Diandian

326
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,570
is comfortable,

327
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,000
and

328
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,140
I feel secure with her.

329
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,800
Diandian treats me well.

330
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,840
So

331
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,730
I want to treat her well too.

332
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
No matter how she changes in the future,

333
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,380
I won't change.

334
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,960
But this

335
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,380
doesn't have much to do with love.

336
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
She's good to you,

337
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,530
so you promise to be good to her.

338
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,000
But actually, you two

339
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,500
have never officially dated.

340
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,460
Don't blame me,

341
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,360
according to our hometown customs,

342
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,200
once you drink the engagement wine,

343
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,730
my daughter becomes yours.

344
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,450
Tomorrow

345
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,560
take her to Guangzhou to handle the paperwork.

346
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,560
When you return,

347
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,760
you two can pick a date

348
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,800
to register at the civil affairs bureau.

349
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,660
Go to Guangzhou

350
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,810
for what paperwork?

351
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,080
Diandian was born in Guangzhou.

352
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,280
Do you want to come along?

353
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,840
Grandpa Stone is hurrying us,

354
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,900
the other relatives are all waiting.

355
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
The foundation of love is trust,

356
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,700
without reservation.

357
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,680
I know.

358
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,000
The things you keep hidden inside,

359
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,260
when you're together,

360
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,900
can be guessed anyway.

361
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,500
It's better to just

362
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,280
say it from the beginning

363
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,140
and resolve it.

364
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,770
Xu Tian knows everything about me,

365
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,740
there's nothing he doesn't know.

366
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,580
What are you referring to?

367
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,930
I don't need to know,

368
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,440
Xu Tian needs to know.

369
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,620
I've been wanting to tell you something.

370
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,600
What is it?

371
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,890
Mom told me not to say it.

372
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,450
I never did that.

373
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,140
In October,

374
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,080
when we returned from Beijing that night at the airport,

375
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,040
you said Zhou Tong had been taken to the hospital but was fine.

376
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,880
Whether I tell you or not,

377
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,340
it won't change anything.

378
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,760
Things were different then.

379
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,440
Back then,

380
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,610
you couldn't even tell who was who.

381
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,300
Now you're going to live with Xu Tian.

382
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,840
Why was

383
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,440
Zhou Tong

384
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,090
in the hospital?

385
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,440
On October 18th,

386
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,640
I was holding your hand crossing the street.

387
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,970
He was on the other side,

388
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,760
passing right by us.

389
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,640
We were fine,

390
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,560
but he got hit by a car.

391
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,600
I was terrified.

392
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,820
Later, I took him to the hospital.

393
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,920
When I saw him,

394
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,740
it was like seeing you,

395
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,060
and my mind went blank.

396
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,760
He was okay,

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,660
but I was worried something might happen to you.

398
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,130
So did he,

399
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,880
did he see me?

400
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,090
He stared at you.

401
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,020
Then Auntie Song arrived.

402
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,640
There was another man with her,

403
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,300
so I stepped out to call my mom.

404
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,610
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

405
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,880
It's better

406
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,970
to talk about these things.

407
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,840
You two got together

408
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,640
because of looking for Zhou Tong,

409
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,700
it's not reliable,

410
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,640
but heaven protects good people.

411
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,440
What's in the past is in the past.

412
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,680
From now on,

413
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,120
let's be more understanding

414
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,450
and live well together.

415
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,900
Director Fang.

416
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,040
Which floor

417
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
is the banquet on?

418
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,090
Third floor.

419
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,010
You can go up.

420
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,100
Alright, we'll head up first.

421
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:23,980
We're here.

422
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,520
I'll get out and stretch my legs for a bit.

423
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,850
Want me to come with you?

424
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,450
You're not planning to go to Beijing, are you?

425
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,440
I have

426
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,500
nothing to do with him.

427
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,800
I just

428
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,480
want to be

429
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,620
alone for a moment.

430
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,930
Mom and Dad are already seated.

431
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,330
That day,

432
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,240
when you left me

433
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,920
alone at the restaurant,

434
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,240
you were

435
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,200
taking him

436
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,060
to the hospital, weren't you?

437
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,060
Then why didn't you

438
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,860
ask me to come with you?

439
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
I was worried you might get hurt too.

440
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,530
What a coincidence.

441
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,120
You two just met

442
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,050
and got into a car accident.

443
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,080
Is he going to be okay?

444
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,840
He was already awake when I left.

445
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,820
Did his girlfriend

446
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,500
come to see him?

447
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,050
I didn't see her.

448
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,900
Wen Xiaoyao's performance that day.

449
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,530
What a coincidence.

450
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,760
Past events

451
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,570
and all my wild thoughts over the years

452
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,460
have all collided at once.

453
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,760
What past events are you talking about?

454
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,740
Teacher Jia Sulan's daughter

455
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,840
is now

456
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,840
also playing Bai Suzhen.

457
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,760
Let's go to Beijing together to see her.

458
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Coincidentally,

459
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,240
we ran into another me.

460
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,780
Zhou Tong is Zhou Tong,

461
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,380
and you are you.

462
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,720
I know.

463
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,420
It would make people think weird things,

464
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,240
so you

465
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,170
didn't dare tell me.

466
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,880
Should I

467
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,520
change how I address

468
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,580
your family today?

469
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,280
We'll do that when we host

470
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,880
the wedding banquet at home.

471
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,280
Okay.

472
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,570
Beijing W·86151

473
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,700
We're here.

474
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,100
It's not home anymore.

475
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,050
And Xiaoyao isn't here either.

476
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,840
On October 16th,

477
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,640
someone named Shi Diandian

478
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,000
came to the troupe looking for Xiaoyao.

479
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
She never mentioned it to me.

480
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,920
Shi Diandian.

481
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,080
What does she look like?

482
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,920
I only saw the name in the registry.

483
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,520
How would I know what she looks like?

484
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,080
On the 18th, when Zhou Tong had the accident,

485
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
a woman took him to the hospital.

486
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,640
I saw her when I rushed to the hospital.

487
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,300
Her hand was covered in blood.

488
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,530
I was quite puzzled at the time.

489
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,840
I asked her twice but she didn't answer.

490
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,050
Hesitating.

491
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,970
Auntie Song.

492
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,660
Director Song.

493
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,340
For these past two months,

494
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,160
she's barely spoken.

495
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,280
She used to be such a chatterbox.

496
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,600
Before Xiaoyao left,

497
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,500
she went to Zhou Tong's house,

498
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,300
but Auntie kicked her out.

499
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,760
Before,

500
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,060
she had quite a temper,

501
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,930
which had its own charm.

502
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,160
Now she's so gentle,

503
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,000
more feminine.

504
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,280
I...

505
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,160
I'm not taking advantage of her situation, am I?

506
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,640
Dad,

507
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,120
could you please

508
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,280
discuss this kind of thing with people your own age?

509
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,640
It's too much.

510
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
You're my father.

511
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,060
Someone my own age, right.

512
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,640
How could I forget

513
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,700
about Auntie Gang.

514
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,220
I saw her at noon today.

515
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,720
She was very upset and ran off.

516
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,920
Director Yang convinced her to resign.

517
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
The troupe is rehearsing a new show.

518
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,080
Sister Yun is choreographing.

519
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,120
That's a big deal.

520
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,400
Her artistic career is over.

521
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,220
Xiaoyao's career is over too.

522
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,900
Where are you going later?

523
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,220
I'm going to Jinsong Community Plaza

524
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,880
to watch Tiantian there.

525
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,360
Just like you,

526
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,370
I'm afraid of going home alone.

527
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,610
Keep yourself warm.

528
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,930
Tiantian comes without saying a word.

529
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,770
It's so cold.

530
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,640
This sound system is terrible,

531
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,170
all crackling and buzzing.

532
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,480
I'll sponsor a new set later.

533
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,220
I'm late today,

534
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,440
I went with Xiaomi

535
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,680
to Babaoshan.

536
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,380
On the seventh of every month,

537
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,200
Xiaoyao

538
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,260
visits her mother.

539
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,300
She's not here now.

540
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,160
Xiaomi and I

541
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,060
brought some flowers.

542
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,720
You're a good person.

543
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,130
Who's right?

544
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,960
Here, put on

545
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,730
this mink scarf.

546
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,440
Let me be fair here,

547
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,920
actually,

548
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Zhou's departure

549
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,980
can't be entirely blamed on Xiaoyao.

550
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
Everyone has their own fate.

551
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,480
It's normal to miss someone,

552
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,120
but life

553
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,720
must go on,

554
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,880
right?

555
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,980
Did I blame Yaoyao?

556
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,600
How could I blame her?

557
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,120
As soon as there's trouble

558
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,080
you disappear

559
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
and stop dancing.

560
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,040
Why did you leave?

561
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,480
Guanwang.

562
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,920
Get in the car.

563
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,560
Guanwang.

564
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,840
That's not right,

565
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,160
people will think we're having some big fight.

566
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,160
Get in, please.

567
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,530
I only see you once a day,

568
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
and then you're gone when I get home.

569
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,600
Guanwang.

570
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Please get in.

571
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,600
I'll drive slowly wherever you want to go,

572
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,060
at least it's warm inside.

573
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,020
I don't want to ride in the car.

574
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,840
Why not?

575
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,690
I want to walk alone.

576
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,880
Are you tired of me or just the car?

577
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,800
Not you.

578
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,770
That's good,

579
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,650
then I'll walk with you from now on.

580
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,240
How many keys do you have?

581
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,770
Just one.

582
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,900
I'll throw it away.

583
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,080
Don't need the car anymore.

584
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,920
There's nothing valuable in it anyway,

585
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,640
nothing important,

586
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,100
everything valuable is right here with you.

587
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,480
What are you doing?

588
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Taking advantage of the situation.

589
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,560
Come pick me up.

590
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,040
Can't do it,

591
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,520
no car.

592
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,480
Then I'll come to you.

593
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,010
I'm busy,

594
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
we'll talk later.

595
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,200
Stop looking.

596
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,960
I threw it in the river,

597
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,320
not in the grass.

598
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,000
You're trying to scam me.

599
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,880
Just say the word

600
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,560
that I'm bothering you,

601
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,800
and I'll disappear immediately,

602
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,730
clean and quick.

603
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,760
Scamming people

604
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,960
isn't my style.

605
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,130
I'm doing fine on my own.

606
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,840
Fine? What fine?

607
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,120
Look how thin your face is,

608
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,280
like a crescent moon.

609
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,120
How could anyone not worry?

610
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,980
I'm not in the mood for your jokes.

611
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,580
Actually, I'm quite enjoying

612
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,520
the way you are right now.

613
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,040
Enjoying?

614
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,120
You used to always snap at me,

615
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,130
but now it's so nice.

616
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,370
You're like a piece of jade,

617
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,420
smooth and gentle.

618
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,409
Did I used to snap at you?

619
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,940
You don't even realize it.

620
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,760
When I talked to you,

621
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,199
I had to switch my thinking eight different ways

622
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,530
just to keep up with you.

623
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,409
Now it's so nice,

624
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,320
in the sunset,

625
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,560
you're bending over

626
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,520
in the grass,

627
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,290
looking for my car keys.

628
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,300
How beautiful.

629
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,620
I should enjoy this illusion while it lasts.

630
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,080
If you ever snap out of it,

631
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,159
I'll probably be in trouble again.

632
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,360
I won't snap out of it.

633
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,320
This river used to have

634
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,800
so much water.

635
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,610
How about

636
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,320
I take you out

637
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,600
for something delicious?

638
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,460
I'm talking about the river here.

639
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,280
Since you're not cooking anyway,

640
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,320
and it's getting cold,

641
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,920
you need to put on some weight.

642
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,480
I'll treat you to hot pot lamb.

643
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,210
How about it?

644
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,920
Or maybe

645
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
we could invite Brother Gang

646
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,480
to cheer you up.

647
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,170
What about the car keys?

648
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,800
There might be a spare at home.

649
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,920
In reality,

650
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,100
they're pushing me to the sidelines.

651
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,240
This is directly related

652
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,410
to Yaoyao's departure.

653
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,020
My debut was sensational,

654
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,920
all the southern orders came in.

655
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,060
National tour,

656
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,130
and now you've arranged for

657
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,960
Yang Yun to take my position.

658
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,060
Zhou Tong knows best how to enjoy hotpot.

659
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,640
But these past two years.

660
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,720
I've eaten there with my son a few times.

661
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,330
Mr. Qiao.

662
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,920
Why don't you stop

663
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,580
that sponsorship for a while.

664
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,210
I think if I don't make some effort now,

665
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,400
they'll announce Yang Yun as the director

666
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,460
after the New Year.

667
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,010
The newly arranged show

668
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,820
is still 'The Legend of the White Snake.'

669
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,080
Do you know what it's called?

670
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,060
'The Brocade Zither.'

671
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,690
What are they thinking?

672
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,480
Brother Gang,

673
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,920
tomorrow

674
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,360
you should go to

675
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,440
Jinsong Plaza.

676
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,160
Where is that?

677
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,340
The place where Guanwang dances.

678
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,720
I've been there once.

679
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,320
What's up?

680
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,620
Lead the dance for the ladies,

681
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,050
show your professional skills

682
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,120
and liven up the atmosphere.

683
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,580
It would be best

684
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,440
if you could get Guanwang dancing too.

685
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,200
Go to hell!

686
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,880
My life is already at rock bottom

687
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,680
and it just keeps sinking lower.

688
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,260
What's so bad about it?

689
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,400
I'm not mad at you.

690
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Just seeing your face makes my blood boil,

691
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,530
you look like you're asking for a beating.

692
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,220
I'm trying to respect you.

693
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,560
But you can't just keep bullying people like this.

694
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,600
People like you

695
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,980
deserve to be thrown straight into a hot pot.

696
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,770
You see that?

697
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,000
That's just how she is.

698
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,260
That's exactly right.

699
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,040
I brought you here

700
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,500
just so she could give you a piece of her mind.

701
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,300
Why should I take this?

702
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,530
I'm also a national first-class director

703
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,100
and a people's artist.

704
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,360
Yaoyao stopped performing

705
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,960
because she was heartbroken after my son died.

706
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Your career slump

707
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,650
is because you're getting old,

708
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,040
what's your excuse?

709
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,920
Why blame Yaoyao?

710
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
What was that?

711
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,610
Who was it again?

712
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,290
Yang Yun.

713
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,240
Yang Yun,

714
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,520
don't like what you hear?

715
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,000
Why blame us women?

716
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,240
I told you to go to classes at Guanwang Entertainment,

717
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,970
but you haven't gone even once.

718
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,100
Having you lead the dance for the girls is for your own good.

719
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,160
Step back,

720
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,720
so you can find

721
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,880
the right place in your life.

722
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,540
Enough,

723
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,930
no need to go to classes.

724
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,120
First floor, second floor,

725
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,320
don't bother with any of it.

726
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,580
Better if it all fails.

727
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,480
Guanwang,

728
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
you need to pull yourself together.

729
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,090
It doesn't matter if the business makes money or not,

730
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,540
but if it really fails,

731
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,050
you'll feel even worse.

732
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,730
It'll fail sooner or later,

733
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,720
just like life.

734
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,720
No, no,

735
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,800
don't be so pessimistic.

736
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,280
Brother Gang at least

737
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,170
still has some influence left,

738
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,760
he's still carrying

739
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,090
the dance troupe

740
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,560
director's prestige.

741
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,800
After a while,

742
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,880
once the retirement news gets out,

743
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,410
it won't be worth anything.

744
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,220
Qiao Guanghui,

745
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,080
whose side are you on?

746
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,480
Definitely not yours.

747
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,580
Choosing women over friendship.

748
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,320
Thank you,

749
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,320
thank you for

750
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,120
pointing out

751
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,320
the key point.

752
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,130
It would sound fake if I said it myself.

753
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,680
Did you hear that, Guanwang?

754
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,080
There,

755
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,100
that's the kind of person I am.

756
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,640
Eat some more.

757
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,640
It's getting late, isn't it?

758
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,080
Got it.

759
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,560
You're really in a hurry.

760
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,360
Don't mind me.

761
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,900
I'm close with Director Yang.

762
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,900
I'll put in a good word for you.

763
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,520
Really?

764
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,880
Ignore me.

765
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,920
Look at you,

766
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,240
such a social climber.

767
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,120
Then go take classes at Guanwang Entertainment.

768
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,280
She doesn't need me.

769
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,260
Times like these are when she needs you most.

770
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,170
She lost her husband years ago,

771
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,440
and now her eldest son is gone too.

772
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,880
She must feel so lonely.

773
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
She has you.

774
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,200
She needs you now.

775
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,400
What do you mean?

776
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,600
Helping her is helping me,

777
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,400
or we're done.

778
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
You need to have some compassion.

779
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,940
Who has compassion for me?

780
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,920
Real men

781
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,600
don't need compassion,

782
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,760
we deserve whatever we get,

783
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,490
understand?

784
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,120
I'll go to Hangzhou tomorrow to find Yaoyao.

785
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,680
When?

786
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,690
After you meet with Director Yang.

787
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,090
Director Yang can wait.

788
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,080
He'll be fine.

789
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
You need to comfort Guanwang first.

790
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,690
Alright.

791
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,600
When will you go?

792
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,420
First thing tomorrow.

793
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,340
Then I'll go tomorrow afternoon.

794
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,120
Do you know what Yaoyao

795
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,320
is doing in Hangzhou?

796
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,840
Goodbye, teacher.

797
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,980
What are you doing?

798
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,210
Who is Shi Diandian?

799
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,160
I checked the crew registry today,

800
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,760
she came to see you the day before the incident.

801
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,120
Dad said

802
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,580
she was the one who took Tong to the hospital.

803
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,360
Was it her?

804
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,940
Is her contact information in the registry?

805
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,560
I'll check tomorrow.

806
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,120
Could you help me check now?

807
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,480
Thanks.

808
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,920
Production Manager

809
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,180
Production Assistant

810
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:11,920
DIT Data Manager
