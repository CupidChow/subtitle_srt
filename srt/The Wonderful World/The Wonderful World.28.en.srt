1
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,460
So we still need to go far away.

2
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,780
Life doesn't stop,

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,690
and the journey continues.

4
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,840
Doesn't anyone

5
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,780
look after you?

6
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,880
My life is my own,

7
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
and so is my path.

8
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,450
Come with me.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What about my dad?

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,130
What your dad says doesn't matter.

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
It does matter.

12
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,090
We have love.

13
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,160
I have love

14
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,320
with my dad too,

15
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,280
but that's a separate issue.

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,330
We can go anywhere in the world.

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,120
I'll sing,

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,199
you'll dance.

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
The sky will be our blanket,

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
the earth our bed.

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
Everywhere will be a place of happiness.

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
What exactly do you see in me?

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
The sky as a blanket,

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
the earth as a bed.

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,920
Such a passionate invitation.

26
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,720
You are the source of happiness.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,960
Going far away,

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,240
you'll get nothing but happiness.

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,620
I ask for nothing more.

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
That all sounds nice,

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,120
but...

32
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,400
There's something wrong with you.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm perfectly healthy.

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,400
That's not what I meant.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,420
Are you seriously that clueless?

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,040
I am who I am.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,560
Do you actually love me or not?

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,720
Love is also free,

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,320
only free love is beautiful.

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,720
What if

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,780
someday it's not beautiful anymore?

42
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,079
Then let love

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,250
fade away with the wind.

44
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,360
Then I'll sing

45
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
to express my sorrow.

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,240
We really do get along well.

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
That's why fate

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,640
brought us together.

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,400
You can.

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
Can you stop talking like song lyrics?

51
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,960
I already know you're cool.

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,050
We'll leave tomorrow morning,

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,880
at 10 AM.

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,460
We'll go to Yunnan.

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,240
So you mean

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,440
that...

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
I need to go

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,440
pack my bags right now?

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,650
You don't need any luggage.

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,620
Could you bear to leave me behind?

61
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,720
Aren't you coming with me?

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,680
Do you think

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,120
I could leave my dad

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,329
and Wen Xiaoyao?

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
Could I give up

66
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
the ballet stage?

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,530
You can do it.

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,640
Why?

69
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,810
Because of love.

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,040
Because of you, I guess.

71
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,960
Because of us.

72
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,000
Tomorrow

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
at 10 AM.

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,600
Right?

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,020
West Railway Station.

76
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,960
That's settled then.

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,440
What's wrong?

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,000
Did Zhou Butong ever talk to you

79
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,520
about going far away?

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,159
No.

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Then what if he

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,890
stopped dancing

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,560
and left me

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,659
to wander with you?

85
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,210
He would.

86
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,250
Did he tell you that?

87
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,480
No.

88
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,480
He said

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,960
he's not going anywhere anymore

90
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,280
and wants to settle down with me.

91
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,720
Right?

92
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,880
What's wrong?

93
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,440
What's this?

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,000
My mother's qipao.

95
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,680
One for each of us.

96
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,100
This one's for you.

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,159
These are the interview questions.

98
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,200
I found them online,

99
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,600
the 20 most common HR interview questions.

100
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,810
Why did you choose our company?

101
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
Because your company

102
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,280
has great growth potential

103
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,000
and

104
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,050
excellent industry performance.

105
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,440
That's just flattery, right?

106
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,700
Yes.

107
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,820
You should tell the truth.

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,330
Why should we

109
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
hire you?

110
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,800
Because I need to pay rent

111
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
and make a living.

112
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,980
Please tell us your greatest personal quality.

113
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,360
I don't have any special qualities,

114
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,240
I'm just ordinary,

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,700
neither smart nor pretty.

116
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,200
That's not true,

117
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,860
I think you're the prettiest.

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
That's just flattery, right?

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,260
I'm telling the truth.

120
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,020
What's your motto?

121
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,280
Come to work happy,

122
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,720
go home safe and sound.

123
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,780
What kind of boss would you like to work with?

124
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,680
What kind?

125
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,440
Someone with shoulder pain

126
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,960
who needs frequent massages.

127
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,620
That works.

128
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,680
Tell me about

129
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,010
your family situation.

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,560
My dad, my mom, and me.

131
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,640
Is there more?

132
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,120
Surely

133
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,100
that's not all?

134
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,420
You add something.

135
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,040
Dad, mom,

136
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:36,880
you,

137
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,000
and me,

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
how's that?

139
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Want some coffee?

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,360
Yes.

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,840
Wait here.

142
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,000
Welcome.

143
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,280
Hello,

144
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,120
two coffees please.

145
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,560
Sure.

146
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,640
Run! Quick!

147
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,640
What's wrong?

148
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,200
Why?

149
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,440
We didn't pay.

150
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Why didn't you pay?

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,680
I've never done anything bad before.

152
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,200
No.

153
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,120
Why?

154
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,840
Hurry!

155
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,160
Stop!

156
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,840
I can't, I can't, I can't,

157
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,970
I can't run anymore.

158
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,680
You need to exercise more.

159
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,700
We can't do bad things,

160
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,640
I'll go pay.

161
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,600
Here.

162
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,640
Mom.

163
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,120
Diandian,

164
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,159
how are you?

165
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,890
Pretty good.

166
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,760
How's Beijing?

167
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,920
It's nice.

168
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Made new friends?

169
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,560
He's coming out,

170
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,490
I have to go, Mom.

171
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm sorry,

172
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,040
excuse me,

173
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,680
sorry, sorry.

174
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,480
It's okay,

175
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,960
don't worry about it.

176
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,700
You paid for it.

177
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,210
You acted so convincingly,

178
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,610
I actually believed it.

179
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,760
Slow down.

180
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,490
I don't care.

181
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,980
You led the way before,

182
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,370
now it's my turn to lead.

183
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,799
Goodbye, Dad,

184
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,380
goodbye, Xiaoyao.

185
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,080
Destiny is calling me,

186
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm heading toward love.

187
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,380
No one is more unreliable than me.

188
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,200
Won't you say something nice?

189
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,800
Wish me a safe journey

190
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,600
and good luck with my wandering.

191
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,890
Xiaoyao.

192
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,840
Uncle Hui.

193
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,400
See that cop up ahead?

194
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,320
Yes, I do.

195
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
I've raised both of you for 20 years,

196
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,720
haven't shown any favoritism, have I?

197
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
No favoritism.

198
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,690
I wasn't asking you.

199
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,220
No favoritism.

200
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,520
If Xiaomi dares to get off that bus,

201
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,800
I'll destroy that guy.

202
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,960
I don't care anymore,

203
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,160
I'll spend the rest of my life in prison.

204
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,720
I love Xiaomi,

205
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,600
but that doesn't mean I don't love you too,

206
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,330
understand?

207
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,080
I understand.

208
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,760
From now on,

209
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,420
Xiaomi will probably hate me.

210
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,560
You need to visit me

211
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,920
in prison regularly.

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,480
Okay.

213
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,100
How do you plan to destroy him?

214
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,920
There's a golf club in the trunk,

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,730
I brought it.

216
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,060
Why are you stopping here?

217
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Dropping someone off.

218
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,560
Who?

219
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,320
Me.

220
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,640
Where are you going?

221
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,320
Yunnan.

222
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,770
Get out quickly,

223
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,200
no parking allowed here,

224
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,530
I'm giving you a ticket.

225
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,840
Move along, move along.

226
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Beijing W路86151.

227
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,560
Uncle Hui.

228
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,480
Xiaomi won't leave.

229
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,060
How do you know?

230
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,770
She didn't bring any of her things.

231
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,000
Look, look,

232
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,040
do you see?

233
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,760
She's upset right now,

234
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,080
let's

235
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,000
drive around and come back for her.

236
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,600
You think she'll still be there when we come back?

237
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,080
Yes.

238
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
Beijing W路86151

239
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,640
Hurry up, let's go!

240
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,920
Beijing W路86151

241
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,520
What's the rush, 51!

242
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,080
Beijing W路86151

243
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,840
I thought about it half the night and realized,

244
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,280
you're not just a chauvinist,

245
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,010
you're actually mentally ill.

246
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,100
Incurable.

247
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,560
When you grow up

248
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,880
and get over yourself,

249
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,740
you'll be fine.

250
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,770
You're not leaving?

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
I'll wait until you stop wandering,

252
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
and take me home.

253
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,500
In this vast sea of people,

254
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,040
you might never see me again.

255
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,600
How could I not see you again?

256
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
You know where I live,

257
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,600
and where I work.

258
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,820
You're talking about our hearts,

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,840
our hearts

260
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,100
that have grown apart.

261
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,760
The cruder your words are,

262
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,520
the more sense they make to me.

263
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,400
I love you.

264
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,940
It's completely unreliable.

265
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,690
But I believe it,

266
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,280
yet I don't.

267
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,970
Let's go.

268
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,800
Is he gone?

269
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,680
I'll call Xiaomi.

270
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,700
Yaoyao.

271
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,720
Look, is that Xiaomi?

272
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,120
Xiaomi.

273
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,520
Uncle Hui,

274
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
go ahead and pick up Xiaomi,

275
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,120
then come back for me later.

276
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,250
Where are you going?

277
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,760
Yaoyao.

278
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Xiaomi.

279
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,000
What are you doing?

280
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,120
You hurt Xiaomi.

281
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,240
I never meant to hurt anyone.

282
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
People like you cause the most harm.

283
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,570
What's it to you?

284
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Xiaomi is me,

285
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,320
and I am her.

286
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,440
Forget it,

287
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
I'm done talking to you.

288
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,120
None of you understand anyway.

289
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,360
You're the one who doesn't understand.

290
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,090
You gave up someone wonderful.

291
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,520
Sometimes

292
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,040
in life, you have to let things go

293
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,410
to gain something else.

294
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,560
Jerk.

295
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,760
Think about it,

296
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,090
isn't that how it works?

297
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,320
Xiao'erduo.

298
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,360
I need to call her.

299
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,330
Where did she go?

300
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,010
Looking for you.

301
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,340
What are you doing?

302
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,800
Xiao Yao is over there.

303
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,160
It's no fun being with you.

304
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,560
Who's fun to be with then?

305
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,080
Everyone's gone and you're still getting worked up?

306
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm never getting married.

307
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,200
I'll just take care of you, okay?

308
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,090
Then let me comfort you.

309
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,920
No need.

310
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,850
I've always been the one comforting you instead.

311
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,720
What's wrong?

312
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,900
I'm completely finished.

313
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,440
Director Yang had a talk with me.

314
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,660
He made it clear

315
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,640
that the troupe must support young artists' work,

316
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,370
the market is getting younger,

317
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,450
and I must respect Yang Yun.

318
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,700
How am I supposed to respect her more?

319
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,090
I even went to her home to show respect.

320
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,540
She wants to both dance and choreograph.

321
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,970
What am I supposed to do?

322
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,660
She's reaching for the stars.

323
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,200
You're so annoying,

324
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,940
going on and on with the same complaints.

325
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,480
Director Yang made this clear ages ago.

326
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,120
All day long it's just your petty problems.

327
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,090
You're really done,

328
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,420
completely finished.

329
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm listening.

330
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,660
Let me tell you,

331
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,810
one of your lead performers

332
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,100
almost ran away from home.

333
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,800
If she's gone, how will you choreograph and rehearse?

334
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,720
Are you even listening to me?

335
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,940
So what should I do?

336
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,740
Deal with it

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,730
and get lost.

338
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,940
Where are we going?

339
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,720
What was the saddest moment

340
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
in your life?

341
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,540
What about you?

342
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,930
You go first.

343
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,570
When my mom left.

344
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,000
When I grew up and realized

345
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,530
that my mom was really gone.

346
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,650
When Zhou Tong left.

347
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,650
When I ran into Xu Tian in Hangzhou.

348
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,490
Yesterday when I saw

349
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
the photo of Xu Tian with my mom.

350
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,900
I'm embarrassed to even say mine now.

351
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,760
If you meet Little Ears again,

352
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,160
would you still feel sad?

353
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,520
There's no future there.

354
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,000
Sorry, but I'm still heartbroken.

355
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,200
Where do you want to go now?

356
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,130
I'll go with you.

357
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,520
I want to dance.

358
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,690
I used to want to dance when I was happy.

359
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,210
Turns out I want to when I'm sad too.

360
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,720
What?

361
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,700
It's from Little Ears.

362
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,040
What is it?

363
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,130
I don't know.

364
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,760
You can check

365
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
when you get back.

366
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,480
Mr. Fang, I have to go.

367
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,940
She's coming down.

368
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,890
Goodbye.

369
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,120
I got the job.

370
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,360
Monthly salary of 6,000,

371
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,220
annual raises,

372
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,850
full benefits package,

373
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,560
and even transportation allowance.

374
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,600
You're from the south,

375
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,880
aren't you going back to Hangzhou?

376
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,940
Are you going back?

377
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Wherever you are,

378
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,880
that's where I'll be.

379
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,500
As long as I'm with you,

380
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,080
it doesn't matter where we are.

381
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,210
That makes me happy.

382
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,240
Would you like to buy some flowers, sir?

383
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,800
No, thank you.

384
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,760
Buy a bouquet for the pretty lady,

385
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,820
she looks so happy.

386
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,480
No thanks.

387
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,680
The flowers are so beautiful.

388
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,480
Do you want it?

389
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,860
Who asks a beautiful woman if she wants flowers?

390
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,090
I've never bought flowers before.

391
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,680
Even when I was with my ex-girlfriend,

392
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,010
I never bought flowers.

393
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,840
She didn't

394
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,080
like them.

395
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,720
Let me ask you something,

396
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
when did you

397
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,810
start liking me?

398
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,840
The first time we met.

399
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,220
Where was that?

400
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,560
On the street.

401
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,600
Why?

402
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
We had a connection in our past life,

403
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,140
like meeting an old friend again.

404
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
I'm a man.

405
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,800
Dancing as Xiaoqing.

406
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,140
Why not ask Qiaomi to do it?

407
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,120
Is there something wrong with the moves

408
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,360
or is it me?

409
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,290
Lie down.

410
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,820
Let me massage you,

411
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,330
there's nobody around anyway.

412
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,980
Do you really want to dance

413
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,250
or work on your own 'Jinse'?

414
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
Whatever you choose,

415
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
I'll support you.

416
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,170
Say what you want to say.

417
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,760
I've already said it,

418
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,160
but you won't listen.

419
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,420
I'm listening.

420
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,040
You and Qiaomi barely even speak to each other.

421
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,640
Xiaoqing and Bai Suzhen

422
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
aren't like that.

423
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,770
Who's there?

424
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,320
Come in.

425
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,320
I'm sorry,

426
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,040
I didn't mean to intrude.

427
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,450
What are you two doing here?

428
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,980
We wanted to practice.

429
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,450
Dancing.

430
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,700
Just the two of you?

431
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,440
I'm sorry, Yun,

432
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,490
I didn't know you and Yin were here.

433
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,480
Don't go.

434
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,120
Qiaomi is here now.

435
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,160
Jinse,

436
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,020
Xiaoyao, why don't you try the White Snake role?

437
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,600
Don't you want to dance?

438
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,280
I do,

439
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,130
but I don't know how to dance Jinse.

440
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,280
Aren't we just here to dance?

441
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,760
I really envy you guys

442
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,640
being able to dance together whenever you want.

443
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,760
It doesn't matter if you don't know how.

444
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,720
Just imagine the White Snake and Xiaoqing from 'Jinse'

445
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,250
and dance however you like.

446
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,960
Let's

447
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,770
take the subway.

448
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,420
Didn't you call a Didi?

449
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,960
The car is parked quite far away.

450
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,490
I'm worried you'll be cold.

451
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Hugging this pillow,

452
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,890
I'm not cold.

453
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,760
Should we

454
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,600
tell your

455
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,400
mother?

456
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,680
Tell her what?

457
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,800
That we're

458
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
living together.

459
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,920
It's not really together,

460
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,850
just roommates.

461
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,240
Okay.

462
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,900
If you want to tell someone, go ahead.

463
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,330
Who would I tell?

464
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,040
Your family.

465
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,120
You're my only family now.

466
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,680
I'm an orphan.

467
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,280
That's so sad.

468
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,700
The world is so big,

469
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,020
but having met you,

470
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,620
I don't feel sad at all.

471
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,260
The car is here.

472
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,930
Let's go.

473
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,320
Hello.

474
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,080
Alright,

475
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,160
please wait a moment.

476
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,480
He's just across the street.

477
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,120
Should we ask him

478
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,050
to drive over or should we go there?

479
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,010
Ask him to come here.

480
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,280
I want to stand with you a little longer.

481
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,610
Okay.

482
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,720
Could you please

483
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,600
drive over to us?

484
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,640
We're just

485
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,700
across the street,

486
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
holding a pillow.

487
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,600
And a bouquet of flowers.

488
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,200
And a bouquet of flowers,

489
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
great, thank you.

490
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,300
What are you doing?

491
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,680
I'm filming you a bit.

492
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,260
Right here.

493
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,360
Perfect.

494
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,320
Good.

495
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,100
White Snake and Xiaoqing in the human world.

496
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,240
Will Sister Yun agree?

497
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
Sister Yun knows you dance 'Jinse' well.

498
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,080
I'd say

499
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,400
there's a 60-70% chance.

500
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,880
What about the director?

501
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,880
The director?

502
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,450
If you dance White Snake, he's in trouble.

503
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,720
If Sister Yun stops dancing,

504
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,380
you'll take his position.

505
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,650
So what should we do?

506
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,650
You're always thinking about others.

507
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,420
The director isn't just anybody.

508
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,740
Just focus on dancing White Snake first.

509
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,400
Aunt Gang has our dad.

510
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,320
Call Uncle Hui.

511
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,240
Tell him you're fine now.

512
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,720
I won't.

513
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,000
How could I be fine?

514
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,720
I have angina.

515
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,240
Little Ears

516
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,000
is on the train to Yunnan now.

517
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,450
Don't worry,

518
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,690
I'm here.

519
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,460
I don't want to go home.

520
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,760
Me too.

521
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Let's go

522
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,600
visit

523
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,760
Zhou Tong

524
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,560
and then your mother.

525
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,240
Why didn't you show me

526
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,440
these books earlier?

527
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,960
You can't even pay the rent,

528
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,800
and you're buying new equipment?

529
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,320
If I don't update the equipment and computers,

530
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,560
even fewer people will come.

531
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,620
Everything I bought is second-hand.

532
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,920
The place across the street

533
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,800
got a complete set of new equipment,

534
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,920
so everyone prefers to pull all-nighters there.

535
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
What about these?

536
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,960
Taxes, utilities, fire safety.

537
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,610
None of which can go unpaid.

538
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
So I'm the only one who can cut costs?

539
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,440
Mr. Song,

540
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,080
I'm anxious about this too.

541
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,560
Don't worry anymore,

542
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,260
worrying won't pay the bills.

543
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,640
Mr. Song,

544
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,960
I really don't have any options.

545
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,720
I know.

546
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,370
I won't push you out.

547
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,520
This first floor would be empty,

548
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,900
and that would feel too quiet.

549
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,200
From now on, I'll waive the rent.

550
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,080
Let's treat each other

551
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,200
like family.

552
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Mr. Song,

553
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,240
that doesn't

554
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,240
seem right.

555
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,360
Listen to you,

556
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,800
you must be thrilled inside.

557
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,600
This won't work.

558
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Regular expenses can't be avoided.

559
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,690
What do you mean?

560
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,400
Neither of you knows how to do business.

561
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,440
Business is about keeping things separate.

562
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
You're making decisions for me now?

563
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Let me make a decision for you and see if you like it.

564
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,400
Listen carefully first.

565
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,600
The three of us:

566
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,440
she handles operations.

567
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,040
You provide the storefront,

568
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,500
meaning the fixed assets.

569
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,860
And I, as a rich guy,

570
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,060
being wealthy,

571
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,120
with more money than sense,

572
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,320
will be the investor.

573
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,680
Rent, utilities,

574
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,320
equipment upgrades -

575
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
I'll cover it all.

576
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,010
You don't need to worry about my expenses.

577
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,120
The three of us

578
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,650
are all equal partners,

579
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,660
no one asks anyone else for money.

580
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
One-third each,

581
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
we all get a share.

582
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,440
If we lose money, that's life.

583
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,160
If we make money,

584
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,820
we split it.

585
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,720
Understand?

586
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
Don't look at her.

587
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
My idea is Mr. Song's idea.

588
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,120
What do you say?

589
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,010
Don't look at me.

590
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,800
Is this really appropriate?

591
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,260
Let's just do what he says.

592
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,160
I'm willing to,

593
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,800
but what if later...

594
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,250
Don't you get it yet?

595
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,960
From now on,

596
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,250
I'll be the one calling the shots here.

597
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,000
I understand.

598
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,280
Tomorrow we'll draft the contract.

599
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,680
Not just the first floor,

600
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,050
or the second floor,

601
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,480
I'll hand everything over to the trust.

602
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,120
What are you doing?

603
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,170
Class is about to start,

604
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,100
I'm just setting up the speakers.

605
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,120
Hire someone to do it.

606
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,610
I might as well hire myself.

607
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,560
How did

608
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,320
my

609
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,560
first-floor proposal

610
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,440
go just now?

611
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,210
Pretty good.

612
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,460
Then let's move up level by level,

613
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,780
I'll handle the second floor too.

614
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,440
Go ahead.

615
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,400
I'm now

616
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,159
a sponsor of Guanwang

617
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,090
Entertainment.

618
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,719
No,

619
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,679
more like a shareholder.

620
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,890
I suppose so.

621
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,560
I'm also a sponsor of the ballet company.

622
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,480
It's easy to make things happen.

623
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,520
Let's turn this place

624
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,400
into

625
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,040
a ballet arts

626
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,840
training center.

627
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,340
Kids can have their regular classes.

628
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,370
It's empty most of the time anyway.

629
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,080
Then we'll bring in students from the arts school.

630
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,440
Get the Cultural Bureau's stamp of approval.

631
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,200
Open it up

632
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,650
for public enrollment.

633
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,040
Then get an official

634
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,360
partnership agreement

635
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,760
with the ballet company to hang on the wall,

636
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,000
more effective than Zhao Gang's photo.

637
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,120
He's just retired,

638
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,170
so he can legitimately come teach.

639
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,960
It'll be like training

640
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,520
future talent for the ballet company.

641
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,360
When that happens,

642
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,020
don't complain it's too busy.

643
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,980
You really have a knack for business.

644
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,080
I lost that craving long ago,

645
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,600
I just can't bear

646
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,060
to see you working so hard.

647
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,920
You're quite the smooth talker.

648
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,850
I'm not done yet.

649
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,120
Once this place gets busy,

650
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,340
you'll be willing to hire people.

651
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,640
Hire someone to clean,

652
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,850
add a secretary.

653
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,480
You can just sit

654
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,660
on the third floor and enjoy life.

655
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,460
Why don't I quite believe you?

656
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,010
What don't you believe?

657
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,880
You being so nice to me,

658
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,010
you must be up to something?

659
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,450
I am up to something.

660
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm determined to have a good life with you.

661
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,820
Class is starting.

662
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,680
Mr. Qiao,

663
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,120
even the dance group is connected now,

664
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,920
what about me?

665
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,720
Aren't you still in school?

666
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,480
Senior year.

667
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,100
What's your major?

668
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,780
Directing.

669
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,650
How are your skills?

670
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,570
Pretty good.

671
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,760
You have two options:

672
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,680
joining the dance group is harder,

673
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,600
while becoming

674
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,480
Master Zhao's assistant is easier.

675
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,160
I'll take the assistant position with Master Zhao,

676
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
is that possible?

677
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,610
Drop the question mark.

678
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,960
Thank you, Mr. Qiao.

679
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,160
Going again?

680
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
At this time of day,

681
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,600
I just want to go dancing,

682
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,660
get some exercise.

683
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,280
I always feel like Zhou Tong

684
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,740
is still dancing in there.

685
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,560
I've already taken charge of the first and second floors,

686
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,520
so I might as well

687
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,280
take over the third floor too.

688
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,760
Do it.

689
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,800
Zhou Tong,

690
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,330
didn't he love traveling everywhere before?

691
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,120
Make a list of all the places he's been to,

692
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,040
draw up an itinerary,

693
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,800
create a map.

694
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,450
If he went in spring,

695
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,640
we'll go in spring.

696
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,920
If he visited in autumn,

697
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,980
we'll go in autumn.

698
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,760
Following his schedule and locations,

699
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,890
I'll accompany you,

700
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,560
and we'll retrace his steps.

701
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,760
Zhou Tong has been to so many places.

702
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,140
We have plenty of time ahead of us.

703
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,300
Have you been drinking some kind of love potion?

704
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,320
With Zhou Tong gone,

705
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,930
what about Xu Tianxing?

706
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,050
What do you mean?

707
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,900
I'll ask him to come

708
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,120
and show you his square dancing.

709
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,120
Can he do it?

710
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,250
He's going wild.

711
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,920
As soon as he got to Beijing,

712
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,980
he had a big drinking session with me and sang all night.

713
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,650
I've been thinking about that kid.

714
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,500
Uncle Qiao.

715
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,600
Where are you?

716
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,930
Nothing urgent, right?

717
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,380
I'm busy right now.

718
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,680
I'll send you

719
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,000
my location later.

720
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,860
What is it, Uncle Qiao?

721
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,380
You'll see when you get there.

722
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,650
Xu Tian is heading over now.

723
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,880
He really listens to you.

724
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,820
We're buddies,

725
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,680
friends despite our age difference,

726
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
with a lot of fate between us.

727
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,000
Director Qiao, Director Song,

728
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,400
um,

729
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,810
should I draft the contract first?

730
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,000
Is that okay?

731
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,640
Fine.

732
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,680
We're all shareholders,

733
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,040
doesn't matter who drafts it.

734
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,570
Go ahead.

735
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,820
Look how pleased he is,

736
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
finally got himself out of trouble.

737
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,960
I arranged to meet Zhao Gang

738
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,640
at

739
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,040
the square dancing area.

740
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,920
Why?

741
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,960
I came here

742
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,000
specifically to take you there.

743
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,460
He called me this morning,

744
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,940
completely freaking out,

745
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,760
the bureau called him in for a talk.

746
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
They're still making him step down.

747
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,570
Let's squeeze him even harder,

748
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,000
push him to the edge so he can rise again.

749
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,720
Perfect time

750
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,680
to make our arrangement

751
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,810
clear to him as well.

752
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,960
What do we need to make clear?

753
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,890
We have to be transparent with him.

754
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,600
Zhou Tong says

755
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,200
there are no two identical leaves in the world.

756
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,400
Definitely not.

757
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,900
And no two people are the same either.

758
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,890
Definitely not.

759
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,640
So we should be a bit happier.

760
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,720
Right.

761
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,520
Guess

762
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,160
what's inside.

763
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,240
If you want to know, just open it.

764
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,280
I can't bear to.

765
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,880
Let's look at it when we get home.

766
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,760
Has he arrived in Yunnan?

767
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,680
Not yet,

768
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,840
he can't afford the high-speed train.

769
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,440
I just texted him,

770
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,600
and he sent me a photo.

771
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,900
What kind of photo?

772
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,400
Nothing special,

773
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,080
just blue sky,

774
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,040
white clouds,

775
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,850
and power lines.

776
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,000
He's nuts.

777
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,220
What do you like about him?

778
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,120
I don't like him anymore,

779
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,160
I'm heartbroken.

780
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,160
From now on,

781
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,690
we'll depend on each other.

782
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,640
I think so too.

783
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,760
Some people,

784
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,880
if they want to be nice to you,

785
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,760
will say

786
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
they want to sleep with you at night.

787
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,850
Did he tell you that?

788
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,120
Some people, if they want to be with you, will say

789
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,600
they want to wake up

790
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,120
with you in the morning and enjoy the sunshine.

791
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,320
He's the latter type,

792
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,360
which is more confusing.

793
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,320
But actually,

794
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,100
he's just like the first type.

795
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,360
Maybe he really just wants

796
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,080
to wake up

797
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,880
and enjoy the sunshine with you.

798
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:02,840
Look.

799
