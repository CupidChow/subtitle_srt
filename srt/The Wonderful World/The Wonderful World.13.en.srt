1
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,920
Beijing is huge and congested,

2
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,039
it took so long to get here from the hotel

3
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,500
that it's almost dark now.

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,170
Why are you meeting her?

5
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,570
Wen Xiaoyao,

6
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
I'll have to see her sooner or later.

7
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
Building 2, Room 201.

8
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,220
I'll wait for you outside.

9
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,020
Over there.

10
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,140
Xiaomi.

11
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,200
What?

12
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,650
Stop riding,

13
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,600
get in the car.

14
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,000
No way.

15
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,880
Come on, hurry up,

16
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,610
be a good kid.

17
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,720
What's going on between you two?

18
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,400
Nothing.

19
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,100
The premiere is tomorrow.

20
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,800
One of you plays Xiao Qing,

21
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,480
the other plays Xiao Bai.

22
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,240
It's such a wonderful opportunity!

23
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,640
Why are you two fighting?

24
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,159
Bai Suzhen falls in love with Xu Xian,

25
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,080
Xiao Qing disapproves but can't stop it.

26
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,040
We're having a disagreement,

27
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,700
just getting into character.

28
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,320
You think I'm stupid?

29
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,440
Why are you sitting here?

30
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,460
Did you go up there?

31
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,040
No.

32
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,420
No one's there.

33
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,060
Do you want one?

34
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,080
It's this window.

35
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,400
Tell me,

36
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,520
why did you

37
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,120
bring me here?

38
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,160
Where did you

39
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,100
disappear at noon?

40
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
I saw him.

41
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,480
Who?

42
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,200
He was

43
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,770
on the overpass near the hotel.

44
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,340
I followed him,

45
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,530
thinking it was you.

46
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,360
Then I saw Wen Xiaoyao holding his hand.

47
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,600
And then?

48
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,600
He got on a bus,

49
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,290
and I followed Wen Xiaoyao to the ballet company.

50
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,680
She's performing

51
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
as Bai Suzhen in 'Legend of the White Snake' tomorrow.

52
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,170
What a coincidence.

53
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,880
We spent so much effort

54
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,000
checking surveillance footage in Hangzhou,

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,400
and we run into him as soon as we arrive in Beijing.

56
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,560
Tomorrow we'll even watch his girlfriend

57
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,760
perform in 'Legend of the White Snake'.

58
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,170
Her mother is Jia Sulan.

59
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,320
Did

60
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,840
you

61
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,240
ask her about it?

62
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,130
How can there be such a coincidence in this world?

63
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,810
What kind of person is Wen Xiaoyao?

64
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,460
You'll see for yourself soon.

65
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,640
Tell me quickly,

66
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
why did it happen?

67
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,560
I already told you it's nothing.

68
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,320
Xiaoyao.

69
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,400
Zhou Tong.

70
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,640
Why does every bit of bad luck

71
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,900
have to fall on this mother and daughter?

72
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,760
You're the one who arranged Zhou Butong.

73
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,090
That's because you asked me to arrange it.

74
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,960
Zhou Tong is a good kid,

75
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,240
really good.

76
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,380
Dad, stop meddling in my business with Xiaoyao.

77
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,090
It's not that I don't like Zhou Butong.

78
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,960
But in just these few days,

79
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,240
they've actually gotten together,

80
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,370
do you realize that?

81
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,360
It's perfectly normal they got together.

82
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,220
What are you being awkward about?

83
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,020
I'm not being awkward.

84
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,780
I don't see that at all.

85
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
Well, Xiaoyao was being awkward too.

86
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,880
Why don't you say anything about her?

87
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,520
You're being completely unreasonable

88
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,720
and bullying people.

89
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,480
How dare I bully you?

90
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,900
You bullying me is perfectly normal,

91
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,400
but you can't bully Xiaoyao.

92
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,480
I didn't.

93
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,000
Uncle Hui,

94
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,880
we're fine.

95
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,080
You two have

96
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,320
grown up together,

97
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,250
what obstacle can't you overcome?

98
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,740
Apologize to Xiaoyao.

99
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,080
Xiaomi, I'm sorry.

100
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,059
Apologize.

101
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,679
Cut it out.

102
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,409
Dad told me to apologize to you.

103
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Say you're sorry.

104
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,000
Uncle Hui,

105
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,640
please stop.

106
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
Don't provoke me,

107
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,620
I'm really getting angry.

108
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Say you're sorry.

109
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,120
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,320
I had nothing but good intentions,

111
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,240
I meant no harm,

112
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,090
why am I always the one at fault?

113
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,240
Come back.

114
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,040
Xiaomi.

115
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,520
Xiaomi.

116
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,810
Xiaoyao,

117
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,760
get in the car.

118
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,120
Xiaomi is gone.

119
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,320
Get in the car,

120
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,860
she won't let herself suffer.

121
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,600
It doesn't take a genius to figure out

122
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
she's either gone back to Park Avenue

123
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,640
or to my place.

124
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,760
Tomorrow's the premiere,

125
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,160
go home and get some rest.

126
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,850
I don't know when

127
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,480
she'll be back.

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,930
If you're tired,

129
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,970
you can rest your head on me.

130
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,250
How can I do that?

131
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,840
There are people around.

132
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Diandian,

133
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,400
do you know why

134
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,000
we got together

135
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
so quickly?

136
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,210
In such a short time.

137
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,400
Tell me.

138
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
I've been living on my own

139
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,400
since

140
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
I was 10,

141
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,880
managing everything by myself,

142
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,380
it was familiar

143
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,490
but exhausting.

144
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,880
Then

145
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,130
I met you,

146
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,100
and I love it when you take charge,

147
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,040
I also love how

148
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,100
you treat me

149
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
like I'm yours,

150
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,650
it feels so relaxing

151
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,760
and safe.

152
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,410
I know you're afraid

153
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,160
because you

154
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,280
lost someone

155
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
you loved before,

156
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,740
but think about me,

157
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,760
I'm scared too,

158
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm terrified

159
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,720
that I might make

160
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,800
one mistake and lose you,

161
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,200
or that

162
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,340
you might not want to remember me,

163
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,160
then what would

164
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
my future be like?

165
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,520
If, as you say,

166
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,840
there really is such a thing as past life connections,

167
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,160
then I already have

168
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,720
you now.

169
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,780
Don't you want to meet her?

170
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,930
I might just want

171
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
to see the person

172
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,360
who looks like me,

173
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,610
but what does she

174
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
have to do with me?

175
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,040
Really?

176
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,240
Actually, when

177
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,900
you said you wanted to bring me to see her,

178
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,050
I was thinking about

179
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,560
how I could

180
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
reassure you.

181
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,210
You could have just said no.

182
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,880
That would have made you even more worried.

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,730
Let's wait another 10 minutes,

184
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,930
if she doesn't come back, we'll leave.

185
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Fifteen minutes.

186
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,970
Fifteen minutes is a long time.

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,800
It's just these fifteen minutes in our whole life.

188
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,720
Okay,

189
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,610
if you're tired,

190
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,980
just rest a bit.

191
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,400
Beijing W86151

192
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Beijing W-86151.

193
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,000
Xiaoyao.

194
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,820
After all these years,

195
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,930
you're still so formal with me.

196
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,680
Don't treat yourself like an outsider.

197
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,760
I'm not.

198
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,220
You should be like Xiaomi,

199
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,840
not afraid to yell at me.

200
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,800
In my heart,

201
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,000
you're just like Xiaomi.

202
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,720
Thank you, Uncle Hui.

203
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,680
Still so formal.

204
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
And you know what,

205
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,640
Xiaomi's heart

206
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,800
is full of you.

207
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,290
My position isn't as high as yours.

208
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,290
She depends on you too much.

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
As her big sister,

210
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,100
you should be a little more patient with her.

211
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,770
If Xiaomi ever stops talking to me,

212
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
it would be as if my entire life

213
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,300
since childhood never happened.

214
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,940
That won't happen.

215
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,860
She'd rather ignore me

216
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,060
than ever stop talking to you.

217
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,260
Just wait a bit longer.

218
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,760
The one who surrenders

219
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,090
will definitely be her.

220
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,840
Uncle Hui,

221
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,980
I'm heading up now.

222
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,880
Get some rest.

223
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,000
His clothes

224
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,580
are similar to what you're wearing underneath.

225
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,080
This sweater of mine?

226
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,520
Same color.

227
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,920
How many minutes has it been?

228
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,480
It should be

229
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,500
about ten minutes now.

230
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,920
Three years ago

231
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,040
during a company physical exam,

232
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
when I thought I was catching a cold,

233
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,080
I ran into him.

234
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:19,960
I see.

235
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,660
He's a sales rep at the company

236
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,760
who's usually not in Ningbo.

237
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,250
And then?

238
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,330
He travels frequently,

239
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
so we can only video call each other.

240
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,500
The longer we talk,

241
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,380
the emptier I feel inside.

242
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,690
I've arrived at Uncle Hui's place.

243
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Even if we don't talk much today,

244
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,840
we'll still be staring at each other pretending we can't sleep.

245
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,560
Tomorrow,

246
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,170
you'll also fall off your brother Yin,

247
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,800
it's bad luck.

248
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,520
I'm ignoring you now.

249
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,420
It's so nice to run into you again.

250
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,490
Actually, the first time I saw you,

251
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,580
I had a really good impression of you.

252
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:48,760
Do

253
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
you like flowers?

254
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,840
Lao Shi told me before,

255
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,320
about when your mother passed away.

256
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,040
Yes, I do.

257
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,800
Then why

258
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,620
don't you keep any at home?

259
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,690
Flowers.

260
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,839
Just flowers.

261
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,720
Then why don't you turn off that lamp by the bed?

262
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,970
A lamp is just a lamp.

263
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,940
Would you consider yourself obsessive?

264
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,640
I guess so.

265
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,140
Mom said two obsessive people

266
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,900
are perfect together.

267
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,740
Just right.

268
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,740
Has it been 15 minutes?

269
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,900
Just about.

270
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,530
Shall we go back?

271
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,920
Are we still going to the show tomorrow?

272
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:41,880
No.

273
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,560
Thank you for being so nice to me.

274
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,420
Do you want more water?

275
00:17:59,480 --> 00:17:59,920
No.

276
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,920
Then I won't bring it,

277
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,090
it's heavy to carry.

278
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,080
Mom,

279
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,120
have you seen my phone?

280
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
I haven't seen it.

281
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,760
Look for it yourself.

282
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,320
Uncle Hui?

283
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,290
Are you going to bed?

284
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,160
Soon.

285
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,360
If you two weren't arguing,

286
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,000
I wouldn't be so lucky.

287
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,760
Daughter,

288
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
finally spending the night at home.

289
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,280
Qiaomi said

290
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,800
for the first three days of the premiere,

291
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,930
you'll stay at home.

292
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,320
It's been over ten years,

293
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,250
first time ever.

294
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,120
Is Xiaomi asleep?

295
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
I'm asleep.

296
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,840
I'm pretty carefree.

297
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,170
Xiaoyao,

298
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:27,880
tomorrow,

299
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,200
I'll drive with Xiaomi to pick you up.

300
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,700
No need, Uncle Hui.

301
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,720
Your Aunt Gang just called me,

302
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,000
rambling on like a nervous wreck,

303
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
afraid something might happen.

304
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,560
We need to

305
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
put safety first.

306
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,180
I'll drop you both at the theater,

307
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,040
noon rehearsal,

308
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,880
then in the afternoon,

309
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,840
interviews and makeup,

310
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,920
preparing for the show.

311
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,480
Got it?

312
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,200
I heard you.

313
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,480
I've got both lead actors in my car,

314
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,440
one Green Snake

315
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,920
and one White Snake. Got the whole package!

316
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,240
I'm living large.

317
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,300
Get some sleep.

318
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,680
Peach leaves sharp at the tip,

319
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,840
willow leaves covering the sky,

320
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,480
honorable elder sitting before me,

321
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,360
please listen to what I have to say.

322
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,640
Brother Tong.

323
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,000
Aren't you supposed to be

324
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,120
on morning or evening shift?

325
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,680
Getting up so early

326
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,560
in the morning.

327
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,610
Brushing teeth.

328
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,770
Brushing teeth?

329
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,800
You got up this early just to brush your teeth?

330
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,160
Fine,

331
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,290
you're impressive,

332
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,130
so hygienic.

333
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,410
Let me discuss something with you.

334
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,220
You should find a man soon.

335
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,520
Being alone all day

336
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,240
is dangerous when climbing ladders and reaching high places,

337
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,080
I even have to help you change light bulbs.

338
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,880
Brother Tong,

339
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,080
you can be really annoying sometimes.

340
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,010
Most of the time.

341
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,560
Spit out that toothpaste,

342
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,280
don't keep it in your mouth,

343
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,610
or you might choke on it.

344
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,080
Mom.

345
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,480
Come here.

346
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:34,840
Here.

347
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,040
I made some porridge.

348
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,440
Don't bother with that. Come here.

349
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,040
Fresh hot

350
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,520
soy milk and fried dough sticks.

351
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:40,880
Here.

352
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,410
What's the occasion today?

353
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,370
No occasion,

354
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,640
I just feel like I've let you down,

355
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,100
causing you so much trouble all these years.

356
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,880
In a bit,

357
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,000
I need to mop the floor

358
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,200
in the rehearsal room downstairs,

359
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,530
unless you want to do it.

360
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,400
No problem,

361
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,930
I'll go right after eating.

362
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,090
Here,

363
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,020
it's still hot.

364
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,760
Tastes good?

365
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,360
It's good.

366
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,920
Mom,

367
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,610
why don't you

368
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
come with me?

369
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,040
It would be nice to get away for a while.

370
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,840
Malaysia?

371
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,720
Come on,

372
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,130
I have too many things to take care of around here.

373
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,250
Why are you looking at me like that?

374
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,320
Nothing's wrong,

375
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,160
I'm completely fine,

376
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,680
I'm just the same as before,

377
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,120
going

378
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,980
here and there,

379
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,840
it's all good,

380
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,240
I'm in great spirits.

381
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,120
Better to be away from it all,

382
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,380
to avoid the troubles.

383
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,450
Not dating anymore?

384
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,600
I need to heal.

385
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,320
For how long?

386
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,730
Let's not talk about me,

387
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,320
you're living alone,

388
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,120
I think

389
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,960
you should find someone.

390
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,080
Don't change the subject to me.

391
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,960
I'm serious,

392
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,820
I'd support you finding someone,

393
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,640
Mr. Qiao

394
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,920
has feelings for you,

395
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,490
even a fool can see that.

396
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,170
That's obvious enough,

397
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,520
he's so forward about it,

398
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,840
everyone knows for miles around.

399
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,960
Isn't that good?

400
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,040
Enough,

401
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
stop deflecting to me,

402
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,290
I'm too old for this.

403
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,800
I'm not deflecting,

404
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,000
you raised me

405
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,560
all by

406
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,320
yourself,

407
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,250
from childhood,

408
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,500
it wasn't easy.

409
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,840
If you

410
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,500
really meet someone you like,

411
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,040
then

412
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
what's wrong with finding someone?

413
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,610
Seeing you happy

414
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,290
would make me feel good too.

415
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,440
You need to keep dating.

416
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,560
Why?

417
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,600
Look,

418
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,640
it's only been a few days,

419
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,400
and you're already being so considerate,

420
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,130
talking to me heart-to-heart,

421
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,040
how long has it been since you've done that?

422
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Mom, I should

423
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,370
really thank Wen Xiaoyao for that.

424
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,810
Where's Xiaomi?

425
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,680
Get in the car.

426
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,610
Where's Qiaomi?

427
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,100
Did you sleep well last night?

428
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,570
The director is asking you a question.

429
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,120
The success or failure of the ballet company,

430
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
your future career,

431
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,380
all depend on tonight.

432
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,800
Don't be distracted.

433
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,520
Focus your mind.

434
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,360
At noon,

435
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,000
with Yinye and Xiaomi,

436
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,930
go through those movements again.

437
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,020
Rest after meeting the reporters in the afternoon.

438
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
Yang Yun's dressing room

439
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,930
will be exclusively yours.

440
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:51,960
Get in.

441
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,810
How nice.

442
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,200
Please get in.

443
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,850
Let's go.

444
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,460
Mr. Hui.

445
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,450
Where's Xiaomi?

446
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,240
She went to find Zhou Tong.

447
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,640
I want to find Zhou Tong too.

448
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,900
You can't go anywhere,

449
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
I'm watching you.

450
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,280
Mr. Hui.

451
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,330
Do you have a power bank?

452
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,810
I don't have that thing.

453
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,320
What is it?

454
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,520
Can I borrow your place

455
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,320
to invite Zhou Butong down here?

456
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,330
Is that okay?

457
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,480
Why don't you go up yourself?

458
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,560
Up there is his territory,

459
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,560
I'm at a disadvantage.

460
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,180
What do you want to talk about?

461
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,240
You want to know that too?

462
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,080
If you're using my place,

463
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,360
you need to respect me.

464
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,580
You stay here at night.

465
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Lives in the back.

466
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,200
Sister,

467
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,120
I'm really in a hurry,

468
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,920
apologize to Zhou Butong,

469
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,050
admit your mistake.

470
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:21,920
Why?

471
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,880
For my bestie Xiaoyao,

472
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,720
to set them up as a couple.

473
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,020
Sister, I'm really in a hurry.

474
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,680
Tong,

475
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,620
Xiaomi is looking for you.

476
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,560
Who?

477
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,320
You know,

478
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,850
that ballet dancer Qiaomi.

479
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,680
I heard you're looking for me.

480
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,280
What's up?

481
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,860
My time is limited,

482
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,120
so let's make this quick.

483
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
What a coincidence,

484
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,380
my time is limited too,

485
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,920
but I don't have time to fight with you.

486
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,380
Then why did you come down?

487
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,840
Why did you come up here then?

488
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,140
I want to hear why your time is so limited.

489
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,480
Listen up,

490
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,740
I need to mop the floor.

491
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,280
After mopping,

492
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,610
I'm flying to Malaysia.

493
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,440
Don't you have anything important to do all day?

494
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,000
All you do is date and fool around.

495
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,840
No important business,

496
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,770
just having fun.

497
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,000
You're a grown man,

498
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,800
but you don't do anything meaningful,

499
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,960
I really don't know what Xiaoyao sees in you.

500
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,220
Do I need her to like me?

501
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,040
Watch how you speak.

502
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
I'm already being very humble here.

503
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,360
Wait, wait,

504
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,560
what did you just say?

505
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,640
I said

506
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm already being very humble here.

507
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,450
Before that.

508
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,880
You're not allowed to go to Malaysia today.

509
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,560
This afternoon,

510
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,160
come to see the performance.

511
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,460
Anything else?

512
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,170
Apologize to me.

513
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,719
I was planning to apologize to you,

514
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,719
so you need to apologize to me first.

515
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,010
Little girl,

516
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,920
coming all this way

517
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,080
so early in the morning,

518
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,409
are you out of your mind?

519
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,420
We barely know each other.

520
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,800
Zhou Butong,

521
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,560
you'll regret this.

522
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
You really think you're a princess?

523
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,719
Am I wrong?

524
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,370
Why don't you go talk to him?

525
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,010
Why should I?

526
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,440
Getting Xiaoyao and Brother Tong together

527
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,300
would be great.

528
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,960
I haven't even completely changed my attitude yet,

529
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,560
and he's still being so rude.

530
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,140
I'm leaving

531
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,100
for rehearsal.

532
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,680
It's fine,

533
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,370
go ahead with your work.

534
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,440
Tong,

535
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,970
got any tickets?

536
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,040
No.

537
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,720
Yin Ye, are you crazy?

538
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,500
This is a disaster!

539
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,560
The reunion at Broken Bridge,

540
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,090
isn't it supposed to be sad?

541
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,890
That's over now,

542
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,850
there should be joy too.

543
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,880
We need some joy.

544
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,970
Didn't you always have joy before?

545
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,240
Think carefully and try to remember,

546
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,100
can you do that?

547
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,400
Now,

548
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,600
I feel more sadness inside.

549
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,360
Control it.

550
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,410
Yaoyao, what are you doing?

551
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Let's do it again.

552
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,100
Come on.

553
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,570
Yaoyao dances really well.

554
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,560
Joy, anger, sorrow, happiness,

555
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,840
she expresses it all.

556
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,490
You're really doing it.

557
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,330
Here.

558
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,970
I'll mop.

559
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,200
No need,

560
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,960
I already said I'd do it.

561
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,560
Don't worry,

562
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,280
before I leave,

563
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,560
I'll make sure this place is

564
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,240
spotless.

565
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,960
Should I clean the mirrors too?

566
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,480
Of course,

567
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,680
I always clean them all.

568
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,120
Alright,

569
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,450
I'll do them right away,

570
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,680
from top to bottom,

571
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,810
extra clean for you.

572
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
What are you doing?

573
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,960
Why are you staring at me?

574
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,920
It's awkward.

575
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,840
What's wrong?

576
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,480
Can't I look at you a bit more?

577
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,440
Fine, fine,

578
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
look all you want.

579
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,320
Joey,

580
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,060
what time is it?

581
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,800
Got stuck in traffic.

582
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,160
You're telling the audience about traffic too?

583
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,420
We haven't even started performing yet.

584
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,840
Yin Ye,

585
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,480
are you tired?

586
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,640
I'm not tired.

587
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,530
Look at Xiao Yao.

588
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,480
Not tired.

589
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,040
You don't need perfect stretching,

590
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,520
but the emotion must be there.

591
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,240
Let the emotion guide your positioning.

592
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,120
Please,

593
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,360
be careful.

594
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,040
Next, let's

595
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,040
run through the trio dance for

596
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,920
"Boating on the Lake" and

597
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,160
"Broken Bridge" scenes.

598
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,490
Here.

599
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,280
You went to see Zhou Tong.

600
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,650
What did you talk about?

601
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,040
To strengthen our friendship

602
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,500
and build our connection.

603
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,800
Then I'll invite him

604
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,730
to watch the performance tonight.

605
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,320
I actually invited someone too.

606
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,600
Yin Ye.

607
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,360
What's that got to do with me?

608
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,200
They're speaking lines now,

609
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,620
it's a dance drama.

610
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,760
I'm sorry, Yin.

611
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,640
Can you two show some emotion,

612
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,040
you divine beauties?

613
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,400
We can.

614
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,600
Continue,

615
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,970
start from the trio dance in 'Broken Bridge.'

616
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,280
This place

617
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,240
is quite nice.

618
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,970
Do you want to go see him?

619
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,560
After seeing the show and seeing him,

620
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
when I return to Hangzhou,

621
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,020
I won't be able to think about anything else.

622
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,650
How strange.

623
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,570
What's so strange about it?

624
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,400
Diandian,

625
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,210
does it look too big?

626
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,960
Ask Xu Tian,

627
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,210
he's the expert.

628
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,320
Not loose,

629
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,360
it's perfect.

630
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,600
Let's go eat.

631
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,480
After we get back to Hangzhou,

632
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,280
have Xu Tian make one for you too.

633
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,960
He made one for me before,

634
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,610
it's really beautiful.

635
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,250
Why didn't you bring it?

636
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,120
Mom,

637
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,880
Xu Tian and I won't join you for dinner.

638
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,010
Give me the address.

639
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,200
I don't think that's necessary.

640
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,440
I think it is necessary.

641
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,040
Should we listen to you or me?

642
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,730
Let's listen to Xu Tian.

643
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,760
Actually, being able to see him

644
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,960
would be quite nice.

645
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,180
