1
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,080
Xiaoru.

2
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Yun.

3
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,760
What's wrong?

4
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,880
Go see where Xiaoyao and Joey went.

5
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,479
They're in the dressing room.

6
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,400
I just saw Xiaoyao leave,

7
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,930
and Joey's been looking for her but she hasn't come back.

8
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,600
Okay.

9
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,040
Yun is calling for you.

10
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
Xu Tian hasn't arrived yet.

11
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,440
Just leave the ticket at the front desk for him to pick up.

12
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Didn't we agree to wait for him here?

13
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,000
Then give it to me,

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,280
you go inside.

15
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,620
It doesn't matter.

16
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,240
He's here, he's here.

17
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,920
Xu Tian, over here!

18
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,079
Hurry!

19
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,240
Hello!

20
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,360
Hi.

21
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,140
You're quite late.

22
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,560
The tickets

23
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,600
are in the envelope.

24
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,060
Thanks.

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,240
We've been here for a while,

26
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,900
just couldn't find the place.

27
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,780
You're Bai Suzhen, right?

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,000
Can I take a photo

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,800
with you?

30
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,080
I'm Xiaoqing.

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
She's Bai Suzhen.

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,760
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Bai Suzhen,

34
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,360
can I take

35
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,640
a photo with you?

36
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,320
Use my phone.

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,880
Sure,

38
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,700
no problem.

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,920
Use my phone.

40
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
Xu Tian, come here!

41
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,890
Take a photo for us, please.

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,280
Thanks!

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,400
Excuse me, let me through

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,370
so I don't bump into you.

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Sorry about that.

46
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,880
Come on.

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,920
Let's take another one.

48
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,120
Thank you.

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,579
Xu Tian,

50
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,480
let's take a photo of the three of us.

51
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,160
Yes, yes,

52
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
you three should take one together.

53
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,079
I'll take it.

54
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,610
Alright,

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,760
get ready.

56
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,820
Send it to me later.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,079
Okay.

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,080
Xu Tian, hurry up!

59
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,280
You're being so slow.

60
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,010
Come over here quickly.

61
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,839
Send me the photos.

62
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,320
I'll send them once we're inside.

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,120
Alright.

64
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,680
Come on, let's go.

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
Let's go.

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,980
Where are the tickets?

67
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,640
Here.

68
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,880
You go in first,

69
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,340
I need to use the restroom.

70
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,159
our performance will begin shortly.

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,120
Please put away your phones and switch them to silent mode.

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,320
No photography during the performance,

74
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,880
thank you for your cooperation.

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
Our performance will begin shortly.

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm sorry,

77
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,640
I got held up at work and arrived late.

78
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,370
Is it halfway through already?

79
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,360
Okay.

80
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,480
Fine.

81
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Zhao Gang

82
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
is gone.

83
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Stop right there.

84
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,480
Stop!

85
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,760
Where are you hiding?

86
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,320
No matter where you hide, you're dead.

87
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
From now on, this is your fate,

88
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,970
understand?

89
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,760
You're joking.

90
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,560
Prince,

91
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,160
you were already past your ballet prime 20 years ago.

92
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,680
Face reality,

93
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,010
everyone has their day.

94
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,680
You sound exactly like Song Guanwang.

95
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,720
You know what,

96
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,740
from now on,

97
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,480
the three of us will be working together.

98
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,280
We'll collaborate with the art school and ballet company.

99
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,840
I'll invest, you'll be the director,

100
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,960
all legitimate.

101
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,080
Put your photos from your youth at Guanwang Entertainment,

102
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,880
display them,

103
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
and your second career begins.

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
So it's all settled then.

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,720
Let's go back.

106
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,440
What for?

107
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,120
Whatever the reason, we need to go back.

108
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,260
So I have to dance for you to be satisfied, is that it?

109
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,690
That's called self-destruction.

110
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,480
Mrs. Song.

111
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,940
It's Diandian, right?

112
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Everything's fine with him now.

113
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,720
What happened?

114
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,450
Being together isn't easy,

115
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
be good to him,

116
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,280
okay?

117
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Diandian,

118
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
this is Mrs. Song.

119
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,090
Nice to meet you.

120
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
Did some people just

121
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,600
mistake you for my son?

122
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,320
Yes.

123
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,200
He's only been here three times

124
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,680
and never danced with me once.

125
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,940
Please sit.

126
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,380
I have something to announce:

127
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,760
Mrs. Song and I are officially together now.

128
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,480
All right.

129
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,760
We're in public,

130
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,620
why are you getting so emotional?

131
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,700
Congratulations.

132
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,930
Is that sincere?

133
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,280
Well, you're all having a good time anyway.

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,800
Do you know how many years I've supported your career?

135
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,080
Song Guanwang is now my partner,

136
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,760
and also your boss.

137
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,080
You should sincerely

138
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,080
congratulate us.

139
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,890
How should I congratulate you?

140
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,640
Dance.

141
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,420
Come on, dance!

142
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,360
Thank you.

143
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,760
I'll come dance with you more often.

144
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,650
You're not going back to Hangzhou?

145
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,720
No, I'm not.

146
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,640
I'm staying in Beijing with her.

147
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
Didn't she say she forgot all about you?

148
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,340
She remembers you now?

149
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,880
No.

150
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,920
Just look at her eyes.

151
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,770
How could she possibly forget you?

152
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Look at how head over heels she is.

153
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,400
Actually,

154
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,160
it would be better if she forgot me.

155
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,020
Not forgetting

156
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,840
is the problem.

157
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,340
She called me Auntie Song right away.

158
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,520
She remembers me,

159
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,210
so how could she forget you?

160
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,570
She called you Auntie Song.

161
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,320
Where are you going?

162
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,120
Uncle Qiao,

163
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,840
we just bought some things and are heading home.

164
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,460
Everything good between you two now?

165
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,960
Yes, it's fine.

166
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,840
I stayed

167
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,560
at her place last night.

168
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,120
Well done.

169
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,400
Uncle Qiao, did you need something from me?

170
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,080
Did you dance?

171
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,400
Yes, I did.

172
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,250
Then that's all.

173
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,760
I'll be going then.

174
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,050
Goodbye, Mrs. Song.

175
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,720
Dance.

176
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Louder.

177
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,920
Good,

178
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,240
good.

179
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,700
I said I'd sponsor you with a set of speakers,

180
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,640
remember?

181
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,200
Yeah,

182
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,920
you just love spending money and showing off.

183
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,850
I'll sponsor another audiophile-grade set.

184
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,600
Otherwise it won't match the prince.

185
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,040
Look at that dancing.

186
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Why did you leave?

187
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,540
I wanted to go home.

188
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,500
There's so much stuff.

189
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,440
That was a relative's mother just now,

190
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,200
Mrs. Song.

191
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
I wanted to introduce you to her,

192
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,440
since we'll be in Beijing often

193
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,440
and you'll meet eventually.

194
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,640
Okay.

195
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,900
Did you call her Mrs. Song?

196
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,880
No,

197
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,220
it's the first time meeting her and I don't know her.

198
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,450
I'll do it next time.

199
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,780
The car's here.

200
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,840
Let's get in.

201
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,560
Just now when we met,

202
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,500
you called Zhou Tong's mom Mrs. Song, right?

203
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,640
Who said that?

204
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,840
Mrs. Song.

205
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,120
I was actually wondering

206
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
how to introduce you.

207
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
We've already been introduced now.

208
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,280
Diandian.

209
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,960
Did you remember?

210
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,570
Or did you never forget?

211
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,540
What are you trying to say?

212
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,130
I want to hear you say it.

213
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,360
I just want to say

214
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,280
meeting you

215
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
is really fortunate.

216
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,360
Unfortunately,

217
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,400
I didn't meet you sooner.

218
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Fortunately,

219
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,960
meeting earlier

220
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,220
wouldn't have been as good as now.

221
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,360
Unfortunately,

222
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,600
we've already met before.

223
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,760
Fortunately,

224
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,920
I forgot.

225
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,760
Unfortunately,

226
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,020
you didn't forget.

227
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,280
Fortunately, you believe that I forgot.

228
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,920
Fortunately,

229
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,650
this fortunate-unfortunate game

230
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,480
we also played in Hangzhou.

231
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,760
Really?

232
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,040
I thought

233
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,700
I fell in love with a new Shi Diandian.

234
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,620
You had another Diandian before?

235
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,000
What's really going on here?

236
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,200
I don't understand what you're talking about.

237
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,680
I'm wondering

238
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,770
what these three days between us really mean.

239
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Sorry, master.

240
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,640
Diandian.

241
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,760
Diandian.

242
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,760
You haven't forgotten anything, have you?

243
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,300
Did you come to Beijing

244
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,480
just to find me?

245
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,210
Isn't this good enough now?

246
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,250
The past doesn't count.

247
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,360
But you're

248
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,780
still the same Diandian from before.

249
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,440
You've split me into two people.

250
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,000
You're the one who wanted to become two different people.

251
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,720
Which one do you prefer?

252
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,720
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,000
The old Diandian is back.

254
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Then what happens to who you are now?

255
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,760
Let's go home.

256
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,130
I'm heading back first.

257
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,880
Mom.

258
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,120
What day is today?

259
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,240
The worst day ever.

260
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,760
Why?

261
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,640
I might lose Xu Tian forever.

262
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,360
Where is he?

263
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,650
He hasn't come back yet.

264
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,780
What happened?

265
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,930
The day Xu Tian came to Beijing,

266
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,280
I decided to forget him,

267
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,100
but when I woke up, I hadn't forgotten anything.

268
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,020
I'm afraid he won't come back,

269
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,560
and I don't have the courage to find him in Beijing.

270
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,000
I hate myself so much.

271
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,960
After thinking about it, I just...

272
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,160
Don't think about it.

273
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,370
Tell that to Xu Tian.

274
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,560
Tell him what?

275
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,240
He likes who I've been these three days,

276
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
and just like him,

277
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I don't like who I was before either.

278
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,400
I'll call him.

279
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,280
Don't call.

280
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,730
If he doesn't want to come back,

281
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,440
I don't have the face to look for him again.

282
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,600
What's behind you?

283
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,080
Behind you?

284
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,140
Are those flowers?

285
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,730
Who bought them?

286
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,930
Did Xu Tian buy them?

287
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,600
I bought them myself.

288
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,330
These three days have been wonderful,

289
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,400
all the bad things from before are gone.

290
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
But there's nothing I can do,

291
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,520
the bad things

292
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,420
will always disappear along with the good ones.

293
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,420
I'm hanging up.

294
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,200
You're back.

295
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,000
I just went to buy something else.

296
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,610
Let me take that.

297
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,600
The food's gone cold.

298
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,280
There's hot food in the processor,

299
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,140
help yourself.

300
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
I'll go put the sheets and covers on.

301
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,600
I'm late today

302
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,010
because I went to buy you a cake.

303
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,580
It's your birthday today.

304
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,610
The pillowcases aren't on yet.

305
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,890
We can do that later,

306
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
make a wish first.

307
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,540
I'll turn on the lights after you make your wish.

308
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,080
And then?

309
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,760
We'll eat cake

310
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,280
and chat a bit.

311
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
No one else should hear when you make a wish.

312
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,810
Then should I

313
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,720
cover

314
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
my ears?

315
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,320
No.

316
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm grateful to have met you in this lifetime.

317
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,520
I am Xu Tian.

318
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,360
I know.

319
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,600
I make qipaos.

320
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,880
Give me.

321
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,960
Let me know what love is.

322
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,400
My mother passed away when I was little,

323
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,120
and I became obsessive and insecure,

324
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,360
distrusting everything.

325
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,600
Actually, I just didn't trust myself.

326
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,160
Thankfully, I have you,

327
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,400
who makes me feel hope,

328
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,480
and feel loved.

329
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,440
Isn't it sour?

330
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,800
It's sweet.

331
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,720
To be honest,

332
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,860
have you never liked me at all?

333
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Let's treat today as our first time,

334
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
start over.

335
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,570
Everything from before

336
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,960
doesn't count.

337
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,080
I've never met anyone

338
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,480
who treats me the way you do.

339
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,440
If I let you go now

340
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,900
because of what happened in the past,

341
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,420
then I'd definitely be a fool.

342
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,840
Need help?

343
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,960
What?

344
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,160
The water.

345
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,440
I see you're having trouble opening it.

346
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,610
Do you have a boyfriend?

347
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,640
Your ordered meal.

348
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,000
Are you following me?

349
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,440
I couldn't help falling

350
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
Why?

351
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,620
for you at first sight.

352
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,240
Are you cold?

353
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,330
I won't be cold if you come down.

354
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,440
I love you.

355
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,920
I need time to adjust.

356
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,800
How long will that take?

357
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,720
The Earth revolves around the sun.

358
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,520
Revolution is too long,

359
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,450
let's talk about

360
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,010
rotations instead.

361
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,440
Thirty rotations.

362
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,500
How about just one?

363
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,600
When did you start liking me?

364
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,800
The first time we met.

365
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,800
Why?

366
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,450
We were destined from a previous life,

367
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,540
like meeting an old friend again.

368
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,810
I don't care that you led me before,

369
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,400
now I'll lead you.

370
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,199
Would you like some cake?

371
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,370
Let's eat together.

372
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,560
I'll cut it.

373
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,760
Was my former self

374
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,920
exhausting to you?

375
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,080
Be honest.

376
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,000
A little bit.

377
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,160
What about these three days?

378
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,820
Very relaxing.

379
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,120
Really good.

380
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,960
I'm a liar,

381
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,460
but I had no choice.

382
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,960
Alright,

383
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,720
let's not talk about this anymore.

384
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,680
When we were looking for Zhou Tong together,

385
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,960
Wen Xiaoyao showed up,

386
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,600
and I started to worry about her,

387
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,920
so I pretended to forget the past

388
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,780
and called her to come to Beijing.

389
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,480
I wish I could forget myself.

390
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,560
Forget yourself?

391
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,720
Would you still know me then?

392
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,720
I'd want to.

393
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,160
No matter what,

394
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,040
I'll always know you,

395
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,600
so stop overthinking.

396
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,810
Is the cake good?

397
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,890
It's delicious.

398
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,380
It doesn't matter,

399
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,420
whether it's the old Diandian

400
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,000
or the current Diandian,

401
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,400
I like them both the same.

402
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,970
Happy birthday.

403
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,500
The ballet company is rehearsing a new show.

404
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,320
Xiaoyao and Xiaomi are both starring in it.

405
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,960
They dance beautifully.

406
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,170
Xiaoyao should be fine now.

407
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
She's very strong

408
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,770
and misses you a lot.

409
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,520
Mrs. Song is with Mr. Qiao now.

410
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,440
They'll be fine,

411
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,740
so don't worry about them.

412
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,600
The girl who took you to the hospital after the accident

413
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,860
is named Shi Diandian.

414
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,080
She's my wife now.

415
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,940
We've been living in Beijing for a while now,

416
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,080
and we've discovered that real life

417
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
and genuine love

418
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,700
can heal the wounds in our hearts.

419
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,890
The two of us, who grew up without mothers,

420
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,040
can now comfort each other.

421
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,050
We're going to be just fine.

422
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,720
Zhao Gang (Aunt Gang)

423
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:24,840
Xiao Ru

424
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,490
Lighting Assistant

425
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,300
Set Manager

426
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:28,560
Mechanic
