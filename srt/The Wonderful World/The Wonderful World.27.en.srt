1
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,479
I've topped up the utility card.

2
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,940
There were too many people queuing at the property office.

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,440
So I'll just

4
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,560
leave my stuff here

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,490
and then I'll go.

6
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,660
I can also put it in the fridge for you.

7
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,250
Or I could eat it for you.

8
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,759
Seven.

9
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,600
Reverse, one.

10
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,400
Three.

11
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Bow, five.

12
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,040
Six.

13
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,760
Seven.

14
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,200
Eight hands.

15
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,840
Walk.

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,360
Three.

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:22,920
Four.

18
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,120
Bow, five.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,800
Six.

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Eight, reverse one.

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,760
Three.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,440
Four.

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Bow, one.

24
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,280
Three.

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,120
Four.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,920
Five.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,800
Six.

28
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,400
Seven.

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,680
Keep going, everyone.

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,640
Hello, are you...

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,280
Let me see.

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,120
I saw 'The Legend of the White Snake'.

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
You're Miss Wen Xiaoyao.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
You dance so beautifully.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,160
I heard that

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,760
you don't dance anymore.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,520
Tiantian.

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,250
Xiaoyao is here.

39
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,120
Mrs. Song.

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,900
Let's go, Xiaoyao.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Where are we going?

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,120
Come dance with me in the square.

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,880
I'll pass. I just came to see you.

44
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,810
Where's Xiaomi?

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,100
She's out on a date.

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,570
She keeps herself busy.

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,040
Well then,

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,580
why don't you go upstairs,

49
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,640
have something to eat,

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,170
watch TV or play some games.

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,600
Zhou Tong's room is open.

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,480
Tonight,

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,440
the two of us

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,120
can make dinner together.

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,600
Okay.

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,960
I'll be back in an hour and a half at most.

57
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
Or maybe I should just stay.

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,690
Go ahead.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
You should go, Mrs. Song.

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,800
Go.

61
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,450
Alright.

62
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,760
I should get some exercise,

63
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,890
my joints are stiff.

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,920
It feels good knowing

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,450
someone's waiting at home.

66
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,960
Go ahead.

67
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,840
Don't touch my computer, please.

68
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm talking to you,

69
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,300
let me rest for a while.

70
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,760
Don't touch my computer, please.

71
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,820
I'm talking to you,

72
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,220
let me rest for a while.

73
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,360
Guanwang.

74
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,200
Uncle Hui.

75
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,570
What's going on?

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,460
The dishes aren't washed.

77
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,770
Where is she?

78
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
She went dancing in the square.

79
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,130
That's good,

80
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,200
moving around keeps her active.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,330
Let me make you some tea.

82
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,370
No need, no need.

83
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,890
I'll pick her up.

84
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,159
Yaoyao.

85
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,080
What happened to that kid

86
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,480
who drugged Xiaomi?

87
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,880
How is he?

88
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,440
He's fine.

89
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,520
Call him and ask him out.

90
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,690
I don't have his number.

91
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,980
Get it from Xiaomi,

92
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,300
but don't let her know.

93
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,780
Still reading?

94
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,210
Take a break.

95
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,410
I've already eaten.

96
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,740
I just had two slices of pizza.

97
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,160
I can heat up two slices for you in the microwave.

98
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,159
I'll leave after you finish eating.

99
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,570
Do you have more interviews tomorrow?

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Other companies.

101
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,360
Planning to

102
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,020
stay in Beijing permanently.

103
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,960
Is it good?

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,800
It would be better

105
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,280
if we had a food processor.

106
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,480
Why?

107
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,540
I'll buy one

108
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,760
tomorrow

109
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
and bring it over.

110
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't.

111
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,780
Don't you know?

112
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,600
Know what?

113
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
The food processor has functions.

114
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,560
It can cook so many different dishes,

115
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,320
both Chinese and Western style,

116
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,360
make soy milk,

117
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,840
and prepare all kinds of soups.

118
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,900
Just press a button

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,330
and everything's done.

120
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,490
Is it expensive?

121
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,610
Over 10,000.

122
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,600
That's too expensive.

123
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Forget it.

124
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,090
I already have a microwave.

125
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,800
Actually,

126
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,800
if I move in here,

127
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,690
I should bring some things.

128
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,650
I should also

129
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,970
contribute something.

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,760
So,

131
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,160
I just noticed

132
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,000
that room's door was open and

133
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,200
it's empty.

134
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,380
Why don't we share the apartment?

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,460
Here's what I'm thinking:

136
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,880
if I move in,

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
I'll take the outer room

138
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,280
and you can move into that room since you're a woman,

139
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,880
which would be safer and more convenient for you,

140
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,610
while I stay in the living room.

141
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,760
My proposal

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,840
makes perfect sense

143
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,800
financially.

144
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,560
Look, you haven't found a job yet

145
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,360
and don't have

146
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,440
much income.

147
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,360
And I

148
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,960
can't keep staying at hotels,

149
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,220
that's too expensive.

150
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,520
If we share the apartment,

151
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,560
we split the rent,

152
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,160
which saves us both money.

153
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,240
Besides, I think

154
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,600
you quite like me too.

155
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,680
At least

156
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
At the very least,

157
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,970
I'll make you feel safe,

158
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,040
right?

159
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,090
Heating,

160
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,360
water and electricity -

161
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,280
I'll pay for all of that.

162
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,010
Just the rent

163
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,960
we'll split 50-50.

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,690
How about it?

165
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,600
No.

166
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Then before you go to bed at night,

167
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,440
at least send me a message

168
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,760
on WeChat.

169
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,980
Preferably

170
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,840
with a photo of yourself.

171
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,540
Well, I'm leaving now.

172
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,800
Step it up.

173
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,940
Persevere!

174
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,210
Push harder!

175
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,280
Never give up!

176
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,570
Where are you going?

177
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Why haven't you left yet?

178
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,120
I can't bear to leave.

179
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,880
So I stayed.

180
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,330
I'd just be alone if I went back.

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,730
Are you cold?

182
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,920
Not when I'm with you.

183
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,980
Are you always this smooth-talking?

184
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,450
I've been working on it lately.

185
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,920
Why?

186
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,640
Time is short and the task is urgent.

187
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,440
Life is brief.

188
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,200
What task?

189
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,410
Making you fall in love with me.

190
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,760
Oh my god!

191
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,620
Why are you doing this?

192
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,210
Love at first sight.

193
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,520
Don't you believe it?

194
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,440
It's too fast.

195
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,580
It's not how I imagined it.

196
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,400
Then what's your idea

197
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,600
of love?

198
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,100
I haven't really thought about love,

199
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
but I've thought about

200
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,740
what it's like when two people are together.

201
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,740
What's it like?

202
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,640
Not strangers but not too familiar either.

203
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,700
We don't earn much,

204
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,520
so we keep working hard.

205
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,210
Sometimes we argue,

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,130
and even when upset,

207
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,040
we find many reasons

208
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,170
to forget about it within ten minutes.

209
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,440
Happiness and little unhappiness come and go,

210
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,560
and it just goes on like that.

211
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,570
That's about right,

212
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,060
just like what I imagined.

213
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,040
You're lying.

214
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,840
I never lie.

215
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,250
You must be cold.

216
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,600
I am cold,

217
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,440
but

218
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
that's not lying.

219
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,410
Gave it to me.

220
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,420
What about you?

221
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,640
Do you miss your ex-girlfriend?

222
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,410
Not anymore.

223
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,730
You're lying again.

224
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,040
You're sitting right next to me,

225
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,890
why would I think about her?

226
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,000
What if I wasn't here?

227
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,920
I love you,

228
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,140
it's as simple as that.

229
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,320
I need to adjust for a moment.

230
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,010
How long will that take?

231
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,680
The Earth revolves around the sun.

232
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,480
Revolution won't work,

233
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,410
I mean rotation,

234
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,780
how many spins?

235
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,160
Thirty.

236
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,140
How about just one?

237
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,680
Can I go up now?

238
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,740
Then why did you come down in the first place?

239
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,970
To see if you'd left.

240
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,280
Go ahead then,

241
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,360
I'll watch you leave.

242
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,320
Keep it on.

243
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,210
Wen Xiaoyao.

244
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,650
Wen Xiaoyao.

245
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,250
Is Xiaoyao here?

246
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,880
Every time I see you, it feels like time travel,

247
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,210
Zhou Tong used to stand in that exact spot.

248
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,080
Xiaomi.

249
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,010
Is Xiaoyao here?

250
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,040
Who is it?

251
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,940
Xu Tian is looking for you.

252
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,400
What does he want?

253
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,170
Nothing.

254
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,840
He says it's nothing.

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,800
What did you want to see me about?

256
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,920
Right,

257
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,480
hold on a second, Xu Tian.

258
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,480
I laid my cards on the table with my dad,

259
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,520
two pairs of twos,

260
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,740
he couldn't beat me

261
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,000
and got frustrated.

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,320
But getting upset won't help.

263
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,200
Can you give me

264
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,730
Little Ears' phone number?

265
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,010
Of course I will.

266
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,520
If I can't get past him, I still need to get past you.

267
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,320
Just a moment.

268
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
I'll be going now.

269
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Are you coming up or should I come down?

270
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,760
What?

271
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,640
I'm so happy right now.

272
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,240
Me too.

273
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,520
Why are you?

274
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,180
I never felt it before,

275
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,180
but just now

276
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,400
I felt love.

277
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,160
Me too.

278
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,280
Come up here so we can talk.

279
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,500
I won't come up.

280
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,920
Thank you all.

281
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,610
Thank you, Xiaoyao.

282
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,080
So,

283
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,640
have you reconciled with Dian?

284
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,840
Are you two back together?

285
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,080
Has she remembered everything?

286
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,400
No.

287
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,040
But the past doesn't matter anymore,

288
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,170
I love who she is now.

289
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,840
Does she love who you are now?

290
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,930
The Earth rotates once.

291
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,690
What does that mean?

292
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,000
Tomorrow.

293
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,819
You come here but don't dance,

294
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,210
it's getting awkward to watch.

295
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,839
I visit every place

296
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,119
I've been to with my son,

297
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,650
just to sit and look around,

298
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,369
as a way to remember him.

299
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,369
It's a shame,

300
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,680
he never danced with me.

301
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,960
I want to talk to you about three things,

302
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,200
first one.

303
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,800
When did you

304
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,860
start having feelings for me?

305
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,360
When?

306
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,120
Don't you know?

307
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,000
I was thinking.

308
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,960
Was it this.

309
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,490
Last time we walked this way

310
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
to the riverside.

311
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,080
When I dropped my keys

312
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,000
in the grass,

313
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,320
and you picked them up,

314
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,980
was that it?

315
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,360
No.

316
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,280
Tell me.

317
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,280
The night Zhou Tong died,

318
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,420
I was walking alone

319
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,560
on the street,

320
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,800
I felt like dying myself.

321
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,080
You got out of your car

322
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,040
and yelled at me.

323
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,560
One yell and you fell for me.

324
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,080
Second thing,

325
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,480
what about Zhao Gang?

326
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,720
Art has messed up his mind,

327
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,010
but he's still a decent person.

328
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,800
We need to find a way

329
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,160
to help him break free.

330
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,840
Let him join the square dancing,

331
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,200
turn him inside out,

332
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,400
he'll be liberated instantly.

333
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,330
The Swan Prince dancing like this?

334
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,760
That might actually kill him.

335
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,800
That's the point,

336
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,000
say goodbye to his past life,

337
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,800
and he'll be completely reborn.

338
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,320
Alright,

339
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,730
that would be true liberation.

340
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,610
The third thing.

341
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,970
I want to ask you something.

342
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,850
Go ahead.

343
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,120
Look at me,

344
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,820
I'm not young anymore,

345
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,340
and you're so wealthy,

346
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,570
you could have any young girl you want,

347
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,400
why settle for someone like me?

348
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,200
What do you mean old?

349
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,280
You're a mature woman

350
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,600
with lasting charm, that's how I'd put it.

351
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,920
Fine,

352
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,040
a mature woman,

353
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,140
but what are you after?

354
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,840
When I was younger,

355
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,200
mature women were my weakness,

356
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,680
it's only when you get older that you chase young girls.

357
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,640
Being with you

358
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,000
makes me feel young again.

359
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,620
So you're after feeling young yourself?

360
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,240
I'm just teasing you.

361
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,540
It makes sense though.

362
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,180
Seriously,

363
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,080
the third thing is what's really bothering me.

364
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,400
Xiaomi

365
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,660
is dating someone,

366
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,130
some wandering street performer.

367
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,820
She came clean with me,

368
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,600
saying she doesn't want any property,

369
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,860
and wants to elope with that little punk.

370
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,960
No way.

371
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,400
Daughters turning their backs on parents happens every day.

372
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,480
I really want to strangle that little punk.

373
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,120
Help me figure something out,

374
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,050
and stop me before I commit a crime.

375
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,760
Now that you mention it...

376
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,290
Hurry up.

377
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,000
Take me home.

378
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,520
Let's go.

379
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,160
We'll finish discussing the marriage first,

380
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,520
and handle everything else one by one.

381
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,840
There's nothing more to discuss.

382
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,900
When love comes, nothing can stop it.

383
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,560
Unstoppable.

384
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Did you listen to what Mom just said?

385
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,640
I heard.

386
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,880
Don't forget to take your medicine.

387
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,600
Don't you have anything to tell Mom?

388
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,040
I'm fine, don't worry.

389
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,720
I need to check job listings, gotta go.

390
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,760
Job listings?

391
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,180
Where exactly are you?

392
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,120
I can see four black umbrellas

393
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,080
in front of me.

394
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,080
Is that the place?

395
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,540
I'll send you my location.

396
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,640
Speak up, I can't hear you clearly.

397
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,360
Gongti

398
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,600
Room 9.

399
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,640
I know it's Gongti Pure K, Room 9,

400
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,640
but where exactly is it?

401
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,680
Is it in front of this umbrella or behind it?

402
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,240
I'll send you the location.

403
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,320
Don't send me the location,

404
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
my phone can't read location data,

405
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,560
it's not a smartphone.

406
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,280
Can't you just tell me where it is?

407
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,240
Never mind, I found it.

408
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,840
Found it.

409
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,200
Xiaoyao,

410
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,320
come quickly.

411
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,480
I'm here.

412
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,180
Both of you listen carefully,

413
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,080
stay calm when we go in,

414
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,560
we're just here to intimidate,

415
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,960
I only have one daughter.

416
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Stop right there.

417
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,380
Who are you?

418
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,700
Wrong room.

419
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
If you got the wrong room, just leave.

420
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,650
Have you no manners?

421
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,440
Sorry.

422
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
What's your name?

423
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,520
None of your business.

424
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,850
Who are you looking for?

425
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,160
Wen Xiaoyao,

426
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,720
Qiao Mi.

427
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,240
I'm their father.

428
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,860
Hello, sir.

429
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
Grab a chair and sit here.

430
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
What's your name?

431
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,330
Little Ears.

432
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,520
My full name is Lian Cuihua.

433
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,850
So your surname is Lian.

434
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,420
Xiaomi has been honest with me

435
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,920
about wanting to be with you from now on.

436
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,680
I want to ask you three straightforward questions.

437
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,640
If you're a real man,

438
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,170
don't give me any nonsense.

439
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,530
Alright.

440
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,650
Go ahead.

441
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,640
Xiaomi

442
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,880
has been raised

443
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
like a princess her entire life.

444
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,600
I've treated her like fine china,

445
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,060
like a delicate treasure,

446
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,840
and she's even more strong-willed than I am.

447
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,570
When you're together with her,

448
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,540
can you indulge her

449
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,000
and cater to her every whim?

450
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,660
No, I can't.

451
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,180
Love is about equality

452
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,330
and mutual respect.

453
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,640
Life isn't that simple.

454
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,520
Daily necessities,

455
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,580
utility bills,

456
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,560
having kids, education, insurance,

457
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,680
there's a ton of stuff.

458
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,800
Can you afford all that?

459
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,480
My daughter is into arts,

460
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,800
a future dancer.

461
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,760
I can't afford it.

462
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,880
That's not possible.

463
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,040
Because none of that matters.

464
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,300
Then what does matter?

465
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,200
Love.

466
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,520
Only love matters.

467
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,560
Fine,

468
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,220
let's talk about that.

469
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,360
Can you promise to love

470
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,400
Xiaomi for the rest of your life?

471
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,200
To be honest.

472
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,360
That's not good enough.

473
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,960
I can't.

474
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,420
Because love is fleeting,

475
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,760
like all beautiful things,

476
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,520
it's temporary and will disappear,

477
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,320
which is why they're beautiful.

478
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,580
But no matter how far apart we are,

479
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,520
Xiaomi will always have

480
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,580
a place in my heart.

481
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,240
Far apart my ass!

482
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,450
I knew it would be like this.

483
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,360
Love comes first,

484
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,240
and then comes all this

485
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,180
worldly stuff.

486
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,010
That's why I want to wander.

487
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,240
You want to take Xiaomi wandering with you?

488
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
If she's willing.

489
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,120
Listen, you little punks,

490
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,400
no, no, no,

491
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,130
not the face.

492
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,560
Three.

493
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,640
I'll kill you.

494
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,700
I'll beat him to death.

495
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,080
Old Xu,

496
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,280
finish him.

497
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,500
Don't just stand there watching!

498
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,360
When you weren't home today,

499
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,440
Xu Tian was beaming like a flower under the window,

500
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,440
saying

501
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,970
he never felt it before,

502
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,120
but now he's experiencing love with Sister Diandian,

503
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,380
and wants to thank you.

504
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,960
It's just that

505
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
when I see him,

506
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,140
I'm reminded of Zhou Tong.

507
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,640
Dad.

508
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,560
What's wrong?

509
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,400
That guy called Xiao'erduo

510
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,560
got into a fight with me,

511
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,490
and now he's at the police station.

512
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,400
Hurry up.

513
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,920
What happened?

514
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,960
How did Xiao'erduo

515
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
end up with my dad?

516
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,280
Uncle Hui,

517
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,740
he insisted on meeting him, so I arranged it.

518
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,160
They got into a fight!

519
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,840
Why are you fighting at your age?

520
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,600
Dad.

521
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,680
Close the door.

522
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,880
He's my real father. Why did you hit him?

523
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
Can't I like someone?

524
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,040
I'm not your private property.

525
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,600
If you're like this, I'll never get married.

526
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,520
Good. Don't get married then.

527
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,850
What's good about that?

528
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,200
Didn't you say having Xiaoyao in this life was enough?

529
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,600
That's different.

530
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,760
Why are you here? Where is he?

531
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,850
He's inside.

532
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,220
You hit him and he's still inside?

533
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,140
He deserved it.

534
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,820
It's cold outside. Get in the car.

535
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,000
Let's wait for them here.

536
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,480
Come on.

537
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,660
Do you see the problem now?

538
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,260
Once love arrives,

539
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,680
dad becomes irrelevant,

540
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,000
raising a daughter was all for nothing,

541
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,360
18 years of hard work and sacrifice.

542
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,880
I'm less important than

543
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,010
someone she's known for just two days.

544
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
I got blindsided.

545
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,410
That little punk is like a wolf,

546
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,570
he got into a fight with my two buddies.

547
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,180
Xiaomi.

548
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,560
What?

549
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,280
Where are Uncle Pao and Uncle Bing?

550
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,800
They're inside dealing with the police

551
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,060
and can't come out yet.

552
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,280
If you shine that light in my eyes again,

553
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,140
I'll twist those little ears off.

554
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Look at you,

555
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,570
acting like I don't even exist.

556
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,840
Uncle Hui.

557
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,800
No matter when,

558
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,320
you're always the most important person to Xiaomi and me.

559
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,160
Really?

560
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,440
So if I don't approve,

561
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,700
you won't get married?

562
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,660
No, I won't.

563
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,320
Did you just knock on my door?

564
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,560
No, I didn't.

565
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,880
Where are you?

566
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,530
At the hotel.

567
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,840
Why is your voice

568
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,480
so shaky?

569
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,480
I was taking a shower

570
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,480
when the water suddenly turned cold,

571
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,540
the power went out,

572
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,720
and someone knocked on my door. I don't know who it was.

573
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,490
Here it comes again.

574
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,140
Go check the peephole.

575
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,140
No one's there.

576
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,400
Don't move at all,

577
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,960
I'll be right there.

578
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,560
Hurry up,

579
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,320
come on!

580
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,120
Uncle Hui is leaving.

581
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,600
Xiaoyao.

582
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,920
Where do you think they might have gone?

583
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,200
They won't go anywhere,

584
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,860
I'll call them when I get back.

585
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,020
I'll wait in the car in the garage.

586
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,800
No, don't.

587
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
Xiaomi will get upset if you do that.

588
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,570
I'll contact her later.

589
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,280
Xu Tian.

590
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,160
Xiao Yao.

591
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,760
What are you doing?

592
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,880
I'm planning

593
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,640
to move in

594
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,010
and live with Dian Dian.

595
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,480
Not like that,

596
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,560
as roommates.

597
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,380
Did you agree on it?

598
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,320
Not yet.

599
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,640
I see.

600
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,640
Is that not appropriate?

601
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,900
Are you busy right now?

602
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,160
Could you

603
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,560
watch my boxes for me?

604
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
I'll go upstairs

605
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,090
and if she disagrees, I'll come back for them.

606
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,640
Sure.

607
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:43,920
Oh, right.

608
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,440
I almost forgot.

609
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,300
Come over here.

610
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,260
Here, give me that.

611
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
I have two qipaos.

612
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,140
And also

613
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,880
a photo

614
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,220
that I brought for you.

615
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,370
These two qipaos

616
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,520
were specially made by my mother

617
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,160
for your mother back then.

618
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,290
They've been kept in my home for over 20 years.

619
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,360
And this photo,

620
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,600
I'll let you see it,

621
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,960
but I'll need to take it back.

622
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,560
This is your mother back then.

623
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,160
My mother.

624
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,520
This is me.

625
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,480
You're in this photo too,

626
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,290
in your mother's belly.

627
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,730
Why are you only giving these to me now?

628
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,760
I came to Beijing.

629
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,040
I was supposed to bring it to you,

630
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
but then I forgot.

631
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
I'll head out now.

632
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,280
The thing.

633
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:32,960
Diandian

634
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,000
has remembered everything from the past.

635
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,320
No,

636
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,240
but the past doesn't matter anymore,

637
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,300
it's all behind us.

638
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,080
You're the tenant Shi Diandian, right?

639
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,120
Yes.

640
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,080
Were you the one knocking just now?

641
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,960
Your power's out, right?

642
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,080
I charged your electricity card this afternoon

643
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,680
but left it at the property office.

644
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,920
Why couldn't I see you through the peephole?

645
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,450
I was checking the fuse box.

646
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Your electricity card

647
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,130
is inside behind your door.

648
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,100
Coming,

649
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,140
I'm coming!

650
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,880
Who are

651
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,880
you?

652
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,820
Property management.

653
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,690
On the clothes rack.

654
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,280
On what?

655
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,280
Where you insert the power card.

656
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,380
Let me help you.

657
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,520
There's no hot water,

658
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,620
what about my hair?

659
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
I have a solution.

660
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,860
What solution?

661
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,100
Your life's ambition.

662
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,440
Mine?

663
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,060
My life's ambition

664
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,600
is now yours.

665
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,620
Why isn't it steaming yet?

666
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,760
This isn't a kettle.

667
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,480
It doesn't steam.

668
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,540
Look at this light.

669
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,679
When it turns green,

670
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,280
it means

671
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,739
the temperature is right.

672
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,900
Let me show you.

673
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,290
It's automatic.

674
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,240
Let me wash your hair.

675
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
I'll do it myself.

676
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,800
The hot water is mine.

677
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,180
Here's a towel.

678
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
I can do it myself.

679
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,050
Let's be roommates.

680
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,240
We'll split the rent.

681
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,500
During the day,

682
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,570
I'll help you look for a job.

683
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,490
At night,

684
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,970
I'll come home and cook for you.

685
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,320
So it's settled then.

686
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,120
I'll go down

687
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
to get my luggage.

688
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,520
The key is by the door.

689
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,320
She agreed

690
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,610
to be roommates.

691
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,240
She just kissed me.

692
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,890
Never happened before.

693
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,160
Never.

694
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,410
Well.

695
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,500
You should go then.

696
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,200
I feel like

697
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,610
I was such a fool before.

698
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,720
I used to think

699
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,290
dating was just about routine.

700
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,400
But now

701
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,080
starting over

702
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,360
feels so good.

703
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,810
I really envy Diandian.

704
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,250
She's not the same Diandian as before.

705
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,280
I've met someone new

706
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,880
who happens to be called Shi Diandian too.

707
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
And I've become a new person as well.

708
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,120
It's because the old Xu Tian wasn't good enough,

709
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,720
that's why

710
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,250
she wanted to forget me.

711
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,730
Zhou Tong and I made many mistakes too,

712
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,620
we're also starting over.

713
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,960
I'm sorry.

714
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,650
It's not your fault.

715
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,560
He always said life is unpredictable,

716
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,420
and it really turned out that way.

717
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,560
Where is he

718
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,400
buried?

719
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,560
Babaoshan.

720
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,680
Tomorrow I'll take Diandian

721
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,520
to visit Auntie Song,

722
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:33,980
and then

723
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,780
we'll go see him together.

724
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,720
Can I take

725
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,400
this photo home tonight?

726
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,120
Of course.

727
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,220
Will you

728
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,040
ever dance

729
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,800
as White Snake again?

730
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,100
Whenever I dance White Snake,

731
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,840
I think of Zhou Tong.

732
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,040
My mother must have felt the same way back then.

733
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,320
Teacher Jia Sulan

734
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,920
stopped playing White Snake

735
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,690
not because of love,

736
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,380
but because of you.

737
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,320
That's why you should keep dancing White Snake.

738
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,850
Zhou Tong

739
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,280
would want you to continue dancing too.

740
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,560
On stage,

741
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,080
transforming into someone else

742
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,600
is wonderful.

743
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
It's like magic,

744
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,080
and then

745
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,890
you meet someone new again.

746
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,840
Dancing your inner feelings

747
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,170
and emotions

748
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,250
for everyone to see.

749
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,560
But it's

750
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,720
too short.

751
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,290
Think of it this way:

752
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,900
a person's life

753
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,380
is also very short.

754
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,280
You're becoming more and more like him.

755
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,720
Diandian is waiting for you,

756
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
you should go now.

757
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,500
I'll be going then.

758
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,320
Diandian,

759
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,280
I'm back.

760
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,500
Go to sleep now.

761
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,680
Okay.

762
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,860
There's a new toothbrush.

763
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,820
What's the plan for tomorrow?

764
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,940
Interview in the morning.

765
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,290
