00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,520
Hello, Mr. Fang,

2
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,380
this is Xu Tian.

3
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,380
Where are you guys?

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,080
About to have dinner.

5
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,139
Where's Diandian?

6
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,170
I'm waiting for her.

7
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,370
Where did she go?

8
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,010
I don't know.

9
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,210
Did you two have a fight?

10
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
Of course not,

11
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,079
no way.

12
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,960
I can't leave.

13
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
If she comes back and can't find me,

14
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,840
it would be terrible.

15
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
Send me your location,

16
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,540
I'll come over.

17
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,560
Who are you?

18
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,620
What are you doing?

19
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,080
Where is this place?

20
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,520
What's going on?

21
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

22
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,620
Where's my son?

23
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,020
Doctor!

24
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,720
Son!

25
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,720
Mom!

26
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Watching Xiaoyao's performance.

27
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,090
What's happening here?

28
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,850
This?

29
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,290
Why are you all here?

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,730
This?

31
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,060
What happened?

32
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,570
This?

33
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,020
Please save my son!

34
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,040
Hurry, hurry!

35
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
What's going on?

36
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,260
Please save my son!

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,380
What happened?

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,440
Is it serious?

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,460
I'm talking to you!

40
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,380
Who's this?

41
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,020
Someone who brought in a patient.

42
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,080
Mom,

43
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,290
come pick me up quickly.

44
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,560
I can't remember the way,

45
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,160
I'm afraid I'll forget everything soon.

46
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,520
Okay.

47
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,290
You're with Xu Tian, right?

48
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,260
Xu Tian just sent me his location,

49
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,440
but I don't have anything from you.

50
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,200
Okay.

51
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't panic.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,840
Where are you approximately?

53
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,770
Xiehe Hospital?

54
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,200
Which part of Xiehe Hospital?

55
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,860
Which part of Xiehe Hospital?

56
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,840
East gate?

57
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,480
East gate?

58
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,040
Xiehe Hospital east gate?

59
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,440
Okay.

60
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
Xiehe Hospital east gate.

61
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,960
Are you okay?

62
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,600
Bring my and Xu Tian's luggage,

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,320
book flight tickets home immediately.

64
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,120
Let's go home!

65
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:49,960
Okay.

66
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
We're going home.

67
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Diandian!

68
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,860
Did something happen?

69
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,700
Xu Tian and Zhou Tong ran into each other.

70
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,560
Zhou Tong had a car accident.

71
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,400
I'm worried something might happen to Xu Tian too.

72
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
It won't, Diandian.

73
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
No matter what happens,

74
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,890
don't get upset,

75
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,120
you know about your old condition.

76
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,480
Come pick me up quickly,

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,730
stay where you are, don't move.

78
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,520
Yaoyao,

80
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,360
you did it.

81
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,240
Yin Ye,

82
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,040
Qiaomi.

83
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
It's all good,

84
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,440
it's all good.

85
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
The great love story is perfect.

86
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,200
Take a bow!

87
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,570
Why isn't Zhou Tong down there?

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,040
He can see us.

89
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,280
Dad will bring him backstage soon.

90
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Hurry up, Qiaomi.

91
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,040
Don't remove your makeup after the curtain call.

92
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,800
There's an interview in the dressing room.

93
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,060
There's an interview?

94
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,620
You're famous now.

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,520
Can I ask Zhou Tong to come to the dressing room?

96
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,680
Hurry up for the curtain call.

97
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,240
Quick!

98
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,159
Come on.

99
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,320
Don't push, please.

100
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,440
We performers need to make some quick adjustments.

101
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,840
Just a quick adjustment.

102
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,600
Don't push.

103
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
Stop pushing.

104
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,500
Thank you, thank you. Please don't push.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,260
Wait, wait, just wait.

106
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Everyone, please be patient.

107
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,640
We'll take you one by one.

108
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,760
Let's maintain some order.

109
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,000
You're from Dance Observer, right?

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,730
I know you, your surname is Lin.

111
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,720
And you're from Tencent website.

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,420
When we go in, we must maintain order.

113
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,160
No rush.

114
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,050
Let the performers adjust.

115
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,560
Come on.

116
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,160
Let me see.

117
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,360
Uncle Hui.

118
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,559
Everyone.

119
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,440
Stop pushing, everyone.

120
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,200
This way.

121
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,059
Be careful.

122
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Can I interview you?

123
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Can I interview you?

124
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,770
Can you comment?

125
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,140
Yaoyao.

126
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,280
Yaoyao.

127
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,840
Is Zhou Tong still in the hospital?

128
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,570
Don't say that, don't say that.

129
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,280
Let me through.

130
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,960
Let me through.

131
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
Are you crazy?

132
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,480
Let me out.

133
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:48,800
Hello?

134
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,660
Yaoyao,

135
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,050
will you play Bai Suzhen again?

136
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,320
I missed it this time.

137
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,880
Yes.

138
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,410
That's good,

139
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,130
I'll catch it next time.

140
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,000
Are you okay?

141
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,320
I'm fine,

142
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,000
I can still call you, can't I?

143
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,800
Are you done performing?

144
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,560
How did it go?

145
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,300
I'm coming right away.

146
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,890
No rush, take your time.

147
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,240
Where are you?

148
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,080
Wait for me,

149
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,400
just wait.

150
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,800
Don't worry.

151
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,130
Okay.

152
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,040
Can you really do this?

153
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,800
The doctor said

154
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,130
your brain is bleeding.

155
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,280
Kid,

156
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,200
you shouldn't move around right now.

157
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,730
Mr. Qiao,

158
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,880
please don't worry,

159
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,080
I'm completely fine,

160
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,540
really.

161
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,760
Besides,

162
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,960
if something were really wrong,

163
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,840
all the more reason to see you now.

164
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,770
What if I never get to see you again?

165
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,160
Not yet.

166
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Help your mother.

167
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,360
I'm just feeling a bit dizzy.

168
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,880
I'll have the doctor check

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,260
if I have a fever later.

170
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,400
Mr. Song.

171
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,560
Remember when you put

172
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,600
that thermometer

173
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,010
in hot water before?

174
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,090
I know exactly what's going on.

175
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,200
I've caused you

176
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
so much trouble in my life.

177
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,490
What are you talking about?

178
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,560
From now on,

179
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,330
your son isn't going anywhere.

180
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,600
After marrying Xiaoyao,

181
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
he'll settle down

182
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,640
and take good care of you.

183
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,530
Would she want that?

184
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
Look, she's here now.

185
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,040
Your son will ask her right away.

186
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,760
See how beautiful she is.

187
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,640
Mom, don't hold onto me.

188
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,520
Don't scare her.

189
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,080
It's okay,

190
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,680
it's fine.

191
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,410
First time meeting you.

192
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,020
And I'm already dizzy.

193
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,740
I'm so glad to meet you.

194
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,810
The emergency patient is here.

195
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,120
Get back quickly.

196
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,980
The patient hasn't passed the critical period yet.

197
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,360
Are you ready?

198
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,240
Wait for me,

199
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,920
I'm coming.

200
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,500
Hurry up! You're always the slowest.

201
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,400
Diandian.

202
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,680
Diandian.

203
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,570
Dian.

204
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,560
Diandian.

205
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,880
Diandian.

206
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,520
It's Mom.

207
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,119
Xu Tian,

208
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,380
Xu Tian is waiting for you inside.

209
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,079
Where is he?

210
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,960
Who am I?

211
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,800
Mom.

212
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,560
Mom will take you to find Xu Tian.

213
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,440
Okay.

214
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,090
Did you bring the medicine?

215
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,240
The other one is gone.

216
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Xu Tian will go crazy if he finds out.

217
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,840
Gone?

218
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,360
When I saw him,

219
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,050
he was just like Xu Tian,

220
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,180
blood was coming out of his mouth.

221
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,000
He is himself,

222
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,080
and Xu Tian is Xu Tian.

223
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,530
How could he be gone?

224
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,040
Wasn't he taken to the hospital?

225
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,400
Should we tell Xu Tian?

226
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,600
Tell him what?

227
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,330
How would we explain it?

228
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,120
If he's gone,

229
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,000
Wen Xiaoyao will come looking for Xu Tian.

230
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,930
There's no 'if'.

231
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,220
There's a photo at Xu Tian's home,

232
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,600
their mothers

233
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,680
took a picture together before.

234
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,780
Everything

235
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,090
has already been arranged by fate.

236
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,380
You've really lost your mind.

237
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,800
I know I'm annoying,

238
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,680
but I can't help it.

239
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,330
You'll lose Xu Tian if you continue like this,

240
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,680
and soon,

241
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,960
very soon.

242
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
Who could put up with you?

243
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
What should we do?

244
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,600
Zhou Tong has been sent to the hospital,

245
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,570
so it's over now.

246
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,540
Whether you talk about it or not, it won't change anything.

247
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,060
Go back to Hangzhou

248
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,040
and live a good life with Xu Tian.

249
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,800
Will he be okay?

250
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
He has his mother,

251
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,020
he has Wen Xiaoyao.

252
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,000
What about your life, Shi Diandian?

253
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,530
Do you still want to live it?

254
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,770
We've done our best.

255
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,250
Please accept my condolences.

256
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,400
He's gone.

257
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,130
It's past 1 o'clock.

258
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,020
You haven't removed your makeup yet.

259
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,690
Where's Director Song?

260
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,200
Handling paperwork.

261
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,560
The person is already dead,

262
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,490
what paperwork is there to handle?

263
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,380
Could you show some humanity when you speak?

264
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,970
There's a ton of paperwork.

265
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,490
Collecting personal belongings,

266
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,850
death notices need a doctor's signature,

267
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
then we need to get

268
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,680
a hospital death certificate,

269
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,610
and it needs an official stamp too.

270
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,820
Why does it need a hospital stamp?

271
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,080
To cancel the household registration at the police station,

272
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,040
arrange cremation,

273
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,840
you need the hospital's official seal. Don't you understand?

274
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,680
Dad, please stop talking.

275
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,800
Xiao Yao.

276
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,560
Yao Yao.

277
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,320
What's wrong, Xiao Yao?

278
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,330
It's past 1 o'clock,

279
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,640
and we still have a performance tomorrow.

280
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,200
What performance?

281
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,600
Your son is lying in there,

282
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,480
he's gone,

283
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,000
what's the point of performing?

284
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,970
We must perform.

285
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,050
I believe Zhou Tong's spirit is watching over us,

286
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,960
and he would want you to perform.

287
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,410
He loved you,

288
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,930
and he would want to see you doing well.

289
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,000
Son.

290
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,440
Just one.

291
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,380
Did you sign the doctor's notice?

292
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,120
Yes, I did.

293
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,560
When you go to work tomorrow,

294
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,720
don't forget to go to the medical office

295
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,120
to get the hospital seal.

296
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,770
Come over and sign this.

297
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
Do you want to check everything?

298
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,520
Mrs. Song.

299
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
Do you love Zhou Tong?

300
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,500
If you love him, why break up with him?

301
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,080
I don't.

302
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,480
You don't?

303
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,300
If you don't, why did he leave?

304
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,680
He even got the lead role.

305
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,010
Just let him go then.

306
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,700
Why ask him to come back to see your performance?

307
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,520
It's strange.

308
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,780
This is the first time that boy has been so obedient.

309
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,880
Mrs. Song,

310
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,530
there's been a misunderstanding,

311
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,360
a mistake.

312
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,120
The person is gone because of a mistake.

313
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
It's all my fault.

314
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,540
What good does blaming you do?

315
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,640
If I blame you,

316
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,440
will my son come back?

317
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,600
I don't want to see you again.

318
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,840
Auntie.

319
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,120
Auntie.

320
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Auntie, don't go.

321
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,760
It's my fault,

322
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,880
all my fault.

323
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,360
I was the one who did wrong,

324
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,080
I've let Xiaoyao and the others down.

325
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,540
Auntie.

326
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,330
Old Qiao.

327
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,880
Auntie.

328
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,600
Hurry up.

329
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,360
Auntie, don't go, please.

330
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,080
Look after Xiaoyao.

331
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,800
I don't need your help with this.

332
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,000
Don't drive too fast.

333
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,880
Yaoyao.

334
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,050
We can't just keep staying here like this.

335
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:20,920
You should go back.

336
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,580
Zhou Tong, you're such a fool.

337
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,820
I was just using you for practice.

338
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,480
I've told you several times already,

339
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,760
but you still took it seriously.

340
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,800
I've already moved on to the White Snake role.

341
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,280
Thanks for your cooperation.

342
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,810
Goodbye.

343
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,280
It's all my fault.

344
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,160
Otherwise you wouldn't have met

345
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,560
Song Guanwang's son.

346
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,520
Auntie.

347
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,520
Auntie.

348
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,400
Auntie, I'm sorry.

349
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,240
I was the one who caused trouble,

350
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
I've wronged Xiao Yao.

351
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,700
Auntie.

352
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,380
Auntie.

353
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,320
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

354
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,040
Go away.

355
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,220
Xiaomi.

356
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,640
Go take care of Yaoyao,

357
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
I'll walk her out.

358
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,320
I'm sorry, Xiaoyao.

359
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,800
I'm a complete idiot,

360
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,080
I'm a terrible person,

361
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,640
I'm an absolutely

362
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,700
horrible villain.

363
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Don't forgive me.

364
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,480
Director.

365
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,600
There are still two performances left.

366
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,260
Do you think I can still dance?

367
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,620
If you don't dance,

368
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,200
who will?

369
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,160
Shake it!

370
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,680
Life can be

371
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,120
cruel sometimes.

372
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
There are many hardships in life

373
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,080
that you have to

374
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,580
face one by one on your own.

375
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,640
Yang Yun can't get over it.

376
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,080
The tickets are already issued.

377
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,040
Delete the video.

378
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,480
I don't want to

379
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,160
dance anymore.

380
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,490
What do you mean?

381
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,680
Guanwang.

382
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,880
Get in the car.

383
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,450
Why don't you

384
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,140
put your bag in the car.

385
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,640
It's so heavy.

386
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,320
I'll stay with you.

387
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,850
Back off,

388
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,440
don't get worked up. Just back off.

389
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,400
How far are you going to walk alone this late at night?

390
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,640
What if something happens?

391
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,240
What if?

392
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,260
Everything's already at rock bottom. What else could happen?

393
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,120
Get away.

394
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,480
Why are you yelling at me?

395
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,330
Don't you still have to live your life?

396
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,239
Hurting yourself

397
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,440
like this won't help.

398
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,889
What if you get sick?

399
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,690
What do you know?

400
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,810
I'm a living person too.

401
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,760
What don't I understand?

402
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
The dead are gone,

403
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,880
the living should live well.

404
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,280
That's all there is to it.

405
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,440
That was my own son.

406
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,170
Who hasn't lost someone close?

407
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,760
My wife

408
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,159
died from complications

409
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,489
giving birth to Xiaomi.

410
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,969
One comes, one goes.

411
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,889
Death certificate,

412
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,880
birth certificate,

413
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,400
I signed both on the same day.

414
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,920
Especially at times like this,

415
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,560
you need to take care of yourself.

416
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,620
Do you understand?

417
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,199
The living

418
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,929
need to act like they're alive.

419
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
Don't glare at me.

420
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,120
Let me carry your bag.

421
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,080
If you want to be alone,

422
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,540
just pretend I'm not here.

423
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
It's safer to have someone with you.

424
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,130
If you're in pain

425
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,960
or get upset,

426
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,890
you can even kick me a couple times.

427
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,840
Get in.

428
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,660
Come on, get in.

429
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,120
Don't touch my computer,

430
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,500
I'm talking to you.

431
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,900
Let me rest for a while.

432
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,600
Xiaoyao,

433
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,900
come up and get some sleep.

434
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,080
I'm not tired.

435
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,120
You need to rest,

436
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,660
you have a performance tomorrow.

437
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,160
Xiaomi,

438
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,380
was my White Snake dance good?

439
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,680
Really good.

440
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Then I've done justice to my mother.

441
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,920
Come up and sleep,

442
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,040
or at least lie down.

443
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,660
Otherwise you won't have energy to dance tomorrow.

444
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,850
Even if I don't sleep all night,

445
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,960
I have enough strength

446
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,760
to perform twice.

447
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,600
What do you mean?

448
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,060
I won't dance anymore after this.

449
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Why not?

450
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,000
I dance White Snake

451
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,720
because of Zhou Tong.

452
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,440
He's gone now.

453
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,760
Beijing,

454
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,380
I can't stay here anymore.

455
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,040
The streets,

456
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,040
the subway,

457
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
the Great Wall,

458
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,250
the Forbidden City.

459
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,240
When day breaks, I'll think of him everywhere I go.

460
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,520
What exactly are you saying?

461
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,460
Going home.

462
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,520
Your home is right here.

463
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,640
I want to go back to Hangzhou.

464
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,320
When?

465
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,770
After these two performances.

466
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,370
Xiaoyao,

467
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,600
I just got out of the subway,

468
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,660
I'll be there soon.

469
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:44,770
Xiaoyao,

470
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,040
I just got out of the subway,

471
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,170
I'll be right there.

472
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,080
