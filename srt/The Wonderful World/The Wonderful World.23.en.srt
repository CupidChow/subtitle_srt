1
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,520
Can we go back?

2
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,360
Yes, we can.

3
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,500
If we can come here, we can go back.

4
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,620
No, something's wrong with mine.

5
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,810
You need to twist it.

6
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,320
Don't touch it.

7
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,440
Let me fix it for you.

8
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,840
Fix yours first.

9
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,480
Are you tired?

10
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,760
No.

11
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,290
But you said you were tired yesterday.

12
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,760
I didn't.

13
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,360
You told my mom at home that you were exhausted,

14
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,090
grinding your teeth every day for over ten years.

15
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,560
Are you Zhou Tong?

16
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,420
Who else would I be?

17
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,960
What's wrong?

18
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,720
Are you upset?

19
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,720
No.

20
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,770
Look at that unhappy face of yours.

21
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,320
Why did I have to come all the way here to see you?

22
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,279
Yesterday at home,

23
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,010
what you said

24
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,760
was completely unreliable.

25
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,080
I thought

26
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,680
meeting you would finally let me breathe easy,

27
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
having a home in Beijing.

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,260
Haven't you met me now?

29
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,130
Besides,

30
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,890
everywhere can be home,

31
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,520
every place,

32
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,320
is a hometown.

33
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,580
What a happy thing.

34
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,820
Don't be upset.

35
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,620
Keep climbing upward,

36
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
infinite scenery

37
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,580
awaits at the dangerous peak.

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,200
Alright, we're here.

39
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,660
That'll be 300.

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
Here's your receipt.

41
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,040
Thank you.

42
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,320
Driver,

43
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,240
could you

44
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,700
wait for me for an hour?

45
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,120
In an hour,

46
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
you won't make it back with all the traffic.

47
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,640
How about two hours then?

48
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,480
Pay me enough and I'll wait here for you.

49
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,580
Here you go.

50
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,770
Alright.

51
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,440
Thank you.

52
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Don't mention it.

53
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,120
Hurry up!

54
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,580
I'm exhausted.

55
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,560
Just a few more steps,

56
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,490
I'll help you up.

57
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,620
Need a hand?

58
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,760
I'm scared.

59
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,659
What are you afraid of?

60
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,420
Afraid that

61
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,520
if you hold onto me,

62
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,450
I'll disappear.

63
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,320
Really?

64
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,680
Yes.

65
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Look at your face,

66
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,020
you believed me again.

67
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,130
Let's go.

68
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
I'll hold you.

69
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,900
Come on.

70
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,480
You said you'd spend every minute

71
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,610
of your life with me.

72
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,260
Plans can't keep up with changes.

73
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,400
You said everyone must be honest

74
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,800
and speak from the heart.

75
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,690
That was your true feeling.

76
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,440
I just took the liberty

77
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,100
of saying it

78
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,080
for you.

79
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,130
Will you always be here?

80
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,610
Don't forget me.

81
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,300
I'm right here.

82
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,480
Always here.

83
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,700
If you want me here,

84
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,320
I'll always be

85
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,700
right here.

86
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
There's nothing.

87
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,360
Duojing.

88
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Standing so high up

89
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
is too dangerous.

90
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Let's go back.

91
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,880
Go back where?

92
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,210
How about

93
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,850
I sing you a song?

94
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,520
No.

95
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,539
But there's nothing here.

96
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,380
We have each other,

97
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,210
isn't that nice?

98
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,010
Then I'll be completely quiet,

99
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,500
pretend I don't exist.

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,920
Don't leave.

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,460
I won't.

102
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
I miss you so much.

103
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,040
Me too.

104
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,730
Don't leave.

105
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,050
Wen Xiaoyao,

106
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,100
what are you doing?

107
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,620
Don't do anything stupid.

108
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,280
What's it to you?

109
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,080
I've seen you,

110
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
so it concerns me.

111
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,040
Go away.

112
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,700
I can't.

113
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,780
I need to keep an eye on you.

114
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,280
Why?

115
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,490
Xiaoyao.

116
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,250
It's so high up here,

117
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,040
there are rocks everywhere below,

118
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,700
falling would be disastrous.

119
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,320
Plus there's nobody around,

120
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,000
just me.

121
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,480
If I have to carry you down

122
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,440
from this mountain,

123
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,900
and then

124
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,320
take you to a hospital,

125
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,080
back to the city,

126
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,140
that would be a lot of trouble, right?

127
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,500
You're imitating him.

128
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
Imitating Zhou Tong.

129
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,900
I went to see

130
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,120
a crosstalk show yesterday,

131
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,080
and spent the evening with Uncle Qiao,

132
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,200
so I might sound a bit like a northerner now.

133
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,730
Don't copy the way he talks.

134
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,770
I'm not copying him.

135
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,820
I am myself.

136
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,300
Go away.

137
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,770
Wen Xiaoyao.

138
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,560
Heaven brought me

139
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,120
to you,

140
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,090
so you must listen to me.

141
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,720
Go away.

142
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,370
Xiaoyao,

143
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,370
Wen Xiaoyao.

144
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,600
Don't say my name,

145
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,900
Xu Tian.

146
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,410
Are you okay?

148
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,680
No.

149
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm

150
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,560
fine.

151
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,240
Promise me

152
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,660
you won't think such crazy thoughts anymore, okay?

153
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,360
Today

154
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,160
there's nobody here.

155
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,160
If I hadn't come,

156
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,120
what would have happened to you?

157
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,640
That's right,

158
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
if he hadn't come,

159
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,720
what then?

160
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,410
Wen Xiaoyao.

161
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,970
Wen Xiaoyao,

162
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,920
don't ever do this again.

163
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,530
Never again.

164
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,880
Yes,

165
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,300
don't do this anymore.

166
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,340
There are so many things to do in life,

167
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,180
and you're still so young.

168
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,340
Are you giving up dancing?

169
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,600
You've already become the lead dancer,

170
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,330
haven't you?

171
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,520
About dancing,

172
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,140
last time we were here,

173
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,450
what did you say?

174
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,410
Before, I just wanted to dance,

175
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,560
not knowing why I danced,

176
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,920
just dancing and dancing.

177
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Now I just want to sit here forever,

178
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,720
thinking about nothing.

179
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,120
What did I say?

180
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,640
That's such a waste,

181
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
it's not worth it.

182
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,360
You should keep dancing.

183
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,080
Why did you come back to Beijing?

184
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,500
I've been asking myself that too.

185
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Maybe it's because of my childhood.

186
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,250
Actually, I know

187
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,850
there's no real connection between Zhou Tong and me.

188
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,050
But this knot in my heart

189
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,660
just won't go away.

190
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
For over 20 years,

191
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,400
I've always imagined there was another me.

192
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,850
But now that Mom is gone,

193
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,570
even if there is another me,

194
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,020
wouldn't he be just as lonely?

195
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,040
Living alone

196
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
isn't easy at all.

197
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,940
You can only grit your teeth and carry on.

198
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
It's exhausting.

199
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,620
Then I suddenly met Shi Diandian,

200
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,600
and I thought

201
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,040
I would finally have a complete family.

202
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
In the days ahead,

203
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,800
I would care for her,

204
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
she would care for me,

205
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,160
how secure that would be.

206
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,680
But it was still exhausting.

207
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,780
So after thinking it through,

208
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,580
I still feel

209
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,780
that only Zhou Tong is family.

210
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
For over 20 years,

211
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,170
closer than family.

212
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,960
I'll visit Auntie Song tomorrow

213
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,570
and then head back to Hangzhou.

214
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,380
I never thought

215
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,770
we were the same kind of person.

216
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,960
You don't look anything like Zhou Tong.

217
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,810
Does he come here

218
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,080
often?

219
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,840
He's a photographer,

220
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,560
he's been to many places.

221
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,130
It is beautiful.

222
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,080
He says this place

223
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,680
is most beautiful at sunset.

224
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,680
Should we wait

225
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,820
until sunset then?

226
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,140
No need.

227
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,720
Since we're back in Beijing,

228
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,760
you should

229
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,420
continue dancing.

230
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
I didn't get to see

231
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,020
The Legend of the White Snake.

232
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,530
The theater company has a new production now.

233
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,400
New or old,

234
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,280
for me,

235
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,850
they're all new.

236
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,080
Diandian!

237
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,920
Diandian, open the door!

238
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,200
Open up!

239
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,120
Mommy's here.

240
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,760
Diandian!

241
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,360
I know you're in there,

242
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,160
open the door!

243
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,920
Fang,

244
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,050
get the keys,

245
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
open the door!

246
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,840
It's over.

247
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,250
Would you like to buy it?

248
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,880
Just looking.

249
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,680
You shouldn't cut them before selling.

250
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
When flowers are cut from the plant,

251
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,120
they naturally create

252
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,240
a seal at the wound.

253
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:56,920
I know.

254
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm not planning to sell them,

255
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,860
they're just for the shop.

256
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,730
It's for you.

257
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,240
Why?

258
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,660
Sorry about last time.

259
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,570
I apologize,

260
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,440
but this time I guarantee

261
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,570
every stem is fresh.

262
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,160
I never buy flowers,

263
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,640
thank you.

264
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,160
When you're with Diandian,

265
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,120
you also feel exhausted.

266
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,300
That's what you just said.

267
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,650
She's somewhat obsessive,

268
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,180
things she can't get over,

269
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,930
no one believes her when she speaks up.

270
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,920
The things you can't get over,

271
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,250
no one believes even if you don't say them.

272
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,680
She's been traumatized,

273
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,060
she's experienced

274
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,620
episodic amnesia.

275
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,290
What if she forgets you too?

276
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,800
I would be sad.

277
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,570
But why would she want to forget me?

278
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,600
Fear of pain

279
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
is what leads to forgetting.

280
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,400
Maybe she just has this ability.

281
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,440
I trust her,

282
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,280
but she doesn't trust me.

283
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,930
Diandian loves you.

284
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,600
If your love equals hers,

285
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,540
even distrust can feel sweet.

286
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,130
Does love

287
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,690
make people trust or distrust?

288
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,840
Diandian.

289
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
This is Fangfang,

290
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,060
is this Xu Tian?

291
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,410
How is Diandian?

292
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,560
Not good at all.

293
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,960
Did she call you?

294
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,760
No,

295
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,250
she's disappeared.

296
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,570
Her dorm is perfectly tidy,

297
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
something's happened again.

298
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
What's happened now?

299
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
She's having her old problem again.

300
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,080
At times like this,

301
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,120
wandering around is the most dangerous.

302
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,480
We don't know what she remembers and what she doesn't,

303
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,010
what if she gets lost again?

304
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,880
Well,

305
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,400
why don't you call her?

306
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,800
Isn't her phone with me?

307
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,440
At this point,

308
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,760
calling her wouldn't help anyway.

309
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,160
We need to find her first,

310
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,400
then carefully

311
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
go along with whatever she says.

312
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,000
Let her contact whoever she wants to contact.

313
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,800
I've got to go,

314
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,220
keep your phone on.

315
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,880
Thank you for picking me up at the airport.

316
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,440
Wait,

317
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,410
after I pack my things at Uncle Qiao's,

318
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,280
I'll go straight to the airport and back to Hangzhou.

319
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,540
Take care of yourself,

320
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,200
live well.

321
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,320
Keep dancing,

322
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,580
go see Auntie Song.

323
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,330
Tell Auntie Song

324
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,240
I can't see her this time,

325
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,580
and I won't be coming back to Beijing.

326
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,330
Never again.

327
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,000
Check out this delicious ice cream!

328
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,330
Here you go, beautiful.

329
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,880
Delicious ice cream.

330
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:12,760
Hey, beautiful!

331
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,360
Take a look.

332
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,560
Delicious ice cream.

333
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
Check out this delicious ice cream!

334
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,680
Check out this delicious ice cream!

335
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,560
Thank you.

336
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Check out this delicious ice cream!

337
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Check out this delicious ice cream!

338
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,620
Check out this delicious ice cream! Thanks!

339
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,760
What are you doing here?

340
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,690
You're here too.

341
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,770
What did you buy?

342
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,580
Just browsing around.

343
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
Excuse me, sorry.

344
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,780
Let me have a taste.

345
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
It's really good.

346
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,180
Delicious.

347
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,400
Here, have another bite.

348
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,610
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

349
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,720
Might as well be dead.

350
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,540
Just a walking corpse.

351
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,500
Look how carefree you are.

352
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,260
Can't compare.

353
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm just stepping back from the front line.

354
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,290
It's about time anyway.

355
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,320
Did you call me here

356
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,440
just to keep putting me down?

357
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,240
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

358
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,800
Where to?

359
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,480
Back to that dump of yours

360
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,940
to lock yourself away with your depression?

361
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
What else can I do?

362
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
In life,

363
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,560
when one door closes,

364
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,420
another opens.

365
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,660
Song Guanwang.

366
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,440
Beautiful and kind-hearted.

367
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,160
Has a car and a house,

368
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,240
you two are such a perfect match.

369
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,440
Sparks flew at your first meeting.

370
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,760
I was really careless.

371
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,720
What are you talking about?

372
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,120
Let me be honest with you,

373
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,280
Song Guanwang

374
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,880
is not my type at all.

375
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,500
We're buddies,

376
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,120
I have no reason to lie to you.

377
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,380
You're a great artist,

378
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,880
otherwise why would I

379
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,840
be

380
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
constantly sponsoring you?

381
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,160
My money doesn't grow on trees.

382
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,760
Why would I push such a great artist like you

383
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,490
into Guanwang Entertainment?

384
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,280
Do you get it now?

385
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,400
Everything I've done

386
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,280
was just to

387
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,680
get you noticed by Song Guanwang,

388
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,560
to bring

389
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,240
you two together as a couple.

390
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,760
I'm out of breath just saying it.

391
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,210
Matchmaking for me,

392
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,680
how thoughtful of you.

393
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,920
Matchmaking for me? You were the one

394
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,080
who first

395
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,800
fell in love.

396
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,760
Did I say that?

397
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,520
Go ahead.

398
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,080
Song Guanwang had you

399
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,810
head over heels.

400
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,860
That's because I'm loyal.

401
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,800
I was too eager to

402
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,680
get your attention.

403
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,520
What do I have to do with Song Guanwang?

404
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,220
Let me tell you,

405
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,480
if you reject Song Guanwang

406
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,320
I'll kill you.

407
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,200
What's the rush?

408
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm frustrated because you're like mud that won't stick to the wall.

409
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,400
Why are you insulting me now?

410
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,340
Give me a straight answer,

411
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,520
are you in or not?

412
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
I'm a man,

413
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,370
if anyone's following, she should follow me.

414
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,410
Look at that,

415
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,080
finally speaking your true feelings.

416
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,440
Am I wrong?

417
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,060
Absolutely right.

418
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,720
I'll set up a meeting,

419
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,210
I'll be the matchmaker,

420
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,680
and definitely bring you two together.

421
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,930
I'll arrange it now,

422
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,040
right away.

423
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,840
Better not wait too long.

424
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,480
Hey, Qiao,

425
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,330
I was just about to call you.

426
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,880
Xiaoyao said

427
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,320
Xu Tian has come to Beijing.

428
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,050
Did you know?

429
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
He's staying at my place.

430
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,290
Go open the door.

431
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,180
Go answer the door.

432
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,440
Do I have to arrange everything?

433
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,080
You really think you're a prince or something?

434
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,440
Are you out of your mind?

435
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,600
Master Zhao is at your place too?

436
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,740
Just watching.

437
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,890
I'll set up a meeting

438
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,000
for us.

439
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,520
Brother Gang.

440
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,680
Let's get this matter sorted out.

441
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,540
Where did you go halfway through?

442
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,330
Alright,

443
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,300
go ahead and do your thing.

444
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,340
Uncle Qiao.

445
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,360
What's going on?

446
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,840
Xiaoyao and

447
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,960
Xu Tian are back.

448
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,000
We agreed

449
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,960
it would be

450
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,560
just the three of us - you, me, and Zhao Gang.

451
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,040
Let's not wait until tomorrow,

452
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
let's do it today.

453
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,800
Is there any need to rush?

454
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,840
You brought Xu Tian along too.

455
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,480
Fine.

456
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,810
Alright,

457
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,420
I got it.

458
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,480
Uncle Hui.

459
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,540
How did you end up with him?

460
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,260
We ran into each other.

461
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,480
He was about to leave,

462
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,810
going back to Hangzhou.

463
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,760
What the hell? Who is he?

464
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,960
Haven't you met him in Hangzhou?

465
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,760
No, I haven't.

466
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,360
Don't pretend you don't know.

467
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,760
Save your act

468
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,200
for Song Guanwang.

469
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,460
Yaoyao might have met him, but I haven't.

470
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,880
I'm at your doorstep now.

471
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,040
211009.

472
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,500
Xiaoyue, wait outside. I'll go in alone.

473
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,680
No one on the first floor.

474
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,480
Diandian?

475
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,600
Diandian?

476
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,080
Nobody here.

477
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,040
Keep searching,

478
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm heading to the airport now,

479
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,760
and I'll get the earliest flight when I arrive.

480
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,410
Leshuiting.

481
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,240
What?

482
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,160
Leshuiting Pavilion in the Flower Harbor Fish Viewing area,

483
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,020
go check there,

484
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,120
it's not far from Diandian's workplace.

485
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,450
Okay.

486
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,280
Fang Fang.

487
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,960
I saw her

488
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,930
just inside.

489
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,860
Did she see you?

490
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,520
No,

491
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I was too far away.

492
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,400
You go in first

493
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,260
and talk to her.

494
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,000
I'll come in if everything's fine.

495
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,960
Me go in first?

496
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,400
How can I go in first?

497
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,940
You're her mother.

498
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,320
Xu Tian, you introduced her.

499
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,570
So it's my fault now?

500
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,770
Sister Fang,

501
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,680
if Dian Dian has an episode,

502
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,960
she probably wouldn't even remember her grandpa.

503
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,640
Exactly,

504
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,020
hurry up and go.

505
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,120
All right.

506
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm not senile yet,

507
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,260
what do I need this for?

508
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,400
I'm just worried you might forget.

509
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,920
No good deed goes unpunished.

510
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,960
The scenery is really nice over there.

511
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,600
Let's go there.

512
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,060
Come on.

513
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,090
Okay.

514
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,600
I'll take a photo for you.

515
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,060
Hold me.

516
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,260
Excuse me, miss

517
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:05,850
could you

518
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,480
help us

519
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,360
take

520
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,520
a photo?

521
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,520
Sure.

522
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,120
Thank you.

523
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:16,960
Thanks.

524
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,040
One, two.

525
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
One more, please.

526
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,280
Thanks.

527
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,970
You're visiting West Lake too?

528
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,880
Miss, you're really beautiful.

529
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,840
Where are you from?

530
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,440
Beijing.

531
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,600
Would you like us to take a photo for you?

532
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,000
No, thanks.

533
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,440
Be careful on your way.

534
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,040
Watch out!

535
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,490
I don't know you.

536
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,960
It doesn't matter if you don't know me.

537
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,040
What if Xu Tian comes back and doesn't recognize you either?

538
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,570
When is Xu Tian coming back?

539
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,400
Mom.

540
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,490
What are you doing here?

541
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,970
Keeping you company

542
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,130
to see West Lake.

543
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,480
This city is so beautiful.

544
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,970
As if you just arrived in Hangzhou.

545
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,880
How long have I been here?

546
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,570
Not long.

547
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,680
Where did I come from?

548
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,610
Beijing.

549
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,400
Yes.

550
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,880
Am I having trouble remembering again?

551
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:25,880
No.

552
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,640
If I can't remember,

553
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,000
you must tell me.

554
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Look at West Lake.

555
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,140
Remember what you can,

556
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,420
and what you can't,

557
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,930
just doesn't exist.

558
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,660
I remember something.

559
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,040
What?

560
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,500
The Legend of the White Snake.

561
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,980
Do you see Leifeng Pagoda over there?

562
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,920
I have a friend

563
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,680
who plays Bai Suzhen.

564
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,450
What's her name?

565
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,450
Wen Xiaoyao.

566
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,620
What about Xu Tian?

567
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,280
Your phone call just now.

568
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,020
I didn't answer it.

569
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,850
Want to check it?

570
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,639
Wen Xiaoyao.

571
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
You've never mentioned her before.

572
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,420
She's a ballet dancer.

573
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,489
Where is she?

574
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,370
Beijing.

575
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,940
I've never met her.

576
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,840
There are photos in my phone.

577
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,400
Are you good friends?

578
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,040
How close?

579
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,680
Very close.

580
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,940
Could that call

581
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,800
have been from her?

582
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,930
Should we call her back?

583
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,820
What if she needs something from you?

584
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,490
What could she want?

585
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,680
Maybe she's coming to Hangzhou.

586
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,320
No way.

587
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,340
How can you be sure?

588
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,280
Maybe she wants you to go to Beijing.

589
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,680
I just came from Beijing.

590
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,250
You just came from Beijing?

591
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,860
That's what you just said.

592
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,130
Then maybe she wants you to go back to Beijing.

593
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,490
It's connected.

594
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,080
Do you want to talk to her?

595
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Sister Diandian.

596
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,440
Let Mom say hello to her,

597
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,680
okay?

598
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Ask Wen Xiaoyao

599
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,890
if I should go to Beijing

600
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,330
or if she's coming here.

601
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,850
Wen Xiaoyao.

602
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,770
I'm Diandian's mother.

603
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,920
Hello, ma'am.

604
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,810
Xiaoyao,

605
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,720
thank you for your help.

606
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,800
Is Xu Tian with you?

607
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,520
Yes,

608
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,320
we're on our way to the airport with him.

609
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,880
Listen,

610
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,080
let Xu Tian hear this too.

611
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,120
Okay.

612
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,720
Tell Xu Tian not to return to Hangzhou,

613
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,920
it won't help anyway.

614
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,490
Xiaoyao,

615
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,900
Diandian only remembers you now.

616
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,880
How is that possible?

617
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,330
Mr. Fang.

618
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,120
This is Xu Tian. I'm listening.

619
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,050
Please go ahead.

620
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,200
Xu Tian,

621
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,320
Diandian has forgotten you,

622
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,720
it's selective amnesia.

623
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,400
You are the core trigger of her condition,

624
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,130
the severity

625
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,240
and duration are unpredictable.

626
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,570
It could last a few days,

627
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
or maybe six months to a year.

628
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,600
Now let me ask you something.

629
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,080
If you're feeling tired of this,

630
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,040
you could take this opportunity

631
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,840
to end things,

632
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,760
and I'll take Diandian home.

633
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,960
Or do you still care about Diandian?

634
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,020
I do care about her.

635
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,000
The flight is booked.

636
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,740
Wen Xiaoyao

637
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,050
will pick you up.

638
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,740
What about you?

639
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,290
Do you want me to come along?

640
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,250
First time I've heard of something like this,

641
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,480
a woman completely

642
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,360
forgetting her own husband.

643
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,080
Is this really a medical condition?

644
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
She doesn't recognize him anymore.

645
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,520
They'll have to get to know each other again.

646
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,780
Are you still leaving?

647
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,100
I told him to come back.

648
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,080
Get in the car.

649
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,420
Where are we going?

650
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,520
I've set up a meeting,

651
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,660
it's quite important.

652
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,610
I'm taking you to meet Zhou Tong's mother.

653
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,740
Uncle Qiao.

654
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,240
Me?

655
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,880
It's not a big deal.

656
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,090
If I hadn't come to find you,

657
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,080
would you have just

658
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,880
wandered around here until dark?

659
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,560
Can you man up a little?

660
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,490
Your wife's condition,

661
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,200
didn't you know about it before?

662
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,520
I did.

663
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,760
So you still got married, right?

664
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,890
She didn't deceive you before,

665
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,860
and she still wanted to marry you.

666
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,640
If there's an illness, treat it.

667
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,600
No big deal.

668
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,880
Your wife's mind

669
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
has some issues.

670
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,960
But her hands, feet,

671
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,080
internal organs,

672
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
they're fine, right?

673
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
She can take care of herself, right?

674
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,000
Yes.

675
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,680
Then thank heavens for that.

676
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,140
If you truly love her and got a call

677
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,300
saying she was paralyzed,

678
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,120
wouldn't you

679
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,760
willingly take care of her for life?

680
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,320
Yes.

681
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,940
You'd do that for anyone you love.

682
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,300
Xiao Yao already said,

683
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,090
start over like strangers,

684
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,450
fall in love all over again.

685
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,880
It's like finding a new wife,

686
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,400
you're actually coming out ahead,

687
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:12,920
kid.

688
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,530
Uncle Qiao, you have a way of making

689
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,160
everything sound so simple.

690
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,080
Well, tell me something complicated then.

691
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,020
Unless you don't want to be with her anymore.

692
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
But you can't just

693
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,920
wander around in the wilderness

694
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,680
pretending to be depressed.

695
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,540
Come on, get in the car.

696
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,960
I'm freezing out here too.

697
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,560
Let's go.

698
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,300
Move it.

699
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,370
Where's Xiaomi?

700
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,970
I don't know.

701
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,580
You don't know where she went?

702
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,360
Everyone's being so difficult.

703
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,460
If Zhou Tong were still alive,

704
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,560
he wouldn't just stand by watching

705
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,020
you two ignore each other.

706
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,000
We're not.

707
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,520
Don't think I don't know.

708
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,050
Zhou Tong's life was short,

709
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,200
but yours isn't over yet.

710
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,370
Are you going to move on with your life?

711
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,000
Answer me.

712
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,480
Yes.

713
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,800
Then go find Xiaomi

714
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,360
and act like a proper big sister.

715
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,720
Xu Tian is with me today,

716
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,200
you and Xiaomi

717
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,260
should discuss Xu Tian's situation.

718
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,320
You can't win.

719
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm looking at you

720
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,280
but thinking about something else.

721
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm staring at you,

722
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,810
but my eyes can look elsewhere.

723
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,370
You're cross-eyed?

724
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,240
That's an advantage.

725
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,890
You lose.

726
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:26,800
Fine.

727
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,300
You've got skills.

728
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,600
Hurry up and eat.

729
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,200
Their chicken is delicious,

730
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,880
they raise them themselves.

731
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,560
How do you know they raise them?

732
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,480
Because I also raised chickens at their place,

733
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,210
and that's what you're eating.

734
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,120
Is it good?

735
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,210
Its name was Little Flower.

736
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,320
You name your chickens?

737
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,480
Just kidding.

738
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,690
What are we doing right now?

739
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,560
Eating.

740
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,600
Dating.

741
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,400
Director of Photography

742
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,650
ADR Director

743
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,240
Creative Director
