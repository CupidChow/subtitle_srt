1
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,880
My name is Xu Tian.

2
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,479
Help me

3
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,210
run a cheongsam shop in Children's Alley.

4
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,479
They said it's business.

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,759
Actually,

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm just running errands for my mom.

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Mom is pretty.

8
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,570
Especially when she wears cheongsam.

9
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,210
Let's go.

10
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,490
Let's go.

11
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
She's also a Vietnamese fan.

12
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,530
Her favorite

13
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,639
is "Tale of the White Snake".

14
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
She often took me to the theater.

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,960
Even if I always sleep in the drums,

16
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,079
Okay.

17
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,360
One more, please.

18
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,520
Okay.

19
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,160
Thank you.

20
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,610
Here.

21
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,800
Ready.

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,960
When you wash the photos,

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,520
be careful.

24
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Don't expose it.

25
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,480
Okay, don't worry.

26
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,480
Oh no.

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,240
I forgot to give this cheongsam to Mr. Jia.

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,960
It's okay next time.

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,720
No, this...

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,250
Hurry up.

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,200
At the backstage,

32
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,520
I saw Ms. Jia who played Bai Suzhen.

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,060
who played Bai Suzhen.

34
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,160
That year,

35
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,300
my mom was sick too.

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,380
In a blink of an eye,

37
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,780
Mom has been gone for 18 years.

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,500
I came here every week.

39
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,810
Maybe this place

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,960
the closest place to mom.

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,200
Brother Tian.

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,220
It's clear.

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,040
Let's go.

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,200
Gosh.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,400
I guess the city hasn't downloaded yet.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,090
Let's go, Brother Tian.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,560
Are there many people going to the tower today?

48
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,290
More than 250 people are going to the tower today.

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,400
It's empty now.

50
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,160
Brother Tian.

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,160
You always ask how many people you want.

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
but you didn't go up.

53
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,130
What do you mean?

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,200
It's heavy with many people.

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,000
It's heavy.

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
Who are you pressing?

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,640
No way.

58
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,360
Do you think Bai Suzhen is really under the tower?

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,520
Are you kidding me?

60
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,720
That's a fairy tale.

61
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,980
You take it seriously?

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,760
Let's go.

63
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,610
It's time to clear the room.

64
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,760
Come on.

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,800
Hurry up.

66
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,260
Close the door!

67
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,440
We're closed.

68
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,200
The demons are coming out in this weather.

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,800
Who would do human business?

70
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
It's so dark.

71
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,360
It's only 2 p.m.

72
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,000
Dude.

73
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,620
Who are you?

74
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,760
Don't get me wrong.

75
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm a tourist.

76
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,280
As you can see,

77
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,920
The rain is too heavy today.

78
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm not drenched.

79
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,820
My shoes are full of water.

80
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,480
Your door is open and no one is here.

81
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,010
I knew it.

82
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll get changed

83
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,480
and leave right away.

84
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,400
Don't worry. I didn't touch

85
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,800
I didn't touch anything.

86
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
The people of Hangzhou are kind and nice.

87
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,960
You can't kick me out like this.

88
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,560
Right?

89
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,000
Buddy.

90
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,800
Are you the owner of this house?

91
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,320
How do I turn on the light?

92
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,920
Dry it.

93
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,720
Thank you.

94
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,560
Hurry up.

95
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,920
I think Auntie Steel will be angry today.

96
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,780
He's been in a bad mood these days.

97
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,200
He has never been happy anyway.

98
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,280
Sister Yun almost didn't listen to him during the rehearsal the day before yesterday.

99
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
I see.

100
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,800
We might have to fight today.

101
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,200
Let's rehearse in the theater.

102
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,320
Hurry up.

103
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,040
Ru, hurry up.

104
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,690
Why are you rehearsing?

105
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,680
I haven't started yet

106
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Where is Yang Yun?

107
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,740
I don't know

108
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,600
Aren't you two a couple?

109
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,400
I want to be a couple.

110
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,380
You, Xu Xian, she, Bai Suzhen,

111
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,880
aren't rehearsing together?

112
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,360
She's a fairy in the play.

113
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,280
I'm a mortal.

114
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,480
For over a thousand years,

115
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,320
I haven't been together

116
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,520
for decades.

117
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
You don't need to talk about ballet.

118
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,760
You all have sharp tongue.

119
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,500
Go get Yang Yun.

120
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,440
Go get him.

121
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,400
I'll go get Yang Yun.

122
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,450
Act 2, Lake Tour.

123
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,320
Music.

124
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,960
Up.

125
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,560
Music. Stop.

126
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,800
Jommy.

127
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,240
Director,

128
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,960
You ate too much in the morning.

129
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,560
Lake Tour.

130
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,240
Bai Suzhen likes Xu Xian.

131
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,600
They're flirting.

132
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,400
How can we rehearse without Sister Yun?

133
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,120
If she doesn't come to the theater, she won't turn around.

134
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,450
That's not what I meant.

135
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,160
How about

136
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,200
find someone

137
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,580
to replace Bai Suzhen.

138
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,770
Why don't you feel awkward too?

139
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,960
Who replaced Bai Suzhen?

140
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,890
I couldn't find her.

141
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,800
Shaking.

142
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,200
Oh, my.

143
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,319
Oh, my.

144
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,160
What are you doing?

145
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,089
Something's up.

146
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:14,960
Last time,

147
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,980
you introduced

148
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,700
introduce a girl to me.

149
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,760
Which one?

150
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,380
I've only introduced one.

151
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,640
the city road information collection center.

152
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,160
The backstage maintenance.

153
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,760
You don't like her, do you?

154
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,220
Are you still in touch?

155
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,520
We're relatives. We can contact each other anytime.

156
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,580
What are you doing?

157
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,280
I want

158
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,120
Can we meet again?

159
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
You've finally come to your senses.

160
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,760
I want to ask her

161
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,480
to help.

162
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,740
Yesterday,

163
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,480
I left you.

164
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,010
When I went back,

165
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
I met

166
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,520
someone

167
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,880
just like me.

168
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,560
You saw it too.

169
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,480
Yesterday...

170
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,140
The weather was weird.

171
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,320
Later,

172
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,520
the wind stopped and the rain stopped.

173
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,780
When the sun comes out,

174
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,980
when the sun comes out.

175
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
People don't disappear, right?

176
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
There's a camera in front of my shop.

177
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,210
There are two groups

178
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,640
There are two groups.

179
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,800
You have one too.

180
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,520
Seo-jin.

181
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,440
You're always daydreaming.

182
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Have you taken medicine these days?

183
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,490
I just want to figure it out.

184
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,440
Seo-jin.

185
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,040
Your mom passed away 20 years ago.

186
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,810
Stop thinking about it.

187
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,920
19 years.

188
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,120
You should start dating

189
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,640
and get married, you know?

190
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,000
When you meet her later,

191
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,560
Her name is...

192
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,240
Gran.

193
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,360
Look.

194
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,440
You even forgot the girl's name.

195
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,420
Mr. Shi has the same surname as me.

196
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,050
I'll call her later.

197
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
Call her now.

198
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,490
Do you want flowers?

199
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,440
You've been standing for almost five minutes.

200
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm just looking.

201
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,050
What are you looking at?

202
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,050
Flowers.

203
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,240
Are you buying or not?

204
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,600
You shouldn't cut it before selling it.

205
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,640
The flowers are cut off from plants.

206
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,770
they will secrete a cover on the wound.

207
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,900
When customers buy it,

208
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,800
cut another 45 degrees incision

209
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,360
Insert it into the water immediately.

210
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,620
It's only been preserved for a long time.

211
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,720
I'll give you a discount for this batch.

212
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,040
No, thanks.

213
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,480
Hello, Gran.

214
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,280
Grandpa!

215
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,680
Gran.

216
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,640
The young man I introduced to you last time, Xu Tian.

217
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,880
I introduced to you last time?

218
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,610
He has a good impression of you.

219
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,450
Do you want to

220
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,440
meet him?

221
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,400
Who?

222
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,480
Oh, my.

223
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,580
It's in your phone number.

224
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,920
I'm sure you didn't delete it.

225
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,960
I saved it for you.

226
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,520
Xu Tian.

227
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,520
Yes.

228
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,280
Xu Tian.

229
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,220
Grandy.

230
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,400
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

231
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
I'll make an appointment for you two, okay?

232
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,400
Okay.

233
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,500
I'll call you when I make an appointment.

234
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,130
Beauty, do you like flowers or not?

235
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,080
Yes.

236
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,700
Will you buy it?

237
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,250
You'll see withering if you buy it.

238
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Hello, Director.

239
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,500
She's really good at dancing.

240
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,320
Lower your voice.

241
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,440
Go on.

242
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,120
There's nothing inside.

243
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,040
When you see someone you like,

244
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,740
How do you feel?

245
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,210
Jump.

246
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,400
What does that mean?

247
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,360
Forget the process.

248
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,760
Life is full of ups and downs.

249
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,520
But...

250
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,720
Are you born to die?

251
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,210
You want to be the chief?

252
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,400
Yes.

253
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,640
But I'm not as good as Sister Yun.

254
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,640
What's so good about her?

255
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,280
Dance.

256
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,780
There are four levels.

257
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,690
You can be a dancer with good basic skills.

258
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
He's full of charisma.

259
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,340
Excellent.

260
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,840
To be loved by someone

261
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,930
I tried the bitterness and sweetness of love.

262
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,160
I can touch myself

263
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,880
and also influence others.

264
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,080
and finally experienced parting.

265
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,480
understand gains and losses,

266
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,560
can you become

267
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,440
a real artist.

268
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,880
What level is Yun in?

269
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,020
Have you ever been in a relationship?

270
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,120
No.

271
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,760
Nonsense.

272
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,780
Not even close.

273
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,700
A piece of white paper.

274
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,360
I can work hard.

275
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,240
How?

276
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,720
Dating?

277
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,640
With whom?

278
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,260
You're wasting your time.

279
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,600
This is all you have.

280
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,200
Hangzhou is not so damp.

281
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,360
Why is it so wet?

282
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,080
You're in the water.

283
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,760
This kid.

284
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Look at this smell.

285
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,840
Can you still wear it?

286
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,040
Can we discuss something?

287
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,480
If you continue to be like this,

288
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,280
I won't be filial to you.

289
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,240
You don't have to be too filial.

290
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,570
Okay.

291
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,600
I'll leave tomorrow.

292
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll continue tomorrow.

293
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,960
Find a girlfriend tomorrow.

294
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,720
and get married later.

295
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
Go wherever you want.

296
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,400
Mr. Song.

297
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,000
I don’t have time.

298
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,520
I've booked the tickets.

299
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,320
Then don't say filial piety.

300
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
You're not my son.

301
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,320
It hurts my feelings.

302
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,760
Look at you.

303
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,360
Why don't you

304
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,650
Why don't you have a job?

305
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,360
This is work.

306
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
This is a good job.

307
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,040
Take photos and write travel notes.

308
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,840
Your son, I'm the Big V of the Donkey Association.

309
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,570
A million fans are just for fun.

310
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,730
You took this yourself?

311
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,970
I took it myself.

312
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,580
Take photos yourself.

313
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,440
What?

314
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,010
So you have a companion when you go out.

315
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,520
I see.

316
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,000
Not what

317
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,780
Men or women

318
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,480
No there's no woman

319
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,380
That's a man

320
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,720
No, not even a man.

321
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I'm always alone. You know that.

322
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,240
Alone?

323
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,640
Isn't this you?

324
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,160
Take a picture of yourself.

325
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,960
Why is your photo in your camera?

326
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,880
It's true.

327
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,360
Mom, can you stop coaxing me?

328
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,200
I feel a little dizzy.

329
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,560
Can you let me rest for a while?

330
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,360
Don't bother.

331
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,360
OMG

332
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,560
It's wet

333
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,680
I'll get you a thermometer

334
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,360
That's weird.

335
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,050
Open your mouth.

336
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,170
Close it.

337
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,520
Come, sit tight.

338
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,480
You're over 20 years old.

339
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,680
You're still single.

340
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,360
No, I'm not urging you to get married.

341
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
I just want you to find a girlfriend.

342
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,880
Okay.

343
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,330
Open your mouth.

344
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,400
I'll fly the horse tomorrow.

345
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,460
Don't mess with me.

346
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,660
Don't go anywhere.

347
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,600
You have a fever.

348
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,440
39.1 degrees.

349
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,080
Look.

350
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,960
39.1 degrees.

351
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,540
Do you have a fever?

352
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,160
It shouldn't be.

353
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,560
Jommy.

354
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,320
Jommy.

355
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,300
What are you doing?

356
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,650
I have to make up my mind.

357
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,340
This...

358
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,040
What is it?

359
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,000
Wait a minute.

360
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,540
I'm not wearing it.

361
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,800
Talk.

362
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,680
What's wrong with you?

363
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,960
It's quite stimulating.

364
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,120
No.

365
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,920
Dating.

366
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,770
I'm afraid I can't make up my mind if I don't write it down.

367
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,480
It's a deal.

368
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:43,920
With whom?

369
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,760
No one.

370
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,640
Come on.

371
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,040
It's only been half a day and you already have someone.

372
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,720
Didn't you practice this afternoon?

373
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,160
I was scolded by Aunt Steel for dancing Bai Suzhen.

374
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,800
She said there was nothing in my heart.

375
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,160
I don't know the sweetness and bitterness of love.

376
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
I see.

377
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,600
I support you.

378
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,140
What kind of person do you want to talk to?

379
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,520
My dad will arrange it for you.

380
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,450
He's a social man. He has a wild way.

381
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,680
Daughter,

382
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,840
Why can't you care about your dad?

383
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,970
Is your heart not feeling well?

384
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,600
No.

385
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:49,960
I just want to...

386
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,560
My chin is broken. You didn't care about me.

387
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,720
What happened?

388
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,200
Here.

389
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,000
This month's rent...

390
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,560
Stop it.

391
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,320
What rent?

392
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,880
By the way,

393
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,060
find a honest man for Shaking.

394
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:09,800
A man?

395
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,280
Aunt Steel asked her to date.

396
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,160
Date?

397
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,600
What do you think your dad does?

398
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,800
Where can I find him?

399
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,320
It's time to experience life.

400
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,440
I...

401
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,320
Can I find it?

402
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,210
If you don't,

403
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,280
If you don't,

404
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,160
I'll take her to the street.

405
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,920
You even threatened me.

406
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Are you done?

407
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,020
Uncle Hui is responsible for men.

408
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,560
So smooth.

409
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
Experience life.

410
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,240
I know.

411
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,680
Observe.

412
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,840
What is it?

413
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,020
Do you have a girl by your side?

414
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Let me introduce.

415
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,720
Well...

416
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,560
Don't do that you know everything.

417
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,400
I want a piece of white paper.

418
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,520
What's the use?

419
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,080
Be serious.

420
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,280
I just fooled my son.

421
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,570
You have to hurry up.

422
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,360
Why do you

423
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Why do you have to find me?

424
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,480
You're a social man.

425
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,880
What impression did I leave for you?

426
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,160
Do I?

427
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,120
Yes.

428
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,400
Of course.

429
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,040
A piece of paper.

430
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
I want to date too.

431
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,440
I knew it.

432
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
there are many girls around you.

433
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,940
Don't get me wrong.

434
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,760
Hello.

435
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,000
Who will Uncle Hui arrange for me?

436
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,560
You are too anxious.

437
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,720
Wouldn't it be awkward if you meet someone messy?

438
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,360
Why do you think so much?

439
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,520
You have to make him like you.

440
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,010
Of course, you have to like him too.

441
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,920
The peach leaves

442
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,400
The willow leaves cover the sky.

443
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,200
It's...

444
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,360
It shouldn't be.

445
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,920
Tong.

446
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,440
Tong, wait for me.

447
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,480
I need to get something.

448
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,320
What?

449
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,560
What are you doing?

450
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,400
It’s the festival.

451
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,480
For Mr. Song.

452
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,800
You should

453
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,120
Just carry it up.

454
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,580
Why are you giving it to me?

455
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
It's quite heavy.

456
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,600
This...

457
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,000
Mr. Song is sick.

458
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,080
I...

459
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,400
I feel a little uncomfortable.

460
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I have a fever.

461
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,080
Mr. Song.

462
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,560
Where did you get the fruit?

463
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,610
It's a free show.

464
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,120
I haven't paid rent for four months.

465
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,400
All you do is send fruits.

466
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,960
The fruits are expensive now.

467
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,200
What is this?

468
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,080
I bought some medicine.

469
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,520
and a thermometer.

470
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,639
They always say I have a fever.

471
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,639
I don't feel anything.

472
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,199
I guess

473
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,060
our temperature is not accurate.

474
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,520
You can't take the medicine casually.

475
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,280
No.

476
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,159
Can you feel the fever

477
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,080
No, but I don't feel dizzy either.

478
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,810
I think you feel a little dizzy.

479
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,320
Like this.

480
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,600
The thermometer is new

481
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,320
You need to wash it before using it.

482
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,440
I'll send it to you later.

483
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,120
Okay.

484
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,160
Here. Drink it.

485
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,520
No, mom.

486
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,720
I have medicine for cold.

487
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,520
I'll take some with me.

488
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,850
The flight is tomorrow.

489
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,320
Here.

490
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,530
Open your mouth.

491
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,490
Sit down.

492
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,320
What I said yesterday was in vain.

493
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,100
You're not worried at all.

494
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,650
What am I worried about?

495
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,880
Tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.

496
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
Guangming Pavilion.

497
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,280
What are you doing?

498
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
Miss has made an appointment for you.

499
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,000
with you.

500
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,050
Mr. Song.

501
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,520
We can’t change the flight.

502
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,440
We still have time.

503
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,720
It’s more than 2 p.m.

504
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,920
Mr. Song, what problem can I have?

505
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,640
With your tricks,

506
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,080
my heart is like a mirror.

507
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,520
There are three unfilial sons and no descendants.

508
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,880
You're still single.

509
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,450
You think you're right?

510
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,610
Open your mouth.

511
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,720
41.2 degrees.

512
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,840
No way.

513
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,090
The thermometer is broken.

514
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,020
We have to believe in science.

515
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,280
Drink it.

516
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,130
Shaking.

517
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,920
Tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.

518
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,500
What are you doing?

519
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,720
A blind date.

520
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,320
Didn't you ask me

521
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,280
for you to date?

522
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,400
The son of a domineering female president

523
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,440
is cultured.

524
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,800
and classy.

525
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,520
He said yes because he trusts me.

526
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
Don't take it too seriously.

527
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,800
You said you wanted to experience life.

528
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,960
You broke his heart

529
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,360
and my business.

530
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,040
What do you mean?

531
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,120
Do I need to report to you?

532
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,560
Let's stop at the subway entrance.

533
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,680
Really?

534
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,480
Let me ask Mr. Song for a photo.

535
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,160
What if he looks ugly?

536
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,760
Guess what he looks like.

537
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,840
Fan.

538
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,400
Tong.

539
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,960
Slow down, Tong.

540
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,840
You're really something. Don't fall down.

541
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,440
Why did you get up so early in the morning?

542
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,500
I almost fell down.

543
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,880
Dried fruit tea, Fan.

544
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,130
Why are you here? No one is on the stage.

545
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,640
To be honest, Fan,

546
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,520
I

547
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,440
not here to watch crosstalk today.

548
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,600
I'm meeting someone.

549
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,720
to show my filial piety.

550
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,400
Be filial.

551
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,570
Sit here.

552
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,200
Okay.

553
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,400
I'll get you some tea.

554
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,560
Okay, thank you.

555
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,360
Why are you wearing a mask?

556
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,600
I lied to him that he had a fever.

557
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,000
Otherwise, he would have to fly to Malaysia in the afternoon.

558
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,680
Did you send my son's photo to that girl?

559
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,330
Otherwise, I wouldn't even know who he is on a blind date.

560
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,920
He's alone downstairs.

561
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,020
Take a photo and send it to her.

562
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,760
I'm afraid he can't sit still.

563
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,320
I'll find a way and leave.

564
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,360
Have some tea. OK. Thank you.

565
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,120
You're welcome.

566
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,000
Do it yourself.

567
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,250
You're welcome.

568
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,960
Here.

569
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,920
See?

570
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,320
Love officially begins.

571
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,560
Who should I look for?

572
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,000
It's mine.

573
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
Here's the photo.

574
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,640
Look.

575
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,840
Where is this?

576
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,040
Not bad.

577
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,000
Are you serious?

578
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,120
It's not a show.

579
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,570
I'm more nervous than performing.

580
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,080
This girl

581
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,200
She's like a fairy.

582
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,720
Not bad.

583
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,880
Is it immortal?

584
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,560
is not as good as you in my eyes.

585
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,050
What do you mean?

586
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,080
When I was young,

587
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,120
I always wanted the heavens to like Xiaoxian.

588
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,480
At the age of immortality,

589
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,160
It's time to land.

590
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Right now,

591
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,240
like swordsmen.

592
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,480
Who is the hero?

593
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,080
You.

594
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,000
In my heart,

595
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,840
you are a heroine.

596
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,920
She's just a veteran.

597
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,480
Alright, stop it.

598
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,760
Send me the photo.

599
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,960
I'll send it to my son.

600
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:12,960
Okay.

601
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,210
Let's go.

602
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,320
I promised to wait for you outside.

603
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,080
Let me experience it too.

604
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,760
Cheong and my sister have been together for 1000 years.

605
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,640
Then she turned around and went on a date.

606
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,880
I'm experiencing life

607
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,410
Common experience.

608
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,080
A common goal.

609
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,090
The understudy becomes the chief.

610
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,660
The understudy will be the chief.

611
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,120
Come on.

612
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,240
Wen Xiaoshao.

613
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,530
Wang Peng Cheng, Liu Shuangxi.

614
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,800
Stanicam.

615
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,780
Music Producer

616
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,120
Ma Gunichi.
