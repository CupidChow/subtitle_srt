1
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
Stop filming.

2
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,170
Stop filming me. Film the scenery.

3
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,320
I'll send it to you later.

4
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,080
Come here.

5
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,039
I think

6
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,759
we should keep our distance for now.

7
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,620
Let's talk about something real.

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,560
How real?

9
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,560
I'll go first,

10
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,920
then

11
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,000
it'll be your turn.

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,400
Okay?

13
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,039
Fine.

14
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,960
See

15
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
this shadow?

16
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,920
Soon

17
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,880
there will be more and more of it,

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
and it'll be dark.

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,820
When I was a kid,

20
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,900
I watched helplessly as my father

21
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,100
died in his car.

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,579
That's been a shadow over my life.

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,140
That's why I studied psychology in college,

24
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,460
hoping to heal myself.

25
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,320
But I never expected that

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,579
after seven years,

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,540
the shadow hasn't diminished at all,

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,480
it's actually grown larger.

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,400
So

30
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,079
I can only

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,180
run around,

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
to beautiful places.

33
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,450
Taking pictures of beautiful things.

34
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,960
And then?

35
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,120
Then it gets a bit cheesy.

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,250
That's okay.

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,090
To be honest,

38
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,200
when I first saw you,

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,040
I was stunned.

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,700
You are that beautiful place,

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,140
that beautiful thing.

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,160
Last night,

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,250
my mom was lecturing me.

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,460
She told me that

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
no matter how short life is,

46
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,800
you should live it completely.

47
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Positive energy.

48
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,240
So

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,079
dating,

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,530
marriage, having kids,

51
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,680
none of it should be delayed.

52
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,410
What did you say?

53
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,160
I said

54
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,410
I can't be the only one interested.

55
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,960
Forced melons aren't sweet,

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
a whipped horse won't pull the cart,

57
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,760
a wide-awake donkey won't turn the millstone,

58
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,160
right?

59
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,010
Are you doing a comedy routine?

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,770
I've heard too many of them,

61
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,610
it's become a habit.

62
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,610
Talking too much has side effects.

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,680
Your turn.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,519
How long until sunset?

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,880
About an hour.

66
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,400
If you had

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,680
only one hour left to live,

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,680
what would you want to do?

69
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,680
Can we skip the hypotheticals?

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,409
Just answer.

71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
I've never really

72
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,380
thought about that question.

73
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,040
Look,

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,120
what if my answer isn't what you're expecting?

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
Wouldn't that ruin this beautiful moment,

76
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,120
right?

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,530
Let's text it on WeChat,

78
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760
so there's evidence and no regrets.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,560
Then

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,680
we both have to be honest,

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,600
no being vague.

82
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,760
I know what you're going to say.

83
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,800
No way.

84
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,180
How about this,

85
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,560
I'll use your phone to text myself,

86
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,620
and you use my phone to text yourself.

87
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,840
Then

88
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
I'll be in control

89
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
of your honest answer.

90
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,720
Begin.

91
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,800
Okay.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,120
I want to spend

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,260
every minute with you.

94
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,280
From now on,

95
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,100
I don't want to waste a single second.

96
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,010
It's getting

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,360
dark here.

98
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,210
Come to my place,

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,890
there's sunshine here.

100
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,850
Do you really mean what you say?

101
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
I mean exactly what you mean.

102
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,770
Are you for real?

103
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,980
More real than pearls.

104
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,720
Yesterday in the subway,

105
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
I was right next to you,

106
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,280
you know?

107
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,720
I know.

108
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,159
I wanted to put my arm around you,

109
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,020
but I held back.

110
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,240
Now you can.

111
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,880
What are you thinking about?

112
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,260
What about you?

113
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,770
I'm thinking

114
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,440
that there must be others

115
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,760
in this world

116
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,920
who like you

117
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,440
as much as I do,

118
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,000
but I'm just lucky

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,260
that I found you first.

120
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,360
Let's go down.

121
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,050
It's getting

122
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,480
dark soon.

123
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,480
Stay a little longer.

124
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,840
Then

125
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,820
let's take a photo.

126
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,720
Unlock it.

127
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,480
What's wrong?

128
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,960
The car broke down.

129
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,760
Can you fix it?

130
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,410
What's the problem?

131
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,760
I'll call for roadside assistance,

132
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,160
come out and take a break.

133
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,850
Which chair are you going to sit on?

134
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,120
Dad, where are you?

135
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,000
I want to comfort you.

136
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720
I don't need comforting.

137
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,360
You've made me angry so many times since you were little.

138
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,080
No,

139
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
I'm going anyway.

140
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Where's Xiaoyao?

141
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
We're doing fine.

142
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,600
Mr. Song and Aunt Gang are both here.

143
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,730
That sounds lively.

144
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,000
You can come,

145
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,400
but don't cause trouble.

146
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,280
I know,

147
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,010
they're all elders.

148
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
Wanhui Teahouse.

149
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,300
What are you carrying?

150
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,940
Liniment for bruises.

151
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,200
He hasn't arrived yet?

152
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,400
He's sitting inside.

153
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,700
Don't keep calling her Steel Auntie,

154
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,920
call me Brother Gang.

155
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,720
Brother Gang,

156
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,370
alright,

157
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,480
I need to figure out our age difference.

158
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,490
Already prepared for this.

159
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
Anticipated in advance,

160
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,240
made preparations early,

161
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,770
as usual.

162
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,740
Here's a trash bag.

163
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,960
Being with you

164
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
is so reassuring.

165
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,570
Isn't that nice?

166
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,920
Very nice.

167
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,490
Still thinking about that person?

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,330
I've been thinking about it the whole way.

169
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,180
Where did he

170
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,050
actually go?

171
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,880
What is he

172
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,440
doing now?

173
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,980
Also in the suburbs

174
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,490
with someone who likes him.

175
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,480
I like you.

176
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,880
You've always known.

177
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,480
Put it in.

178
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,920
Wait.

179
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,330
Why did you run away?

180
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,400
Slow down.

181
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:46,960
Okay.

182
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,520
So this is what it feels like.

183
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,800
What feeling?

184
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,320
I

185
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,420
understand my mother now.

186
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,420
Nothing else matters,

187
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,260
only love does.

188
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,680
I used to

189
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,820
just want to dance,

190
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,440
not knowing why I danced,

191
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,680
just dancing on and on.

192
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,760
Now

193
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
I just want to sit here,

194
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,640
forever,

195
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,040
doing nothing,

196
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,780
thinking nothing.

197
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,760
That's not worth it,

198
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,120
you still need to dance.

199
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,410
Just let me sit a little longer.

200
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,640
We have a big flashlight,

201
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,160
even when it gets dark,

202
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
we'll have light.

203
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,780
That's enough.

204
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,839
On the 6th,

205
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,400
when I met him,

206
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,619
he was actually a completely different person.

207
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,599
But that day was stormy

208
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,170
with electromagnetic disturbances.

209
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,569
Stop making excuses for me.

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Tell me honestly,

211
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,570
did you never like me at all?

212
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,090
Let's treat today as our first meeting, okay?

213
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,320
Start over,

214
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,120
and forget

215
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,250
everything that happened before.

216
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,900
Can you really do that?

217
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,280
I think I can.

218
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,320
The light in Mom's room upstairs is off.

219
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,560
Not yet.

220
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,460
Maybe if I find him,

221
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,980
meet him and talk things through,

222
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,210
I might actually be able to move on.

223
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,370
Maybe so.

224
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,880
Our trip to the airport today

225
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,410
did accomplish something.

226
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,120
In the surveillance footage they showed us,

227
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,320
he was carrying a bag,

228
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,360
and behind him was Gate B46.

229
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
At that time,

230
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
how many flights were at Gate 46?

231
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,290
One flight at 3:30 to Shenyang.

232
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,160
4:10.

233
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,380
Flight to Beijing,

234
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,360
I see at gate B46

235
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,200
people seem to be boarding already.

236
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,760
He looked up at the monitor.

237
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,040
Security cameras are usually installed high up in malls.

238
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,960
He's either going to the restroom or buying something,

239
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,820
not queuing up.

240
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,200
So

241
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,680
he's more likely taking the flight to Beijing.

242
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,420
You never actually

243
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,780
called for roadside assistance today, did you?

244
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,560
The car isn't broken.

245
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,960
We can leave anytime.

246
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Stay a bit longer,

247
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,940
it's rare to have you here.

248
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm afraid I'll get sleepy if I stay,

249
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,940
I barely slept last night.

250
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,480
Why?

251
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,980
Checking surveillance footage.

252
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,480
Then go get some sleep,

253
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,880
sleep as long as you need.

254
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,280
I've never met anyone

255
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,730
who treats me the way you do.

256
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,560
If I let go of who you are now

257
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,460
because of what happened in the past,

258
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,640
then I'd certainly be a fool.

259
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,900
That's the spirit.

260
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,600
I'll apply it thicker for you,

261
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,240
so that

262
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,370
the medicine works better.

263
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,980
Don't move.

264
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,160
Listen, keep it tight like this,

265
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,160
maintain this position,

266
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,840
if you move, the medicine will lose its effect,

267
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
you need to hold it for five minutes.

268
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Did my daughter

269
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,980
Xiaomi come to see you?

270
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,370
Don't take whatever she said to heart.

271
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,560
Whatever you say,

272
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,220
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

273
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,730
Since there are no outsiders here,

274
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,320
and Brother Gang isn't an outsider either.

275
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,320
How old are you this year, Wang Zi?

276
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,040
I'm

277
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,920
47 by Western count,

278
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,050
48 by Chinese count.

279
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,440
Didn't you say you were 50 the other day?

280
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,240
Older than me.

281
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,160
You wanted me to call him brother,

282
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,760
so I need to

283
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,560
get his age straight.

284
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,520
Wang Zi, how old are you?

285
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,410
53 by Western count,

286
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,690
54 by Chinese count.

287
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,040
54 years old, I see.

288
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,730
Alright.

289
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,300
I'll call you brother,

290
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,160
let's put our differences behind us.

291
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,040
To be honest,

292
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,850
I don't like you.

293
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,160
Will you let me speak?

294
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,960
We're all adults here,

295
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,160
why are we bickering?

296
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,210
You sure took your time growing up.

297
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,680
Hello everyone.

298
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,040
Which room is Mr. Qiao in?

299
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,760
Mr. Qiao.

300
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,370
Brother Hui.

301
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,090
The large suite.

302
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,360
No need.

303
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,360
Guanwang.

304
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,880
The diamond ring.

305
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,140
I've never bought one for a woman before,

306
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,600
just this once in my life.

307
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,490
I was planning to formally propose to you,

308
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,780
but my daughter interrupted.

309
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,480
It's okay,

310
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,560
just one thing to say.

311
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,520
I really like you.

312
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,560
I hope you'll

313
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,370
seriously consider it.

314
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,380
See, this is getting awkward.

315
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:14,800
No.

316
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,450
What do you mean?

317
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,880
Otherwise it's torture.

318
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,080
Are you saying

319
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
I must give you an answer today?

320
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,560
Dad.

321
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,280
Director.

322
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,800
Auntie.

323
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,800
Who's an auntie?

324
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,690
Who are you calling auntie?

325
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,080
I'm sorry.

326
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,480
The child is here too,

327
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,140
let's not discuss this today.

328
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
Let's discuss it.

329
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,320
Right now.

330
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,240
Thinks she's so special.

331
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
I've been there twice already.

332
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,520
I agreed to take photos

333
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,240
and work part-time at your place.

334
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,570
When has Qiao Guanghui ever begged anyone

335
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,160
looking so pathetic?

336
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,380
It breaks my heart just watching.

337
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,530
If I were you, I'd reject him immediately.

338
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,360
Reject him.

339
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,370
Better a quick end than prolonged suffering.

340
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,440
Can't you see she has

341
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,930
absolutely no respect for you?

342
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,920
My daughter's here.

343
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,720
Let's drop it.

344
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,200
My heart is in the right place.

345
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,450
Alright.

346
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,250
You're truly loyal, Brother Gang.

347
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,480
So today I'll

348
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,300
give you my answer.

349
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,260
Qiao Guanghui,

350
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,660
I don't think we're

351
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,080
right for each other.

352
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,640
It's not that

353
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,170
I think you're a bad person,

354
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,960
or that I've found someone else.

355
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,920
I just think

356
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,080
we should be friends,

357
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,640
okay?

358
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,850
Not okay.

359
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,770
Mind your own business.

360
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,890
Is that alright?

361
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,920
Just friends.

362
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,280
Fine.

363
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,320
Friends it is.

364
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,680
You have no backbone.

365
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,700
I'll accept this gift, Brother Gang.

366
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,200
Once your leg heals,

367
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,400
come work at my place.

368
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,880
Impossible.

369
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,530
You don't get to decide.

370
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,520
Brother Gang.

371
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,600
See?

372
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,960
Alright, alright,

373
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,760
stop talking.

374
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,800
If I had known about this,

375
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,080
I wouldn't have come today.

376
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,640
Seriously, I'm leaving.

377
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,040
Come on,

378
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,640
don't just stand there like that.

379
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,680
I'm just kidding.

380
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Why do I get so fired up

381
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,600
every time I see you?

382
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,000
Same here.

383
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,580
Look at that punchable face of yours.

384
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,920
Have a seat.

385
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,490
Watch your fifth position.

386
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,780
Keep your footwork clean.

387
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,570
Movement in the lower body.

388
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,060
Mind your fifth position.

389
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
Upper body movement.

390
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,960
Excuse me,

391
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,370
teacher.

392
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,200
I'd like to ask

393
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,400
when Wen Xiaoyao

394
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,200
is coming out?

395
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,380
She's not here.

396
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,660
She's not here?

397
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,160
That can't be right,

398
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,490
isn't she the understudy for White Snake?

399
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,410
Do you know anything at all?

400
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,520
No, I don't.

401
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,320
Stop taking photos.

402
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm not photographing anyone else.

403
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,780
You're Song Guanwang's son, aren't you?

404
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,210
Song Guanwang is my mother.

405
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,720
All so

406
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,320
improper.

407
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
Mind your rhythm,

408
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,570
hold it down.

409
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,080
Improper,

410
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,370
I heard that.

411
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,920
You're right about that.

412
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,160
What you're doing is proper dance,

413
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,040
while that thing on our second floor

414
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,370
is just flailing about.

415
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,160
But you professionals are at risk,

416
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,490
easy to break your legs.

417
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,250
Stop joking around.

418
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,120
This is what you

419
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,650
brought.

420
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,120
Here's your toothpaste,

421
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,380
I'll put it on your tab,

422
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,880
60.

423
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,960
This is for both of you,

424
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,440
the toothbrushes are in there somewhere,

425
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,570
I'm too busy to help.

426
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,160
It's here.

427
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,930
Xiao Lu, you took yours without saying anything.

428
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,610
Okay, about the underwear,

429
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,740
they're out of pink for yours.

430
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,820
Have you seen Xiao Yao?

431
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,560
There's money still owed. I worked so hard,

432
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,120
put it on my account.

433
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,800
Have you seen Xiao Yao?

434
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,520
Stop messing everything up,

435
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,480
this one is yours.

436
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,560
This is too chaotic.

437
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,800
I'll keep track of it.

438
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,000
Take your stuff with you.

439
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,400
Do you really have to do this in front of everyone?

440
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,060
Won't you give me any respect?

441
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,160
What exactly is our relationship?

442
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,600
Even a queen doesn't treat her slaves like this.

443
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,060
Do you look like an artist?

444
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,040
The lead in a dance drama.

445
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,520
Xu Xian.

446
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,860
Just look at yourself.

447
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,400
Rehearsal is over,

448
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
you play Xu Xian on stage,

449
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,140
but how do you live?

450
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,880
I dance as Bai Suzhen,

451
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,340
and my Xu Xian is like this,

452
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
how can I love him?

453
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,040
Can we separate

454
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,440
our life from our acting?

455
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,040
I can't.

456
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,960
You can't separate them,

457
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,920
but I can.

458
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,290
If that's what you want,

459
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,970
then we're breaking up.

460
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,480
It's over.

461
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,920
Don't take your frustration with the director

462
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,040
out on me.

463
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,300
You couldn't get the part anyway,

464
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,840
you don't even look like Xu Xian.

465
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,360
Master.

466
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,820
Have you seen Xiaoyao?

467
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,880
Thank you.

468
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,010
How is it?

469
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,930
This... this...

470
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,540
this...

471
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,080
Let's do it again

472
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,680
and adjust

473
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,600
the speed.

474
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,440
Right.

475
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,200
Faster or slower?

476
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,000
No, no,

477
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,920
you stay normal,

478
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,600
I'll adjust the shutter speed.

479
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:40,930
Okay.

480
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,900
Lights out now.

481
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,780
That's enough.

482
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,500
Thank you, driver.

483
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,850
Stop taking photos.

484
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,290
You go ahead.

485
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,600
I'll wait for Xiaomi.

486
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,050
Then I'll wait for you at the entrance.

487
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,280
No.

488
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,770
I'll wait for you at the bookstore.

489
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,570
Take it easy.

490
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:02,890
Xiaoyao.

491
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,080
What are you

492
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,210
doing sitting here?

493
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,360
Dating.

494
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,370
Zhou Tong just left.

495
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,060
Lighting technician,

496
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,280
anyone there?

497
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,500
Turn on the lights.

498
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,560
Xiaoqing.

499
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,639
Thanks.

500
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,520
Come here.

501
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,639
Come here.

502
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,449
Don't be angry anymore.

503
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,679
What's there to be angry about?

504
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,280
What did you do to let me down?

505
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,639
The house.

506
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,000
Xiaoqing.

507
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,600
You worked hard at rehearsal today.

508
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,239
Let me massage Xiaoqing's feet

509
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:50,960
and legs.

510
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,560
Manicure.

511
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,960
Yeah,

512
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,000
we had plans

513
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,760
and I ended up all alone.

514
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,810
But I've already forgiven you.

515
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,200
I need to tell you

516
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,860
something really important.

517
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,020
How important?

518
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,330
I went to the Great Wall with Zhou Tong yesterday.

519
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,680
We kissed.

520
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,730
You're done for.

521
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,100
Completely finished.

522
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,480
I'm finished.

523
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,200
But now I finally understand

524
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,080
how Mom felt back then.

525
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,120
Your mom couldn't play the White Snake

526
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,680
after she got together with Uncle Hanghai.

527
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,000
You've completely forgotten.

528
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,400
If they hadn't fallen in love,

529
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,860
I wouldn't exist, would I?

530
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,890
That's true.

531
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,640
Zhou Tong said

532
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,200
every minute, every second,

533
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,120
added together,

534
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,580
he'll be with me every day.

535
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,880
That's so cheesy. Let's go.

536
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,650
Give me a diagnosis.

537
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,410
What diagnosis?

538
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,770
Condition serious,

539
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,280
kissing is toxic.

540
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,080
You're doing this to experience life,

541
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,940
to find the feeling between White Snake and Xu Xian.

542
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,560
Is he Xu Xian?

543
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,580
Well, I'm not White Snake either.

544
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,480
But you should be.

545
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,440
You've always wanted to dance as White Snake,

546
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,360
watching Yue Opera's 'White Snake Legend' since childhood.

547
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,720
It doesn't matter anymore,

548
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,320
Sister Yun dances it so well.

549
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,920
Why so sudden?

550
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,610
It doesn't matter anymore?

551
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,620
You've changed, Wen Xiaoyao.

552
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,580
The director told me the other day

553
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,000
that loving someone and being loved

554
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,680
lets you experience the sweetness and bitterness of love,

555
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
then inspire yourself

556
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,770
and move others.

557
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,080
And then?

558
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,140
I think he's wrong.

559
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,560
There's no bitterness,

560
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,090
no possibility of parting,

561
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,490
only sweetness.

562
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,210
How long has it been since he dated anyone?

563
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,490
You're serious about this.

564
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
Are you really...

565
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,360
Is he serious too?

566
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,500
More genuine than pearls.

567
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,690
I'm jealous.

568
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
My heart is burning with envy,

569
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,400
my emotions are in turmoil.

570
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
I'm serious.

571
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,680
I'll have him come pay respects to you,

572
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,680
go through all the rituals,

573
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,880
bow and kowtow to you.

574
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,360
He would do that?

575
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,720
If he can't get your approval, he's worthless.

576
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,660
Completely finished.

577
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,480
If he can't get past me,

578
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,280
guess what?

579
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,800
He won't pass?

580
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,600
If he doesn't, you'll have to run away with him

581
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,480
and never come back home.

582
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,720
Impossible.

583
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,960
No way I'm going to his place.

584
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,740
I was wondering

585
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,300
why you wouldn't even take the house.

586
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,100
This girl is driving me crazy.

587
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,640
So he's at the bookstore now,

588
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,570
you should come with me right away.

589
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,760
Let's not.

590
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,260
You should give him a heads-up first.

591
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,690
Invite him to come here,

592
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,760
it's not appropriate for me to go.

593
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,020
Then I'll go right now.

594
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,850
Go ahead.

595
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,970
I'm leaving.

596
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,820
Lighting technician,

597
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,450
turn off the lights.

598
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,490
They're off.

599
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,880
Ms. Jiang.

600
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,200
I noticed

601
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,000
there are many young women

602
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,060
at your workplace.

603
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,300
If anyone needs

604
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,560
qipao dresses made, they can come to me.

605
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,160
You opened a qipao business?

606
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,810
Just a small tailor shop

607
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,080
in Hai'er Lane.

608
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,880
By the way,

609
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,200
the boss wanted

610
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,240
to talk with Diandian.

611
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,040
Said that

612
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,020
her boyfriend made a mistake.

613
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,040
Because of me.

614
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,640
You really are her boyfriend?

615
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,500
Is it official?

616
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,980
I am committed.

617
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,640
That's a weight off my mind.

618
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,360
Why did you come to my workplace?

619
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,560
To see you.

620
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,820
They're very gossipy.

621
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,120
I finished

622
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,040
your qipao this morning.

623
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,480
Can I try it on?

624
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,610
Go ahead.

625
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,010
You won't run away after I come out?

626
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,540
I won't.

627
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,000
Ms. Jiang,

628
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,200
excuse me for bothering you.

629
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,200
Why does everyone

630
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,210
in the office

631
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,240
stare at me

632
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,440
whenever I come here?

633
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
Ever since

634
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,000
Diandian joined our office

635
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
on her first day last year,

636
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
everyone has been wondering

637
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,240
when she would find a boyfriend.

638
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,760
You know,

639
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,820
you're very lucky.

640
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,370
Do you know about

641
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,640
the Shi Group in Keqiao?

642
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,800
It's a big family,

643
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,960
with all the relatives

644
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,290
worth several billion.

645
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,130
And she's their only daughter.

646
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,680
What does that have to do with me?

647
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,120
Is there anything else

648
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,440
you'd like to know?

649
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,180
I only know that

650
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,620
Diandian is good to me,

651
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,240
so I'll be good to her.

652
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,960
Yes, yes,

653
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,090
don't break Diandian's heart.

654
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,960
It looks beautiful,

655
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,020
really beautiful.

656
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,920
How much is it?

657
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,880
We're practically family now, why mention money?

658
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,560
He says he's your boyfriend.

659
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:29,960
Really?

660
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,690
Are you free at noon?

661
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,900
I'll wait for you at Leshui Pavilion.

662
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,690
Okay.

663
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:40,920
Ms. Jiang,

664
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,680
I'm going now.

665
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,290
Goodbye.

666
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,920
Goodbye.

667
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,800
What did you tell Xu Tian?

668
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,700
That you're their only daughter.

669
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,080
Anything else?

670
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
That he must never break your heart.

671
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,460
Moving crew

672
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,650
Ding Jian'ai

673
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,730
Assistant producer

674
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,330
Colorist

675
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:44,760
Executive Producer
