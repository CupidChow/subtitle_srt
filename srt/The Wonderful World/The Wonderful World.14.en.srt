1
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
Driver, do you remember the way?

2
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,170
Don't worry,

3
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,440
Mr. Fang has already given instructions.

4
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:02,880
Good.

5
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,120
Mom.

6
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,240
Stop wiping,

7
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,770
I've already wiped it once.

8
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,640
It looks like cat scratches,

9
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,360
not clean.

10
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,920
That's enough.

11
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,200
The kids who come here to dance,

12
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,480
it's not just about how well they dance,

13
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,760
it's mainly about

14
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,490
how they feel watching themselves in the mirror.

15
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
You must be exhausted doing this every day.

16
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
What's going on?

17
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,890
Are you leaving?

18
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,700
Yeah, I'm leaving.

19
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,640
So early?

20
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,480
Why not stay for lunch?

21
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,280
No, I'll pass.

22
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
Waiting here

23
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,880
or at the airport,

24
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
it's all the same.

25
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,720
You just can't sit still,

26
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,490
why not send Xiaoyao a message?

27
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,120
I did.

28
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,329
What did she say?

29
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
She didn't reply.

30
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Then call her.

31
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
Tell her you're going on a business trip.

32
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,000
Even if you can't be friends, you can still be acquaintances.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,480
Really, there's no need.

34
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,040
I sent the message like you suggested,

35
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,120
and she didn't reply,

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,800
which

37
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,620
is actually a reply in itself.

38
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Besides, we had an agreement.

39
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,880
I'd accompany her

40
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
to experience life

41
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,520
and practice until the performance day,

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
which is today.

43
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,680
As a grown man,

44
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,000
if I keep pestering her,

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,360
it would be embarrassing

46
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
and annoying.

47
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,440
Besides, she must be busy with her premiere today.

48
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,339
You're quite considerate of others.

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,329
I'm leaving.

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
Let me walk you out.

51
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,240
No need,

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,880
mom will see you off.

53
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,480
You never offered to walk me out before,

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,410
so I'll just leave like this today,

55
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,520
don't bother.

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,380
Go back inside.

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,159
You can go.

58
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,080
Go back in.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,400
Did you bring your ID card?

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,130
Credit card?

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,480
It's not my first time leaving.

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,560
You never asked all these details

63
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,040
when I left before.

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,480
You're acting like we'll never see each other again,

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,610
but I'm coming back.

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,760
How long will you be gone this time?

67
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,890
About ten days or so.

68
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,970
Text me when you arrive.

69
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,050
Don't worry,

70
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,640
I'll take pictures for you.

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,960
You didn't take photos of the square dancing

72
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
yesterday.

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,820
I'll take them when I get back.

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,400
You know,

75
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
you should really try square dancing sometime,

76
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,660
it's very refreshing.

77
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,080
I'd rather die than do that.

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,170
Don't say such unlucky things,

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,900
spit it out!

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,320
Where's Xier?

81
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,180
I don't see her.

82
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,880
Tell her for me

83
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,740
that I've left.

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,330
Go ahead.

85
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,280
Just between us,

86
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,240
she's having a hard time,

87
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,370
so stop pressuring her about the rent.

88
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,330
What do you mean?

89
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,720
It's been so long,

90
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
she'll pay us when she has money.

91
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,360
She's not that kind of person.

92
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
Her life is hard enough already,

93
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,320
if you keep pushing her for rent, how can she survive?

94
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,380
Alright, alright.

95
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,159
Let's go.

96
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm off now.

97
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,570
Are you walking to the airport?

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,760
I called a car.

99
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,560
It's waiting for me at the corner.

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
Let's go back.

101
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,640
Let's go in.

102
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,250
When I see him later,

103
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,370
I don't know what to say.

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,140
Let him do the talking.

105
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,690
He's nervous about seeing you too.

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,720
Really?

107
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,680
Clear your mind,

108
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
empty your thoughts,

109
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,520
let your brain reach

110
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,970
a state of tranquility.

111
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Only then will your spirit

112
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,960
and body

113
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
completely

114
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,760
rest.

115
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,440
Xiaomi.

116
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,080
Xiaomi,

117
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
could you get my phone for me?

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,800
Yaoyao and Yin Ye

119
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,640
have the most selfish thoughts.

120
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,680
Qiaomi

121
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,680
is the most innocent.

122
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,010
So I'm just stupid, huh?

123
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,520
Having selfish thoughts

124
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,780
doesn't mean it's bad.

125
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Being innocent isn't wrong either.

126
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,840
Human emotions and desires

127
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,520
are the roots of artistic expression. Don't be trapped by them.

128
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,250
You sure can spin words around.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
Do you want to get off?

130
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,340
No need.

131
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,840
I'll ask Zhou Tong to come over this afternoon.

132
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,680
You're

133
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,160
so busy this afternoon.

134
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,340
I get anxious when I don't see him.

135
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,880
I was

136
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,360
going to make up with him.

137
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,930
But his attitude was terrible.

138
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,840
Xiaomi

139
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,660
is here.

140
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,880
Go do whatever you need to do,

141
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,940
stop clinging to Yaoyao all the time.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
Getting all high and mighty now,

143
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,400
forgetting who helped you when I'm also a lead actor.

144
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,760
You're not doing interviews anyway,

145
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,620
go take a break.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,460
Yaoyao.

147
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,400
Yaoyao,

148
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,200
hurry up.

149
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,039
Coming!

150
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,680
Thank you everyone for your hard work.

151
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,360
So.

152
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,240
Let's...

153
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,200
In 15 minutes,

154
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,000
she hasn't eaten yet,

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
in 15 minutes,

156
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,640
one at a time,

157
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
finish before 4 o'clock.

158
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,420
Yaoyao.

159
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,120
The food is on the table,

160
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,560
go help yourself.

161
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,280
Calm down.

162
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,240
Calm down.

163
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,760
Look, look!

164
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,720
She's coming out!

165
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,800
Miss Wen is coming out!

166
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,040
Miss Wen, may we have an interview?

167
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,280
Can we have an interview?

168
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,680
What's wrong, Mom?

169
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
Are you at the airport yet?

170
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,920
Almost there.

171
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,570
Why is it taking so long?

172
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,040
There's a bit of traffic.

173
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
I never used to care

174
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,580
where you went before.

175
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,520
You went to Malaysia?

176
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,880
Yes,

177
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,320
where else would I go?

178
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,080
You didn't go looking for Xiao Yao, did you?

179
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,280
If I wanted to see her,

180
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,000
would I need to buy a plane ticket? Think about it.

181
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm feeling so anxious about this.

182
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,680
Something's definitely

183
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,560
fishy here.

184
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,320
Actually,

185
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,200
I just went

186
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,400
to see Xiao Yao.

187
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,040
Are you with her now?

188
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I texted her but she didn't respond.

189
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,000
If that's the case,

190
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,210
just come back home.

191
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,700
If you can't let go,

192
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
how can you leave?

193
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,800
I really can't let go, Mom.

194
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,880
What should I do?

195
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,840
I feel miserable.

196
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,920
She's a nice girl.

197
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,880
You two have history together.

198
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,480
Come back

199
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,620
and start over.

200
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,760
Go back?

201
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,720
I'm already at the airport.

202
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Who are you kidding?

203
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,120
In this state,

204
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,050
you can't leave.

205
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,010
So I'm really coming back then.

206
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,800
Come home.

207
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,210
I'll feel better when you're back.

208
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,120
Gotta go,

209
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,380
getting out of the car.

210
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,880
I care about you

211
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,300
so I'll waive your rent

212
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,160
for two months

213
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,460
but not for half a year.

214
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,680
Really?

215
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,600
Three months.

216
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,340
You're so kind.

217
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,440
Brother Tong.

218
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,250
Want me to keep you company?

219
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,900
You're just trying to fool me.

220
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,760
So this is where we get off?

221
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,730
You're lying through your teeth to me!

222
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,740
Alright, alright,

223
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,600
come on in,

224
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,220
let's go upstairs.

225
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,940
Where's your luggage?

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,400
Well...

227
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,330
What do you mean?

228
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,560
Don't tell me you're looking for Xiaoyao?

229
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Hello, ma'am.

230
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,440
And you are?

231
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,920
Hello, ma'am.

232
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
My name is Xu Tian,

233
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,540
I'm from Hangzhou.

234
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,720
We're here

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,060
to visit Zhou Tong.

236
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,060
This is my girlfriend,

237
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,880
Shi Diandian.

238
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,000
Hello, ma'am.

239
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,880
Okay.

240
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,320
We'll be going now.

241
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,920
That woman just now was Zhou Tong's mother.

242
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,400
Zhou Tong isn't here,

243
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,530
he went to Malaysia.

244
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,320
What were you

245
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,850
talking about just now?

246
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,040
About you.

247
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,730
Let's go.

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,660
I'm coming.

249
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,400
He's not here.

250
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,410
Let's go.

251
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,280
Get in the car.

252
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,690
Wait, open the door.

253
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,760
Ma'am.

254
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
You look so alike.

255
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,680
I'm Song Guanwang.

256
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,650
I'm Zhou Tong's mother.

257
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
You've come from so far away.

258
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,720
Come,

259
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,980
come in and have a seat.

260
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,850
I'll wait for you in the car.

261
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,770
I'm already at the airport,

262
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,360
heading to Malaysia.

263
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,170
Thank you for giving me these six days,

264
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,810
I really took it seriously.

265
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,560
Even a complete fool

266
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,720
would truly like you.

267
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,320
Good luck with your White Snake performance.

268
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,980
Wen Xiaoyao, can we start now?

269
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,200
Just stay seated,

270
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,260
look at the camera.

271
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,480
I'm sorry,

272
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,450
my stuff is here.

273
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,760
I didn't mean anything by it.

274
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,290
Xiaoyao,

275
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,410
these things belong to Sister Yun.

276
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,600
You big fool.

277
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,400
The video Xiaomi showed you

278
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,930
was just me comforting her.

279
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,970
Without you,

280
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,740
there would be no White Snake.

281
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,260
Did you forget what we said on the Great Wall?

282
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,319
I love you.

283
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,920
Are you coming or not?

284
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,720
Zhou Tong.

285
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,960
Can we begin now?

286
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,160
I need to make a video call first,

287
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,359
I'll just leave it aside without talking.

288
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,089
That's fine.

289
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,080
How do you

290
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,280
interpret this version of White Snake in the dance drama?

291
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,050
I've never been in love before.

292
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,360
Because of dancing White Snake,

293
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
I met someone

294
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,930
named Zhou Tong.

295
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,920
From.

296
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,210
From the first time we met until today,

297
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,130
I've loved him for six days.

298
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,680
I hope to be with him every day from now on.

299
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,400
I hope he comes to see this performance.

300
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,650
Without him,

301
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,570
there wouldn't be the White Snake in my heart now.

302
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,560
White Snake gave up immortality

303
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,440
to become human for Xu Xian.

304
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,780
If there were no Zhou Tong,

305
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,380
I'd rather not have today.

306
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,920
Well.

307
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,540
Will he come to see your performance?

308
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,040
He's here.

309
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,720
Everyone really has

310
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
their own

311
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,000
destiny.

312
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,940
Look at you,

313
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,520
your mother passed away

314
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,920
when you were just seven.

315
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
You took care of her for three years.

316
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,760
I didn't really do much,

317
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,640
just went to the pharmacy

318
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,100
to get medicine every day,

319
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
brewed it at home,

320
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
and gave it to her.

321
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
I wish I could have

322
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,560
taken care of her

323
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,560
until now.

324
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,200
What do you do for work now?

325
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,720
I make custom qipaos.

326
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,240
We've always had a shop,

327
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,980
my mother was a tailor.

328
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Look how

329
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,320
refined and gentle he is.

330
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,120
Not like my son at all.

331
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,920
He walks like he's in a rush,

332
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,450
always swaggering around.

333
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,200
You'll see what I mean when you meet him.

334
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,800
Mrs. Song,

335
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,240
actually,

336
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,010
I just came to visit.

337
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,450
I don't necessarily

338
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,610
need to meet him.

339
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,640
I've just

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,130
been thinking about it for many years.

341
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,040
Actually,

342
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
now that I'm here,

343
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
I can let it all go.

344
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,410
What have you been thinking about?

345
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Those things

346
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,940
are difficult to explain.

347
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,200
I'm being quite presumptuous,

348
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,160
bothering you when we've never met.

349
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,360
Thank you for the tea.

350
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,680
It's fine,

351
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,160
have some more tea.

352
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,360
Actually, your girlfriend

353
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,320
already told me some things about you.

354
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
If she hadn't, I wouldn't have let you come up.

355
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,970
I almost mistook you for my son.

356
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,320
I thought Zhou Tong was acting

357
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,920
a bit strange when he left today.

358
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,380
So that's what's going on.

359
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,760
Zhou Tong! Zhou Tong!

360
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,720
Here it is, here it is.

361
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm watching, I'm watching.

362
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,440
The next group of reporters will be interviewing soon.

363
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Where are you now?

364
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,650
I'm on the airport expressway.

365
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,610
What were you thinking going to Malaysia?

366
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,440
I'm just

367
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,560
out of my mind.

368
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,300
Did you miss me?

369
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,000
Did you miss me?

370
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,400
What's with the 'hmm'?

371
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200
Say it.

372
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,600
You just wait.

373
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,760
Look,

374
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,880
this is

375
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,330
Sister Yun's makeup room that she lent me,

376
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
and I'm all alone.

377
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,560
Hurry up,

378
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,480
come in.

379
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,840
Wen Xiaoyao,

380
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,800
can we start now?

381
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,160
Listen, superstar,

382
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,680
why don't you hang up since

383
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,540
you're so busy.

384
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,000
When I get to the door,

385
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,130
I'll text you, okay?

386
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,460
Not hanging up.

387
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,330
Hurry up.

388
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,600
I want to,

389
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,800
but I just hope

390
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,400
there's no traffic jam once I get into the city.

391
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,900
Have an orange.

392
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Thank you, ma'am.

393
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,730
When my mother passed away,

394
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,720
she told me

395
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
there's no such thing

396
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,050
as past lives in this world.

397
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,560
But I was young then,

398
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,730
and I needed a reason

399
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
to keep on living.

400
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,600
So

401
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,200
I always imagined

402
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,450
another version of myself.

403
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,120
When I grew up,

404
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,200
I realized

405
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
it was impossible.

406
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,360
But after so long,

407
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,660
those thoughts became stubborn.

408
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,600
Yes.

409
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,130
Being alone all the time

410
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,680
makes you feel stifled,

411
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,340
doesn't it?

412
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,050
From the 6th of this month until today,

413
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,360
it's been like a roller coaster.

414
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,120
All my previous thoughts have been shattered.

415
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,000
Today

416
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,530
I'm sitting here again,

417
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,620
chatting with you.

418
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,890
Downstairs,

419
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,600
my girlfriend Diandian

420
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,920
is waiting for me in the car.

421
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,720
When I think about it carefully,

422
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,280
all the days before,

423
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,100
all the things I've experienced,

424
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,720
were all meant

425
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
for me to meet her.

426
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
She always thinks

427
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,500
how lucky she is to have met me.

428
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,080
But I know deep down

429
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,680
it's because I met her

430
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
that in this life,

431
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,960
I've finally

432
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,580
started living again.

433
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,640
What's your girlfriend's name,

434
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,360
Diandian?

435
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,640
Shi Diandian.

436
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,320
You need to treat her well, okay?

437
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,320
Mrs. Song.

438
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,770
It's really nice

439
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
talking with you.

440
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,200
It must be fate.

441
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,320
Such a strange coincidence.

442
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,250
I'm not just saying you two look alike.

443
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,840
Well, Mrs. Song, I should get going.

444
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Leaving already?

445
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,180
I've been rude enough.

446
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,560
Nonsense.

447
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,900
Let me walk you out.

448
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,600
Mrs. Song.

449
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,440
May I

450
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,770
go upstairs and take a look?

451
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,140
Better not go up there,

452
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,500
no one's there anyway.

453
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,600
There are three rooms upstairs,

454
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,440
a living room,

455
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
and two bedrooms.

456
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,760
His room

457
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,920
is both a study

458
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,800
and a bedroom,

459
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,000
it's a complete mess.

460
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,040
Actually,

461
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,040
on the 6th,

462
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,530
when he was in Hangzhou,

463
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,600
I saw him.

464
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,760
It was raining that day,

465
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,480
and he happened

466
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,740
to be changing his wet clothes in my shop.

467
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,640
Right,

468
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,840
that explains it.

469
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,360
When he came back from Hangzhou, his clothes

470
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,200
were all wet.

471
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,640
He was in Hangzhou on the 6th.

472
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:32,980
Yes.

473
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,620
I also saw him later in the security footage.

474
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,700
So you checked the security footage.

475
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,520
Otherwise how would I

476
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,120
have run into my girlfriend.

477
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,880
At your shop,

478
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,200
why didn't Zhou Tong tell me he was back?

479
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,800
It was dark that day,

480
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,560
and coincidentally

481
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,080
there was a power outage at the shop,

482
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,880
so he probably

483
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,860
couldn't see my face clearly.

484
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,920
Yes, I see.

485
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,680
When Zhou Tong came back,

486
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,080
he even took a photo of you

487
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,240
on that bus.

488
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,320
I see now.

489
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,160
Well,

490
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,180
I should go.

491
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,880
Mrs. Song.

492
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,180
Will you come back to Beijing?

493
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,220
No, I won't.

494
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,060
After I go back,

495
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,080
I'll settle down

496
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,940
with Diandian.

497
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,940
Your girlfriend has very good features.

498
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,920
Thank you.

499
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,800
You're such a polite young man,

500
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,650
let's go.

501
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,720
I'll be performing all three Beijing premieres.

502
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,920
I can play Bai Suzhen,

503
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,360
thanks mainly to Sister Yun's guidance

504
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
and the director.

505
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Oh my god!

506
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,320
I'm on a video call

507
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,060
and you just

508
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,480
interrupted me.

509
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,440
What's got you so impatient?

510
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,640
The most

511
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,440
important thing in the world.

512
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,560
Mr. Song,

513
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,880
I'm officially announcing to you

514
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,810
that Wen Xiaoyao

515
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,800
is now confirmed

516
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,260
as your daughter-in-law.

517
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,520
Forget Malaysia, the Moon,

518
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,800
I'm not going anywhere.

519
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,400
From now on,

520
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,000
I'll stay home to take care of you,

521
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,800
along with your daughter-in-law Wen Xiaoyao,

522
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,530
we'll look after you together.

523
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,520
Where are you?

524
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,600
I gotta go now, bye.

525
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,970
This kid is always so dramatic.

526
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,580
I'm hungry.

527
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,890
Are we still watching the show?

528
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,140
It's getting late.

529
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,400
No, let's not.

530
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,880
What about Zhou Tong?

531
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,880
He doesn't want to watch either.

532
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,610
What do you want to eat then?

533
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,560
It's up to you.

534
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,490
Up to me, huh?

535
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,040
After dinner, we'll head back to Hangzhou.

536
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,860
From now on,

537
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
I'll follow all your arrangements.

538
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,320
I love making arrangements.

539
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,120
We should have taken the Fourth Ring Road earlier.

540
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,600
Heading downtown at this hour, how could it not be jammed?

541
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,560
Once you get on the Fourth Ring Road,

542
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,040
you can't get off. That's even worse.

543
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,240
Zhou Tong, Zhou Tong,

544
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,640
I finished my interview.

545
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,520
I can't take it anymore,

546
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,780
sitting here anxiously without moving.

547
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,040
Why are you so anxious?

548
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,560
Afraid time might turn back

549
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,760
and you'd disappear again.

550
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,620
Then why did you go to the airport?

551
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,760
Life,

552
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,640
destiny,

553
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,240
right?

554
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,560
I'm so happy.

555
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,660
Then promise me

556
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
that you're mine.

557
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,840
Do I still need to guarantee that?

558
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,040
I already told my mom.

559
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,200
You are mine,

560
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,040
I am my own,

561
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,810
everything is mine.

562
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,770
With that attitude,

563
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,680
how can you dance White Snake well?

564
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,000
Come and see for yourself.

565
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,260
Is the interview over?

566
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,400
Hurry up, we're waiting for you.

567
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,440
Focus,

568
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,290
there's only one hour left,

569
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,360
makeup, warm-up,

570
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,800
and stop making phone calls

571
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,680
before you prepare for your role.

572
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,080
You're driving me crazy!

573
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,120
Ask Yang Yun, a good actor,

574
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,650
how she prepares for a role.

575
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,880
She gets into character three days in advance.

576
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,120
I'm sorry, Director.

577
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,600
How are you doing, Xiaoyao?

578
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,960
Do you feel like a big star?

579
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,280
Why are you everywhere?

580
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,720
Go back to your own dressing room.

581
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,780
Xiaoyao hasn't put on makeup either.

582
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,160
Uncle Hui.

583
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Everyone's here.

584
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,480
Come on,

585
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,280
let's

586
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,860
take a photo together.

587
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,680
Come on.

588
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,680
Come on,

589
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,880
look here, look here.

590
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,080
Fine, I'm not taking photos.

591
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,980
Yaoyao,

592
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,160
I've told you everything you need to know.

593
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,360
You have five minutes

594
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,120
before closing the doors to visitors.

595
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,580
Am I considered a visitor?

596
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,480
I am a visitor.

597
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,040
I'm sorry, Director.

598
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,120
The pressure is too much,

599
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,840
let's cut him some slack.

600
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,800
Uncle Hui,

601
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,520
could you help me at the entrance later

602
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,280
to wait for Zhou Tong

603
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,480
and give him a ticket?

604
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,280
You still want to give him a ticket?

605
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,810
I haven't given him one yet.

606
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,820
I have one here,

607
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,280
let's take a photo first.

608
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,610
Okay.

609
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,680
Let's go.

610
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Everyone's here.

611
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,400
Don't be nervous,

612
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,730
I'll go to the entrance.

613
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,320
Come on!

614
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,680
Really?

615
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,720
Zhou Butong is actually coming?

616
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,250
He was heading to Malaysia,

617
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,400
but now he's on his way back from the airport.

618
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,000
So you two worked things out?

619
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,800
What did you say to each other?

620
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
I asked him to come back and he did.

621
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,810
Zhou Butong didn't say anything bad about me, did he?

622
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,370
He spoke well of you.

623
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,570
That's good,

624
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,600
so what happens next?

625
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,520
I guess I'm his now.

626
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,040
How can you be his person?

627
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,840
What about me?

628
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,440
I'm still yours.

629
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,770
He belongs to both of us,

630
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,730
he's our person.

631
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,280
So I should call him brother-in-law now, right?

632
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,010
Pretty much.

633
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,200
Then I'll treat him like Xu Xian,

634
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,120
waiting for him to make mistakes.

635
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,520
Help me keep an eye on him,

636
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,690
go on now.

637
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,540
Going to put on makeup.

638
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,220
Close the door.

639
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,240
Oh my God,

640
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,200
is heaven trying to destroy me?

641
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,520
To get to Hufang Bridge,

642
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,840
it'll be 7 o'clock at least,

643
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,970
walking would be faster than driving.

644
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,240
No way.

645
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,680
Driver,

646
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,760
I'm getting out.

647
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,040
You're really leaving?

648
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,920
I can't afford to waste time like this.

649
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,880
I'll take the subway,

650
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,640
alternating between riding and running would be much better.

651
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,000
What's so urgent?

652
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,530
Another blind date.

653
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,400
Thank you.

654
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,640
Please leave a good review.

655
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,300
Sure thing.

656
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,210
Can you handle food this spicy?

657
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,010
A little bit is fine.

658
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,370
Then let's look at something else.

659
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,380
Jiangzhe cuisine.

660
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,280
You come to Beijing just once

661
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,340
and you want to eat Jiangzhe cuisine?

662
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,060
I won't come again.

663
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,700
We won't go anywhere else after this.

664
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,000
We'll go back to Hangzhou,

665
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,960
you'll go to work,

666
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,160
and I'll make qipaos.

667
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,080
What if I don't work?

668
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
I can support you.

669
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,170
Roast duck! Roast duck!

670
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,530
There's a four-star restaurant here.

671
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,160
Aren't we inviting your mother?

672
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,210
Let's eat by ourselves.

673
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,640
Okay.

674
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,500
I've warmed up.

675
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,640
Hui is waiting for you at the ballet company entrance,

676
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,360
and asks Mrs. Song to come watch the performance too.

677
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
I'm on the subway,

678
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,160
be there soon.

679
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,360
Is it far?

680
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,800
Not far,

681
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,280
just past that traffic light ahead,

682
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,040
turn left,

683
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,800
then right, then left again.

684
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,440
I don't want to hear all that,

685
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,640
I'll just follow you.

686
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,100
Don't need your ears anymore?

687
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,440
I don't even need my eyes.

688
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,370
Aren't you afraid of losing me?

689
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,360
This way I won't lose you.

690
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,960
Then close your eyes.

691
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,480
Please don't walk too fast.

692
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,760
No peeking.

693
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,280
I'm not.

694
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,810
I'll blindfold you.

695
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,000
Emergency! Excuse me! Coming through!

696
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,060
Thank you! Thanks!

697
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Thank you so much!

698
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Coming! Almost there, Xiaoyao!

699
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
I'm out of the subway now.

700
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,320
Mom.

701
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,250
Go ahead.

702
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,000
I didn't hear my phone.

703
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,960
The children are here for class.

704
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,659
Why are you panting like that?

705
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:37,960
It's nothing,

706
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,719
um,

707
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,920
later,

708
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
we're going to see Xiaoyao's performance,

709
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,960
Mr. Qiao is waiting for us at the ballet company entrance.

710
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,620
Mr. Qiao again? I'm not going.

711
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,320
You're just telling me now?

712
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,760
Son.

713
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,440
What's wrong?

714
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,760
Let me tell you,

715
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,889
today, shortly after you left,

716
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,840
someone from Hangzhou

717
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,560
named Xu Tian came by,

718
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,610
who looks exactly like you,

719
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,520
and I mistook him for you.

720
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,600
A southerner

721
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,290
who talks all fancy.

722
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,320
When it was raining in Hangzhou,

723
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
you changed clothes at his shop.

724
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,040
Remember?

725
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,560
He actually

726
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,820
came to Beijing specifically to see you.

727
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,680
After chatting with me for a while,

728
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,240
he said

729
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,680
he's going back home to live a quiet life

730
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,140
and won't come back again.

731
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,330
You're not saying anything again.

732
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,890
Look, I don't have time to go there.

733
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,160
Diandian.

734
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,020
What's wrong with you?

735
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,100
What happened?

736
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,840
Just had a car accident

737
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,770
and hit someone.

738
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,560
Did you see it?

739
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,920
Is there

740
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
roast duck here?

741
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,440
No.

742
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,360
Don't be afraid,

743
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,960
it's okay.

744
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,480
Was that person

745
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,080
badly hurt in the collision?

746
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,850
I don't know.

747
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,850
Wait for me here.

748
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,330
Where are you going?

749
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,080
Bathroom.

750
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,900
Then I'll order first.

751
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,460
Wait for me right here.

752
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,370
What are you doing here?

753
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,450
Are you his girlfriend?

754
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:18,960
Phone.

755
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,180
Hello, son.

756
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,000
Have you arrived at the theater?

757
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,840
Ever since you left today,

758
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,370
I've been feeling anxious.

759
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,650
What's so special about today?

760
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,680
Have you seen Xiaoyao?

761
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,860
Who is this?

762
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,740
Why are you crying?

Ma'am,

764
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,120
it's Diandian.

Not at all.

I'm a little bit.

772
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,720
Zhou Tong should be downstairs already, right?

773
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,480
Definitely.

774
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Love you, Xiaomi.

775
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,280
Me too.

776
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,180
Just watching.

777
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,180
You finally answered your phone.

778
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,720
Is Zhou Tong with you?

779
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,490
The show started over half an hour ago.

780
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,570
