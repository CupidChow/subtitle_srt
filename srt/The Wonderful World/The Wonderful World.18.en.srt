1
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,280
I just told him I've turned off my phone.

2
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
How did you know I haven't turned it off yet?

3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,520
Is this Shi Diandian?

4
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,080
Who are you?

5
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,360
Wen Xiaoyao.

6
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,960
We met in Beijing,

7
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,300
at the theater.

8
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,200
I found your number

9
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,650
in the theater troupe's registry.

10
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,120
Is there something you need?

11
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,680
Not

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,800
really anything.

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Then I'll hang up,

14
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,210
please don't contact me again.

15
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,060
Why were you

16
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,560
the one who took Zhou Tong

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
to the hospital the day he died?

18
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
Zhou Tong is dead.

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,800
Why are you with him?

20
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,610
I have nothing to say to you.

21
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,360
I won't

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,800
bother you.

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,210
I'm just asking.

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,140
I don't dance anymore,

25
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm in Hangzhou now.

26
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,250
Ma'am, please turn off your phone.

27
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,920
Where are you?

28
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,520
Hangzhou.

29
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,340
Where exactly?

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,980
Leifeng Tower.

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,340
You're from Hangzhou, right?

32
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm sorry, Yun,

33
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
I can't dance.

34
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,260
You're dancing very well.

35
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,360
Not at all.

36
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,360
I miss Xiaoyao.

37
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,480
Xiaomi, we're leaving,

38
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,800
bye-bye.

39
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,159
Xiaomi, I'm leaving.

40
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,690
Bye-bye.

41
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,120
Xiaoyao.

42
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,920
Where are you?

43
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,100
I'm at Leifeng Pagoda,

44
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,180
like I told you before.

45
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,800
Me.

46
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,480
I have these days off,

47
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,760
nothing to do.

48
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,020
Aren't you rehearsing a new show?

49
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,760
I want to visit Hangzhou,

50
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,490
would that be okay with you?

51
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,900
Why are you crying?

52
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,620
It makes me look more pitiful.

53
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
I've never been to Hangzhou before.

54
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,640
What would we talk about if you came?

55
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,480
We don't have to talk,

56
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,840
I just want to see you.

57
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
Give me your flight number,

58
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,170
I'll pick you up.

59
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,880
Really?

60
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,620
I'm really coming.

61
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,290
Xiaoyao.

62
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,000
Xiaoyao.

63
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,160
I've booked a flight for early tomorrow morning.

64
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,840
I'll come find you when I arrive.

65
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,880
Send me your location.

66
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,010
No need to pick me up.

67
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,960
Xiaoyao.

68
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,640
Xiaoyao?

69
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,720
What's wrong?

70
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,610
What's wrong, Xiaoyao?

71
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,880
I saw Zhou Tong.

72
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,840
I saw him.

73
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Exactly the same.

74
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
But he didn't recognize me.

75
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,400
Xiaomi,

76
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,340
that wasn't Zhou Tong.

77
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
It's impossible.

78
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
When will you hand out the wedding candies?

79
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,280
On the 17th,

80
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,240
Friday,

81
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,680
Diandian and I will get our marriage certificate,

82
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,280
and then

83
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,780
we'll hand out wedding candies to everyone.

84
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,960
Why do you look unhappy?

85
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,320
I am happy.

86
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,600
Be good to Diandian,

87
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
you've really found a treasure.

88
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,440
I know.

89
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,960
Have you met her parents?

90
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,100
Yes, I have.

91
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,040
Ms. Jiang,

92
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,040
here is

93
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,930
Diandian's leave request.

94
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,800
Why do you

95
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,700
still look so strange?

96
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,480
It might rain outside,

97
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,080
I just

98
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,400
walked a bit too fast.

99
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,880
Why are you following me?

100
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,460
Is there anything I can help you with?

101
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,800
Who are you?

102
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,480
Who am I?

103
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
My name is Xu Tian,

104
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,160
Xu with the two-person radical,

105
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,360
and Tian as in heaven.

106
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,680
Why are you in Hangzhou?

107
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,210
I've lived in Hangzhou since I was a child.

108
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm sorry for bothering you.

109
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,210
Where are you going?

110
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,050
I just arrived in Hangzhou,

111
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
going to the furniture mall to buy some furniture.

112
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,720
East of the Flower Harbor Fish Viewing area,

113
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,180
there's a furniture mall.

114
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,720
Who are you?

115
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,620
My name is Wen Xiaoyao.

116
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,520
I went to Guanwang Entertainment early this morning.

117
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,560
It was absolutely packed.

118
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,160
I sent you the photos

119
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
I took with Song Guanwang on WeChat.

120
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,120
I never thought

121
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,240
that after all these years,

122
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,120
Qiao Guanghui,

123
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,800
you'd turn out to be this kind of person.

124
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,200
So comforting Guanwang

125
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,730
was just to complete a task,

126
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,200
not something you wanted to do?

127
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,730
Don't beat around the bush.

128
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,600
We agreed I would meet with Song Guanwang

129
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,280
and you would talk business with Director Yang.

130
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,880
I did go.

131
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,200
You didn't brush your teeth or wash your face.

132
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,860
You didn't even get out of bed.

133
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,560
Dad.

134
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,200
I'll go see Xiaoyao first thing tomorrow morning.

135
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,640
Qiao Guanghui.

136
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,080
I called Director Yang

137
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,320
and told him all about

138
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,850
what you've been thinking.

139
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,520
What did Director Yang say?

140
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,880
If you want to help Yang Yun

141
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,720
mentor younger talents,

142
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,850
then do it properly.

143
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,740
Otherwise,

144
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,880
forget it.

145
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,600
So all our work on 'White Snake'

146
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
All that national

147
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,440
investment and effort

148
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,610
wasted for nothing.

149
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,480
A lot of my money is in there too,

150
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,880
and I'm the sponsor, but I'm not panicking.

151
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,650
I don't care.

152
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,240
I'm going to Hangzhou to find Yaoyao.

153
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,800
Give it a rest,

154
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,480
the department has already made

155
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,440
their decision, so stop struggling.

156
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,920
I'm the director.

157
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,560
Alright.

158
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,640
I'll try again.

159
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,920
Fine.

160
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,440
The director

161
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,200
will force me to do it.

162
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,820
Are you going to Hangzhou too?

163
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,760
Xiao Yao is acting weird.

164
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
What do you mean?

165
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,360
She said

166
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,160
she just saw Zhou Tong.

167
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Hangzhou and here

168
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,260
don't have a time difference.

169
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,480
She must be dreaming during her daytime nap.

170
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,940
She said his name is Xu Tian

171
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and he looks exactly like Zhou Tong.

172
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,050
Then you need to go quickly.

173
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,560
She's really lost it.

174
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Keep her company.

175
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,320
Your director is also going

176
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,580
to Hangzhou tomorrow.

177
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,780
Why not just

178
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,290
bring her back home?

179
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,680
Let her stay

180
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
and recover here.

181
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,080
She's barely spoken to me since she left.

182
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,840
Today she said more to me

183
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,720
than she has

184
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,520
in the past two months combined.

185
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
What did you pack?

186
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,050
Should I give you a card?

187
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,520
Dad.

188
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,160
I'm a bit scared.

189
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,930
Afraid of Zhou Tong?

190
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,960
Zhou Tong is gone.

191
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,360
I'm afraid

192
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,240
Xiaoyao

193
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
won't forgive me.

194
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,480
How many stupid things have you done?

195
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,740
It's been over two months,

196
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,780
things are this bad with Xiaoyao,

197
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,690
and you won't tell me anything.

198
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,360
Will you go?

199
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,640
Where?

200
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Hangzhou?

201
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,520
If you go, it'll carry more weight,

202
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,040
and Xiaoyao will definitely come back.

203
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,360
I've already made plans

204
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
to see a comedy show with Aunt Song tomorrow.

205
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,920
Xiaoyao is in such a state,

206
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,460
and you're still thinking about having fun?

207
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,520
What I'm doing is important too.

208
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,160
It was her son who died.

209
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,640
Here we go again.

210
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,740
I'm protecting what really matters.

211
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
That's a lot of stuff.

212
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,700
You said you only needed a bed delivered.

213
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,280
A bed,

214
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,880
a nightstand,

215
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,640
a chair,

216
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
a desk,

217
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,400
and a lamp.

218
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,120
300.

219
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Help me carry them

220
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,920
upstairs.

221
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,410
Which floor?

222
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,520
Second floor,

223
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,920
500.

224
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,580
We agreed on 100 on the phone just now.

225
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,920
It's pouring out here.

226
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,360
450.

227
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,820
Take it or leave it.

228
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,200
It's pouring rain,

229
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,330
what's wrong with you standing there?

230
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,890
Are you out of your mind?

231
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,050
Just a few hundred bucks, you lunatic!

232
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,160
I know

233
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,180
why you've been following me.

234
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,760
You followed me from Leifeng Tower

235
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,560
all the way

236
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,640
to the City Information

237
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,970
Technology Institute.

238
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,900
That place is where my girlfriend works.

239
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,200
Her name is Shi Diandian.

240
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,680
We're

241
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,180
getting married soon.

242
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,360
Shi Diandian?

243
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,240
That's right.

244
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,000
I'd like to ask

245
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,250
if you're

246
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,250
that Wen Xiaoyao who performed

247
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,520
as White Snake

248
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,040
in the ballet in Beijing?

249
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,800
Do I

250
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,560
look a lot

251
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,160
like him?

252
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,800
Actually, I was supposed

253
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,760
to meet him

254
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,220
in Beijing in October.

255
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,890
Unfortunately,

256
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,940
I didn't get to see him.

257
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
I didn't get to see

258
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,410
your White Snake performance either.

259
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,360
Is that car

260
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,290
waiting for you?

261
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes,

262
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,960
he'll be here soon.

263
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,440
I met Shi Diandian in Beijing

264
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,580
when she came to see me at the ballet company.

265
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,520
That day

266
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,120
near the hotel,

267
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,040
she said

268
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,360
she saw your boyfriend

269
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,360
and thought it was me.

270
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,530
She lost track of him

271
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,520
and that's why

272
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,020
she's been following you.

273
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,440
I'm sorry about that.

274
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,840
She

275
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,720
studied science

276
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,280
and can be

277
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,240
quite obsessive sometimes.

278
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,320
How come she was the one

279
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,730
who took Zhou Tong to the hospital when he was hit by a car?

280
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,520
Actually,

281
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,560
we ran into each other

282
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,620
at the intersection that day.

283
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,960
It's just that

284
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,080
I didn't see him then.

285
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,060
What about her?

286
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,280
She's

287
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,780
gone to Guangzhou.

288
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,760
By the way, why are you

289
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,960
here alone?

290
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Just wanted to stay here for a while.

291
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,040
What about Zhou Tong,

292
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,970
is he doing well?

293
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,760
Are you two

294
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,600
getting

295
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,920
married soon?

296
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,000
It wasn't meant to be.

297
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,330
You broke up.

298
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,720
How about him,

299
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,650
is he doing okay?

300
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,130
You seem very concerned about him.

301
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,490
He's doing fine.

302
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,280
I'm not

303
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,440
doing well at all.

304
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,360
Why did you two break up?

305
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,100
We would've split up sooner or later anyway.

306
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,600
That's harsh.

307
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,880
200 yuan.

308
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,720
I'll handle loading it into the car,

309
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,380
but not carrying it upstairs.

310
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,180
Could you help me with something?

311
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,570
Go ahead.

312
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,280
Help me carry

313
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,730
these things upstairs.

314
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:04,920
Sure.

315
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,880
Thanks.

316
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,800
I can't hear clearly

317
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,660
who's calling?

318
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,000
Wen Xiaoyao.

319
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,320
Before taking off from Beijing.

320
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,570
Wen Xiaoyao is in Hangzhou.

321
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,240
They must be together now.

322
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,580
How do you know?

323
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,880
He went to Leifeng Tower,

324
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,040
it's destiny.

325
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,520
Xiaoyue said

326
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,930
she heard you say Zhou Tong is dead.

327
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,800
Wen Xiaoyao said it himself.

328
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,040
Have you told Xu Tian?

329
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,720
He'll go crazy.

330
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,680
He doesn't even know Zhou Tong.

331
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,410
They're closer than you think.

332
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,580
I found out when I was checking the surveillance footage with him.

333
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,480
But if you don't tell him,

334
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,730
Wen Xiaoyao might tell him anyway.

335
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,160
Should I call Xu Tian?

336
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,820
Call him if you want to.

337
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,130
What should I say to him?

338
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,370
I don't want him to think I'm annoying.

339
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,010
It looks like

340
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,340
you're going to stay in Hangzhou.

341
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,260
I'm from Hangzhou.

342
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,840
My mother was in Hangzhou

343
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,220
when she was young.

344
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,080
I've seen your mother's performances,

345
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,940
Teacher Jia Sulan, right?

346
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,330
I watched them when I was little

347
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
with my mother.

348
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,810
My mother was

349
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,490
a big fan of your mother.

350
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,360
It's nice to meet you.

351
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,040
Well, I should

352
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,920
get going now.

353
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,920
Thank you.

354
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,090
You're welcome.

355
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,240
Xiaoyao.

356
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,080
I have a flight

357
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,000
tomorrow morning.

358
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,440
I'll give it to you.

359
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,840
I brought you a down coat.

360
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,930
He just left.

361
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,760
Who?

362
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,160
I've already let him

363
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,600
go three times.

364
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,760
At noon.

365
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,920
Once at West Lake.

366
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,520
And just now.

367
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,720
Are you

368
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,560
confused?

369
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
I'm not confused.

370
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,330
I'm very clear-headed.

371
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,960
But that's clearly only twice,

372
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,480
yet you said three times.

373
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,720
Is it that guy

374
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,600
named Xu Tian?

375
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,000
October 17th.

376
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,200
When you called to tell me

377
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
Sister Yun was hospitalized.

378
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,320
I should have gone after him.

379
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,690
I'm sorry, Xiaoyao.

380
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It's all my fault.

381
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,220
I didn't get enough time with him.

382
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,970
He was always good to me.

383
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,970
I never got the chance to be good to him.

384
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,100
This...

385
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,360
Zhou Butong is

386
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,560
already gone.

387
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,480
I know.

388
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,360
I know.

389
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,050
I'll be there tomorrow.

390
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,120
What good will that do?

391
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,000
I...

392
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,060
Hanging up now.

393
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,960
I'm sorry,

394
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,000
it's still raining outside

395
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,860
and I forgot to bring an umbrella.

396
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,440
Thank you.

397
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,960
I just

398
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
heard some noise in here.

399
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,860
What happened?

400
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,250
The cabinet fell apart.

401
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,179
How about this,

402
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,360
it seems difficult for you to assemble it alone,

403
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,219
let me help you.

404
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,650
I'm booking for tomorrow morning,

405
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,480
can I complete all the procedures in one visit?

406
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,409
I don't know.

407
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,880
I'll change my return flight to an earlier one,

408
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,370
to tomorrow.

409
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,659
Take a deep breath.

410
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,060
Now exhale.

411
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,659
If you want to call, just do it.

412
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,040
Overthinking things

413
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,160
only makes everything seem worse.

414
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,040
Just make the call and it'll all be fine.

415
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
What's meant to happen will happen.

416
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
Zhou Tong is gone,

417
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
now it's my turn.

418
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,840
Those two will meet sooner or later.

419
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,440
How do you know they'll meet?

420
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,800
I don't know,

421
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,000
heaven knows.

422
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,620
Just make the call.

423
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,940
Think carefully before you call.

424
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,980
You can't stay here like this,

425
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,640
without bedding or anything.

426
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,100
They'll arrive tomorrow.

427
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,410
I'm staying at a budget hotel tonight.

428
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,400
If I hadn't gone to Leifeng Pagoda,

429
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,730
I wouldn't have met you.

430
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,400
Does your visit to Leifeng Pagoda

431
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,400
have anything to do with the Legend of the White Snake?

432
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,480
Yesterday was the seventh day of the lunar month,

433
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,640
the anniversary of my mother's passing.

434
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,240
Going to Leifeng Pagoda was like visiting her.

435
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,730
What a coincidence.

436
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
What year did Teacher Jia pass away?

437
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,800
2002.

438
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,520
In 2002,

439
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,100
Leifeng Pagoda

440
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,640
had just been completed.

441
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,760
My mother

442
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,410
also passed away that year.

443
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,600
Could you help me

444
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,000
take a photo

445
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,660
from below?

446
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,640
Up.

447
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,860
Take it from above.

448
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,410
That's good.

449
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,860
Just a moment, please.

450
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:20,960
Diandian,

451
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,690
you're here?

452
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,880
Is it raining there?

453
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,280
It was raining earlier,

454
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,640
but it seems to have stopped now.

455
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,570
Are you home yet?

456
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,400
Not yet.

457
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,580
What are you doing?

458
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,040
It's nothing,

459
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,760
just calling you.

460
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,560
I miss you.

461
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,040
I miss you too.

462
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,690
Where's Director Fang?

463
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,680
Just got out of the car and entered the hotel.

464
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,680
I should go in too,

465
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,760
or he'll be looking for me again.

466
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,200
Can I tell Diandian

467
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
that I'm with you?

468
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,200
After all,

469
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,660
you've all met in Beijing.

470
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,280
I just called her at noon.

471
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,860
Just letting you know I'm with

472
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,920
Wen Xiaoyao.

473
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,400
Who?

474
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,560
Professor Jia Sulan's daughter,

475
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
the one who played

476
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,000
Bai Suzhen in 'Legend of the White Snake.'

477
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,840
We just ran into

478
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,500
each other at Leifeng Pagoda.

479
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,010
I don't believe you.

480
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,560
Look.

481
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,120
Hello.

482
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,200
Xu Tian.

483
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,690
Go ahead.

484
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,040
Wen Xiaoyao

485
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,760
and Zhou Tong

486
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,520
broke up.

487
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,760
She's planning to

488
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,890
settle in Hangzhou.

489
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,800
I just happened to run into her,

490
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,360
so I'm helping her

491
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,620
set up some furniture.

492
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,010
You're at her place?

493
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,920
She hasn't

494
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,760
moved in yet.

495
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,340
Say hello to her for me.

496
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,780
If she needs anything,

497
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,050
please help her out.

498
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,730
I'll go visit her later.

499
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,290
Okay.

500
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,210
Don't worry.

501
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,600
Keep her company.

502
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,410
She's all alone.

503
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,010
She is alone, right?

504
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,720
Yes.

505
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,600
Let me see.

506
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:16,960
Look,

507
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,770
I don't need my dorm stuff anymore,

508
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,280
ask her if she needs any of it,

509
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,160
so she won't have to spend money buying new things.

510
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,560
Okay.

511
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,130
I'll hang up now,

512
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,040
let me know when you get home.

513
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,090
Sure.

514
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,080
Diandian.

515
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Those two are definitely together.

516
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,440
Where?

517
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,290
At Wen Xiaoyao's place.

518
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,480
It's only been half a day,

519
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,880
and they've already connected.

520
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,960
They didn't need to connect.

521
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,840
Fate.

522
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,320
It's okay.

523
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,840
I know what to do.

524
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,770
We're about to get married,

525
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,880
I understand.

526
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,080
How did you get

527
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,490
Diandian's number?

528
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,520
She came to

529
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,080
the dance group and registered her number.

530
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,720
Did you look for her specifically?

531
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,120
The day Zhou Tong had the accident,

532
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,580
I wanted to know why she was the one who took him to the hospital.

533
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,410
So now you know everything.

534
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,360
That day

535
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,120
I also went to Zhou Tong's home,

536
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,450
but only saw his mother.

537
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,560
How am I supposed to find you?

538
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,200
Don't you have Diandian's number?

539
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,730
Find her and you'll find me.

540
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,920
Besides,

541
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,160
Diandian said she wants to visit you in a few days.

542
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,320
She loves decorating

543
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,000
your place.

544
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,250
Goodbye.

545
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,330
Ma Jianyi

546
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,480
Project Manager
