1
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,540
Diandian just called and asked me to pick you up.

2
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,240
When did she call you?

3
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,120
Just now at the airport

4
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,180
when you got off the airport express.

5
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,400
Actually,

6
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,650
I don't even know

7
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
why I came to Beijing.

8
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,480
I don't know why I came to pick you up either.

9
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,459
Don't look at me like that.

10
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,240
I'm

11
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,880
not Zhou Tong.

12
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,420
Diandian's

13
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,460
phone is turned off

14
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,240
and she

15
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,240
deleted me on WeChat too.

16
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,700
It's really baffling.

17
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,680
Should I

18
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,120
go back to Hangzhou now?

19
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,720
Taking the airport express back from here

20
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,650
won't take long.

21
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,920
But I want to be Zhou Tong for three days.

22
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,810
Where does he

23
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,500
usually like to go?

24
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,640
I haven't been with him for long.

25
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,940
What about the first time?

26
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,920
Where did you two

27
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,660
first meet?

28
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
Guangming Pavilion.

29
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
The second time was at

30
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,770
a street food stall.

31
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,240
He got into a fight with someone.

32
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,290
He actually fights?

33
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,680
The third time was at the Forbidden City.

34
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,520
The fourth time was at the Wild Great Wall in Huairou.

35
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,680
What's Guangming Pavilion?

36
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,480
What is it?

37
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,100
It's for comic dialogues.

38
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Aren't you going to the hotel first?

39
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,840
That would be boring.

40
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,240
Diandian asked me to take care of you.

41
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,040
We'd better

42
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,100
not stay together.

43
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,640
She'll call soon

44
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,980
and go crazy again.

45
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,409
So for these three days,

46
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,840
are you just going to wander

47
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,040
around Beijing like this?

48
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,570
I'll stay at a hotel for now.

49
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,440
Tomorrow

50
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,520
I'll go visit Zhou Tong's mother first.

51
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,900
I'll be going then.

52
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,720
Thank you.

53
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,880
That's called an iron threshold.

54
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,600
An iron threshold can be stepped over.

55
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
Who says I can't step over it?

56
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,480
Then come on!

57
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,010
Look, you really did it.

58
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,520
Hui,

59
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,580
I accept WeChat Pay and credit cards.

60
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
I don't have space for cash,

61
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,360
count it out quickly.

62
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,480
You're so generous.

63
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,360
Hui,

64
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,450
your change.

65
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,200
Keep it.

66
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,940
You've been waiting a few months anyway,

67
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,300
consider it interest.

68
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,760
Here's another 200.

69
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,240
Hui,

70
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,170
why don't you

71
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,320
come downstairs for a drink

72
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,380
and catch the show?

73
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,280
Thanks,

74
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,410
here's another 100.

75
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,360
Is that crosstalk show

76
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
even worth listening to?

77
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,720
It would ruin my ears.

78
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,560
Come on,

79
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,690
just take the money,

80
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,220
and mind your manners.

81
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,760
Invite some experts.

82
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,520
Brother Tong.

83
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,080
Why didn't you let me know you were coming today?

84
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,600
Alright.

85
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,930
With all these luggage,

86
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
you came straight to our teahouse as soon as you arrived in Beijing.

87
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
That's why we call you our loyal patron.

88
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,700
This way, this way.

89
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,520
Today's performance is 'Exploring Qingshui River',

90
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,560
everyone's here for Master Er,

91
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,040
it's extremely crowded,

92
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,760
sorry you'll have to sit on the side.

93
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,890
Do I come here often?

94
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
You're teasing me again.

95
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,680
This 'Exploring Qingshui River'.

96
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
You sing it just as well as Master Er,

97
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,720
please have a seat,

98
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,120
I'll go make you some tea.

99
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,880
Listen up.

100
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:37,800
What is it?

101
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,840
Prepare the best dried fruits,

102
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,970
brew the finest tea,

103
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,720
for Brother Hui.

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,380
Right away!

105
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,040
This is Brother Tong's table.

106
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,700
Get moving!

107
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,640
Sure thing, as you wish.

108
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,900
Let's get to the point.

109
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,800
Hui.

110
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,920
Can I sit here?

111
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,440
Just sit here.

112
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,520
Tong,

113
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
this is Hui.

114
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,520
If you prefer somewhere quieter,

115
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,050
I can find you another spot.

116
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm fine here.

117
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,200
All right then,

118
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
gentlemen,

119
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,300
enjoy yourselves.

120
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,560
They called you Tong,

121
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,160
and you actually responded.

122
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
What's your name?

123
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't tell me your name is Zhou Tong.

124
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
That would be freaky as hell.

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,060
Don't mess with me in broad daylight.

126
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,960
Xu Tian.

127
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,120
From Hangzhou?

128
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,760
Just got off the plane.

129
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,640
Tea for you both.

130
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,280
How did you know to come here?

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Wen Xiaoyao brought me here.

132
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,600
Do you know my name?

133
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,700
Qiao Guanghui.

134
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,900
Hello, Uncle Qiao.

135
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,200
The moment I saw you,

136
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,840
I got goosebumps all over.

137
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,559
When I met Zhou Tong,

138
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,980
I felt the same way.

139
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,140
You've met him?

140
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
He visited Hangzhou.

141
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,680
When I saw him,

142
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,940
it was dark,

143
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,680
windy,

144
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
and pouring rain.

145
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,780
So you came to Beijing.

146
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,280
Zhou Tong is gone,

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
and I feel terrible about it.

148
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,570
You two weren't even close.

149
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,720
We weren't,

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,960
but still,

151
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,960
I feel sad about it.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,240
You feel sad.

153
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,810
Then meeting me was the right move.

154
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,200
Why?

155
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,010
Because I'm not feeling great either.

156
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,080
Xiaoyao.

157
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,640
Get two cups.

158
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,280
Put them here.

159
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,970
Alright,

160
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
go sit over there.

161
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,940
Try these braised bamboo shoots.

162
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,720
The ones you made last time

163
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,650
were just so-so.

164
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,000
Auntie,

165
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,010
let's not talk about it.

166
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,810
Now I can't even mention it?

167
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,280
Last time Zhou Tong was here.

168
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,660
He's already in his grave,

169
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,740
you need to move on.

170
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,340
I can't get over it.

171
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,060
You must move on even if it's hard,

172
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,060
the living can't follow the dead.

173
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,850
Here.

174
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,160
Eat some meat.

175
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,240
After my mother passed away,

176
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,690
I joined the training class at six,

177
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,000
started formal ballet training at nine,

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,260
together with Jiaomi.

179
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,130
From dormitory to rehearsal hall,

180
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,600
for over ten years,

181
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,930
I persevered every day,

182
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,170
never going anywhere else.

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
It was so exhausting.

184
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,520
I didn't know what love was,

185
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,890
then I met Zhou Tong,

186
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,680
and finally I could breathe.

187
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,570
I thought I had a future.

188
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,810
What do you mean?

189
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,520
Having a home in Beijing,

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,460
spending my life with him.

191
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
This is your home.

192
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,040
But Zhou Tong is gone.

193
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,930
Xiaoyao.

194
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,360
Recently,

195
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,340
I also felt life was meaningless,

196
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,720
I didn't expect you'd feel the same way.

197
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,490
Zhou Tong was unfortunate.

198
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,980
But this is how things are now,

199
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,040
I can't indulge you anymore.

200
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,540
How old are you?

201
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,360
Twenty.

202
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
You've been practicing ballet with Xiaomi,

203
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,460
for how many years?

204
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,040
Over eleven years.

205
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,760
What are they to you?

206
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,000
Family.

207
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,160
You only have Zhou Tong in your heart,

208
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,040
not them,

209
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,200
is that right?

210
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,480
You just said

211
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,400
you persevered with ballet,

212
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,840
why?

213
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Do you like it?

214
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes.

215
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,010
Then why did you have to persevere?

216
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,100
Because I wanted to be like my mother.

217
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,280
You wanted to be like your mother,

218
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,940
dancing the White Snake Lady.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,330
Now you've achieved it,

220
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,260
as the lead.

221
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
As soon as Zhou Tong is gone,

222
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
you stop dancing,

223
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,240
who are you being fair to?

224
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,330
Zhao Gang knows about this,

225
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
he's devastated.

226
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,480
When you visit your mother at the cemetery,

227
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,820
what will you tell her?

228
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,360
Xiaoyao.

229
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,400
Zhou Tong

230
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,360
was my son,

231
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,000
he's gone,

232
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,250
I'm more heartbroken than you.

233
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,400
It's not easy for me

234
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,970
to sit here counseling you.

235
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,540
You need to listen.

236
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,580
These braised bamboo shoots are delicious.

237
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,780
Have some more.

238
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,420
Please have some too, auntie.

239
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,720
Meeting me first when you arrived in Beijing

240
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,480
is fate.

241
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,780
Yaoyao doesn't count.

242
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,280
Did your wife call her?

243
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,330
I'm not married yet,

244
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,040
but we've had our engagement celebration.

245
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,780
Put it here.

246
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,380
Where are you staying?

247
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,660
Diandian booked it for me,

248
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,570
let me check.

249
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,260
In a hurry to sleep?

250
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,180
Not really.

251
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,480
Can you have

252
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,060
a drink?

253
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,080
I don't enjoy drinking,

254
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,600
but

255
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,370
I can hold my liquor.

256
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,480
Let's go then,

257
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,810
I'll take you somewhere

258
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,100
to belt out some songs.

259
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,930
Will Zhou Tong be there too?

260
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,840
Everyone goes there.

261
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,260
Uncle Qiao,

262
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,460
where are we going?

263
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,320
A karaoke bar,

264
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,280
don't tell me you've never been.

265
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,000
I really haven't.

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,880
You're lying.

267
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,160
I never lie.

268
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,380
Then you're not a real man,

269
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,760
a real man

270
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,880
tells a few lies now and then.

271
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,180
Why go to a karaoke bar?

272
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,380
When you're feeling down,

273
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,080
with nowhere to vent,

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and still have to pretend to be nice.

275
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,160
When someone dumps you,

276
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,800
and you have to act like everything's fine,

277
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
forcing yourself to smile,

278
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,860
who can stand that?

279
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Get together,

280
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,020
find a karaoke bar,

281
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,570
sing your heart out,

282
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,450
it works.

283
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,170
Don't tell me you're not feeling down.

284
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,200
Why do things have to be this way?

285
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,040
What way?

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,530
Nothing.

287
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,140
Look at you, how can it be nothing?

288
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Come with me,

289
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,680
have some drinks,

290
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,610
sing some songs,

291
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,930
and you'll feel better.

292
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,140
Uncle Qiao, are you feeling down too?

293
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,040
I'm feeling terrible.

294
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,580
You can talk to me about it.

295
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,940
There's an old saying,

296
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,920
'Drawing water with a bamboo basket - all for nothing,'

297
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
have you heard it?

298
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,700
There's more to it,

299
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,600
'Standing tall

300
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000
while making someone else's wedding dress.'

301
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,320
After tonight,

302
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,480
I'll be helping them

303
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,650
prepare for their wedding.

304
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,440
Mrs. Song,

305
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,570
I'm leaving.

306
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,200
Come visit more often,

307
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,730
make yourself at home here.

308
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,650
If you want to see it,

309
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,079
just go in and take a look.

310
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,839
I'll pass.

311
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,220
Let me walk you out.

312
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,760
No need,

313
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,600
I'll still have to leave whether you see me downstairs or not.

314
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,800
Auntie,

315
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,680
Xu Tian is here.

316
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,200
He came alone

317
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
and said he wanted to see you.

318
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,970
How did you know?

319
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,370
His girlfriend asked me to pick him up.

320
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,160
You know

321
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,170
his girlfriend?

322
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,720
We met in Hangzhou.

323
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,440
Auntie,

324
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,650
I'm leaving now.

325
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
Take it slow, watch your step. Don't fall.

326
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,400
Come on.

327
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,530
Turn right up ahead.

328
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,000
Hui! My dear Hui!

329
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We've been waiting for you forever.

330
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,930
Come on, quickly

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,720
put that fruit plate here for Hui.

332
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,400
Sleeping for a hundred years.

333
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,320
Have fun.

334
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,160
Request a song.

335
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,000
Alright.

336
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,480
Don't just drink without singing.

337
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,800
What song will you sing?

338
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
"Exploring Qingshui River."

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,520
Great.

340
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,120
Find it for him.

341
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,600
Okay,

342
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,330
don't worry.

343
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,520
After drinking,

344
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,920
you have to sing, you know?

345
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,250
You've got to let it out.

346
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,130
Sit down.

347
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,200
I admit I'm a captive.

348
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,360
Because of cowardice and tolerance,

349
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,120
their arrogance grows daily.

350
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,960
In the end, it will cost lives.

351
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,140
How about that?

352
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,820
Shared a bunch of personal feelings.

353
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,730
I really feel sorry for you now.

354
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,360
Growing up alone must have been so hard.

355
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,460
If it were me, I'd have gone crazy.

356
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,480
But don't think you and Xiaoyao

357
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,820
actually have some special connection.

358
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,740
Let me tell you something.

359
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,920
Get out,

360
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,440
wrong room.

361
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Sorry about that.

362
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,890
Get lost.

363
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,520
Slow down, slow down,

364
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,360
be careful.

365
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,520
Beautiful mountains and colorful peaks,

366
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,600
how could anyone say our country is ill?

367
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,660
Uncle Qiao,

368
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,800
you mentioned you had something to tell me?

369
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,040
Yes.

370
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,440
Fate is a strange thing,

371
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,980
sometimes it's not necessarily a blessing.

372
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Your...

373
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,240
Willow leaves fill the sky,

374
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,440
as the honorable Master Ming takes his position.

375
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,320
Listen carefully to what I have to say.

376
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,280
Who just told me to get lost?

377
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,920
I did.

378
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Brother, I'm so sorry.

379
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,560
Say it again.

380
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,840
Come here, let me tell you something.

381
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,680
Say it again.

382
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,370
He pushed me.

383
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,850
He pushed me.

384
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,320
Get out.

385
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,690
This isn't your private property.

386
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,200
It's okay,

387
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,360
keep singing.

388
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,240
You're seriously messed up.

389
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Can't you talk like a normal person?

390
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,520
It's all in the music.

391
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,360
You call that playing the piano?

392
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,490
It's embarrassing.

393
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,000
What's so embarrassing?

394
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,800
Following me from Hangzhou

395
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,060
all the way to Beijing.

396
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,960
You were the one who showed

397
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,160
interest in me first.

398
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,600
That never happened.

399
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,920
You asked for

400
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,740
my phone number first,

401
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,880
then when I said I was going back to Beijing,

402
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,480
you gave me your home address

403
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,280
and invited me to watch you dance ballet,

404
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,680
right?

405
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,560
I

406
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,200
could

407
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,440
ask you to

408
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,160
dance

409
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,920
ballet.

410
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,120
But

411
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,160
you

412
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,680
can't make me listen to your piano playing.

413
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,080
Just admit it,

414
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,160
you've fallen for me.

415
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,290
That's ridiculous,

416
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,400
dating is too embarrassing.

417
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,180
I've been coming here for two days straight.

418
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,490
I never invited you.

419
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,740
Today is the third day,

420
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,520
I should go upstairs now.

421
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,280
Why?

422
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
Love comes quickly and goes quickly,

423
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,770
we can't waste time.

424
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Don't deny your feelings.

425
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,940
Come on,

426
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,560
I'll make you breakfast.

427
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,860
For heaven's sake!

428
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,460
Someone's already making me breakfast,

429
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,810
she's taking a shower upstairs right now.

430
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,360
You have a boyfriend?

431
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,240
It's a woman,

432
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,660
my best friend.

433
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Let's go meet her.

434
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,220
Good grief!

435
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,120
Are you really

436
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,080
too busy

437
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,000
today?

438
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,600
I have a ton of stuff to do.

439
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,600
Another time.

440
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,880
When exactly is 'another time'?

441
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'll call you.

442
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,130
Fine.

443
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,240
Let's put it in writing,

444
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,720
okay?

445
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,160
Write it right here,

446
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,290
where you can see it.

447
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,500
Don't you dare!

448
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,280
If you write anything here,

449
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,680
I'll cut you off immediately,

450
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,040
and never speak to you again in this life,

451
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
plus the next one.

452
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,160
What's wrong with you!

453
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,680
Don't you understand about protecting the environment?

454
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,210
So how about tomorrow then?

455
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,600
Maybe.

456
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
A day has 24 hours,

457
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,740
that's a long time.

458
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,050
Now admit it, are you pursuing me or am I pursuing you?

459
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
It's all the same.

460
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
See you tomorrow.

461
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,920
Eat up.

462
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,020
Have you eaten?

463
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,840
Um,

464
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,720
Director Yang is coming to the troupe today,

465
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,080
and he specifically asked for you to be there.

466
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,340
Let's go see Dad first,

467
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,810
and bring him along.

468
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,920
Why?

469
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,040
Because of the issue between Aunt Gang and Sister Yun,

470
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,970
about the new and old productions.

471
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,640
You're the lead actress,

472
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
so you need to give an explanation when you return.

473
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,680
Do I really have to go?

474
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,920
Aunt Gang is counting on you.

475
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,240
Morning, Uncle Qiao.

476
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,400
You're up.

477
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,650
Exercise is vital for life.

478
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,440
After drinking heavily,

479
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,770
you need to sweat it out.

480
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,690
Do you exercise regularly?

481
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,880
Rarely.

482
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,160
No exercise,

483
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,920
not good.

484
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,000
You should exercise more

485
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,600
and keep a positive mindset.

486
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,340
Do two sets.

487
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
I'll give it a try.

488
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,560
Too light? Want me to add more weights?

489
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,680
No, no,

490
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,940
it's not light.

491
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,440
Young man,

492
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,730
I push even heavier weights than this.

493
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,120
It's too heavy.

494
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:30,680
Okay.

495
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,160
These young people.

496
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,120
So weak!

497
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,360
Put some muscle into it!

498
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,880
Give it more effort!

499
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,740
It's too heavy,

500
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,480
I can't do it anymore.

501
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,400
That's it.

502
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,560
Zhou Butong.

503
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,000
Why is he here?

504
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,840
I... I...

505
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,890
Did I time travel or something?

506
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,370
He's not a stranger.

507
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,640
What's going on?

508
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,000
I arrived in Beijing

509
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,720
yesterday,

510
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,280
then

511
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,120
Xiaoyao picked me up

512
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,400
and took me to

513
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
Guangming Pavilion,

514
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,010
where I ran into Uncle Qiao.

515
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,800
Had quite a few drinks,

516
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,660
got some sleep,

517
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,280
and now we're practicing, aren't we?

518
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,520
Where will he sleep?

519
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
In the guest room.

520
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,560
He's staying at my place.

521
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,660
I'm sorry for the trouble.

522
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,280
Nothing to be sorry about.

523
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,000
You'll stay here for the next few days,

524
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,800
it's much better than any hotel.

525
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,260
Thank you, Uncle Qiao.

526
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,000
Why are you thanking him?

527
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,460
I make the decisions here,

528
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,040
do you have a problem with that?

529
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,680
So you two are in cahoots now.

530
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,120
This man

531
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,280
has been through a lot,

532
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,610
is loyal and righteous,

533
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,040
and we get along well.

534
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,440
I'll take you to meet Director Song later.

535
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:36,920
No way,

536
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,000
I need to go to the ballet company today,

537
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,120
Aunt Gang's fate hangs in the balance today.

538
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,760
Today?

539
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,640
Xiaoyao is waiting at the door,

540
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,400
she's back,

541
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,520
they need to decide between 'Jinse' or 'White Snake' today.

542
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,050
Do you want to go see Yaoyao?

543
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,300
I don't need to.

544
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,410
Xiaoyao doesn't have time either.

545
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,680
Then just grab something to eat,

546
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,960
go wherever you want.

547
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,400
Keep your phone on if you get lost,

548
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,200
I'll call you.

549
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,930
Go change your clothes.

550
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,800
Xiaoyao.

551
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,680
Guess what?

552
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,000
Time travel?

553
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,200
Xu Tian

554
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,740
is lifting weights at Uncle Hui's place.

555
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,610
Xiaoyao,

556
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,800
get in the car.

557
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
We'll call Auntie Gang from the car.

558
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,490
Do you want to go see him?

559
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,780
No need.

560
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,700
Get in quickly.

561
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,640
Xu Tian.

562
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,520
Lao Shi,

563
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,300
I'm in Beijing.

564
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,740
Yeah, arrived yesterday.

565
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,560
I called Diandian,

566
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,290
but her phone is off,

567
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,520
and she's

568
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,480
deleted me on WeChat.

569
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,010
That can't be right?

570
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,400
I know it seems impossible,

571
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,680
but

572
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,800
I don't know why she deleted me.

573
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,770
What exactly

574
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,460
happened between you two?

575
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,560
If you find her,

576
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,280
let me know.

577
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,000
Xiaoyao.

578
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,250
Xiaoyao.

579
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,440
Why haven't you changed yet?

580
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,200
The leaders will be

581
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,000
holding a meeting for us in the training hall soon.

582
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,730
You go ahead.

583
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,760
You need to practice,

584
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,400
hurry up.

585
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,600
I saw that boy this morning.

586
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,080
He seems nice.

587
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,280
If you like him, don't hesitate.

588
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,160
I'm so embarrassed.

589
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,760
He's right.

590
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,680
Which part?

591
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,840
Love comes quickly and leaves just as fast,

592
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,500
we can't afford to waste time.

593
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,800
You agreed so quickly.

594
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,160
No way.

595
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,240
He needs to get your approval first,

596
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,300
it's not that easy.

597
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,300
He already has.

598
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,920
Come on, that's so irresponsible of you.

599
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,920
I'll head over first.

600
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,240
Xiaomi.

601
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,970
Give me a hug.

602
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,730
Thinking back to

603
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,000
1992.

604
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,570
You were just a section chief then.

605
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Of course, your talent

606
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,460
had already been recognized.

607
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,360
My talent

608
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,210
was personally recognized by you.

609
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,880
Hong Changqing.

610
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,280
You came on stage to give me flowers,

611
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,840
and I embraced you on stage,

612
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,960
holding those flowers.

613
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,720
And then in that small restaurant,

614
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,180
we drank celebration wine

615
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,100
half the night.

616
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,720
Listen to me.

617
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,320
The 1998 flood relief,

618
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,400
the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.

619
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,880
When have I ever

620
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,480
let you down?

621
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,840
It was the entire troupe,

622
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,199
and even the whole artistic community,

623
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,719
a collective effort,

624
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,440
not just one person's achievement.

625
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,969
Will you listen to me or not?

626
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,080
I understand being cast aside after use,

627
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,760
I get it.

628
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,320
I understand knowing when to step down.

629
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,600
But I still have a burning passion,

630
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,639
and a lifetime of rich experience.

631
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,239
Now Yaoyao has returned.

632
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,639
You must revive 'The White Snake'.

633
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,239
Stop, stop, stop.

634
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,760
Who's talking here, you or me?

635
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,040
Please listen to me.

636
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,239
I am the bureau chief,

637
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,040
and also the party secretary of the ballet troupe.

638
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,639
Believe it or not, I can remove you as director.

639
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,179
Is that necessary?

640
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,860
It wouldn't be fun if I did.

641
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,960
Zhao Gang.

642
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,980
Don't push the leader too far.

643
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,400
The leader is saving face for you.

644
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,120
Exactly,

645
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,800
the older you get,

646
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,930
the worse your temper becomes.

647
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,660
If you really remove me...

648
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,100
'The White Snake' is a repertoire piece,

649
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,560
we'll perform it in the future.

650
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,720
The revival will happen soon.

651
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,180
Wen Xiaoyao has returned,

652
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,000
she must face consequences.

653
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,240
She left whenever she wanted,

654
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,080
and now expects to be the lead again.

655
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,740
How are we supposed to manage the ballet troupe?

656
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,080
The new production 'Jin Se'

657
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,760
caters to the market.

658
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,760
What market?

659
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,220
You interrupted me again,

660
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
how dare you!

661
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,280
Please listen.

662
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,120
The youth market,

663
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,530
old stories,

664
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,060
new interpretations.

665
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,880
Yang Yun's generation of dancers is transitioning,

666
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,210
we should support them.

667
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,760
How were you supported back then?

668
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,160
Let me explain.

669
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,260
Stop wasting time.

670
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,760
You're still the director,

671
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,720
assist with

672
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,040
the new production

673
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,960
choreography.

674
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,880
If you keep complaining,

675
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,610
you won't be director anymore.

676
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,370
Mr. Qiao,

677
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,760
you are

678
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,960
the ballet company's closest sponsor,

679
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,370
any objections?

680
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,640
I sponsor national artistic groups,

681
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,760
I support our country's

682
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
ballet industry.

683
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,880
I have no objections.

684
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,480
Is that it?

685
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Say one more word!

686
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,880
How am I supposed to assist?

687
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,960
Find your place

688
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,690
while adapting to the changes.

689
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,890
Should you announce it or should I?

690
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,560
Let the director announce it.

691
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,420
How's it going?

692
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,040
Come in.

693
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,080
Uncle Hui.

694
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,940
You've got dark circles under your eyes.

695
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,440
Really?

696
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,250
I was drinking with Xu Tian half the night,

697
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
but I still got up early to exercise.

698
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,930
How is Xu Tian doing?

699
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Come over at noon,

700
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,640
and spend some time with him.

701
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,240
Don't bring up sad memories.

702
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,160
He's just like Zhou Tong,

703
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,880
cut from the same cloth.

704
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,600
Uncle Hui,

705
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,180
you're so kind,

706
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,560
so very kind.

707
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,080
I've never told you that before.

708
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,620
Why do you say that?

709
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,720
I don't know how to repay you.

710
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,130
What are you talking about?

711
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,010
There's no need for repayment.

712
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,760
Okay.

713
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,530
Girls, hold on a moment.

714
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,520
Director Yang is here.

715
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,250
Let's sit down and take a break.

716
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,000
After unanimous agreement among the leadership,

717
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,800
The Legend of the White Snake

718
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,920
will remain as a repertoire piece of our ballet company,

719
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,600
to be restaged when needed.

720
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,240
Yang Yun's newly choreographed

721
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,960
Jinse

722
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,780
will officially begin

723
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,620
rehearsals today.

724
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,480
I will assist,

725
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,640
with Yang Yun taking the lead.

726
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,770
Yang Yun, Qiao Mi, and Yin Ye will star.

727
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,040
Wen Xiaoyao.

728
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,250
Present.

729
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Wen Xiaoyao will receive one demerit,

730
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,460
accept disciplinary action,

731
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,000
and be assigned to the corps de ballet in Jinse.

732
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,760
That's all for the announcements.

733
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,090
Let's begin rehearsal.

734
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,160
Fang Fang,

735
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,960
Dian Dian,

736
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,840
did she go back to her hometown in Shaoxing?

737
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,320
No,

738
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm right outside her dorm room now.

739
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,160
Her phone is turned off too,

740
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,760
and I've been knocking for ages with no answer.

741
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,460
Could her old problem be acting up again?

742
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,290
Where are you going?

743
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,040
The Forbidden City.

744
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,500
Did you book tickets for the Forbidden City?

745
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,160
No.

746
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,840
The Great Wall would be fine too.

747
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,040
Badaling Great Wall is really crowded.

748
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,840
Master!

749
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,850
The wild Great Wall in Huairou.

750
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,300
Director Fang.

751
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,540
Where is Diandian?

752
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,320
Hangzhou.

753
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,080
I know she's in Hangzhou.

754
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,120
Did you two have a fight?

755
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,920
Of course not.

756
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,920
Neither of us would do that.

757
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,000
When she took you to the airport,

758
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,130
did either of you say something wrong?

759
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,180
We did talk,

760
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,660
but I'm not sure

761
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,200
which things I said were right

762
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,400
and which were wrong.

763
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,250
You sound upset.

764
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,620
Maybe a little.

765
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,130
