1
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,890
Wen Xiaoyao.

2
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,970
Wen Xiaoyao.

3
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,200
Wen Xiaoyao.

4
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,810
I've been looking everywhere for you.

5
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,160
I'm sorry.

6
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,760
You're not

7
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,880
Zhou Tong.

8
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,200
I miss him so much.

9
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,960
I mistook you for him.

10
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,680
When I see you,

11
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,680
it's like seeing him.

12
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,220
The more you resemble him, the more it hurts.

13
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Don't drink like that.

14
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,640
You...

15
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,480
I was thinking

16
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,560
of being with you for a day,

17
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,480
three days,

18
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,610
or even a lifetime if possible.

19
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,120
I told myself

20
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,370
that I was seeing him in you.

21
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,800
He came back.

22
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,720
Thank you.

23
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
I'm sorry.

24
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,520
Why did I come to Hangzhou?

25
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,240
If I disappeared one day,

26
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,960
would you

27
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,920
look for me?

28
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,480
Where would you go?

29
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,680
Maybe

30
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,560
I just want to see other places,

31
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,490
different scenery.

32
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,320
If that's the case,

33
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,160
You-

34
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,620
let me know in advance.

35
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:09,920
No.

36
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,240
I

37
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,340
I'm just saying if.

38
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,280
Would you?

39
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,440
Yes.

40
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,800
I would.

41
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,090
I would look for you.

42
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,780
Who are you?

43
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,800
I...

44
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,480
I...

45
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,159
Who are you?

46
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,840
Stop trying to fool us here,

47
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,280
get lost,

48
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,940
go away now!

49
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,780
What are you doing?

50
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:43,930
He...

51
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,200
He's not Zhou Tong.

52
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,930
It's all because of you,

53
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,260
otherwise Zhou Tong wouldn't have left.

54
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,260
Get out of here!

55
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Go away!

56
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
Zhou Tong is dead.

57
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,440
Xiao Yao,

58
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,580
who is this person?

59
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,370
Have you lost your mind?

60
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,360
Why are you always like this,

61
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
why do you always act this way?

62
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,960
If I could bring Zhou Tong back,

63
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,640
I'd rather be hit by a car and die.

64
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Is that possible?

65
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,280
I'm too stupid to understand.

66
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,039
But I

67
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,559
just don't get it.

68
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,880
I'm sorry, Xiaoyao,

69
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,539
I was wrong.

70
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
I've let Xiaoyao down.

71
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,400
I...

72
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,400
Zhou Tong.

73
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,600
He's dead.

74
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,490
Xiaoyao.

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,530
Xiaoyao,

76
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,560
what are you doing?

77
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,040
If you say you'll never forgive me,

78
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,840
I'll leave.

79
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,320
But

80
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,960
how will you manage alone?

81
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,560
No,

82
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,640
what about me?

83
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,880
What will you eat,

84
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
what will you do, what will you wear?

85
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm sorry, Xiaoyao,

86
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,200
I was wrong.

87
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,320
Let's go back to Beijing, okay?

88
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
There's family in Beijing,

89
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,360
there are loved ones there.

90
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,800
Auntie Gang,

91
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,640
she's already here,

92
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,440
and Uncle Hui,

93
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,100
our father.

94
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,180
What are you doing here all alone?

95
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,440
We've trained together for so many years,

96
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
and you just quit dancing like that.

97
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,160
How could you do this?

98
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,520
You think you're so special because you fell in love?

99
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,000
So many people love you,

100
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,570
why do you only have eyes for Zhou Tong?

101
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,820
Don't you care about us at all?

102
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
What's wrong?

103
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,490
Where are you headed, miss?

104
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
If we're driving into the city,

105
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,160
you need to tell me where, right?

106
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,480
Should we take Qianjiang Bridge One or Two?

107
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
I can't remember.

108
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,700
You're going home, right?

109
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,020
If you're not sure, call a friend and ask.

110
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,730
Hai'er Lane.

111
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,210
Hai'er Lane,

112
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,880
got it.

113
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Do you have water?

114
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,680
Yes.

115
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,290
Here.

116
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,480
Thank you.

117
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,300
Wen Xiaoyao is quite nice,

118
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
she's beautiful and dances ballet.

119
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,490
When I saw her in Beijing last time,

120
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,410
I thought she was really great.

121
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,880
Since she's coming to Hangzhou,

122
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,410
you two should be together.

123
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,280
After all, I've never

124
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,540
done anything for you.

125
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,660
You ran away the first time you saw me.

126
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,850
That wasn't the first time.

127
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,720
I hope I won't forget you.

128
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,080
But if things continue like this,

129
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,410
someday I won't be able to control myself.

130
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,840
I'll be letting myself down,

131
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,240
and letting you down too.

132
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,340
Xu Tian is here.

133
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,000
We've arrived at Hai'er Lane.

134
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,840
Should we enter

135
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,370
from the east or north side?

136
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,250
I'm begging you.

137
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,410
Wen Xiaoyao, I love Xu Tian.

138
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,600
Please,

139
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,000
just go.

140
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,740
I'm also sad about Zhou Tong's death,

141
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,290
but at least you had him.

142
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,520
Xu Tian and I have just started our relationship,

143
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,320
it's not fair.

144
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,160
Miss,

145
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,210
are you done?

146
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,960
Yes.

147
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,700
Come on.

148
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,120
Pay up.

149
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,860
What are you doing?

150
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,800
You're turning into an alcoholic, you know that?

151
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Forced to drink yesterday,

152
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,660
and drinking again today.

153
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,920
I can hold my liquor pretty well.

154
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,050
Dian Dian is going to scold you.

155
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,130
Two bottles.

156
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,370
Which one should I take?

157
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,520
Just take both.

158
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,940
I only need one.

159
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,020
They're exactly the same.

160
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
Something's off about you.

161
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,200
Did something happen?

162
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,720
Do I have paranoia?

163
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,280
You don't know yourself?

164
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,319
Do I?

165
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,599
It's quite serious.

166
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,839
Things that never happened,

167
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,760
you can put them in your head out of nowhere.

168
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,000
And things that did happen,

169
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,280
you cut off the beginning and end,

170
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,920
make up your own version,

171
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,780
and put that in your head instead.

172
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,680
Really?

173
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,480
But,

174
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,180
that day in September,

175
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,180
it was pouring.

176
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,250
The rain that day

177
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
was much heavier than today.

178
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,000
The sixth.

179
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,240
He

180
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,100
really did appear.

181
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,810
Like looking in a mirror, you know?

182
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,610
Mom's been gone for a long time,

183
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,320
but he really exists.

184
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,360
Why did I go to Beijing?

185
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,840
Lao Shi.

186
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,340
I'll be right back.

187
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,120
He's gone too.

188
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,490
What are you talking about?

189
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,920
You're not making any sense.

190
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
You're overthinking again.

191
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,700
Just like that.

192
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
No, that's not right.

193
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,330
The bottle is empty.

194
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,580
The shadow is gone too.

195
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,320
Diandian.

196
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,680
Diandian.

197
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,250
You're back.

198
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,140
Would you like some water bamboo?

199
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,930
If you eat, I'll eat.

200
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,050
I missed you,

201
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,890
couldn't help coming back.

202
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,850
I missed you too.

203
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,900
You're still here?

204
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,500
I came back.

205
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,460
You left yesterday and now you're back already?

206
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,060
He's been drinking again.

207
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,240
Don't talk about him.

208
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,450
His old problem is acting up again.

209
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,840
165 yuan.

210
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,160
Diandian,

211
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
where are the things you bought?

212
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,770
You bought something earlier.

213
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,660
Did you exchange the ring?

214
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,240
Yes, I did.

215
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,700
You didn't sell it?

216
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,800
No.

217
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,040
Did Wen Xiaoyao go?

218
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,400
She left the ring at the counter,

219
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,890
and after I picked it up,

220
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,730
I ran into her on the street.

221
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,440
Did you spend more time with her?

222
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,120
I took her

223
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,240
to the theater where Teacher Jia Sulan

224
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
used to perform.

225
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,290
Let's go.

226
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

227
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,400
Thankfully, the landlady was kind enough

228
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,800
to bring back your phone.

229
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,890
Staying silent won't solve anything.

230
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,940
Everyone can see the feelings

231
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
between you two.

232
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,410
She can understand Yaoyao's pain.

233
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,780
Is this a mattress pad?

234
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,770
It's a quilt.

235
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,180
Move aside.

236
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,120
It's completely pointless.

237
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,120
This is typical childish drama, just playing house.

238
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,360
Life has its ups and downs, that's inevitable.

239
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,160
Crying over every little thing,

240
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,960
you can't just cry your way back to the womb,

241
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,320
how will you ever grow up?

242
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,120
You're all like the morning sun,

243
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,120
just starting to shine,

244
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,460
and acting like it's the end of the world.

245
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,650
What a dangerous day it was!

246
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,560
Three lives

247
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,560
almost lost forever.

248
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,400
Get up.

249
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,040
Why me again?

250
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,680
I've been taking care of you since you were little.

251
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,210
You entered art school at 9,

252
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,210
and Yaoyao at 10.

253
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,480
For your daily needs,

254
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,400
who took care of you more,

255
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,530
Qiao Guanghui or me?

256
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,120
I shouldn't have let you join the ballet company.

257
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,380
All my efforts wasted.

258
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,600
I shouldn't have let you play Xiao Qing,

259
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,080
I shouldn't have let you fall in love

260
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,200
or play Bai Suzhen.

261
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,560
You're only in your twenties

262
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,420
and acting like your life is over.

263
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,450
I'm still struggling here.

264
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,520
What if we faced a war?

265
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,240
If a whole platoon goes to battle

266
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,440
and half the comrades die,

267
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,840
what about the other half?

268
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,100
Do they stop fighting?

269
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
Giving up on yourself

270
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,420
is that any way to live?

271
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,520
Turn your grief into strength.

272
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,200
Director.

273
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,640
But this is peacetime,

274
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,960
we're not at war.

275
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,000
You're used to interrupting, aren't you?

276
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,260
The director is right,

277
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,440
turn grief into strength.

278
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,770
Fold up those blankets,

279
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,220
you're all sitting there like grandmas.

280
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,320
I'm naked.

281
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,960
Get dressed.

282
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,360
If you're dressed, why are you under the blanket?

283
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,160
I'm cold.

284
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,840
It's wet.

285
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,720
Go, go,

286
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,780
go change quickly.

287
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,120
Xiaoyao,

288
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,940
is there any hot water?

289
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,450
There's a water heater.

290
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
You're all so good

291
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,480
at fooling me.

292
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,520
Calling me Auntie Gang behind my back,

293
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,580
thinking I'm deaf.

294
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,340
When people die, they go to paradise.

295
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,220
Do you understand?

296
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,960
When someone's gone,

297
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,760
they're gone.

298
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,600
How did you get through your childhood?

299
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,120
When your mother passed away,

300
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,160
you've been through this before.

301
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,890
You trained hard for ten years,

302
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,180
and one relationship has ruined you.

303
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,280
You're letting yourself down,

304
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,680
and you owe me better too.

305
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,520
When you wanted to dance the White Snake,

306
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,650
what did you tell me?

307
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,880
What did I tell you?

308
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,840
Dance has four levels:

309
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,930
Good technique,

310
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,300
to become a dancer;

311
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,920
Rich inner life and excellence,

312
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,200
experiencing love's sweetness and bitterness;

313
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,240
Moving yourself

314
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,800
and touching others;

315
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
The fourth level,

316
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,640
experiencing life's partings,

317
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,400
understanding gain and loss,

318
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,480
to truly become an artist.

319
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,440
Are you stupid?

320
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,160
Do you need someone else to teach you these things?

321
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,820
Don't you understand?

322
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,260
I can't understand it.

323
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,520
Look at me.

324
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
Zhou Tong is gone.

325
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,000
You're alive.

326
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,440
Uncle Qiao loves you.

327
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Xiaomi loves you.

328
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,160
I love you.

329
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,440
Everyone who loves you is still alive,

330
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,300
but you don't even love yourself.

331
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,640
I really don't know what I'm doing here.

332
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,280
Who am I?

333
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,600
Director.

334
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,320
I flew all the way here,

335
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,260
is the director here to make your bed?

336
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,840
No.

337
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,500
Straight talk,

338
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,360
are you dancing in 'White Snake' or not?

339
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,100
Look at what kind of place this is.

340
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
You might as well stay here forever,

341
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,440
teaching kids in dance classes,

342
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,810
I wouldn't even recognize a youth center.

343
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,740
Let's just do that.

344
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,860
I'll retire early too,

345
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,620
go back to Beijing.

346
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,680
I'll teach kids to flail around too.

347
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,200
Then I'll go to the

348
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,200
square,

349
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,460
teach dancing to middle-aged women.

350
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,080
Life is just

351
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,360
getting by, isn't it?

352
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,410
The two of us,

353
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,000
north and south, 30 years apart,

354
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,320
both retiring early.

355
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,490
Who hasn't been in love?

356
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,360
When I was in love,

357
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,640
I was desperate too.

358
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,880
If I had known it would be like this,

359
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,610
I should have given up long ago.

360
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,160
Can't train spineless people like you.

361
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,560
I'm here, Xiaoyao.

362
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,120
Xiaoyao.

363
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,400
Hello.

364
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,480
Do you have any rooms available?

365
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,520
May I see your ID card, please?

366
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:14,880
Sure.

367
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,320
Hello.

368
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,600
Hello.

369
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm staying in room 312.

370
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,800
Can he stay with me tonight?

371
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,000
Are you relatives?

372
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,800
Yes.

373
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,060
Will you be staying tomorrow as well?

374
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,780
No, I won't.

375
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,460
I won't be staying either.

376
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,000
Then you can check out

377
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,960
and he can register for a one-day stay.

378
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
No refund needed.

379
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,600
That's fine.

380
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,160
Could both of you give me your ID cards, please?

381
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,490
Okay.

382
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:44,850
Here.

383
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,840
Thank you.

384
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,780
Thanks.

385
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,170
I came all the way from Beijing to find you.

386
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,040
Whether you go back or not

387
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,700
is up to you.

388
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,800
Go back,

389
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,730
rise from the ashes.

390
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,200
Don't go back,

391
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,250
and you're just a loser.

392
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,170
Alright,

393
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,160
do I need to get a new access card?

394
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,200
Thank you.

395
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,250
Wen Xiaoyao.

396
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,120
Am I still your director?

397
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,480
You will always be, for life.

398
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,410
I don't want to talk about forever,

399
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,920
are you now or not?

400
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,200
Yes.

401
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,320
Come back,

402
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,600
we'll restage 'The Legend of the White Snake.'

403
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,760
Even if I compromise completely

404
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,520
and we perform

405
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,650
Yang Yunxin's 'The Stringed Zither,'

406
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,080
you still must come back.

407
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,890
You are a professional dancer,

408
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,180
not a professional romantic.

409
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,200
Perform 'The Stringed Zither.'

410
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
The ballet company is going through a transition,

411
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,240
I've stepped back to a supporting role.

412
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,680
Yang Yunxin has choreographed a dance

413
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,410
called 'The Stringed Zither.'

414
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,680
Bai Suzhen and Xiaoqing,

415
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,540
you and Qiaomi.

416
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,460
What about Xu Xian?

417
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,160
Immortals live for thousands of years,

418
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,130
mortals are just passing through.

419
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,200
There's one more dish

420
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,460
take your time eating.

421
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,180
One dish is enough,

422
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,700
have you eaten?

423
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,130
I can't eat anything at all.

424
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,480
Want some soup?

425
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,139
Never mind,

426
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,360
it's too much trouble.

427
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,290
It's no trouble.

428
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,199
What was that thing

429
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,820
you really wanted in life?

430
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
A food processor.

431
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,449
It's not on sale yet.

432
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,199
Why did you rush back?

433
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,090
I was afraid you'd be with Wen Xiaoyao.

434
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,840
Why would you think that?

435
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,100
I couldn't help it.

436
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Zhou Tong is dead.

437
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,360
I know.

438
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,480
You know?

439
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,639
I told her not to tell you,

440
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,530
why did she tell you anyway?

441
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,440
The wiring should have been replaced during renovation.

442
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,200
It's all old.

443
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,340
The day Zhou Tong came,

444
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,260
the power went out too.

445
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
I went to check the circuit breaker.

446
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,250
I'll just say a few words and leave.

447
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,440
Before my flight to Guangzhou took off,

448
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,930
Wen Xiaoyao told me Zhou Tong was dead.

449
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,360
I wanted to come back right away.

450
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,440
Why?

451
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,970
With Zhou Tong gone,

452
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,320
Wen Xiaoyao would be with you.

453
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,280
Do you have to think that way?

454
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,850
While I was checking in, I thought,

455
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,760
maybe I shouldn't go through with it,

456
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,120
since Wen Xiaoyao had already come to Hangzhou.

457
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,180
Wen Xiaoyao has nothing to do with me.

458
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,700
Zhou Tong is the one who matters to me.

459
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,130
What's your relationship with Zhou Tong?

460
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,100
Don't you understand?

461
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,040
I do.

462
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,680
He's the chain.

463
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,640
In the end,

464
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,680
connecting you and Wen Xiaoyao.

465
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,920
You're crazy.

466
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,920
I love you.

467
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,160
Me too.

468
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,040
Don't be angry.

469
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,480
I'm not.

470
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,960
At our engagement party,

471
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,970
Mom summed things up for us.

472
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,610
What did she say?

473
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,280
You're with me

474
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,480
because you feel secure,

475
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,760
not because of love.

476
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,420
I'm good to you,

477
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,300
so you promise to be good to me too.

478
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,580
Actually, the two of us

479
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,960
never properly dated.

480
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,360
Why do you remember all this?

481
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,700
I can't help it.

482
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,890
Some things stick in my memory.

483
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,530
Some things.

484
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,810
Were you like this with him before?

485
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,840
I don't want to talk about the past.

486
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,100
Or is it that you can't remember the past?

487
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Where's the ring?

488
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,050
Let me see it.

489
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,960
Try it on.

490
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,850
Perfect fit.

491
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,490
Perfect.

492
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,010
Will you always wear it?

493
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,080
Yes.

494
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,440
Even if you're not with me?

495
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,730
We'll definitely be together.

496
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,860
You keep your word.

497
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:24,960
Yes.

498
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,770
But I'm not good.

499
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,420
I can't help it,

500
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,180
it's always like this.

501
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,640
It's okay.

502
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,220
Why is there another pair?

503
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,260
They came free.

504
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,740
Since she's come to Hangzhou,

505
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,850
you two should be together,

506
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,130
and forget about me.

507
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,240
I never really did anything for you anyway.

508
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,620
You ran away the first time we met.

509
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,360
I hope I won't forget you,

510
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,520
but if things continue like this,

511
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,850
someday I won't be able to control myself.

512
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,480
By then,

513
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,640
I won't leave you with any good impression,

514
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,050
so I might as well be nice to you now.

515
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm heading back.

516
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,560
Tomorrow we'll look for Wen Xiaoyao together.

517
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,440
What for?

518
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,610
Then who do you want to find?

519
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,200
Zhou Tong.

520
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,280
It's all the same anyway.

521
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,180
South Asian Driver

522
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,210
On-set Art Director

523
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,300
DI Process Supervisor

524
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,080
Music Arrangement
