1
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,039
Has he left?

2
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,780
Yes, he has.

3
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,600
The day I took Zhou Tong to the hospital,

4
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,890
he lost a lot of blood in the car.

5
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,240
I didn't even know where the blood was coming from.

6
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,100
I've never been so scared before.

7
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,520
Seeing him

8
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,810
was like seeing Xu Tian.

9
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,020
I was afraid of losing him,

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,080
afraid I'd never see him again.

11
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,920
It's as if he

12
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,320
and him were the same person.

13
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,079
Wen Xiaoyao.

14
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,160
I understand.

15
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,320
Afraid he'll disappear,

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,970
afraid you'll never see him again.

17
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,660
Xu Tian is important to me.

18
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,120
Zhou Tong is even more important to Xu Tian.

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,130
I'm with Xu Tian because we're looking for Zhou Tong.

20
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Don't tell him.

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,250
If Zhou Tong is gone,

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,770
it won't do anyone any good.

23
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,220
I was thinking the same thing.

24
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,650
I'm getting married to him.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,760
I know.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,290
I'll go back right away.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Okay.

28
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,980
Did their flight take off?

29
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,480
Yes.

30
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
Then why should we be delayed

31
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,800
just because of bad weather?

32
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,840
They had good weather.

33
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,560
Bad weather doesn't mean no flights.

34
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,440
We're just taking off

35
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,500
one plane at a time.

36
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,600
We've been delayed for an hour already,

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:17,959
sir.

38
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,079
Please don't be angry.

39
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,279
Calm down, calm down.

40
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,860
Your temper is too hot.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,440
Sir,

42
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,760
get your supervisor.

43
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,960
I've already called them,

44
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,560
I told you that seven minutes ago.

45
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,760
Get your supervisor.

46
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,800
Alright,

47
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,580
please take a seat for now.

48
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,010
Is Yaoyao picking us up at the airport?

49
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,000
No.

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,060
I didn't tell her I was coming.

51
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,240
After we land,

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,520
we'll share our location,

53
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,580
and we'll go find her wherever she is.

54
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,280
Follow my lead when we get there.

55
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,200
How exactly?

56
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,560
Reason and emotion -

57
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,080
I'll handle the reasoning, you handle the emotions.

58
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,740
Ten years of blood and sweat in ballet training,

59
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,600
and one little romance

60
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,720
throws it all away.

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,920
It's weak.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,860
She must come back no matter what.

63
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,080
Sir,

64
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,760
please keep your voice down.

65
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,020
The flight is delayed,

66
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,770
everyone's already upset.

67
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,200
Where's your supervisor?

68
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm the highest authority here.

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,200
There's no higher supervisor for you to speak to.

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,920
I'll have you know I'm a national first-class director.

71
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Yeah, right.

72
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,340
Just wait a minute.

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,920
I only accept two types of ID here,

74
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,080
and yours isn't one of them.

75
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,320
What other ID do I need?

76
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,159
Retirement card,

77
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,290
priority boarding,

78
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,620
or senior citizen card

79
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,400
with wheelchair access.

80
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,130
Maybe you could look for those.

81
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,810
Who are you calling old man?

82
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,690
Do I look that old to you?

83
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Please wait a moment

84
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
boarding will begin in half an hour.

85
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,520
Don't lose your temper

86
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,920
we're in public,

87
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,560
not in our ballet company's territory.

88
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
You need to control yourself.

89
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Can you hold it in?

90
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,060
What if I can't?

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,800
Director,

92
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,760
I should

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,800
tell you two pieces of

94
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
bad news.

95
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,800
What?

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,360
I'm going to Hangzhou

97
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,890
to reconcile with Xiaoyao.

98
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,320
We used to be so close.

99
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,250
Do you think she can forgive me?

100
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
What bad news?

101
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,370
I'm responsible for Zhou Butong's death.

102
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
I schemed behind everyone's back,

103
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
played dirty tricks,

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,740
I was the worst.

105
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,450
Otherwise he wouldn't have ignored Xiaoyao,

106
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,420
and he wouldn't

107
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
have gone to the airport that day,

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,880
and wouldn't have been hit by a car on his way back.

109
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,210
After Zhou Butong died,

110
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,280
Xiaoyao deleted all the incriminating videos

111
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,360
from my phone.

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,760
Why?

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
That's not good news,

114
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,980
but what does it have to do with me?

115
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,740
Because she resents me so much

116
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,090
she can't even be bothered to curse me out.

117
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,680
This time when I go,

118
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,880
I don't dare hope she'll return to Beijing.

119
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,120
I'd be happy if she just yelled at me.

120
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,600
So our goals aren't the same.

121
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,480
But the second piece of bad news

122
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
does concern you.

123
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,450
Go on.

124
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,200
Well,

125
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
please don't take this personally.

126
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,200
I already have.

127
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,440
Xiaoyao's Xu Xian is gone,

128
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,860
and even if she comes back,

129
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,640
I want to dance

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,970
Sister Yun's 'Jin Se' with her.

131
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,360
Come,

132
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,400
stand up.

133
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,360
Imagine we are a tree,

134
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,080
our heels

135
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,320
are the roots,

136
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,520
our body is the trunk.

137
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,480
Our arms are branches,

138
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,480
our hands are leaves.

139
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,800
There are big leaves,

140
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,400
and small leaves.

141
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,640
Now the wind comes,

142
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,720
we are a tree,

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,840
and the leaves

144
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,440
dance in the air.

145
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,770
There are strong winds,

146
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,080
and gentle breezes.

147
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,480
Not such a strong wind.

148
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,200
Yes,

149
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
let the wind

150
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,080
pass through our bodies.

151
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
Let our branches

152
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,440
dance in the air.

153
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,840
Now,

154
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,400
turn around.

155
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes,

156
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,640
continue.

157
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,640
The wind,

158
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,600
blowing,

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
flowing through our bodies.

160
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,360
Xiao Yao,

161
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,560
I'm boarding now.

162
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,440
Send me your location later, okay?

163
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,800
Look,

164
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,290
Auntie Gang is here too.

165
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,800
Xiaomi.

166
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,450
Do I look the same as before?

167
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,400
Which 'before' are you talking about?

168
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
He and Zhou Tong are the same person.

169
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,920
Who is he?

170
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
You're talking nonsense, Xiao Yao.

171
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,460
I want to spend more time with him,

172
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,660
even if it's just for a day,

173
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,370
or half a day.

174
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,520
And after that?

175
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
There is no after.

176
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,560
What do you mean?

177
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,840
Don't scare me like that.

178
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
I'm going to meet that guy

179
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,360
named Xu Tian.

180
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,580
Just wait here.

181
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,080
I'll be in Hangzhou soon.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,860
Stop cleaning.

183
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,770
I can barely see you behind all that stuff.

184
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,880
It's perfect timing.

185
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
We're closed for the next couple of days,

186
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,840
so I can

187
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,720
organize everything properly.

188
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,300
I'll organize when I get back.

189
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,280
I need to decide where things go.

190
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,480
Let me arrange everything myself,

191
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,280
so I can grab things more easily.

192
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Where's Xiao Yao?

193
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,210
Wen Xiao Yao?

194
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,400
I don't know.

195
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,140
We didn't exchange phone numbers

196
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,840
and told her

197
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
if she needs anything,

198
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,560
to contact you directly.

199
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,600
What's that?

200
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,200
This?

201
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,640
A thimble.

202
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
Why haven't they called you yet?

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
There are still nine people ahead of me.

204
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,680
Diandian.

205
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,920
What's wrong?

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,400
Hello,

207
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,130
can I fill out an application form?

208
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,880
Hi.

209
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,480
Hello.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,930
I'm Wen Xiaoyao.

211
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,320
I know.

212
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
I was just on a video call with Xu Tian

213
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,160
when your call cut it off.

214
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,080
I'm sorry about that.

215
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,040
It's okay.

216
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,200
I wanted to ask you

217
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
where Xu Tian's

218
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
place is?

219
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Are you asking

220
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,800
where our home is?

221
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,740
What's this about?

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
He left his ring at my place.

223
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,100
I want to give it to him.

224
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,040
These should be

225
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,360
your wedding rings.

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,120
I'll send you the address

227
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,600
of the jewelry store later.

228
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
Just deliver it to the store.

229
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,650
I'll go to the store.

230
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,410
Who is it for?

231
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,700
For him.

232
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,880
Diandian.

233
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,240
I think my signal was poor

234
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,740
and got disconnected.

235
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,280
What's that in your hand?

236
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,480
Cloth.

237
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,920
It's raining outside.

238
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,480
I went out

239
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,610
to get some duckweed

240
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,340
and got wet.

241
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,920
Let me see,

242
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,250
did you change the ring?

243
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,760
The one that matches mine.

244
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,220
If you've already sold it,

245
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,380
we'll have to pick another pair when we get back.

246
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,360
The ring...

247
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,360
I might have

248
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,400
left it at Wen Xiaoyao's place yesterday.

249
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,000
I took it off

250
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,260
while I was helping her

251
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,880
assemble furniture.

252
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
I just asked her to take it

253
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,680
to the jewelry store.

254
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm upset.

255
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,080
Wedding rings are so important.

256
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm sorry.

257
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,620
Fortunately, it wasn't lost.

258
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,160
But

259
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,020
it wouldn't matter if it was lost.

260
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,050
It would matter.

261
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,050
As long as I'm in your heart, that's all that matters.

262
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,080
Of course.

263
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,570
Say it again.

264
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,450
What do you mean?

265
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,920
You're always

266
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,580
in my heart.

267
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,960
I couldn't get rid of you

268
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,020
even if I wanted to.

269
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,290
Alright,

270
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,680
I forgive you.

271
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,840
It's canceled.

272
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,440
There are still seven people

273
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
going to the airport.

274
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,800
Then I'll let Director Fang know.

275
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,400
No need to mention

276
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,730
returning to Hangzhou.

277
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,329
Even if we get to the airport, there might not be any flights.

278
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,400
Tea is here!

279
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,839
Tea for you two.

280
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,839
When is your first

281
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,040
performance going to start?

282
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,119
Right away, don't worry.

283
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,720
We'll start in five minutes.

284
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,079
Not everyone is here yet.

285
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,079
Come on now,

286
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,740
you two VIPs are already here.

287
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,160
Stop joking around.

288
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
Please enjoy your tea first.

289
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,319
Last time we came here,

290
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,839
we sat up there.

291
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,440
That's right.

292
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,800
We should have booked the whole place today,

293
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,040
it would be so peaceful.

294
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,500
Come on, stop showing off,

295
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
we came here for the atmosphere.

296
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,640
What would people say

297
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,500
if just the two of us went up there?

298
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,140
Good point.

299
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,160
I always told my son

300
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,120
that life is short.

301
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,040
But I thought

302
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,400
there was still plenty of time,

303
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,440
endless days ahead.

304
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,640
There are so many things

305
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,700
I never got to experience with my son.

306
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,440
Like what?

307
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,840
Dancing together in the square,

308
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,100
sitting here watching crosstalk shows,

309
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,320
traveling together.

310
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,100
The last time I took him traveling

311
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,120
was when he was thirteen,

312
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,920
to Longtan Lake Park.

313
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,040
Zhou Tong

314
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,160
would dance with you.

315
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,560
Guanwang,

316
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,840
let's

317
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,920
not dwell

318
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,720
on these

319
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,080
pointless thoughts.

320
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,400
What's the use?

321
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,500
Don't think about it anymore.

322
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,200
You know, this kid,

323
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,080
in the end,

324
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,360
he didn't even

325
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,240
get to marry.

326
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,300
He just left us.

327
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,440
Xiaomi

328
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,810
went to Hangzhou today,

329
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,200
she's with Aunt Gang,

330
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
maybe she'll bring Yaoyao back.

331
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,570
How is your child doing?

332
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,160
Not too well,

333
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,600
a living person,

334
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,800
gone just like that,

335
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,680
she's still in shock.

336
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,920
Many things

337
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,050
have warning signs.

338
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,760
The day Zhou Tong left,

339
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,720
he told me

340
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,170
that I should find a companion.

341
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,460
He said you were great.

342
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,480
I thought,

343
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,200
this kid

344
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,490
has matured after his breakup,

345
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,610
he knows how to care for others now.

346
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,320
He said for this,

347
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,160
we should thank Xiaoyao.

348
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,040
Guanwang,

349
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,120
hearing you say that

350
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,800
makes me

351
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,960
quite emotional.

352
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,680
Mr. Qiao.

353
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,120
Finally found you.

354
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,170
What do you want, Dengzhao?

355
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,040
Mr. Qiao.

356
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,920
The money for your private event last time,

357
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,520
you must have forgotten in your busy schedule.

358
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Haven't paid yet?

359
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Important people tend to forget things.

360
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,640
I haven't.

361
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,240
I'm discussing business now,

362
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,300
I'll pay you later.

363
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,400
Move aside.

364
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,440
Carry on then.

365
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,120
Two people

366
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,640
We still have to perform with just two people.

367
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,360
Didn't we manage with just one person yesterday?

368
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Let's just make do with what we have.

369
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,960
It's our livelihood after all.

370
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,220
Talk about bad timing.

371
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,520
Go on,

372
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,640
continue where you left off.

373
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
I think you're a really nice person.

374
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,120
Being with you feels comfortable,

375
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,040
not exhausting at all.

376
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,500
Really?

377
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
But if we were to be together,

378
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,380
that would be exhausting.

379
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,400
Why?

380
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,000
Because we've already established what we are:

381
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,530
buddies,

382
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,440
friends.

383
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,600
You can't change the nature of our relationship

384
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,330
just because I'm feeling down.

385
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,760
That wouldn't be right.

386
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,880
As the saying goes,

387
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,640
I couldn't do something like that.

388
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,280
people always aim higher.

389
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,040
Water flows downhill.

390
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,520
Right.

391
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,720
Even a clever wife

392
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,760
can't make porridge without rice.

393
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,160
Exactly.

394
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,560
You understand this principle perfectly well,

395
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,760
I have nothing to hide.

396
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,480
Everyone knows

397
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,900
we're not the type to stir up trouble.

398
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,160
I think you're quite the troublemaker.

399
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,970
How did we get off track?

400
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,800
We've settled our relationship,

401
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,920
but we can't ignore

402
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,130
my son's dying wish.

403
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,280
How about I find you a companion?

404
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,440
I'm well-connected,

405
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,140
know my way around,

406
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,640
and I know

407
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,930
quite a few handsome older gentlemen.

408
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,620
Actually, there's someone ready right now.

409
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,650
Auntie Gang,

410
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,560
what do you think about Zhao Gang?

411
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,320
You really are a true friend,

412
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,200
reliable.

413
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,680
Once we're defined as friends,

414
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,340
we'll be friends till the end,

415
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,560
unwavering for a hundred years.

416
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,960
As they say,

417
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,360
life is precious,

418
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,160
love is even more valuable.

419
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,480
Yes,

420
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,040
but for freedom's sake,

421
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,520
both can be cast aside.

422
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,220
What nonsense is this?

423
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,720
You're making me sleepy.

424
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,040
What did you eat last night

425
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,360
to come up with all this stuff?

426
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,240
What did I eat?

427
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,000
This is

428
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,320
a case of once or twice,

429
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,980
but never three or four times.

430
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,720
Cousins are family through generations,

431
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,520
even with broken bones, blood ties remain.

432
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,800
Yes.

433
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,600
You two.

434
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,600
While we were talking,

435
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,330
he just left.

436
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,370
He's about to leave.

437
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,280
It's just that his departure was quite sudden.

438
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,080
Suddenly

439
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,450
what do you want me to do?

440
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,400
What can I do

441
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,730
to put your mind at ease?

442
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,160
Don't bother.

443
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,920
A clear conscience

444
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,050
gives peace of mind.

445
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,880
As long as you're happy,

446
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,000
that's all that matters.

447
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,800
You're quite the smooth talker.

448
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,640
Everything was fine,

449
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,840
and now my son is gone.

450
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,900
You're hurting more than I am.

451
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,400
Why are you getting upset again?

452
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,600
Can't you get over this small matter?

453
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
I can absolutely get over it,

454
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
I've seen it all.

455
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,680
The issue itself isn't important,

456
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,080
what matters is which things have meaning.

457
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,200
Brother Gang,

458
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,280
are you really going to Hangzhou?

459
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,760
You're really concerned about that, huh?

460
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,160
Are you still not over it?

461
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,120
All right.

462
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,040
What I mean is

463
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,160
I just took a photo with him yesterday,

464
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,220
how could he leave so suddenly today?

465
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,330
The higher-ups asked him to step back.

466
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,480
Yang Yun wants to produce a new play.

467
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,410
He won't give up.

468
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,800
He insists on bringing Yaoyao

469
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,440
back

470
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,730
to perform 'The Legend of the White Snake' again.

471
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,280
I'm quite worried

472
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,540
about that kid Yaoyao.

473
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,690
We really shouldn't have ignored her.

474
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,580
That kid has lost her mind.

475
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,780
What happened?

476
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,720
She said she saw

477
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,980
Zhou Tong in Hangzhou.

478
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,340
In broad daylight,

479
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,160
on the street,

480
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,640
she told me

481
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
about someone who looks exactly like Zhou Tong

482
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,400
named

483
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,040
Xu Tian.

484
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,200
What a coincidence.

485
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,720
I've met this kid Xu Tian before.

486
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,720
The day Zhou Tong had his accident,

487
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,780
he came to our home.

488
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,170
He looks very similar to my son.

489
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,500
I actually mistook him for my son.

490
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Isn't he in Hangzhou?

491
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,090
He came to Beijing once.

492
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,640
You never mentioned that before.

493
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,370
Who would've thought they'd run into each other?

494
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,520
It's not like I'm not paying.

495
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,920
It's just a small amount.

496
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Give me some time.

497
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,280
Mr. Qiao,

498
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,440
a big boss like you

499
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,960
still needs time?

500
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,160
I'll take my time if I want to.

501
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,360
I'm not in a good mood.

502
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:41,890
Fine.

503
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,020
Take your time.

504
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,040
Hello.

505
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm here

506
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,370
to pick up a ring.

507
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Please follow me.

508
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,970
Get Mr. Xu's ring for me.

509
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,480
No, not there.

510
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,160
It's here.

511
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,240
Mr. Xu,

512
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,960
your ring.

513
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,080
Thank you.

514
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,840
Where is the girl

515
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,960
who dropped off the ring?

516
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,600
She just left.

517
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,400
She said you'd come to pick it up.

518
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,280
Excuse me,

519
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,740
I'd like to ask something.

520
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,080
Is the other ring

521
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,920
from the pair

522
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,440
that my girlfriend bought

523
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,970
last time still available?

524
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:44,960
Just a moment,

525
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,560
yes, it is.

526
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,060
Here you go.

527
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,880
Can I return

528
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,280
this one

529
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,920
and get that one instead?

530
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,540
This one is expensive.

531
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,560
I know.

532
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,380
Refunds are really troublesome.

533
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,260
Otherwise,

534
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,480
you could choose another pair,

535
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,010
and pick out a necklace too.

536
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,960
I don't need two.

537
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,100
How about this,

538
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,800
these rings

539
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,920
can be made into

540
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,250
a custom design for you.

541
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,720
We can turn your love story

542
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,560
into

543
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,960
a lifetime keepsake.

544
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,680
And with our custom package,

545
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,960
you'll also receive

546
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,200
a lifetime promise token,

547
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
symbolizing that your love

548
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
will last forever.

549
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,580
That sounds romantic.

550
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,690
Would you like to buy a balloon?

551
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,520
I'll do it myself.

552
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,120
Thank you.

553
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,330
Does it fit well?

554
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,880
It's perfect.

555
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,090
Let me wrap it up for you.

556
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:56,880
No need,

557
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,480
thank you.

558
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Take care, Mr. Xu.

559
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,120
It was a pleasure

560
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,720
providing you with personalized service.

561
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,050
Okay,

562
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,520
thank you,

563
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,050
goodbye.

564
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,720
Diamond rings are expensive, aren't they?

565
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,800
Yes, they are expensive,

566
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,920
but it's a once-in-a-lifetime purchase.

567
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,450
However,

568
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,160
Diandian prefers something less expensive.

569
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,680
So

570
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,770
I exchanged them for another pair.

571
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,690
Found what was lost.

572
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,180
How should I repay you?

573
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,900
You tell me.

574
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,330
Let me think.

575
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,480
You've been

576
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,800
hanging around

577
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,490
since you delivered the rings.

578
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,880
Life is unpredictable,

579
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,480
it's all about perspective.

580
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,240
When you lose something you want,

581
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,500
that's impermanence.

582
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,480
When you lose something you don't want,

583
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,740
that's just ordinary.

584
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,520
When you desperately want something

585
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,360
that was never yours to begin with,

586
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,290
every day becomes unpredictable.

587
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,880
No two leaves in the world are identical,

588
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,180
and no two people are the same.

589
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,360
Who said that?

590
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,520
Zhou Tong.

591
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,000
He and I are exactly the same.

592
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,800
I don't even know

593
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,060
why I came to Hangzhou.

594
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,760
I have no family here.

595
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,960
My mother's grave isn't here either.

596
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,640
Why did you

597
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,170
break up with Zhou Tong?

598
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,020
I didn't want to break up with him either.

599
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,200
I can see

600
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,120
you're

601
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,650
quite upset.

602
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,250
Can you take photos?

603
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,600
I can take some with my phone.

604
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,800
He's a professional.

605
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,360
Then he must take beautiful photos.

606
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,160
Would you like

607
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,780
to see them?

608
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,890
Yes, I would.

609
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,080
I can't take good photos,

610
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,540
you try.

611
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,680
Life is impermanent.

612
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,370
Actually, impermanence means

613
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,000
nothing stays the same.

614
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,800
Who said that?

615
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,480
Zhou Tong.

616
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,530
That's so profound.

617
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,700
Here's your ring back.

618
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,440
Can you take me to see

619
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,700
the theater where my mom used to perform?

620
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,560
I can,

621
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:02,960
but

622
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
there haven't been any performances there for a long time.

623
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,490
I just want to see it.

624
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,400
Let's go then,

625
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,540
it's going to rain again soon.

626
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
You don't want it?

627
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,820
No matter where it drifts,

628
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,300
it's always alone anyway.

629
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,280
Zhou Tong.

630
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,160
What kind of person is he?

631
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
What does he like?

632
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,450
Does his voice sound like mine?

633
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Peach leaves so pointed at the tip,

634
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,600
willow leaves covering the entire sky.

635
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,450
That's how it is.

636
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,320
What?

637
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,610
He loves to sing.

638
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,650
Let's go.

639
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,730
Wen Xiaoyao.

640
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,900
Let's get off at the next stop.

641
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,960
This is the theater.

642
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,140
The theater is inside.

643
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,570
It's been a cultural center for over 20 years now.

644
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,320
Let's use the side entrance.

645
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,199
Such bright sunshine,

646
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,530
why is it still raining?

647
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,480
Does this happen in Beijing too?

648
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,080
Rarely.

649
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,080
Wait here for me

650
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,770
while I go check inside.

651
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,920
Thanks.

652
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,690
Wen Xiaoyao.

653
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,520
There's a way

654
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,040
to get in

655
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,680
through there,

656
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,610
no one's around.

657
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,260
Come on.

658
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,690
This way,

659
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,400
follow me.

660
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,610
Hurry up.

661
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,900
I came here about five or six years ago

662
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,960
and it didn't look like this.

663
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,600
It's probably

664
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,330
going to be demolished.

665
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,400
No one's here.

666
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,640
It's Sunday.

667
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,810
We should head back.

668
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,180
Look, this room

669
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,880
must have been

670
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,360
your mother's

671
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,760
dressing room back then.

672
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,280
There's no way through here.

673
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,880
This is backstage,

674
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,000
and further in

675
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,880
is the side stage.

676
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,320
I found

677
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,640
a power switch.

678
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,600
Back then,

679
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,160
your mom and I

680
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,560
took a photo

681
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,400
in the dressing room.

682
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,500
Maybe you were already

683
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
in that photo.

684
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
When it happened,

685
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,170
I was asleep.

686
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
What happened?

687
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,980
The flooding of Golden Mountain Temple.

688
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,560
The pregnant White Snake

689
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
fainted on stage,

690
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,700
it was a real faint.

691
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,120
Why didn't you

692
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,680
come to my performance?

693
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,090
Will you perform again?

694
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,480
No, I won't.

695
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,280
Why?

696
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,850
Did Zhou Tong

697
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,080
ever see

698
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,600
you play White Snake?

699
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,320
No.

700
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,800
Are we good?

701
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,280
Do that part

702
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,800
again

703
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,320
by itself.

704
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,060
Thanks.

705
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,260
Wait for me.

706
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,260
Hurry up! Hurry up!

707
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,180
I need to turn on the power.

708
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,120
The fire safety office is coming for inspection.

709
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,520
Move it! Move it! Move it!

710
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,930
Let's go! Hurry!

711
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:00,940
Come on!

712
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,600
Mom

713
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,560
What should I

714
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,360
do now?

715
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,920
Mom

716
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,080
I'm a bit tired,

717
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,880
I'm leaving now.

718
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,820
Pool Hall Owner

719
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,900
