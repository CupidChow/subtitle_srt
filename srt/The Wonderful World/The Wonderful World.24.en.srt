1
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,320
Xiaomi.

2
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,729
I'm planning to start over,

3
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,570
keeping Zhou Tong in my heart and living well.

4
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,060
Starting as a background dancer is fine too.

5
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,680
Don't be mad at me.

6
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,040
I've never been mad at you.

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm not good.

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm not good.

9
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,090
Let's stop arguing,

10
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,130
we're still the same as before.

11
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,039
Which 'before' are you talking about?

12
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,400
Practicing together,

13
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,600
going home together.

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,560
Where did you go this morning?

15
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,040
Sister Yun wanted to try the partner dance moves with you,

16
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,370
but when she turned around, you were gone.

17
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,010
I went to the Great Wall.

18
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,400
All by yourself so early in the morning?

19
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I ran into Xu Tian.

20
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,079
If it weren't for him,

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,760
you wouldn't be seeing me right now.

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,960
What do you mean?

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,280
Am I stupid?

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,700
Don't tell me it's because

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,960
he looks like Zhou Tong,

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,640
and you're planning to hook up with him?

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,170
How could that be possible!

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,240
Xu Tian saved you?

29
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,880
Well...

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,120
So Xu Tian is your savior.

31
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
I'll do anything for him from now on,

32
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,810
starting right now.

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Okay.

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,680
His girlfriend is coming to Beijing tomorrow.

35
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,720
Let's help them

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,860
get back together.

37
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,010
What do you mean?

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,250
Will you help or not?

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
I said I'd do anything,

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,480
but...

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,960
Sister Diandian,

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,680
something's wrong.

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,560
I just

44
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,170
saw him at the entrance.

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,959
Now I understand

46
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,640
what's going on between you and Zhou Tong.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
I was being silly.

48
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
So embarrassing.

49
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,480
What's his name?

50
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
Little Ears.

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,040
How long have you been together?

52
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
We're not together.

53
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,080
I picked him up in Hangzhou.

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,560
Did he bring you

55
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,159
to this place?

56
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,920
Fine.

57
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,880
I admit now,

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,040
I never expected

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,260
that I would

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,100
be caught by someone like him.

61
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,450
Isn't that good?

62
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
His temper...

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
His temper is bad.

64
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,760
In the future, whoever...

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,610
It'll be for a lifetime.

66
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,180
You're already thinking about forever.

67
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm so disappointed in myself.

68
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,880
You little punk.

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
Zhao Gang, I've realized you're such a hypocrite.

70
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,250
I introduced Song Guanwang to you,

71
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,610
and you pretended to be reluctant,

72
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,159
but secretly put on cologne at home.

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,450
Stop the car.

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Do I still need to beg you or what?

75
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,360
Stop the car. I'll walk back myself.

76
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,690
Go ahead, jump out then.

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Get out of the car.

78
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,120
Do I always have to convince you?

79
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,360
This isn't necessary, Lao Qiao.

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,280
You're

81
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,440
forcing me,

82
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,770
and still pretending now that we're here.

83
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,300
Xu Tian,

84
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,200
you've been here before, right?

85
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,680
Yes,

86
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,240
I have.

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,900
You go in first.

88
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,320
I have some personal business with him.

89
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,840
Okay.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,330
Same.

91
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,400
Don't tell me

92
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
you don't like Song Guanwang at all.

93
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,640
Be honest.

94
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
She's clearly yours.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
She belongs to herself.

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,200
Women are independent.

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,260
Don't put on airs when you go in there.

98
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,120
You're just a retired old artist.

99
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,780
This is the best place for you,

100
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,010
and it's rare that Guanwang needs you.

101
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Go up first and say something for me,

102
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
then I'll come up.

103
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,680
You're impossible.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,040
If you start something good,

105
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
you should see it through to the end.

106
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,240
Ms. Fang

107
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,010
has packed everything.

108
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,800
Everything's been gathered,

109
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,840
not a single item can be missing.

110
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,320
Toothpaste, toothbrushes and such things

111
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
should be put back exactly as they were.

112
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,680
All items

113
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,040
must not be replaced with new ones.

114
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
After arriving,

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,120
arrange everything exactly as before.

116
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,400
Oh right,

117
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,200
it's getting colder these days.

118
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,690
Bring cold medicine

119
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,080
to prevent catching a cold.

120
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,480
Got it.

121
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,930
I've already found a place in Beijing.

122
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,120
After getting the keys,

123
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,440
give them to Wen Xiaoyao.

124
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
I'll call her in a bit.

125
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,610
How is Diandian?

126
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,040
Xiaoyue will arrive in Beijing tonight.

127
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,960
We'll bring Diandian's things over first,

128
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,000
and arrange the accommodation tomorrow.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,730
She still doesn't remember me?

130
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,040
When you meet in Beijing,

131
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,640
be careful with what you say,

132
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,480
don't mention anything about your past together.

133
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,580
What should I say then?

134
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,720
Act like you've just met.

135
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,340
Take off your ring,

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,360
she's already removed hers.

137
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
He's waiting in the car downstairs.

138
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,880
He's too embarrassed to come up.

139
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
I've delivered the message.

140
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
I've brought the person too.

141
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,360
I've done right by heaven,

142
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
by my bros, and by you.

143
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,300
Zhao Gang and his awful attitude,

144
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
you should know him better than I do.

145
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,010
He acts all high and mighty,

146
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
but deep down he's just trash.

147
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,440
Ambitions as high as the sky, fate as thin as paper.

148
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,480
Pretty pitiful, really.

149
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,320
Sometimes,

150
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,600
I really want to give him a good beating.

151
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,360
He talks tough,

152
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,730
but deep down he's totally into it.

153
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,970
Where's Xu Tian?

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,660
Why didn't he come?

155
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,840
He did come up.

156
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,730
I want to see Xu Tian,

157
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,680
not Zhao Gang.

158
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,480
Fine.

159
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,780
While you're at it,

160
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,360
you can see Zhao Gang too.

161
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,500
You two are both people with dignity,

162
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,410
while I'm just a workhorse.

163
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,680
If that's all, I'll be going now.

164
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,900
Qiao Guanghui,

165
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,520
how did you become this kind of person?

166
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,850
What kind of person am I?

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,160
You're incredibly loyal,

168
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,120
willing to take a knife for your friends,

169
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,080
swallowing your broken teeth without complaint.

170
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,880
Actually, there are many idioms

171
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,210
that could describe me.

172
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:22,840
No,

173
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,580
what are you really trying to say?

174
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,800
Are you crazy?

175
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,280
I feel like I've got a terminal illness now.

176
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,620
I'll handle it myself.

177
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,280
So you don't need me anymore?

178
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
You should go now,

179
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,570
go treat those terminal patients.

180
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,540
Don't pretend,

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,280
don't hurt Guanwang,

182
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,680
got it?

183
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,540
Can you really sit comfortably here?

184
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,720
These days,

185
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,210
wherever I sit, it's half my life gone.

186
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,970
You're here.

187
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,920
Mrs. Song.

188
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,560
Why didn't you come upstairs?

189
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,160
I was just

190
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,680
about to say hello

191
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,840
to you,

192
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,320
but

193
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,740
I need to leave now.

194
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,360
Why?

195
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,000
My girlfriend is

196
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,160
coming to Beijing tomorrow.

197
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,090
The door on the third floor is open.

198
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,080
Zhou Tong's room is open too.

199
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,800
Why don't you go up first,

200
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
I'll come up to talk with you in a bit,

201
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,480
okay?

202
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,600
Good.

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,530
Go ahead.

204
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,880
Go get a glass of water

205
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,300
for Mr. Qiao in the car.

206
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,040
Okay.

207
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
What's wrong?

208
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,420
Are you crying?

209
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,440
Just pretend your brother Zhou Tong has come back.

210
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,120
You know, we're quite lucky,

211
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,480
that in this world

212
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,640
there's someone who looks exactly the same,

213
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,570
giving us a chance to see him again.

214
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,140
What a strange situation.

215
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,440
Can you not touch my computer?

216
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,500
I'm talking to you,

217
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,250
just let me rest for a while.

218
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,360
The computer is still on.

219
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,560
The phone is charging

220
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,940
and none of his things have been touched.

221
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,200
But if you want to check them,

222
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,730
go ahead.

223
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,340
It's unlocked.

224
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,080
When you're not here,

225
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,280
the phone is useless.

226
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,800
Once you leave,

227
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,260
it becomes useless again.

228
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,250
How long does it take

229
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,240
for this phone to lock itself?

230
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,650
If you keep using it,

231
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,240
it won't lock.

232
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
It's okay, ma'am.

233
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,960
Feel free to check whatever you want.

234
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,020
I'll be right here.

235
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,960
I don't really want to check anything,

236
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,420
just wanted to take a look.

237
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,340
This is you, right?

238
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,240
Yes.

239
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,530
Please, have a seat,

240
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,170
sit down.

241
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Thank you, ma'am.

242
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,080
Mrs. Song,

243
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,600
I came here...

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,920
are you

245
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,720
feeling upset?

246
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,760
Tell me a joke

247
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,640
to cheer me up and I won't be sad anymore.

248
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,360
But I

249
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
don't really know how to tell jokes.

250
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,410
When I was in school,

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,760
my dream

252
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,220
was to become a scientist.

253
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,050
Later I found out

254
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,340
some people

255
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,740
wanted to be painters,

256
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,360
and others

257
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
wanted to be writers.

258
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,880
Dian Dian's dream

259
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,880
was to start a family with me.

260
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,720
When she told me that,

261
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,770
I was very happy.

262
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,080
Is it appropriate

263
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,780
for you to tell me all this?

264
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,040
You know,

265
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,800
you're nothing like Zhou Tong.

266
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
You're much more awkward than him.

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,130
He could convince you black was white.

268
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,080
Just a moment.

269
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,940
What are you doing?

270
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,840
I really

271
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
don't understand why

272
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,000
I have to sit

273
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,080
downstairs waiting.

274
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,520
Then do you know

275
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,120
why you're wearing perfume?

276
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,079
Go downstairs and think about it.

277
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,940
Let me know when you figure it out.

278
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,960
When are you planning

279
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,420
to marry your girlfriend?

280
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,849
It was supposed to be

281
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,540
this month,

282
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,079
but

283
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,880
now I'm not sure.

284
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:27,800
Why?

285
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,970
Diandian has forgotten me.

286
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,640
But

287
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,770
she's coming

288
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,200
to Beijing tomorrow too.

289
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,840
I came to Beijing

290
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,760
to give a qipao

291
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,280
to Wen Xiaoyao.

292
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,720
And

293
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
I also have a photo

294
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,280
to show her.

295
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,960
In that photo,

296
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,080
there's me as a child,

297
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,480
my mother,

298
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
and her mother,

299
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,940
Teacher Jia Sulan.

300
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,240
Then

301
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,410
I wanted to come see you,

302
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,040
chat for a while.

303
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,160
I've always felt that

304
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,920
Zhou Tong is like family.

305
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,520
After that,

306
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,560
I'll go back to Hangzhou.

307
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,500
That's good thinking.

308
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,560
But Diandian

309
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,960
is quite obsessive and extreme.

310
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,520
Her last relationship didn't end well,

311
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,610
she got sick.

312
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,120
What kind of illness?

313
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,540
Episodic amnesia.

314
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,560
It's her subconscious

315
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,020
protecting her from pain.

316
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,640
I looked it up online,

317
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,560
it's related to

318
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,160
childhood experiences.

319
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,490
If she's forgotten you,

320
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
why is she coming to Beijing?

321
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,010
To find Wen Xiaoyao.

322
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,180
To find her?

323
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,520
The day before I came to Beijing,

324
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,320
the last person she saw

325
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,250
was Wen Xiaoyao.

326
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,560
This is really quite messy.

327
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,280
But

328
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,880
don't worry about it.

329
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,400
Maybe

330
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,600
it's all for the best.

331
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,360
How could this be a good thing?

332
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,440
As long as you're alive

333
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,300
and breathing,

334
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
it's a good thing.

335
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,560
If you can eat, drink,

336
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,280
walk around and jump about,

337
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,410
there's nothing bad in this world.

338
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,640
You're just like Uncle Qiao.

339
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,040
Thank you.

340
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,960
Thirty-five.

341
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,400
You want money?

342
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,770
Keep the change.

343
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,480
I'll go upstairs to see if your boss Song

344
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
is talking with Master Zhao

345
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,120
or with Xu Tian.

346
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,480
Her name is Diandian, right?

347
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,720
Shi Diandian.

348
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,200
Could you live without her

349
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,920
in the future?

350
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,680
I promised

351
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,490
to treat her well

352
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,700
for a lifetime.

353
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,320
Promises don't work,

354
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,580
people go back on their word all the time.

355
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,040
Ask yourself,

356
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,770
without her,

357
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
does it hurt here?

358
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,650
It hurts.

359
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,980
She forgot you to avoid getting hurt,

360
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
which means you've hurt her before.

361
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,720
I

362
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,780
never did that.

363
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,220
It's in her subconscious,

364
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,300
so it happened.

365
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,200
Her issues,

366
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,820
you should accommodate them.

367
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,200
Starting over now

368
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,530
will be good for you too.

369
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,720
Here's what we'll do:

370
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,640
bring her here,

371
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,340
tell her I'm your aunt,

372
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,600
I'll help you.

373
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,920
But if she comes here,

374
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,880
what if she remembers...

375
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,080
She doesn't like you,

376
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,880
is that it?

377
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,040
Yes.

378
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,440
If she remembers,

379
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,920
she'll naturally continue to like you.

380
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,130
Auntie Song,

381
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,080
how can you

382
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,640
be so strong?

383
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,240
From the moment we're born,

384
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,570
we have to look forward,

385
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,680
love those around us,

386
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,560
and they love us back.

387
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,840
But as we go along,

388
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,010
we get confused.

389
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Actually,

390
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,810
we still need to look ahead.

391
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,930
Trying to be strong is exhausting,

392
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,880
but seeing things clearly

393
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,970
makes it easier.

394
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,200
So,

395
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,320
Auntie, what do you think

396
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I should do

397
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,840
to start over?

398
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,720
You should learn from Zhou Tong.

399
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,800
Turn

400
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,360
black

401
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,520
into white?

402
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,160
Making something white and saying it's white

403
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,420
are not the same thing.

404
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,380
He's reserved,

405
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,080
seems unimpressed by everything.

406
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
But actually, he notices everything,

407
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,810
he's filial,

408
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,370
willing to suffer himself.

409
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,130
The more upsetting things are,

410
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,480
the more casually he talks about them.

411
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,120
I don't know if he's comforting himself

412
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,440
or comforting others.

413
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,120
Without him in this house,

414
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,540
it really feels empty.

415
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,360
He was so lazy.

416
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Now it's better,

417
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,780
no need to clean up.

418
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,370
Auntie Song,

419
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,120
I'll come

420
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,450
to see you often from now on.

421
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,440
Why do you come here so often?

422
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,940
Are you staying

423
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,820
in Beijing now?

424
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,130
Could you help me

425
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,840
with this phone again?

426
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,160
How can I keep it from locking?

427
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,320
Listen to some music.

428
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,520
So it won't lock this way?

429
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,820
It will still lock,

430
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,620
but as long as it has power,

431
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,800
the music will keep playing.

432
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,940
Uncle Qiao.

433
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,330
Starting tomorrow,

434
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,450
I've decided

435
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
to change myself.

436
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,900
And with Diandian,

437
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,760
start over.

438
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,840
Was Song Guanwang

439
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
chatting with you

440
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,920
upstairs just now?

441
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,780
What about now?

442
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,930
So Qiao Guanghui tells you to come and you just do?

443
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,400
And you're even wearing cologne.

444
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
I didn't expect to be dismissed so quickly.

445
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,640
No one in the dance troupe

446
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,050
will even talk to me.

447
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,240
I can't stand

448
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,680
being at home either.

449
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,760
I don't dare

450
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,370
go to the office.

451
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,420
So I came to your place.

452
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
It feels a bit comforting.

453
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,560
Came looking for comfort, huh?

454
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,960
I know this isn't right.

455
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,290
Why is no one talking to you?

456
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,320
Aren't they all your students?

457
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,680
They've all moved up in the world.

458
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,960
Success should come with respect for elders.

459
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,320
It was the leadership's decision.

460
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,050
Leaders decide the big things,

461
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,180
but the younger ones should know better.

462
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,380
Did you really tell Qiao Guanghui

463
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,770
that you like me?

464
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,040
I did.

465
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,880
Come on,

466
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,730
don't give me that sleazy look.

467
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,960
Did you even think it through?

468
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,220
My brain is all used up for creative work.

469
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,120
Human love

470
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,700
is my strength.

471
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,860
Just because I told Qiao Guanghui

472
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,260
doesn't mean it's actually true.

473
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
I was using you to get back at him.

474
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,840
Why?

475
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,960
He can't say anything decent,

476
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,920
always beating around the bush with me.

477
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,360
When he advances, I retreat.

478
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,290
Just when I start being nice to him,

479
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,800
he brings you into it.

480
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,970
So you two play your tactical games

481
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,440
and use me as your weapon.

482
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
You want to be used like that?

483
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,900
Look at me, such a pure person,

484
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,000
I treat you as a friend and him as a buddy.

485
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
Everything you two forced me to do,

486
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,610
tell me which one I didn't accomplish.

487
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,200
I've been carrying so much on my shoulders,

488
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,240
have some conscience, will you?

489
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,800
Zhao Gang.

490
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,800
How tragic.

491
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,480
I may want to,

492
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,660
but I can't keep letting you work so hard.

493
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,000
It's in the same complex as Wen Xiaoyao's,

494
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,840
the one-bedroom is gone,

495
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,040
there's only a small two-bedroom left.

496
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,920
Two-bedroom.

497
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,770
We had to close off one room,

498
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,760
and all of Diandian's things

499
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,690
are arranged exactly as they were.

500
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,090
Tell Wen Xiaoyao

501
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,940
that the key

502
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,840
should be kept in her large bag

503
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,300
together with her wallet.

504
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,840
I've put a fake one in there now.

505
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,240
Okay.

506
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
Are you finished?

507
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,920
Yes, done.

508
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,900
It's quite smooth.

509
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,760
Our

510
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,000
six-layer treatment shampoo

511
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,240
deeply nourishes your hair

512
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,840
and gives it a natural shine.

513
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,450
I'll pay for you.

514
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,120
How much is it?

515
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,560
Hello,

516
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,040
your total today is 398 yuan.

517
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,170
I'll scan your code.

518
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,370
What time

519
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,600
is her flight?

520
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,720
Takes off at 11:15

521
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,880
and arrives in Beijing at 1:20.

522
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,610
I'll go pick up Diandian later.

523
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,920
Are you nervous?

524
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,160
Is this condition even real?

525
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,400
She just doesn't remember anything,

526
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,640
even face to face,

527
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,080
that's intense.

528
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,080
Last night,

529
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,200
I went through

530
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,480
every single moment since I first met Diandian

531
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,240
until now,

532
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,760
everything we experienced together,

533
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,800
I thought about it all carefully.

534
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,530
Thinking so much is pointless.

535
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,960
She deleted you,

536
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,810
probably cleared everything,

537
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,160
because she doesn't want to remember

538
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,090
anything between you two anymore.

539
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,960
That's why.

540
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,000
You need to be a new person,

541
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,520
and treat her as someone new too.

542
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,340
Simply put, she didn't like who you were before.

543
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,080
Xiaomi and I will

544
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,680
arrange for you two to meet,

545
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,960
and you can catch her attention.

546
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,880
Just pretend

547
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,280
you're meeting for the first time.

548
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,760
Make her like you,

549
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,850
treat Diandian as someone new,

550
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,940
and become someone new yourself.

551
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,960
Why are you sighing?

552
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,080
This is just dating,

553
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
it's so simple,

554
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,440
and you already know each other,

555
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,760
getting a second chance with the same person.

556
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
How lucky you are, Zhou Butong...

557
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,680
I mean,

558
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,080
Xu Tian.

559
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,940
What if I were Zhou Tong, how would he act?

560
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Are you stupid?

561
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,880
Is your brain slow or something?

562
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,210
Someone like you still pursuing love?

563
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,180
Embarrassing.

564
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,080
Dying alone is more your style,

565
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,400
or wandering aimlessly,

566
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,660
until you develop some issues yourself.

567
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,880
What?

568
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
What do you mean?

569
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,640
That's how Zhou Tong talks.

570
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,360
He says one thing but means another.

571
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,240
How so?

572
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,040
He likes someone in his heart

573
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,480
but won't admit it with his mouth.

574
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,880
All over the place,

575
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,010
mixing everything up nonsensically.

576
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,920
Like what?

577
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,740
We go on a date to a hot pot restaurant,

578
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,740
and he lectures you about how to make hot pot.

579
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,960
At a comedy show,

580
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,480
he walks out

581
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
and bangs his head on a pillar,

582
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,580
knocking himself out.

583
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,400
He promises to attend my debut performance,

584
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,130
then goes to Malaysia instead.

585
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,080
He just

586
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,400
pretends

587
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,180
not to care,

588
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,010
when he actually cares deeply.

589
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,320
I understand.

590
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,560
Xiaoyao,

591
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,810
I'm bringing you Diandian's keys.

592
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm almost there.

593
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,480
Sister Xiaoyue is coming with the keys.

594
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,610
When did you last return from Beijing,

595
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,050
do you remember?

596
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
When did you quit your job in Ningbo?

597
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,000
Before going to Beijing.

598
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,000
You'll have to rely on Wen Xiaoyao in Beijing.

599
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,130
I can rely on myself.

600
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,000
Mom,

601
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,560
did I forget things again?

602
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,580
You'll remember soon.

603
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,520
When you get to Park Avenue,

604
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,400
call me.

605
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,520
Park Avenue,

606
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,280
got it.

607
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,560
Building One,

608
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,890
apartment 2109.

609
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,200
I know.

610
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,240
I've transferred the money to you.

611
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,900
What money?

612
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,800
For your hair appointment.

613
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,360
You don't need to spend a penny on me.

614
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,440
You've already taken care of me so much,

615
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
I have my savings.

616
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,730
I dropped the house key.

617
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
Mom, I'm leaving.

618
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,960
You should get in the car now.

619
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,560
Medicine.

620
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,200
Take this twice a day.

621
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,720
You'll be away on this business trip for a while.

622
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,400
Cold medicine,

623
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,460
I packed it for you.

624
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,160
Thanks, Mom.

625
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,240
Your birthday is coming up in a few days,

626
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,900
on the 19th.

627
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,640
I didn't even remember it myself.

628
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,100
Days just blend together,

629
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,560
no wonder you forgot.

630
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,980
I'm going now, Mom.

631
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,340
Beijing's weather

632
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,450
is always like this.

633
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,960
It rains often in Hangzhou.

634
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
It's rained twice this year.

635
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,920
The first time

636
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,720
had something to do with Zhou Tong.

637
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,580
The second time

638
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,920
had something to do with you.

639
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,640
There are many types of rain.

640
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,840
Sometimes

641
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,290
it even rains fish from the sky.

642
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,010
Fish from the water.

643
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,080
The weather forecast talks about

644
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,740
light rain,

645
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,730
moderate to heavy rain,

646
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,540
rainstorm,

647
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
heavy rainstorm,

648
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,220
severe rainstorm.

649
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,240
Light rain has precipitation

650
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,840
of less than 10 millimeters.

651
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,240
Moderate rain has precipitation

652
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,970
between 10 and 25 millimeters.

653
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,520
Heavy rain has precipitation

654
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,480
between 25

655
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,770
and 50 millimeters.

656
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,520
How do you know so much?

657
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
When I was little,

658
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,920
I used to brew Chinese medicine for my mom.

659
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,520
Cloudy days

660
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,160
required different prescriptions than sunny days.

661
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,640
So

662
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,450
I had to check the weather forecast every day.

663
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,560
You didn't use to talk this much.

664
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,050
I'm trying to be like Zhou Tong.

665
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,640
Treating Diandian

666
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,500
as someone new.

667
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,040
I need to become someone new too.

668
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
That's what you all said.

669
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,130
That's nice.

670
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,060
The person you love is still here,

671
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,640
you can start over.

672
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,460
I actually regret it a lot.

673
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,530
That rainy day when I met Zhou Tong,

674
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,140
I didn't invite him upstairs.

675
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,770
Even just for a cup of tea and a chat.

676
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,360
If I had,

677
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,610
I probably wouldn't have come to Beijing.

678
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,610
And you and Zhou Tong

679
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,920
might still be together now.

680
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,100
But that wouldn't be good either.

681
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,850
In that case,

682
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,180
I wouldn't have met Diandian.

683
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,370
Heaven is always like this.

684
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,840
We can never have it all.

685
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,400
You had nothing to do with it.

686
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,210
Whether you came or not,

687
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
my fate with him would have been the same.

688
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,340
That's not necessarily true.

689
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,520
Diandian.

690
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,000
Let me carry that for you.

691
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,600
It's fine.

692
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,520
Thank you.

693
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,000
I forget things sometimes,

694
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,260
it's happened before.

695
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,800
Whenever it happens,

696
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,880
I feel relieved.

697
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,380
But I remember you.

698
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,200
You must be connected

699
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,980
to the things I've forgotten.

700
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,540
Thank you for picking me up today.

701
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,050
Do you have a boyfriend?

702
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,490
Not anymore.

703
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,760
If it's not too much trouble,

704
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,290
I'd prefer we don't meet again.

705
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
I don't want any connection to my past,

706
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,440
not at all.

707
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,960
But you just arrived in Beijing.

708
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
I live in Beijing,

709
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,360
it's quieter on my own.

710
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Let me take you to where you're staying then.

711
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,720
Don't trouble yourself,

712
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,840
I know where I live.

713
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,280
Okay.

714
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,560
It was crowded. I didn't see you.

715
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,400
She's in your care now.

716
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,460
Where are you guys?

717
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,240
I'm heading back to the ballet company.

718
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Diandian said she wants to be alone.

719
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,050
Which way did she go?

720
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,800
East from the subway exit.

721
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,400
Thanks.

722
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,500
Need some help?

723
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,680
What?

724
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,680
The water.

725
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,320
I saw you struggling with it.

726
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,680
Thanks.

727
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,290
I'm not a bad person.

728
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,580
South Asian Driver

729
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,980
Airport Guy
