1
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,360
It'll be about three more minutes

2
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,560
Please wait a moment.

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,860
Don't be angry.

4
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,560
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,780
Watch where you're going.

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,880
Why drink so much if you can't handle alcohol?

7
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,720
Are you okay?

8
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm completely fine.

9
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,680
My flight is at 11 tomorrow morning.

10
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,960
You don't need to see me off.

11
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,680
Sleep in.

12
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,410
I want to see you off.

13
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,600
Director Fang is waiting for you at the hotel.

14
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,800
You should head back.

15
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,850
The door is this way.

16
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,240
No need for keys anymore,

17
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,970
it's a digital lock.

18
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,320
Why?

19
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,050
The day we got to know each other again.

20
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,220
Throw up over here.

21
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,329
You've got to be kidding me,

22
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,180
this is the only old thing I have left.

23
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,440
Diandian,

24
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,890
let's get in the car.

25
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,520
Is he upset?

26
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,280
On such a happy day,

27
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
why would he be upset?

28
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,780
You go up first.

29
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,940
Where's the photo?

30
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,280
What photo?

31
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,530
That one photo I had,

32
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,690
where did you put it?

33
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,880
Diandian?

34
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,920
Everything in the house has been replaced with new things,

35
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,840
we don't need the old stuff anymore.

36
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,040
What about the photo?

37
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,880
I have it.

38
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,440
I'll come get it from you.

39
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,340
Don't touch anything at home.

40
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,140
Give me the car.

41
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,200
Miss, do you have a driver's license?

42
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,000
I have it on me.

43
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,520
Should I inform Mr. Fang about this?

44
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,650
Just give me the car.

45
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
What's the big deal?

46
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
It's just a photo.

47
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,580
I didn't throw it away.

48
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,880
I just put it in the drawer.

49
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,010
You can still take it out and look at it whenever you want.

50
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,020
When you get angry, I get nervous.

51
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,020
Either nervous or scared.

52
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,020
What are you afraid of?

53
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,049
Afraid you'll leave me.

54
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,440
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,220
What did I do wrong?

56
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,260
If you like that photo,

57
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,700
you could have just

58
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,160
left it on the cabinet.

59
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,160
I'm sorry I didn't tell you

60
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,090
about Zhou Tong. That was my fault.

61
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,960
But please try to understand me.

62
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,880
When I saw that photo,

63
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,640
it reminded me of Wen Xiaoyao

64
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,040
and Zhou Tong.

65
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,280
That night,

66
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,360
his blood

67
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,160
was all over both my hands.

68
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,930
I told you to stay home and not move around.

69
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,890
You weren't dizzy earlier.

70
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
You must have caught a chill in the cold wind.

71
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
Let's get in the car quickly.

72
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,880
I wasn't driving the car.

73
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,040
I was driving the car.

74
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,300
Is this helping at all?

75
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,440
Get out first.

76
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,040
Could you please check

77
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,320
the surveillance footage at the north entrance

78
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,760
of Erqing Building on Fengqi Road, license plate 3072-A60,

79
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,960
from ten minutes ago?

80
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,960
My car hadn't arrived yet,

81
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,320
but he was already there.

82
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
The time and camera coverage are clear.

83
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,170
If you have the access code, you can see it right away.

84
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,440
Officer,

85
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,400
I did have some drinks,

86
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,680
but

87
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
I really wasn't the one driving.

88
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,280
Both of you stay in the car,

89
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,000
don't get out.

90
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,320
What if we get lost?

91
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,480
You'll check the security footage anyway.

92
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,960
Still angry?

93
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,700
That photo cannot be touched.

94
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,640
It's in the bedroom nightstand,

95
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,040
below the drawer with light bulbs,

96
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,240
in the second drawer.

97
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,240
From the first drink,

98
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,980
I didn't know what I was thinking,

99
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,650
just kept drinking one after another.

100
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,960
I lost count of how many I had.

101
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,280
You know I never drink.

102
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,040
But today,

103
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,060
I had no choice.

104
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm leaving tomorrow,

105
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,730
so you should go to Beijing.

106
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,700
Is that necessary?

107
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,930
Didn't you say you miss her?

108
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,340
What would I say when I see her?

109
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,770
Take the photo with you,

110
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,170
tell her that's her mother.

111
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,720
You two

112
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,860
were connected by fate over 20 years ago.

113
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,040
Back then, she was probably

114
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,970
still in Teacher Jia Sulan's womb.

115
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
In that photo,

116
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,280
all four of you are there.

117
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Actually, I think

118
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,580
it would be better to draw some blood.

119
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,480
Why?

120
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,250
Once the blood is drawn,

121
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,120
my head will be clear.

122
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,580
Your head isn't clear now?

123
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,920
You've confused me.

124
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,570
I say I'm thinking about Zhou Tong,

125
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,440
but you tell me

126
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
it's Wen Xiaoyao.

127
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,720
You're being ridiculous.

128
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,450
No, you're the ridiculous one.

129
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,920
I'm sorry.

130
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,340
Do you like the ring

131
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,250
on my finger?

132
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,120
I like it.

133
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,050
Are you sure?

134
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
Do you really like it?

135
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,760
Yes, I do.

136
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,570
Then tomorrow I'll return this one

137
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,520
and see

138
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
if they've sold the matching one

139
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,040
for you.

140
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,450
Don't return it.

141
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,840
Mine is cheaper.

142
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,000
Come sit here.

143
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,220
I was harsh to you earlier.

144
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,000
It was because of the alcohol,

145
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
I won't drink anymore.

146
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,660
It's mainly because of me,

147
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
I'm petty.

148
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,930
I'm dying of thirst.

149
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,090
You two are acting like you own this place,

150
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,810
get down.

151
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,140
Come on.

152
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,130
Here,

153
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,380
blow into this.

154
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,400
Me?

155
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,480
You're the driver,

156
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,240
so you need to blow.

157
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,700
Come on.

158
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,530
Push harder.

159
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,660
More hands.

160
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,200
Don't move.

161
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,460
This is you, right?

162
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,800
That's me.

163
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,340
This is you.

164
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,020
So which one isn't you?

165
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,380
They're all me.

166
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,220
Is there any water?

167
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,360
On your right.

168
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,530
Are you feeling better?

169
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,290
Much better.

170
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,760
How much better?

171
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,450
Good enough that

172
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
I can keep sitting

173
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,810
as long as the car keeps moving.

174
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,160
Too bad I have to leave tomorrow,

175
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,690
otherwise we could just keep driving.

176
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,599
You sing

177
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,329
really well.

178
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll take you back to your hotel first,

179
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,460
then I'll take a taxi home.

180
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,920
Tomorrow morning I'll take you to the airport,

181
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,480
and then

182
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,800
I'll go to Leifeng Tower.

183
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,760
Xiaomi,

184
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,160
go to the dance group tomorrow

185
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,040
and take a photo of Shi Diandian's registered phone number

186
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,920
for me.

187
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,120
Why are you looking for her?

188
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,800
Who is she?

189
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,140
I don't know who she is.

190
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I want to ask her why she took Zhou Tong to the hospital.

191
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,680
Why did she come looking for me at the ballet group?

192
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,840
Arrange one for us.

193
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,480
We'd like to take a private photo.

194
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,940
Please arrange one for us.

195
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,940
Please arrange one for us.

196
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,740
Please set it up for us.

197
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,170
This is President Song.

198
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,290
President Song.

199
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,730
Hello, President Song.

200
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,440
Master Zhao is teaching us today

201
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,200
all because of President Song's influence.

202
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,360
Everyone, let's thank President Song.

203
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,000
Thank you, President Song!

204
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
We're so grateful. Thank you!

205
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,760
No need to thank me.

206
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
Come on, let's get in position.

207
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Master Zhao will be here any minute.

208
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,050
What's going on?

209
00:20:59,360 --> 00:20:59,800
Master Zhao called me

210
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,200
last night

211
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,120
to let me know.

212
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,680
Sis,

213
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,340
it hasn't been this lively in two months.

214
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,000
These are Zhou Tong's

215
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,880
towel,

216
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,960
toothpaste and toothbrush.

217
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,970
Should we

218
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,290
throw them away?

219
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,970
It hurts to throw them away.

220
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
But keeping them here

221
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,720
and seeing them hurts even more.

222
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm

223
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,040
hurting too.

224
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,490
Master Zhao is here!

225
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,530
Hello everyone.

226
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Can I go upstairs?

227
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,480
With this kind of reception,

228
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,520
how could I say no?

229
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,840
Hello, Teacher Zhao.

230
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,120
Hello everyone.

231
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,840
Come,

232
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,220
let's take it slow.

233
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,680
Don't push.

234
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,120
Let's stand properly, everyone.

235
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,800
Listen to me,

236
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,960
let's form two rows,

237
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,440
okay?

238
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,570
We'll go up shortly.

239
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,120
Come on, don't rush,

240
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,880
line up one by one,

241
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,740
other children please step back.

242
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,330
Everyone together.

243
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,260
Come on.

244
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,240
Let's take a group photo.

245
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,400
The main thing is,

246
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,360
Manager Song,

247
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
get her over here.

248
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,680
Mr. Song,

249
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,940
Master Zhao is asking for you.

250
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,160
I'm busy.

251
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,240
Master Zhao said

252
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,700
you're the guest of honor.

253
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,240
Come on, Mr. Song.

254
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Come on, Mr. Song.

255
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,960
Come on.

256
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,250
Mr. Song is here!

257
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,480
Come, come over here,

258
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,360
I'll sit with Mr. Song.

259
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,020
Come on,

260
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,960
Tiantian, take

261
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,800
a photo.

262
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,330
Mr. Song.

263
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
Come on, children, stand properly.

264
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
Hello, sir.

265
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,770
Alright,

266
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,040
look this way.

267
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,600
Did Qiao Guanghui force you to do this?

268
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:14,920
Yes.

269
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,320
Not bad,

270
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,570
you've already connected with the girls.

271
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,000
They asked for my number first.

272
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,340
I still have some status in the ballet world.

273
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,600
Fine then,

274
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,880
go ahead with the photos.

275
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,940
I'll stay out of it.

276
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,890
What do you mean 'go ahead'?

277
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,380
You think I want to?

278
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,060
Qiao Guanghui said

279
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,880
you must be happy today.

280
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,330
How conflicted you are.

281
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
It's fine for now.

282
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,640
Right,

283
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,880
couldn't find your dignity

284
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,920
in the ballet world,

285
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,360
so you came to me for it.

286
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,440
Why do you always mock me?

287
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,570
I don't know either.

288
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,400
Come on, everyone look here.

289
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Are you happy?

290
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,240
Yes!

291
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
If you're happy, let's take one more.

292
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,280
Are you happy?

293
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,040
If you're not happy,

294
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,640
then Qiao Guanghui won't be happy,

295
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,520
and I came for nothing.

296
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,920
Two, three!

297
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,160
Cheese!

298
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,220
It's your turn, KLEIN.

299
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm going to Hangzhou tomorrow.

300
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,840
Let's work on both fronts,

301
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,040
the bureau has approved the revival of 'The Legend of White Snake'.

302
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,640
Not bad.

303
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,040
Goodbye, teacher.

304
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,320
Master Zhao will teach here next time,

305
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,560
I'll let you all know.

306
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,320
Alright!

307
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,600
Okay.

308
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,440
In the future,

309
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,100
we can recruit more students.

310
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
And then the price

311
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,040
can be raised a bit too.

312
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,380
Can you move back a step when you talk?

313
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,730
I can only see your head.

314
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,680
I promised them

315
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,340
that I would

316
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,600
teach once a week from now on.

317
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,640
In this plastic bag

318
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,100
are Zhou Tong's toothpaste and toothbrush.

319
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,260
Should we throw them away?

320
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Did you throw away

321
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
the other things?

322
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,640
I'm an artist.

323
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,920
I specialize

324
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,520
in studying human emotions.

325
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,800
Would you like

326
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,440
me to comfort you?

327
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,370
Would you like some tea?

328
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,120
No need,

329
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,400
just a few words

330
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,880
will do,

331
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,440
no tea needed.

332
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,280
Go ahead.

333
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,360
Life

334
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,170
is like morning dew.

335
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
The sun comes out,

336
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,800
enjoy it.

337
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,780
But the sun also makes the dew disappear.

338
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,320
Coming and going

339
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,980
happens in the blink of an eye.

340
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,280
But there is one thing

341
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,210
that is most important.

342
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,520
What?

343
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,960
Faith.

344
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,930
Family, friendship, love,

345
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,560
career,

346
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,240
survival,

347
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,530
all depend on faith.

348
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,880
As long as you have faith,

349
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,640
you won't worry about

350
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,560
these toothbrushes and toothpaste anymore.

351
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,290
Are you done?

352
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,160
The principle is simple,

353
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,640
it's just a matter of when you figure it out.

354
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,050
Have you figured it out?

355
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,180
When did you figure it out?

356
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,160
Back in the day, I was also desperate.

357
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,240
Chang Ying,

358
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,940
Qiao Guanghui must have told you, right?

359
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:54,840
Who?

360
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,560
My love.

361
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,280
For her, I could

362
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,050
go without food,

363
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,300
without sleep,

364
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,960
I could even give up dancing.

365
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,700
Even if it meant wandering the world.

366
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,440
Of course,

367
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
I didn't end up wandering the world.

368
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,760
But when Chang Ying left,

369
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,250
I figured it out.

370
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,210
You figured it out after being dumped?

371
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,530
Pretty much.

372
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,800
You artistic types,

373
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,400
none of you are reliable.

374
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,240
Tomorrow I'm going

375
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,920
to Hangzhou

376
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,780
to find Yaoyao,

377
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,820
waiting for her to return.

378
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,620
I'll have her come see you.

379
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,730
It would be best if we could get Zhou Tong back.

380
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,090
The director isn't coming.

381
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,490
He's not coming.

382
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,010
It feels quite strange.

383
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,000
He's been yelling at me since I joined the ballet company as a child.

384
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,400
I'm not used to it either,

385
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,660
but he's just not here.

386
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,200
Sister Yun,

387
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,170
Brother Yin.

388
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,700
This is the music for 'Jin Se'.

389
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,960
The emotional core focuses on

390
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,760
the sisterhood between White Snake and Xiao Qing.

391
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,520
A thousand years of inseparable companionship.

392
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,720
They descend to the mortal world and meet Xu Xian,

393
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,850
searching for true love among humans.

394
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,600
Division,

395
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,660
suspicion.

396
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,880
Mortal love

397
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,090
tests their immortal bond.

398
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,700
Arguments,

399
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,250
understanding,

400
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
reconciliation.

401
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Accepting the cycle of mortal life.

402
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,200
Xu Xian is merely mortal,

403
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
with a brief life,

404
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,610
just a passerby.

405
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,980
White Snake and Xiao Qing,

406
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
after a brief separation,

407
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,410
await another millennium of being inseparable.

408
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,490
After they've both had Xu Xian,

409
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,920
can they reconcile?

410
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,520
Let's try.

411
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,000
You said if we can reconcile,

412
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,450
then I can dance.

413
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,560
Yes.

414
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,090
These are pre-choreographed movements.

415
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,960
So I'm just a visitor now?

416
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,610
Let's rehearse the duet first.

417
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,260
There's no Xu Xian.

418
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,680
Please use my phone

419
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,810
to record the video.

420
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,490
I'll send it to Xiao Yao.

421
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,490
Thanks, Yin.

422
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,220
Why did I change into practice clothes then?

423
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,210
Could you stop talking so much?

424
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,040
I might not follow your choreography.

425
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,240
I'll dance my own way.

426
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,170
That's fine.

427
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,320
This is just preliminary choreography now,

428
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,560
like your improvisation with Xiao Yao last time.

429
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,160
Keep in mind what I just said:

430
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,200
true love in the mortal world.

431
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,930
Separation.

432
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,760
Suspicion.

433
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,920
Gratitude.

434
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,360
Arguments.

435
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Reconciliation.

436
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,360
Longing.

437
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,160
I understand.

438
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,320
The leave request form

439
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,580
take it to my workplace

440
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,440
to apply for marriage leave.

441
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,840
You can rightfully take it to Ms. Jiang now.

442
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,320
By the way,

443
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,440
when you come back,

444
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,970
when should we go register?

445
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,360
Today is the 11th,

446
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,040
I'll be gone for three days and return on the 14th,

447
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,500
then register on the 15th.

448
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,160
Okay.

449
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,960
No, that's not good.

450
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,880
Being away for three days

451
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,610
and returning on the fourth day

452
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,380
is bad luck.

453
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,740
Then the fifth day.

454
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,600
How about the sixth day?

455
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,440
Double six brings good fortune,

456
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
what do you think?

457
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,220
What date is the sixth day?

458
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,080
Friday, the 17th.

459
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
What do you think?

460
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,300
I'll go with whatever you decide.

461
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,440
Then let's do the sixth day,

462
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,040
the 17th.

463
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,360
Okay.

464
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,000
Such an important matter

465
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,980
and you have no idea what to do?

466
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,060
Haven't we always been like this?

467
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,040
Big or small,

468
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,940
I always follow your lead.

469
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,200
I've made it a rule

470
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,380
for myself.

471
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,120
It's safer

472
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,620
and less troublesome.

473
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,680
I saw a game online this morning.

474
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,140
We take turns talking.

475
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,760
You start with 'fortunately,'

476
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,680
and I follow with 'unfortunately.'

477
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,410
For example,

478
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
fortunately,

479
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,130
I won the lottery today.

480
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,370
Unfortunately,

481
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
I lost the ticket.

482
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
Fortunately,

483
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,560
I found

484
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
the ticket in your pocket.

485
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,480
Unfortunately,

486
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,640
the clothes were washed

487
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,100
and the ticket was ruined.

488
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,120
Fortunately,

489
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,460
the lottery center

490
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,120
provided a plane ticket

491
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,600
for me

492
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,680
to collect the prize in Beijing.

493
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,520
Unfortunately,

494
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,240
the plane malfunctioned

495
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
and you crashed on a deserted island.

496
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,080
Fortunately,

497
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,520
you were with me on the plane.

498
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,850
Unfortunately,

499
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,520
I missed the flight at first,

500
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,580
so you were the only one on that plane.

501
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
But fortunately,

502
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
there was someone else on the island.

503
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,170
Someone else was there.

504
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Unfortunately,

505
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,890
that person was a man

506
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
and a cannibal.

507
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
I can't continue.

508
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,600
Isn't it fun?

509
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,040
Fortunately,

510
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,520
that cannibal

511
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,360
happened to be a vegetarian.

512
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,890
Unfortunately,

513
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,040
that person just gave up being vegetarian

514
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,770
and was ready to eat meat again.

515
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,060
Then fortunately,

516
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,570
a plane from Beijing

517
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,400
came looking for me just in time.

518
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,280
Who was it?

519
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,880
People from the lottery center.

520
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,320
Always Beijing.

521
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,280
Unfortunately,

522
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
I should have been

523
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,120
the one

524
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,650
saying 'unfortunately' from the beginning.

525
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I'll do it myself.

526
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,500
Xu Tian,

527
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,220
you don't need to go in.

528
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,880
Just go back with the car.

529
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,850
I think it's going to rain outside.

530
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,840
Alright, Manager Fang,

531
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,440
thank you.

532
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,720
Diandian.

533
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,400
What is it?

534
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,960
Mom and Xiaoyue are here.

535
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,580
Let's say it again,

536
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,930
this time

537
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,970
you say the fortunate part.

538
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,500
The fortunate thing is

539
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,840
I met you.

540
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,860
Same for me.

541
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,120
Do you want to talk about the unfortunate part?

542
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,850
There's nothing unfortunate.

543
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,600
Okay.

544
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,850
You two are so mushy,

545
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,520
it's not like you're never coming back.

546
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,400
Call me when you get to Leifeng Tower.

547
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,360
By the time I reach Leifeng Tower,

548
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,920
your plane will be taking off.

549
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,560
I'll call you before takeoff.

550
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,480
Don't forget to submit the leave request.

551
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:01,810
Okay.

552
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,360
There's an umbrella in the car,

553
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,480
remember to take it.

554
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,880
Got it.

555
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Let's go, Xu Tian.

556
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,600
Welcome.

557
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,080
Umbrella.

558
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,680
Thank you.

559
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,460
Thanks.

560
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
Are you there yet?

561
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,490
Just got off the car.

562
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,640
I'm about to take off.

563
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,040
I'll call you when I land.

564
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,040
It's okay.

565
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,380
No need to call.

566
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,240
Then I won't call you,

567
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,010
not even once in three days.

568
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,810
Then I'll call you instead.

569
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,160
I'm turning off my phone.

570
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,520
Okay.

571
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,360
Tian.

572
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,720
Dian.

573
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,420
Why do you always fly economy too?

574
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,570
