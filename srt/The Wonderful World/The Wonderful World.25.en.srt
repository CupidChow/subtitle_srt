1
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,640
I've never been

2
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,240
to Beijing in winter before.

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,039
But this scene

4
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,700
feels like it's happened before.

5
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,560
Do you ever get that feeling?

6
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,930
All the time.

7
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,440
Know why?

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,080
Why?

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,720
Matrix data overlap,

10
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,040
when another dimension's identical spacetime

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,170
briefly overlaps with our dimension.

12
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,920
Past, present, and future being different

13
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,160
is just an illusion.

14
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,840
What do you mean?

15
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,560
We all believe

16
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,620
that time exists in a linear form,

17
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
constant,

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,570
stretching into infinity.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,600
But past, present, and future being different

20
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,960
is merely an illusion.

21
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,920
Yesterday, today, tomorrow

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,050
aren't sequential,

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
they're a cycle.

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,280
Who said that?

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,079
Einstein.

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,240
Right?

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,720
It seems

28
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,220
few people understand these things.

29
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,380
I studied science.

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,579
I just forgot something from my past.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
I know I've forgotten it,

32
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,200
but I don't know why.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,600
I was just wondering

34
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,050
if I've been to Beijing before,

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,880
or if I used to live here.

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,050
How could you forget

37
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,040
things from the past?

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,530
I have that ability.

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,920
Well,

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,100
could you teach me how?

41
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,200
You just need to believe

42
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,760
that the past isn't real.

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,880
Only the present is real.

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
So you're saying

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,380
that only this moment,

46
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,380
us sitting here together,

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,440
is real?

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,940
The future isn't real either,

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,620
because it's unpredictable.

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,200
The past is even less real.

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,480
What happened a minute ago -

52
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,240
if you think it's meaningless, it doesn't exist.

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,300
Because it's gone,

54
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,450
so it doesn't exist.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
That makes sense.

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,680
Thanks for opening the water bottle for me.

57
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,090
You're welcome.

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Do you know how to get to Park Avenue?

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,460
The residential area.

60
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,500
Go that way,

61
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
take the second intersection,

62
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,340
then turn right and you're there.

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,520
Thank you.

64
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,490
Do you have a boyfriend?

65
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,089
The thing is,

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
you look a lot like

67
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,140
my ex-girlfriend.

68
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,010
How similar?

69
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,040
I'd say

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
exactly the same.

71
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Do you believe me?

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,250
You just said you weren't a bad guy.

73
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,120
If

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,640
you've seen this situation

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,520
before,

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,120
then in that previous scenario,

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,440
was I

78
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,530
a bad person?

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,800
No.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My name is Xu Tian.

81
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,440
Stop

82
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,440
the music.

83
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,880
Joey.

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,040
Just now, three lying down minus one.

85
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,370
Which one should we cut?

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,040
The third section,

87
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,100
sixth measure.

88
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,600
The first or the second one?

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,480
Does it matter?

90
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
If you say it doesn't, then it doesn't.

91
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,220
Let's go to the third section.

92
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,680
Why are you sitting here?

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,280
Don't sit here if you have nothing to do,

94
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,010
if you're sitting here, say what needs to be said.

95
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,850
Why are you here?

96
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,000
I came to see

97
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,760
just how miserable it really is.

98
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,900
Stop the music.

99
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,040
Music off.

100
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,760
It still doesn't feel right.

101
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,250
Wen Xiaoyao,

102
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,960
where have you been?

103
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,400
I already asked you for leave.

104
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,330
Who approved it?

105
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,920
You did.

106
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,580
Sister Yun.

107
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,960
When?

108
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,820
I also informed the director.

109
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
Who has the final say?

110
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,820
Sister Yun.

111
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,250
Please don't get upset.

112
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,240
The sixth measure still doesn't sound right.

113
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,500
What's wrong with you?

114
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,659
They all think it doesn't feel right.

115
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
What do you think?

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,500
Does it feel right?

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,840
I think

118
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,720
Dance

119
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
isn't choreographed like this,

120
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,600
and the play isn't directed this way.

121
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,290
Then how should it be directed?

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,840
I never agreed

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,840
to stage 'Jin Se'.

124
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,440
Your agreement isn't needed,

125
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
it's already been decided.

126
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,770
How can this child speak like that?

127
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,610
She's your student.

128
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,320
'The Legend of the White Snake'

129
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,400
was successful

130
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,880
because it was built on a romantic relationship.

131
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,200
For this role, Yaoyao

132
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,679
experienced the life and death

133
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,059
of love's separation.

134
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,410
The foundation of 'Jin Se' is sisterhood,

135
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,240
a thousand years of spiritual cultivation,

136
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,120
tested in the mortal world.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,240
You only choreograph movements

138
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,840
and expect

139
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,200
actors to bring emotion,

140
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,600
but what kind of emotion?

141
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,880
If you don't feel it inside,

142
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,240
then

143
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,140
your physical expression won't have it either.

144
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,600
You're just jumping around,

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,360
in and out.

146
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,960
Art isn't about physical strength.

147
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,040
Teacher Zhao,

148
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,000
the leadership has decided

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,860
that I will choreograph 'Jin Se.'

150
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,960
Not you.

151
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,620
This child has no respect for her elders.

152
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,760
Ask her to come down and talk.

153
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,360
If leadership decided you'll choreograph,

154
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,000
then I'll just assist.

155
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,100
Come on, continue.

156
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,570
They're still continuing?

157
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,810
Stop the rehearsal.

158
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,160
If you don't explain it clearly, your rehearsal is pointless.

159
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,290
Extras, dismissed.

160
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
Lead performers, come down to talk.

161
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,520
I'm still the director. I haven't retired yet.

162
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,380
All right then.

163
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,810
What's going on?

164
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,360
Yin.

165
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,060
My stomach hurts a bit.

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,240
Does yours hurt too?

167
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,160
Teacher Zhao.

168
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,940
I got them to come down.

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,860
Say something.

170
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,360
Who are you?

171
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,570
I'm Zhao Gang's friend.

172
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,730
Is there any danger?

173
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,840
If I don't go to the bathroom,

174
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
I'll be in danger.

175
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
Did you pick up Diandian?

176
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,800
You don't seem very happy.

177
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,960
Not really,

178
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,320
just worried.

179
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,890
Worry about this first,

180
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,080
your aunt is downstairs.

181
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,520
Who?

182
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,560
Zhou Tong's mother.

183
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,200
She called both Sister Yun and Brother Yin down.

184
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,860
Is it someone from the bureau?

185
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,720
Don't ask.

186
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,320
I know

187
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,320
the bureau's position.

188
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,640
But I came today to see

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,460
what's actually going on.

190
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,320
You're

191
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,840
Yang Yun, right?

192
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,520
Yes.

193
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,340
What were you doing on stage just now?

194
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,450
Rehearsing.

195
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,000
Are you a dancer

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,130
or a choreographer?

197
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,960
Why is it that when someone has feedback,

198
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,040
you can't take it?

199
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,260
May I ask your name?

200
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,200
What's your name?

201
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,640
Yin Ye.

202
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,520
I'm the lead dancer of the ballet company,

203
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,600
everyone knows me.

204
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,080
So a lead dancer has to be known by everyone?

205
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,340
I've danced the Prince

206
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,490
in Swan Lake.

207
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,480
If you don't know me,

208
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,320
you can't be

209
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,120
from the bureau.

210
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,240
Swan Lake wasn't created

211
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,500
just because you can jump around, was it?

212
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,240
How many princes have there been?

213
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,900
Who was the prince before you,

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,840
and who

215
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,240
helped you get that role?

216
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,140
You have no respect for the rules.

217
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,560
You'll also have times

218
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,960
when you should step down

219
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,770
but want to hang on a bit longer.

220
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,280
In life,

221
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
you need to understand social graces.

222
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,800
Half your life passes in the blink of an eye.

223
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Zhao Gang may not be the best,

224
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,640
but he has the right attitude.

225
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,570
See how reasonable he was just now?

226
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,440
What were you doing up there with no foundation?

227
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,880
Who could understand that?

228
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,320
I just wanted to stay a bit longer.

229
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,520
No need to deny it.

230
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,440
Wanting to stay longer is normal,

231
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,360
but when the younger ones don't cooperate,

232
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,480
that's not right.

233
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,040
I figured you out in just that short time.

234
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,680
You,

235
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,680
your wings aren't fully developed yet.

236
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,080
Who are you really?

237
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,880
I'm Zhao Gang's buddy.

238
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,620
Does it matter?

239
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,640
You should respect your teachers.

240
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,880
I wasn't being disrespectful.

241
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,280
Yes,

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,240
but why were you

243
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,600
so worked up on stage?

244
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,600
You're insecure,

245
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
but too proud to admit it,

246
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,730
so you just keep directing anyway.

247
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,760
But what on earth are you directing?

248
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,220
Forget about performing,

249
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,080
you haven't even figured out the choreography.

250
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,000
The management will eventually

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
send you right back where you came from.

252
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,080
You're not management.

253
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,560
Sister Yun.

254
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,080
Ma'am.

255
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,120
I've taken your advice to heart.

256
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,770
But for 'Jin Se',

257
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,770
I am the choreographer.

258
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,170
You're the choreographer?

259
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,840
Then choreograph -

260
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,300
sit here and focus on that.

261
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,720
If you want to dance,

262
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,450
then go up there and just dance.

263
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,560
Choreographing and dancing at the same time,

264
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,960
hogging both positions -

265
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,530
who do you think you are?

266
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,620
So what do you suggest?

267
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,360
Should I sit here

268
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,480
or be on stage?

269
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,680
If you're smart enough,

270
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,560
you should stay here and write well,

271
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,440
as for the stage performances,

272
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,720
let others handle that.

273
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,880
The leadership has already taken the first step in grooming you,

274
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,680
stepping down is just a matter of time.

275
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,080
Stop torturing me slowly.

276
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,680
You need to

277
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,800
secure Zhao Gang's position.

278
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,340
So you're here to stir up trouble.

279
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,880
I'm here to help you.

280
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,320
You're actually being helpful.

281
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,120
No.

282
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,860
You've been taken advantage of your whole life.

283
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,360
It's so chaotic backstage.

284
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,200
Auntie.

285
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,120
Did you pick up Xu Tian's girlfriend?

286
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,720
Yes, I did.

287
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,520
Bring her over for dinner.

288
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,920
Dian said she doesn't want anything

289
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,000
to do with people from her past.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,800
What do I have to do with her past?

291
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,480
She doesn't even recognize who Xu Tian is now.

292
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,850
That's pretty extreme.

293
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,940
Where's Zhao Gang?

294
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,480
He's either in his office

295
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
or he's gone home.

296
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,730
He wouldn't want to go home.

297
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,640
Auntie.

298
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,900
You destroyed Sister Yun.

299
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,010
That's not good.

300
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,320
You don't mean that.

301
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,650
Let's go.

302
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,940
Let me show you the way.

303
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,680
Am I really that unlikable?

304
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,880
I like you,

305
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,040
you know that.

306
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,520
But you like me this way.

307
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,420
I don't like it.

308
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,930
So you don't like me either.

309
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,360
You're just fine.

310
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
No more rehearsal

311
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,600
for today.

312
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,940
We're done.

313
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,680
Dismissed.

314
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,160
Why?

315
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,720
Why did they stop rehearsing?

316
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,360
I don't know.

317
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,420
What's the reason,

318
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,320
Yin?

319
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
What's going on here?

320
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,480
I can't show my face here anymore.

321
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,210
You've taken over everything,

322
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,540
and students have taken all my spots.

323
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,720
Zhao Gang,

324
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,050
don't be so ungrateful.

325
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,120
I've got plenty of my own problems,

326
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,050
yet I still have to look after you and worry about you.

327
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
Who do you think you are?

328
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,680
Coming to the ballet company to arrange things?

329
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,810
How about considering me your friend?

330
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,810
Aren't you feeling miserable?

331
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,810
Completely miserable.

332
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,920
The more you loved your job,

333
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,040
the more miserable you feel stepping down.

334
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,320
The sooner it ends,

335
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,680
the sooner you can move on.

336
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,200
Once you get through this, there's a new world waiting.

337
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,040
You still have

338
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
the rest of your life to live, right?

339
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,440
Whether I live or not,

340
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,960
what's that got to do with you?

341
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,720
Look at you, packing up but not taking anything away.

342
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,380
You just can't let go, can you?

343
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,650
Get out of my way.

344
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm not giving up on you that easily.

345
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Hello, Director.

346
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,560
Director.

347
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,770
Good day, Director.

348
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,080
I used to

349
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,340
tease you all the time.

350
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,640
Now that you're going through a rough patch,

351
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,400
I can't just

352
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,460
pretend I don't see it, right?

353
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,250
Don't find me annoying,

354
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,280
I just want to say a few more words.

355
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,400
Whether you listen or not,

356
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,200
it's up to you.

357
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,200
Look at the people living in this building.

358
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,800
There are people who can't afford apartments.

359
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,640
People walking down there.

360
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,970
People sitting in cars.

361
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,530
Everyone has their own struggles.

362
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,720
Don't be fooled by their smiles.

363
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,880
If they told you about their problems,

364
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
you'd be shocked.

365
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,760
Zhao Gang.

366
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,480
You know,

367
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
your life has been too smooth so far,

368
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,810
you haven't faced many obstacles.

369
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,720
Actually, if you think about it,

370
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,920
retirement

371
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,640
is just like birth, aging, illness, and death,

372
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,100
you just need to accept it.

373
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,920
It'll pass.

374
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
I still have energy and experience.

375
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,640
You've seen it yourself,

376
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,370
does she know what she's doing?

377
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,520
When you know your place,

378
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,840
that's positive energy.

379
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,640
When you're out of place,

380
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,040
that's negative energy.

381
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,960
Adults should act like adults,

382
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,920
and children should act like children.

383
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,480
Don't believe me? Try it yourself.

384
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,610
If you step aside for the younger ones,

385
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,920
and stay in the background,

386
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,480
quietly offering guidance,

387
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,610
see if they'll still give you trouble.

388
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,480
Yang Yun wants to choreograph

389
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,410
and perform too.

390
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,120
She wants to do both things,

391
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,450
but can she do them well?

392
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,920
I don't know about this stuff,

393
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,520
but you do.

394
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,400
Why did I have to run into you?

395
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,690
Bad luck, right?

396
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,120
We should thank Qiao Guanghui for this.

397
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,560
Uncle Hui.

398
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,920
Where did Xu Tian go?

399
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,080
Is he back yet?

400
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,800
Stop thinking about him,

401
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,840
his girlfriend is already here.

402
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,600
I'm not thinking about him,

403
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,640
just asking.

404
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,480
Why are you so into working out lately?

405
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,540
Blowing off steam.

406
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,770
What's the rush?

407
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,580
Take that ring on the table

408
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,540
to the regiment

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,330
and give it to Zhao Gang.

410
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
I won't.

411
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,680
Let Xiao Yao handle this.

412
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,460
After all these years as buddies,

413
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,400
you stole Song Guanwang away.

414
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,680
I'll be loyal till the end

415
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,040
and help make this happen.

416
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,570
Song Dagu went to our dance company today.

417
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,530
What for?

418
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,040
She spoke up for Sister Yun to the director.

419
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,600
Sister Yun is completely devastated.

420
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,000
She's not even rehearsing 'Jinse' anymore.

421
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,840
Song Guanwang went to the ballet company

422
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,370
to stand up for Auntie Gang.

423
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,080
Stop it, you're exhausted.

424
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,680
You'll hurt yourself again.

425
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,320
Dad, please stop this nonsense.

426
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,850
I have more bad news for you.

427
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,040
I...

428
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
I'm planning to date a homeless kid.

429
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Street kids.

430
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
What does 'everywhere' mean?

431
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,120
What do you mean?

432
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,040
Xiaoyao, do you understand?

433
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,840
I do.

434
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,980
Let me tell you.

435
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,730
Breaking up is breaking up.

436
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,410
But the property must be divided clearly.

437
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,580
Don't play this 'half for each person' game.

438
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,200
Your father doesn't save money

439
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,060
for strangers.

440
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,360
Got it?

441
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,320
Are you crazy?

442
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,200
Who is he?

443
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Get him over here.

444
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,940
I'll deal with him.

445
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,040
Xu Tian's

446
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,850
on the phone.

447
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,280
Hello.

448
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,810
Xiaoyao,

449
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,260
this is Xu Tian.

450
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,120
Where are you?

451
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,940
I'm right outside your building.

452
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Which building does Diandian live in,

453
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,500
do you know?

454
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,240
Building One.

455
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,480
So which unit

456
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,160
and apartment

457
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,840
is she in?

458
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,660
I can't remember clearly.

459
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,620
Xu Tian,

460
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,560
come over for dinner tonight.

461
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,220
We'll have hot pot and drinks.

462
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,760
No thanks, Uncle Qiao.

463
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,800
I have something important to do right now.

464
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,060
What important thing?

465
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,080
Dating?

466
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,610
Trying to win

467
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,500
Diandian back?

468
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,890
It's quite intense,

469
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,560
one after another.

470
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,690
Have you figured out a plan?

471
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,480
Not yet.

472
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,490
Let me teach you a trick.

473
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Actually, there's no trick to love.

474
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,820
Just exercise on the spot,

475
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
push-ups, squats, anything works.

476
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,280
Work out until

477
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,680
you're dizzy,

478
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,980
then just go for it.

479
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,490
Whether it works or not,

480
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,600
if it doesn't, just forget it.

481
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,400
Don't think about useless things,

482
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
everything is fate,

483
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,720
destined by heaven.

484
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,450
Understand?

485
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,400
What's that stray kid's name?

486
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,770
I don't know.

487
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,140
How should we deal with this then?

488
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
Does the name matter?

489
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,810
Isn't it important?

490
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,410
Little Ears.

491
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
Little Ears.

492
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,000
Little Ears.

493
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,280
Someone actually has that name.

494
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,000
OK.

495
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,960
All right.

496
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,760
I understand.

497
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,250
Ms. Fang is calling.

498
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,330
You've been here all along.

499
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,400
Thank you.

500
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,720
Hello, Director Fang.

501
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,120
How did it go?

502
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,320
Did you see Diandian?

503
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,160
Did she speak?

504
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,560
Yes, I saw her.

505
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,480
She spoke too.

506
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,360
It was a false alarm.

507
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,560
I'm glad you're both okay.

508
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,680
Stay in Beijing for a few more days.

509
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,760
No rush to return to Hangzhou.

510
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,520
Director Fang,

511
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,040
she...

512
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,640
she doesn't recognize me anymore.

513
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,240
We've met and talked, but she still doesn't recognize me.

514
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,680
Yes,

515
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,000
she doesn't recognize me.

516
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,730
She was like this last time too.

517
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,040
This shouldn't be happening.

518
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,800
After we broke up last time,

519
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,040
we haven't seen each other since.

520
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,200
That's alright, Mr. Fang.

521
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,920
I'll just pretend

522
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,200
this is the first time I've met Diandian.

523
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,520
When we were together before,

524
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,180
she was the one who pursued me.

525
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,680
But now,

526
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
I'm pursuing her.

527
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,770
Can you handle that?

528
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,960
Fate has its own arrangements.

529
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,640
If it works, great.

530
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,560
If not, then forget it.

531
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,760
After thinking it over, it was all fake,

532
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,580
now it's like I'm talking to a different person.

533
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,770
Mr. Fang,

534
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,680
earlier

535
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
at our engagement

536
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,010
at the hotel,

537
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,500
you said Diandian and I were together

538
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,850
not because of love,

539
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,160
but because of our past.

540
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,490
I'm not good with words,

541
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,770
but I know in my heart

542
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,960
that I love Diandian,

543
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,920
and now we can start dating from scratch.

544
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,040
Then I can rest easy.

545
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,570
Mr. Fang,

546
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,490
please let Xiaoyue go home,

547
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,240
I'm here,

548
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,970
don't worry.

549
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
Her birthday is coming up,

550
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,170
the 19th.

551
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,840
She doesn't remember it herself,

552
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,280
so remember to celebrate it with her.

553
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,000
Whether you can celebrate it or not

554
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,920
depends on whether

555
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,520
she'll open the door for you.

556
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,040
Thank you.

557
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,100
Building 1,

558
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,640
Unit 2, Apartment 2109.

559
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,080
Okay,

560
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,760
you should head back now,

561
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,290
I'll wait here a bit longer.

562
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,600
Why?

563
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,240
Forget it,

564
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,640
I'm not waiting anymore.

565
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,520
All this overthinking is nonsense,

566
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,920
I'll just go up and knock.

567
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
All this back and forth thinking is wrong,

568
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,760
I'll just go up and knock.

569
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,400
Excuse me.

570
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,860
I'm also on the 21st floor.

571
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,520
The food for 2109.

572
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,250
Give it to me,

573
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,820
it's for Shi Diandian,

574
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,540
my girlfriend.

575
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,650
Please leave a good review.

576
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,720
I'll do it as soon as I get inside.

577
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,170
Okay.

578
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,560
Just knock directly.

579
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,600
Hello.

580
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,680
I...

581
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,600
You...

582
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,880
About your food order,

583
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,840
I just ran into

584
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,160
your delivery person in the elevator,

585
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,720
so I brought it up for you.

586
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,320
Don't worry, I didn't open it.

587
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,520
If you're concerned,

588
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:29,960
I can

589
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,720
order another one for you.

590
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,240
I'll eat this one,

591
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,760
myself,

592
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,620
since I haven't eaten yet anyway.

593
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,960
Shi Diandian.

594
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,800
Your name is on this.

595
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,860
You can have it.

596
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,360
No way.

597
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,090
I need to replace it.

598
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,960
Should I order the same thing

599
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
or would you prefer something else?

600
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,850
Are you stalking me?

601
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,540
I couldn't help it,

602
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,420
so I followed you all the way here.

603
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,880
If I hadn't run into

604
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,960
that delivery person in the elevator,

605
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,160
I wouldn't have known

606
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,460
where you live.

607
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,640
Why?

608
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,000
It's hard to explain,

609
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,970
and you probably won't believe me,

610
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,570
but that's how it is.

611
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,690
What do you mean?

612
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,130
Love at first sight.

613
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,720
You can call the police,

614
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,520
but they won't arrest someone for wanting to date.

615
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,170
I don't want to date.

616
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,080
That's impossible,

617
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,410
everyone needs to date.

618
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,280
Unless you say you dislike me.

619
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,400
If you dislike me,

620
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,680
I'll

621
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,000
disappear immediately,

622
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,840
I'll never show up again,

623
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,300
you'll never see me again.

624
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,000
I want a quiet life,

625
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,490
dating maybe later.

626
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,720
Later is fine,

627
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,080
no problem,

628
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,540
we've already met anyway.

629
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,040
That's...

630
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,770
that's good.

631
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,560
If you want

632
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,240
quiet time, then be quiet.

633
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,600
When you want someone to talk to,

634
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,440
just come to me,

635
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,520
I'll keep you company.

636
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,840
If you don't want to talk,

637
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,400
we can

638
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,700
just sit together,

639
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,490
whatever works for you.

640
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,120
The thing is,

641
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,360
I just want to be with you.

642
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,020
You're alone, aren't you?

643
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,720
Everyone needs friends, right?

644
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,040
If you ever need someone,

645
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,640
feel free to call me anytime.

646
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,720
I don't have your number.

647
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,080
I have yours.

648
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,920
It's on the order form.

649
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,880
I'll

650
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,020
give you a call.

651
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,570
Goodbye.

652
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,860
I'm Xu Tian.

653
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,880
I've changed my mind.

654
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm going to sit down here today,

655
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,320
and I won't leave until you come down.

656
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,800
You'll have to come out at dawn,

657
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,460
and I'll say hello when you do.

658
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,960
Why?

659
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
When we met,

660
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,360
you said it felt like déjà vu.

661
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,600
As it happens, I like you too.

662
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,520
It's easy to miss each other in this vast sea of people.

663
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,000
I know

664
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,970
I'm being a bit irrational.

665
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,680
But what if I come to my senses tomorrow,

666
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,940
and our chance is gone?

667
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,380
Xiaomi.

668
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,040
Break up with that girl called Xiao'erduo

669
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,840
immediately,

670
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,580
you hear me?

671
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,960
I didn't do anything.

672
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,420
I'm just messing with you,

673
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,400
having Xiaoyao is enough for me.

674
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,440
Xiaoyao.

675
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,540
What's with the 'hmm'?

676
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,120
Is Xu Tian's girlfriend

677
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,140
living in this neighborhood?

678
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,010
Is Xu Tian there too?

679
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,720
I think so.

680
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,120
Which building?

681
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,450
I'll teach him a lesson,

682
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,480
if he's sick, he should see a doctor,

683
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
if not, he should stop causing trouble.

684
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,080
Uncle Hui,

685
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,680
please don't go,

686
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,520
they have nothing to do with me anymore.

687
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,580
We're getting along really well.

688
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,280
When I tell you not to interfere,

689
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,780
stop meddling.

690
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,200
You go up first,

691
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,720
I need to talk to Dad for a bit.

692
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,920
What is it?

693
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,800
Are you being insensitive?

694
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,730
Xiaoyao hasn't gotten over it yet,

695
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,920
Xu Tian looks exactly like Zhou Tong,

696
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,800
you brought her to Beijing

697
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,560
and now she has to watch him with someone else.

698
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,600
Zhou Tong and Xu Tian

699
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,530
are obviously not the same person.

700
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,480
If she can't get past this,

701
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,440
then she needs therapy.

702
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,520
Whatever.

703
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,360
What about you and Ms. Song?

704
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Nothing's happened between you two,

705
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,360
so why are you working out every day?

706
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,880
I prepared myself mentally in every way,

707
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,159
but never expected

708
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,810
she'd end up with Zhao Gang.

709
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,690
Isn't Auntie Gang pretty cool?

710
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,800
Just think of it as charity work.

711
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,460
That's what I thought too.

712
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,130
Goodbye.

713
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,280
My name is Wen Xiaoyao,

714
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,199
I'm Joey's sister.

715
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,600
I know.

716
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
Xiaomi will be up in a moment.

717
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:49,929
Okay.

718
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:58,840
Hey.

719
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,640
Come over to my place.

720
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,240
I'm busy.

721
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,680
Then I'll wait for you.

722
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
Don't wait for me,

723
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,520
I have a dinner appointment tonight.

724
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,780
Come drink at my place,

725
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
just the two of us.

726
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,220
Let's talk about it later.

727
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,290
I'll be waiting for you.

728
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
Did you call him to come here?

729
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,640
No,

730
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,100
I must be crazy.

731
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,250
Do you want to order?

732
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,850
I'll send him away soon.

733
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,900
I should leave.

734
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,130
Why are you leaving?

735
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,440
Don't close the door.

736
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,220
It's not like we have secrets.

737
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,480
It's been several days in a row.

738
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,140
Every night I dream about you,

739
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,080
and they're all connected.

740
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
What do you mean?

741
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,930
I don't understand.

742
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,960
The first night I dreamed we were

743
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,160
rushing to catch a ride,

744
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,040
and we just made it,

745
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,840
then I woke up.

746
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,740
Then the second night,

747
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,140
we caught that ride

748
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,240
and went to Yunnan together.

749
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,720
Like a TV series.

750
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,000
I can't tell anymore what's real

751
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,060
and what's a dream.

752
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,960
Anyway,

753
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
day and night,

754
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,170
episode after episode,

755
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,880
they're all connected.

756
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,140
You should just treat reality as a dream,

757
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,960
it's perfect.

758
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,120
Whatever I say,

759
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,720
don't feel embarrassed.

760
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,240
These are Jade Dragon snow pine seeds

761
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,520
I brought you from Yunnan,

762
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,850
they symbolize purity.

763
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,240
Didn't you go to Yunnan

764
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,840
in your dream?

765
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,860
I went there by myself before.

766
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,040
I told my dad about you,

767
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,080
and he said

768
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,300
if we get together,

769
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
we need to keep our assets separate.

770
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,280
You're just a drifter,

771
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,410
don't overthink it.

772
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,940
I'm from a wealthy family.

773
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,940
Fine, little rich kid.

774
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,260
Do you think

775
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,000
the wind needs money?

776
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,570
The wind,

777
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,570
coming and going as it pleases,

778
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,330
it doesn't need any.

779
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,580
Do you know why?

780
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,360
Because

781
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,200
it's the wind.

782
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,240
The wind is free.

783
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,040
I understand.

784
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,800
So you're

785
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,320
the man like the wind, huh?

786
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,450
Are you cold?

787
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,680
Are you cold?

788
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,330
I won't be cold if you come down.

789
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,400
Sit.

790
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,780
Why are you doing this?

791
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,420
Doing what?

792
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,210
Not leaving.

793
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,380
I'd be alone if I went back,

794
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,100
afraid of loneliness.

795
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
Where do you live?

796
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,340
I'm staying at a hotel,

797
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,740
I'm from the south.

798
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,370
Why did you come to Beijing?

799
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,140
I broke up with my girlfriend.

800
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,400
Do you still love her?

801
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:58,840
Love.

802
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
If you loved her, why did you break up?

803
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,850
I had issues,

804
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,120
and so did she.

805
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,080
What issues did she have?

806
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:08,840
That's

807
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,760
hard to explain.

808
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,740
On a scale of one to ten,

809
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,300
how would you rate her?

810
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,530
Do we have to talk about her?

811
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,770
You said you like me,

812
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,700
so I want to know what she was like.

813
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,560
Nine.

814
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,560
That high?

815
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,370
To be honest,

816
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,240
six points

817
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,720
were just her.

818
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,280
Because I've never seen

819
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,240
or met

820
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,850
anyone as dedicated

821
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,140
and thoughtful as her.

822
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,680
Of course,

823
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,220
I haven't met many people either.

824
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,580
The other three points

825
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,560
I added myself.

826
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,770
Why did you add them?

827
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,800
I grew up alone.

828
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,080
I make qipaos.

829
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,040
When I was very young,

830
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,450
my family had a shop,

831
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,520
so I've always been a tailor.

832
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,640
Being alone

833
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,160
for so long,

834
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,520
you start to feel afraid.

835
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,810
Do you ever feel afraid?

836
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,620
Sometimes I do.

837
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,260
In the past, when I was scared,

838
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,940
I would always imagine

839
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,760
that I was just a hallucination.

840
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,060
That another version of myself was safe.

841
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,300
Until I met her.

842
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,460
Finally I could

843
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,260
stop living all by myself.

844
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,660
Two people are always safer than one.

845
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,700
For safety.

846
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,650
A bit of compromise.

847
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,680
Six parts of what's natural,

848
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,120
three parts of compromise,

849
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
makes nine parts.

850
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,050
What about the remaining one part?

851
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,130
It's for her.

852
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,050
I don't understand.

853
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,650
She probably

854
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,010
loves herself more.

855
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,460
People are supposed to love themselves.

856
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,360
I do too.

857
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,240
Do you hate her now?

858
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,440
Not at all.

859
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,440
If she came back now,

860
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,770
would you still be with her?

861
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,040
No.

862
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,920
It's over.

863
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,170
I'm ready to start over now.

864
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,490
You don't understand me at all.

865
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,860
Let's take it slow.

866
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,640
We can't be together.

867
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,640
Who knows what will happen in the future?

868
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,300
In the past,

869
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
we sat together watching the stars.

870
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,860
She was holding a flashlight,

871
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,440
waving it

872
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,000
across the sky.

873
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,120
Back

874
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,000
and forth.

875
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,980
It felt really wonderful.

876
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,280
At that moment, I thought

877
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,080
she was the one

878
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,220
for my entire life.

879
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,240
I wanted to be with her forever

880
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,370
and never part ways.

881
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,180
But who would have thought

882
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,010
that now I'm sitting here with you.

883
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,440
You still want to be with her now.

884
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,280
I only want to be with you now.

885
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,720
I have a job interview tomorrow.

886
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,720
Thanks for ordering food for me.

887
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,160
It's been delivered.

888
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,960
Don't come here anymore,

889
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,560
and stop calling me.

890
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,680
I wouldn't count on that.

891
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,210
You should find her and bring her back.

892
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,370
I want to,

893
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,100
but she's gone.

894
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,000
Go home.

895
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,290
It's so cold.

896
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,450
Call me before you go to bed,

897
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:44,920
or

898
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,820
just send me a message.

899
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,420
No, I won't.

900
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,820
Now that we've met,

901
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,600
I can't stop thinking about you.

902
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,930
If I don't hear from you,

903
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,330
I won't be able to sleep.

904
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,760
Mrs. Fang.

905
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,840
Xiaoyao,

906
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,080
sorry to keep bothering you,

907
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,760
but I have no one else to ask.

908
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,240
Do you know if Xu Tian and Diandian

909
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,160
are together?

910
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,280
Yes, they are.

911
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,090
Are they doing well?

912
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,160
How does Xu Tian seem?

913
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,160
Like someone in love.

914
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,580
DIT Project

915
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,340
Special Thanks

916
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,160
Ma Jianyi
