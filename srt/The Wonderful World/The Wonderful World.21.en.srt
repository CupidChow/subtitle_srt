1
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,760
Don't touch my computer,

2
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,100
I'm talking to you.

3
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,460
Let me rest for a while.

4
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't touch my computer,

5
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,340
I'm talking to you.

6
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,740
Let me rest for a while.

7
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,560
Don't touch my computer.

8
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,900
I'm talking to you,

9
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,300
let me rest for a while.

10
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,770
Is this Xiaoyao?

11
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,980
This is Song Guanwang,

12
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,650
Zhou Tong's mother.

13
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,640
Song...

14
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,400
Auntie Song.

15
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,600
I got your number from Zhao Gang.

16
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
How are you doing?

17
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,720
Fine.

18
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,800
Your Uncle Hui said

19
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,720
you saw Xu Tian

20
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
in Hangzhou.

21
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,980
What happened?

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,400
China is so big,

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
yet you ran into him in Hangzhou.

24
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Did you bump into him

25
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,920
or did you find him?

26
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,600
I ran into him

27
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
at Leifeng Tower.

28
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,280
Xiaoyao.

29
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,640
I've met Xu Tian before,

30
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,120
on the day Zhou Tong had his accident.

31
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,180
He came to our home,

32
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,600
with his girlfriend.

33
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Good heavens.

34
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,960
Letting me see one,

35
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,820
then taking another away,

36
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,579
I don't know what it means.

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,120
He's a good kid,

38
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
polite,

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,440
reasonable.

40
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,240
But,

41
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,900
he's not Zhou Tong.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
I understand.

43
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,320
I know,

44
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,450
don't get obsessed.

45
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
Since the accident...

46
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,560
I've been holding a grudge.

47
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,620
Not talking to you,

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,579
harboring resentment until now.

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,730
Actually, I've just been making things hard for myself.

50
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,960
Auntie was wrong.

51
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
He's gone,

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,000
blaming heaven and earth,

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,860
but blame won't change anything.

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,400
Come back,

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,320
Xiaoyao.

56
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,420
Auntie misses you.

57
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,050
Do you still love Zhou Tong?

58
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,520
Yes.

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,280
That settles it then.

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
I love him too.

61
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,360
We're so far apart,

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,330
not speaking to each other,

63
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,240
what's the point of that?

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,800
Auntie.

65
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,480
I know what I need to do.

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,840
Don't do anything.

67
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,280
On the 15th,

68
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,900
Zhou Tong's ashes will be buried.

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,380
Will you come back?

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,360
Yes.

71
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,600
Come back early.

72
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Which hotel is Aunt Gang staying at?

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,090
It's very close.

74
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,290
It's hot.

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,360
Hold this to warm your hands first,

76
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
wait until it cools down to drink it.

77
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,080
Are you

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,050
really planning

79
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,770
to stay here the whole time?

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,520
Um.

81
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,360
The company is rehearsing a new show,

82
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,240
choreographed by Sister Yun,

83
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,520
about White Snake and Xiaoqing,

84
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,180
called 'The Brocade Zither.'

85
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,840
It would be great if you came back,

86
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,170
I want to dance with you.

87
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,160
Today.

88
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,620
Not staying at a hotel.

89
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,730
Where are you staying then?

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,090
Here.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,360
How long are you staying?

92
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,840
One day,

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,000
I wish we could stay longer.

94
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,450
we're going back to Beijing tomorrow.

95
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,720
Oh, you.

96
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,490
We'll go back to Beijing together.

97
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,800
Well.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,080
After we go back,

99
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,280
you'll keep ignoring me,

100
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,290
and I'll try hard to please you.

101
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Are we really going back to Beijing?

102
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,120
Can I

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,130
tell my dad about it?

104
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,200
He'll definitely be happy.

105
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,600
I'll ask him to pick us up.

106
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,080
I need to tell Xu Tian

107
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,700
and call Sister Diandian.

108
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,280
Hello,

109
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,440
this is the bus terminal.

110
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,960
Your friend seems to be daydreaming,

111
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,440
telling her the bus has arrived

112
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,080
and won't continue before she gets off.

113
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,940
Is something wrong with her head?

114
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,920
Wait,

115
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,440
she's

116
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,600
pacing back and forth

117
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,200
across the street right now.

118
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,760
Miss!

119
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,440
Miss!

120
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,919
Miss! Hey miss,

121
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,799
your phone.

122
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,799
Diandian, open the door.

123
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,720
Diandian!

124
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,160
Let's check the security footage at the property office.

125
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
If she's still inside, that's fine,

126
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,840
but if she's outside,

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
we're in trouble.

128
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,970
Her old condition is acting up,

129
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,960
she can't even remember the way home.

130
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,600
She should at least answer her phone, right?

131
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,530
She can't even remember who she is.

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,400
She probably lost her phone too.

133
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
What exactly did you two talk about?

134
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,100
She told me to be with Wen Xiaoyao.

135
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
It's completely absurd.

136
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Zhou Tong is dead.

137
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,090
Did you know about this too?

138
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,080
Why didn't any of you tell me?

139
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,210
Besides,

140
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,720
what relationship do I even have with Wen Xiaoyao?

141
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,850
Dian Dian is a woman.

142
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,200
You might think there's nothing between you, but she thinks otherwise.

143
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,920
At a time like this,

144
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,850
don't upset her.

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,840
Diandian.

146
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,840
We met in Beijing.

147
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,960
I just called you.

148
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,530
Since I came back from Beijing in October,

149
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,320
I've been afraid you'd come to Hangzhou.

150
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,450
But you came anyway.

151
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,440
Do you want to call Xu Tian?

152
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,700
I'll just sit for a moment.

153
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,320
Xu Tian is all yours now.

154
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,440
You two are meant to be together.

155
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,940
He's not Zhou Tong.

156
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
I'm going back

157
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
to Beijing tomorrow.

158
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,080
Zhou Tong's funeral

159
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,040
is on the 15th.

160
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,220
What are you doing?

161
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,400
Just looking.

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
Looking for trouble?

163
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,120
Are you crazy?

164
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
I can't even look?

165
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,520
This is a public area.

166
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,400
I'm just practicing my instrument here.

167
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,800
How does that bother you?

168
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,610
So you're from Beijing.

169
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
Why'd you come down south?

170
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,140
Wandering.

171
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,400
See? You are crazy.

172
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
What's your name?

173
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,810
Little Ears.

174
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Little Ears?

175
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,520
That's what they call me on the streets.

176
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,380
What about you?

177
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,040
Just a kid,

178
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,440
talking about 'the streets.'

179
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,240
You don't understand anything.

180
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Which part of Beijing?

181
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,880
Fangshan.

182
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,800
That counts, I guess.

183
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,730
Get lost.

184
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I kind of like you.

185
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,320
How about giving me your number?

186
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:54,880
Wait.

187
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,680
I'm crazy? You're the crazy one.

188
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,960
I told you I'm wandering around,

189
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,240
and you're asking a wanderer for a phone number?

190
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
Don't get all worked up.

191
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,960
You'll miss your chance if you don't take it now.

192
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,160
What do you do anyway?

193
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,100
Ballet dancer.

194
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,380
Go ahead, play.

195
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,660
Just strum it a bit.

196
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,780
Strum what?

197
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,540
That old instrument of yours.

198
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,720
I need a break.

199
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,970
Just play it.

200
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Are you confused?

201
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,640
I didn't see clearly.

202
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,200
Keep playing.

203
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,500
Let me teach you

204
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,820
to be normal at your young age.

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,120
There's nothing cool about wandering around.

206
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,180
Go back to Beijing,

207
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,370
join a class,

208
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
get into a troupe.

209
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,760
Stop deceiving young girls in underground passages.

210
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,090
What?

211
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
Southern girls are easy to fool, huh?

212
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,200
Who's deceiving girls?

213
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,800
I'm just

214
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,840
making an honest living now.

215
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,300
Sure, go ahead.

216
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,840
After Zhou Tong left,

217
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,800
I felt so empty inside.

218
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,560
I wanted to go home,

219
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,240
I missed my mom.

220
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,520
So I came to Hangzhou.

221
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,010
I always felt I might find family here.

222
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,100
But really, there's no one anywhere.

223
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,460
When you like someone,

224
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,260
how should you treat them?

225
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,760
Should you show them your flaws

226
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,500
and ask for their acceptance,

227
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,850
or should you leave them

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
to spare them from getting hurt?

229
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,960
What is love like?

230
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,560
At first,

231
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,120
it's possessing and being possessed,

232
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,780
obsession.

233
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,850
Later, it's forgetting and being forgotten.

234
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,600
If you forget,

235
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,850
is there still love?

236
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,320
Yes.

237
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,020
It's always there afterward.

238
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,980
After a long time, when you remember,

239
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
it's both painful

240
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,120
and joyful.

241
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,140
Aren't you going to answer it?

242
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,820
Are you really going back to Beijing?

243
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,360
Tomorrow.

244
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,650
Will you come back to Hangzhou?

245
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,730
I'm not coming back.

246
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,440
You said it yourself.

247
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,640
It was fate

248
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,880
that I came to Hangzhou

249
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,080
and met Xu Tian.

250
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,440
Diandian,

251
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,320
please take good care

252
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
of Xu Tian in the future.

253
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,280
I just told Xu Tian

254
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
that you two should be together.

255
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,280
I don't have a future.

256
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,730
How do you know that?

257
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,440
I just know

258
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,000
that you won't

259
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,080
see me again.

260
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,880
Can I save your phone number?

261
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,480
Sure.

262
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,580
The bus is here.

263
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,940
Are you coming?

264
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,320
I wish I could see

265
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,380
Xu Tian one more time before leaving.

266
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,960
It's all fate.

267
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Diandian,

268
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,960
should we take a photo together?

269
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,480
Sure.

270
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,410
Where have you been?

271
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,200
Taking the bus.

272
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Then why didn't you answer my calls?

273
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
I didn't know what to say.

274
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,040
Yet you had so much to say at home.

275
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,119
I don't know what else to say.

276
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,840
Me and Wen Xiaoyao together?

277
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,920
That's completely absurd!

278
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:33,960
You...

279
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,360
Do you really

280
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,040
think that?

281
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
My affairs,

282
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,580
have you

283
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,840
just decided everything for me?

284
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,640
Did you ever ask if I agreed?

285
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,850
Besides,

286
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,540
you're my girlfriend,

287
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,820
we even had our engagement celebration!

288
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,840
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,420
Promise

290
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,680
this won't happen again.

291
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,680
What if it does happen again?

292
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,170
At least answer your phone.

293
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
If I don't answer,

294
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,300
would you come looking for me?

295
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Yes.

296
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,530
I was with Wen Xiaoyao just now.

297
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,140
You went to see her?

298
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,810
I couldn't find my way home,

299
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,440
she called me.

300
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,410
Wen Xiaoyao,

301
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,080
she said she's going back to Beijing tomorrow.

302
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:00,960
When is

303
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,440
she leaving?

304
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,890
I don't know,

305
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,560
just tomorrow.

306
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,380
I need to go to Beijing too.

307
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
Zhou Tong is gone,

308
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,890
I can't act like nothing happened.

309
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,220
What are you going to do there?

310
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,040
I'm going

311
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,000
even if

312
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,640
just to see his ashes,

313
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,920
his grave.

314
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,690
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

315
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,840
I can do it.

316
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:29,970
Xiaoyao.

317
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,560
After visiting the cemetery,

318
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,290
let's go to the ballet company.

319
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,560
No.

320
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,080
Let's go see 'The Brocade Zither,'

321
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,240
you might like it.

322
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,360
Xiaomi,

323
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
take care of yourself in the future.

324
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,460
I definitely will.

325
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,610
There's only one bottle

326
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,440
of Yakult left.

327
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,240
Let's eat first,

328
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,720
then drink it after dinner.

329
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,760
Don't hate me.

330
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,250
It's all in the past.

331
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,160
Everything will pass.

332
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,020
That's easy to say,

333
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,610
but I still need to be more careful.

334
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,490
Next time you date someone,

335
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,740
watch how I behave.

336
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,560
Isn't it time for you to date someone?

337
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,200
I...

338
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,400
I...

339
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,440
Who is it?

340
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,480
Nothing.

341
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,160
What an idiot.

342
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,370
Take it down.

343
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,000
Singles' Day is over. We should've taken it down already.

344
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,760
Tong put it up himself,

345
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,280
and couldn't bear to remove it.

346
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,740
Don't bring up sad things.

347
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
Just taking

348
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,940
each day and making it wonderful.

349
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,410
Mr. Qiao,

350
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,240
I wonder why

351
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,480
you're never busy,

352
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,410
don't have a driver,

353
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,250
and keep such a low profile.

354
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,720
I heard from Mr. Song

355
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,570
that you're quite wealthy,

356
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,800
donating several million

357
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,000
to ballet every year.

358
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,820
What else did she say about me?

359
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,040
How about sponsoring me too?

360
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,440
I'm desperate.

361
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
I can do anything.

362
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,010
How long has Master Zhao been in there?

363
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,020
No idea.

364
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
Go upstairs and check for me.

365
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,360
What's he doing

366
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,620
that's taking so long?

367
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Can't you go in and see for yourself?

368
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,530
Here.

369
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,440
Three copies,

370
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,340
sign to make it effective.

371
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,850
Do you know how to play the handkerchief game?

372
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,980
Handkerchief?

373
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,320
You know,

374
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,920
where you walk in a big circle

375
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,850
and drop the handkerchief.

376
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,120
The parents here

377
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,940
want their kids to learn that.

378
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,890
I'm a ballet dancer,

379
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,580
that's my limitation.

380
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,760
The students who come here

381
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,640
are all little girls,

382
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,600
and they love

383
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,660
fans, silk ribbons, and such things.

384
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
But it's up to you.

385
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,690
Please sign.

386
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,000
Brother Gang probably thinks

387
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,530
he's signing his life away.

388
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,200
This place

389
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
is a legitimate company,

390
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,650
we need proper employment contracts,

391
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,040
otherwise you'd be working illegally.

392
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,240
My life is

393
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,720
completely going downhill.

394
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,960
You still look down on my place?

395
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,760
That's not it,

396
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm just

397
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,250
looking down on myself.

398
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,690
Then don't sign.

399
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,160
Qiao Guanghui did me a favor.

400
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,760
Qiao Guanghui made you commit a crime.

401
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,290
Are you committing a crime?

402
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,840
He wouldn't

403
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,600
make that kind of request.

404
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,640
Everyone has to step back from the spotlight eventually.

405
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,260
You're lucky if someone takes you in.

406
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,700
You're going to take me in?

407
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,010
Look at that smug face of yours.

408
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,480
No matter how desperate I get,

409
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,080
I'd never need your charity.

410
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Just give me a straight answer. Are you signing or not?

411
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,960
Hurry up,

412
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,090
make a decision.

413
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
I'm getting annoyed.

414
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,770
What are you annoyed about?

415
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,180
Did you know Director Song likes you?

416
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,740
Has for a long time.

417
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,080
Tough love is still love.

418
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,540
Let me tell you, Zhao Gang,

419
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,400
what you really need is someone like Director Song,

420
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,560
a strong woman to whip you into shape.

421
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,960
Your career has been brilliant for half your life,

422
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,920
and now a late-life romance

423
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,120
is starting to bloom.

424
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,640
How unfair of heaven,

425
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,890
you get all the good things in life.

426
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,700
Late-life romance my ass!

427
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,730
I'm not signing.

428
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,600
I can handle attending classes,

429
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,460
but mentally I just can't take it.

430
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,200
Thanks,

431
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
you really made things clear for me.

432
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,920
I'm really anxious for you guys.

433
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,930
So I guess I do like him then.

434
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,860
If you like him, I'm happy for you.

435
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,650
That's really profound of you.

436
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,610
Are you going to Babaoshan?

437
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,000
Xiaomi and Xiaoyao

438
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,300
have already left.

439
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,060
I'll wait for you downstairs.

440
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,820
The pajamas are new

441
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,130
and freshly washed.

442
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,160
Toothbrush and toothpaste are here,

443
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,720
towels and socks are packed together,

444
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,780
separate them yourself at the hotel.

445
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,600
I didn't touch the two qipaos,

446
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
they're the ones

447
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,660
made by Mrs. Xu.

448
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,720
Yes.

449
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,160
When I get to Beijing,

450
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,120
I'll give them to Wen Xiaoyao.

451
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,640
These two pieces themselves.

452
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,300
It's also made for her mother.

453
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,720
So you're taking this group photo too.

454
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,520
Show it to her.

455
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,010
Take it out of the frame.

456
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,560
Otherwise

457
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,760
it might get crushed.

458
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,380
If I take it out,

459
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,050
the photo will get damaged.

460
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,900
I've watered the flowers.

461
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,560
If you come back,

462
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,120
spray them once a day.

463
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
Is there anything else?

464
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,690
I also have a bag with me.

465
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,840
How long will you be gone?

466
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Two or three days,

467
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,930
maybe three or four.

468
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,560
Is that enough stuff to bring?

469
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,290
Yes, enough.

470
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,840
Can I not go?

471
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,240
No.

472
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,720
Think about it again.

473
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,440
I can't stay in Hangzhou

474
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,370
even for one day.

475
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,800
What's your plan in Beijing?

476
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,850
I'll definitely

477
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,810
visit Zhou Tong's home.

478
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,650
I'll ask Wen Xiaoyao to pick you up at the airport.

479
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,360
Is it okay to trouble her?

480
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,810
We're good friends,

481
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,490
what's wrong with that?

482
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
First time I've heard

483
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,130
that you have good friends.

484
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,250
When I was in middle school,

485
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,280
I had a crush on a girl in my class.

486
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,960
Later we became friends.

487
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,160
I knew

488
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,480
she only became friends with me because

489
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,610
she couldn't get into the inner circle

490
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,820
of four or five popular students.

491
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,050
We were close for about two months.

492
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,450
No matter how serious I was,

493
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,980
she'd leave me the moment they beckoned.

494
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,770
We haven't been in touch since.

495
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,840
The fact that you mention you haven't been in touch

496
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,640
means

497
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,740
you still haven't forgotten her.

498
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,320
If I had truly been heartbroken then,

499
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,650
I would have truly forgotten everything.

500
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,400
I can talk about the past now

501
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,930
because I don't feel sad about it anymore.

502
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,050
Forgiveness and letting go

503
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,320
are just ways we comfort ourselves afterward when there's no other option.

504
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,450
Love is possession.

505
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,440
I've studied

506
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,320
the hormonal curve cycles

507
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,680
triggered by love.

508
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,000
At first, everyone believes it will last forever,

509
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,730
but it's actually quite brief.

510
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,120
It's precisely because it's so short

511
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,450
that we can't accept it.

512
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,680
Either you possess someone else,

513
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,640
or you're possessed by someone else.

514
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,900
And everyone thinks they're in control,

515
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,330
but there's only one true mastermind.

516
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,720
Its name is love.

517
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
You're always right.

518
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,930
Wen Xiaoyao will take good care of you.

519
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,240
I don't need her to take care of me.

520
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,920
You must,

521
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,340
so I can have peace of mind.

522
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,900
Let me do it.

523
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,740
Don't be like this,

524
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,700
I'll be back in three days.

525
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,100
I'll be right here to pick you up when you return.

526
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,810
Let's go.

527
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,280
I'll call Wen Xiaoyao later.

528
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,920
Only you can call her,

529
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,250
I don't have her number.

530
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,680
Go inside now.

531
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
I'll wait until you leave first.

532
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,960
No parking allowed at 159.

533
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,420
Move along now! Get going!

534
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,080
Put the lid on.

535
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,890
The person is in the box.

536
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,480
The box is in the stone.

537
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,080
The stone is in the earth.

538
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,200
Your mother is also

539
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,640
in this place.

540
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Nothing we can do.

541
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,340
Everyone ends up like this in the end.

542
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,360
Let's go

543
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,080
home.

544
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,000
Home?

545
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,160
To my place.

546
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,730
I haven't properly cooked for a long time.

547
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,080
I'll make you a couple of dishes.

548
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,960
I want to say a few words to my mom.

549
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,850
Go ahead.

550
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,800
Good kid.

551
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,400
Dad.

552
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,360
Feeling sad?

553
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
How could I not be?

554
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,610
You and Miss Song are back on again.

555
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,090
If things work out between you two,

556
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,040
then Zhou Butong would actually be my brother,

557
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,320
half-brother, technically.

558
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,650
Are you out of your mind?

559
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,160
Don't worry.

560
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,170
Wait a moment, Xiaoyao.

561
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,280
Mom.

562
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,520
On the seventh of this month, I was in Hangzhou.

563
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,300
I visited Leifeng Pagoda,

564
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,139
so I couldn't come see you.

565
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,159
This is the last time I'm coming here to see you.

566
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,080
These past years

567
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,250
have been so exhausting for me.

568
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,170
Training every single day.

569
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,320
When I finally met Zhou Tong,

570
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,130
I thought I could finally catch my breath.

571
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,280
I wanted to build a home with him.

572
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,100
But he went over there too.

573
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,280
I miss him.

574
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
I miss him so much.

575
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,040
Hello?

576
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Xu Tian has already gone to Beijing,

577
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,240
to Beijing Airport,

578
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,120
Terminal 1.

579
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,220
Turn off the sound.

580
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,800
He's gone.

581
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
I checked online,

582
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,040
the plane has already taken off.

583
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,560
Lie down.

584
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,680
Don't think about anything.

585
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
I've handed him over to Wen Xiaoyao.

586
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,280
I came back to tell you

587
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,840
that he's been sent away.

588
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,420
You should go home,

589
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,410
no need to say anything.

590
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,490
Are you feeling better now?

591
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,010
Much better now.

592
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,090
Go take a hot shower,

593
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,820
get some good rest,

594
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,820
and wait for Xu Tian to return.

595
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,170
That's a relief.

596
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,960
You should stay here,

597
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,880
while Dad and I go back to Shaoxing.

598
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,080
I'll sleep in my dorm.

599
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,530
Let's cancel this room,

600
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,800
it's a waste of money.

601
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:49,960
That works.

602
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll ask Xiaoyue to bring the car downstairs.

603
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,060
I'll drive myself.

604
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,120
Then I'll call her

605
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,610
to have her put the oranges in your car.

606
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,920
Diandian,

607
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,960
did you get it?

608
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,600
I saw him.

609
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,690
Lighting Assistant

610
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,880
Production Coordinator

611
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,140
Production Assistant

612
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,370
Foley Artist

613
