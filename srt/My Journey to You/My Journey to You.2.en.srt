1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,990
Gong Ziyu.

3
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,550
I'm not trying to let them go.

4
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,670
It's just a trap.

5
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,790
Interesting.

6
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,670
I thought the most famous playboy of the Gong family

7
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,790
only knows how to play cards.

8
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,670
Then let me play along with you so that it seems more realistic.

9
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,550
Don't get me wrong.

10
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,550
I'm not mistaken.

11
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,990
I'm just making the best of a bad bargain.

12
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,390
Gong Yuanzhi.

13
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,550
They are all bride candidates.

14
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,470
You're being too negligent of the consequences.

15
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,910
You're indeed the most tender towards women, Young Master Ziyu.

16
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,390
But if there's a Wufeng spy among them,

17
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,990
they should all be executed.

18
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,030
They are already poisoned.

19
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,710
Without my antidote,

20
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,230
they'll just have to wait for their deaths.

21
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,590
Are we really going to die?

22
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,909
I'm scared.

23
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,830
Help me.

24
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,590
I won't die here, right?

25
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,670
I don't want to.

26
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,030
I don't want to die yet.

27
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,910
What are you doing?

28
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,590
Congratulations.

29
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,550
Your trap has succeeded.

30
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,150
The bug has entered the pit.

31
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,670
Bring the antidote to us in exchange for his life.

32
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,230
You can try.

33
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,110
Let's see if you'll die first or he'll die first.

34
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,910
What are you talking about?

35
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,230
Take her away.

36
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,390
Brother Yuanzhi.

37
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,270
You were reckless.

38
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,350
Young Lord.

39
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,990
I was desperate to save Brother Ziyu.

40
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,470
The acupoints below the knees are connected to the elbows.

41
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,710
When the elbows are numbed,

42
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,270
Brother Ziyu should be safe.

43
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,590
Besides,

44
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,910
Brother Ziyu had eagerly set up a trap.

45
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,110
I couldn't let his effort go to waste.

46
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,150
Didn't we catch her in the end?

47
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,030
Nonsense.

48
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,110
You obviously tried to kill me just now.

49
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,270
Brother Yuanzhi.

50
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,030
Next time,

51
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,790
don't be so reckless.

52
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,150
Yes,

53
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,270
Young Lord.

54
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,030
Morning.

55
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,590
Does it still hurt?

56
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,230
A little.

57
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,230
You were so brave last night.

58
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,790
You clearly can't defeat Gong Yuanzhi in a fight, but you insisted on...

59
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,150
Who can't defeat Gong Yuanzhi?

60
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,830
If it weren't for you hindering me,

61
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,590
it would probably had been a balanced fight.

62
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,470
Dream on.

63
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,270
Shut up.

64
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,030
I need to find someone later.

65
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,350
Don't follow me.

66
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,230
Wait for me here.

67
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,110
What are you going to do?

68
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,230
None of your business.

69
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,270
I swear on my conscience

70
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,830
that I really don't want to care about you.

71
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,670
Do you have a conscience?

72
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,230
I do.

73
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,550
But it was eaten by a dog.

74
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,430
Someone was here.

75
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,510
Chi, Mei, Wang, and Liang.

76
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,830
I heard that Wufeng assassins

77
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,110
are divided into four levels.

78
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,990
With your ability and skills,

79
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,350
you're probably in the lowest level, Chi.

80
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,830
Sigh.

81
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,710
It was such a good opportunity,

82
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,230
yet they actually sent a Chi.

83
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,590
Was this a suicide mission?

84
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,310
We Wufeng people

85
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,350
are not afraid of death.

86
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,110
Oh?

87
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,590
Yes.

88
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,990
Many people are not afraid of death.

89
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,230
But that's because

90
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,590
sometimes,

91
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,630
living is scarier

92
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,990
than death.

93
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,590
You must be the Gong Yuanzhi that they talk about,

94
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,590
who's adept at using poison.

95
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,470
Even if I die,

96
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,310
I won't drink your poison wine.

97
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,830
It's fine if

98
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,350
you don't want to

99
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,710
drink this cup of poison wine.

100
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,350
I need you to do something for me.

101
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,710
I'm willing to do anything for you.

102
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,950
I want you

103
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,710
to protect someone for me.

104
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,350
We're not going to die here, right?

105
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,110
Bring the incense burner to the brides.

106
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,950
Yes.

107
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,590
My young master.

108
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,710
What are you doing here?

109
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,230
I just came to look around.

110
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,350
Nonsense.

111
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,590
This is the Ladies' Hostel. What are you looking at?

112
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,830
Go to Wanhua Pavilion if you want to look at women.

113
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,590
Hey.

114
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,990
Young Master.

115
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,710
Hurry.

116
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,830
Guard the door.

117
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,710
Don't let anyone find out that Young Master here.

118
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,990
Or he'll be in big trouble.

119
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,830
Yes.

120
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,710
And I'll be in bigger trouble.

121
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,070
Young Master Ziyu.

122
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,710
Young Master Ziyu?

123
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,310
What is he doing here?

124
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,630
Why is he here?

125
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,070
Wait for a moment.

126
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,470
Young Master Ziyu.

127
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,830
Thank you for your help last night.

128
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,350
Don't call me Young Master Ziyu.

129
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,710
Call me Gong Ziyu.

130
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,470
Isn't it funny?

131
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,750
My name is Yun Weishan.

132
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,830
"Yun" as in the clouds,

133
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,350
and "shan" as in clothes.

134
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,990
The clouds are your clothes.

135
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,470
What a poetic and great name.

136
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,710
How did you know

137
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,630
I'm here for this mask today?

138
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,190
The coloring on this mask

139
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,110
is not ordinary oil paint or color paste,

140
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,990
but a very thin layer of glaze.

141
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,470
It's tough for ordinary craftsmen to create.

142
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,470
It should be made by a skilled craftsman

143
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,590
and expensive.

144
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,110
If I were the owner,

145
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,230
I would also be heartbroken if I lost it.

146
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,190
It has nothing to do with the price.

147
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,830
The main thing is that it can't be bought anymore.

148
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,070
Has the craftsman passed away?

149
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,990
You can say that.

150
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,510
Has your body been detoxified?

151
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,870
Last night, Young Lord sent the antidote here for everyone.

152
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,630
I'm fine now.

153
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,110
Young Master Ziyu.

154
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,230
This medicine is...

155
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,830
It's the Baizhi Jincao Tea.

156
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,590
I'll take it.

157
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,710
You may leave.

158
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,470
Yes.

159
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,830
When I checked in last night,

160
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,230
I had a bowl of

161
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,950
this Baizhi Jincao Tea.

162
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,990
They said that all outsiders have to take it

163
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,110
to resist the fog of poisonous miasma in Jiuchen Valley.

164
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,750
What's wrong, Young Master Ziyu?

165
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,230
Is anything wrong?

166
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,110
Oh.

167
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,190
No.

168
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,350
You must take this Baizhi Jincao Tea.

169
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,870
The depths of the valley

170
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,350
are scattered with rare herbs.

171
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,710
But there are also many poisonous plants.

172
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,310
The valley is constantly shrouded in poisonous miasma.

173
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,110
If a woman stays in the valley for a long time,

174
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,190
then...

175
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,750
What?

176
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,070
Then it'll be hard to

177
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,750
bear a child.

178
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,310
Miss Shangguan, please take the medicinal tea.

179
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,190
Do I have to drink it now?

180
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:10,990
Yes.

181
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,710
I'll take the medicine cup back after you finish it.

182
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,110
That's why the Gong family

183
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,070
wants to marry brides from outside the valley.

184
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,870
But don't worry.

185
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,470
This Baizhi Jincao Tea

186
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,990
is made for women to help resist the poisonous miasma

187
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,590
and nourish their bodies.

188
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,630
But this bowl of medicine...

189
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,990
What's wrong with this bowl of medicine?

190
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,470
Is there a problem?

191
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,350
A few pieces of rat poop fell into it.

192
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,430
Are you serious?

193
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,310
Guess.

194
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,710
Where did you go?

195
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,430
I've been waiting for you this whole time.

196
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,310
Aren't you a little too delicate?

197
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,270
You need medicine even for a minor injury.

198
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,950
This is the Baizhi Jincao Tea.

199
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,990
Why are you drinking that?

200
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,710
Are you out of your mind?

201
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,470
I wouldn't drink the Baizhi Jincao Tea even if I'm out of my mind.

202
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,310
Smell it yourself.

203
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,230
This smell is not right.

204
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,070
Is it poisoned?

205
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,990
I'm not sure yet.

206
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,750
But it's definitely not the original Baizhi Jincao Tea.

207
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,190
Who did this?

208
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,230
Who else could it be?

209
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,710
The person who is

210
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,030
most adept at using poison in the whole valley.

211
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,710
Gong Yuanzhi.

212
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,030
Ziyu.

213
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,950
Brother.

214
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,270
Did you go to the Ladies' Hostel

215
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,790
to look for Miss Yun Weishan?

216
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,470
Brother.

217
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,990
How did you find out?

218
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,710
Last night,

219
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,670
I saw her wearing your mask.

220
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,790
It's your treasure.

221
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,710
You wouldn't have given it

222
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,710
to a regular girl.

223
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,630
I mean,

224
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,630
how do you know her name?

225
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,790
It's my turn to select a bride.

226
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,790
About their family backgrounds,

227
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,950
personalities, and names,

228
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,750
of course I know everything.

229
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,710
Don't worry.

230
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,710
I won't choose Miss Yun.

231
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,710
Brother.

232
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,070
What are you talking about?

233
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,670
Young Lord.

234
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,470
Young Master Ziyu.

235
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,910
Lord Sword Wielder wants to see you.

236
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,990
Okay.

237
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,070
We'll be there soon.

238
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,310
Father.

239
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,990
I heard from them

240
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,310
that the identity of the assassin

241
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,630
has been exposed.

242
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,470
My brother and I...

243
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,430
Young Lord and I

244
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,910
planned to

245
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,430
use the mechanism in the secret tunnel to lure out the assassin...

246
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,630
I didn't expect you to have learned to lie.

247
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,630
How could Young Lord

248
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,750
be as stupid as you?

249
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,470
You fancied yourself as smart

250
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,630
and even want to get Young Lord involved.

251
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,470
Ever since I said I wanted to kill the brides,

252
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,470
it was already a trap.

253
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,510
Huanyu and I

254
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,950
have already discussed it.

255
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,470
Of course we can't kill all the brides.

256
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,310
Otherwise, there will be

257
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,710
no place in the martial world for the Gong family.

258
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,910
Then why did you

259
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,710
say those things to Ziyu?

260
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,710
He has been soft-hearted since he was little

261
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,270
and tender to women.

262
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,230
If he knew I wanted to kill those brides,

263
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,230
he would try his best to save them.

264
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,990
Are you planning to use Ziyu to lure out the assassin?

265
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,310
Yes.

266
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,990
Yuanzhi.

267
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,430
I called you here

268
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,230
because I need your help.

269
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,310
I'm at your service.

270
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,870
Brother.

271
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,670
So,

272
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,230
you all knew this was a trap,

273
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,710
but you didn't tell me

274
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,870
and made me think I was being a hero?

275
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,430
Let me tell you in advance, Ziyu.

276
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,670
With your temper,

277
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,990
what can you hide?

278
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,390
You're incompetent

279
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,430
and a failure.

280
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,750
Do you have that little faith in me?

281
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,750
Look at yourself.

282
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,270
You never focus on business.

283
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,750
All you know is to run to Wanhua Pavilion.

284
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,390
From inside to outside and head to toe,

285
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,550
what is trustworthy about you?

286
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,630
And what do you have in your hand?

287
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,030
Today, I realized

288
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,230
that there's something wrong with the Baizhi Jincao Tea

289
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,070
that's being sent to the Ladies' Hostel.

290
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,990
I suspect

291
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,190
that Gong Yuanzhi changed the formula without permission

292
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,710
to test the new medicine with the brides.

293
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,030
I did change the formula.

294
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,070
Ziyu.

295
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,230
Do you know what the effect of Baizhi Jincao Tea is?

296
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,150
To resist the poisonous miasma in the valley?

297
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,310
Then have you noticed that the poisonous miasma has been increasing?

298
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,510
You're always idle all day.

299
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,470
You never once asked about the affairs of the Gong family.

300
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,190
Of course you wouldn't have noticed it.

301
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,790
Because the miasma is getting worse

302
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,470
and the effect of the original formula is decreasing,

303
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,710
I asked Gong Yuanzhi to come up with a new formula.

304
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,430
Did you say he had no permission?

305
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,870
Do you think

306
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,950
all the Gong family's children are like you,

307
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,230
who fancy themselves as smart,

308
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,710
and take action before reporting?

309
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,230
Reporting to Lord Sword Wielder.

310
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,470
Young Master Shangjue has entered the valley.

311
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,750
He'll reach the Gong residence soon.

312
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,630
Lord Sword Wielder.

313
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,150
I want to go and welcome my brother.

314
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,310
Please excuse me.

315
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,670
Okay.

316
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,150
You may leave too.

317
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,230
Go back

318
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,670
and reflect on your mistakes.

319
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,510
You're not young anymore.

320
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,990
You'd better think it over carefully.

321
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,270
If

322
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,750
you want to continue to be a useless person,

323
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,910
you don't have to stay in the Gong residence.

324
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,070
I don't really want to stay in the Gong residence anyway!

325
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,910
You...

326
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,550
Ziyu.

327
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,230
Where are you going?

328
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,150
Don't stop him!

329
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,150
Let him go!

330
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,710
Seriously.

331
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,470
I can't even say a word.

332
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,310
Father, Ziyu...

333
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,430
He should go as far as possible.

334
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,470
He'd better not come back

335
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,870
and he'd better not show up at the wedding tonight!

336
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,670
Father.

337
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,470
All right.

338
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,750
Go and get ready

339
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,750
for your bride selection.

340
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,790
Why are you still here?

341
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,870
Go.

342
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,470
Yes.

343
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,790
Lady Wuji.

344
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,790
I just saw that boy running away angrily.

345
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,550
Did he make Sword Wielder angry again?

346
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,990
I'll have to trouble you to persuade my father.

347
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,990
On such a joyful day of Young Lord's bride selection,

348
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,710
why are you still fighting with Ziyu?

349
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,990
He's old enough to get married.

350
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,030
He's not the same kid that would just take your scolding.

351
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,710
You should at least let him preserve his dignity.

352
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,910
That brat.

353
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,310
When he was a kid, he was obedient.

354
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,070
But now that he's grown up,

355
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,710
he's getting more and more rebellious.

356
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,790
Whenever I see him,

357
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,790
I get enraged.

358
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,790
Tell me.

359
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,750
He's idle every day.

360
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,230
That's untypical of a son of mine.

361
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,990
You can say that in front of me,

362
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,950
but you must not say that in front of others,

363
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,710
especially in front of the two brothers, Gong Shangjue and Gong Yuanzhi.

364
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,310
You know

365
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,430
that's what he cares about the most.

366
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,190
In my opinion,

367
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,950
he is the most like you.

368
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,190
The two of you have the same temper

369
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,710
and are never willing to say what's in your hearts.

370
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,910
You clearly care about each other,

371
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,510
but you still refuse to admit it.

372
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,470
Listen to my advice.

373
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,230
Find a chance

374
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,870
to talk to him nicely.

375
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,990
You're not young anymore.

376
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,870
Just compromise.

377
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,950
I'm his father.

378
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,030
If someone has to compromise,

379
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,630
it should be him.

380
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,390
Fine.

381
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,910
He'll compromise.

382
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,390
Drink the soup first.

383
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,910
Before the bride selection ceremony,

384
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,070
the Gong family will arrange for a physician

385
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,470
to check all the brides' pulses,

386
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,470
evaluate their physiques,

387
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,990
and check for hidden diseases.

388
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,310
Then, he'll evaluate

389
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,030
your body postures.

390
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,310
After that,

391
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,470
you'll drink the Gong family's secret medicine to heal your body.

392
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,150
After all the assessments,

393
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,630
the three tokens will be issued.

394
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:53,870
The golden token,

395
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,750
the white jade token,

396
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,510
and the wooden token.

397
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,190
The brides who get the golden token

398
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,150
will stand in the first line

399
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,390
at the bride selection ceremony.

400
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,150
So, Yun Weishan,

401
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,950
you need to try your best

402
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,710
to get the golden token for yourself.

403
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,790
Why?

404
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,670
Why?

405
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,750
It's actually a wooden token.

406
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,150
At least give me a white jade token.

407
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,270
I really envy you.

408
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,470
Young Lord will definitely choose you.

409
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,870
That's not true.

410
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,990
Miss Yun has a gold token too.

411
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,710
Based on my understanding of Young Lord Huanyu,

412
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,670
he will definitely choose you.

413
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,710
He won't choose Miss Jiang.

414
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,310
Miss Yun.

415
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,630
Don't worry.

416
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,070
You know Young Lord very well.

417
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,870
We're all after him.

418
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,390
Of course we should know about him in advance.

419
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,190
You should stop pretending too.

420
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,990
Miss Yun.

421
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,230
Don't worry.

422
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,310
Even if Young Lord chooses Miss Jiang,

423
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,750
there's still the Gong family's

424
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,910
Young Master Shangjue.

425
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,550
Gong Shangjue is old.

426
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,790
He wouldn't wait for the next bride selection.

427
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,750
Young Master Shangjue's prestige

428
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,790
is not lower than that of Young Lord.

429
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,150
Miss Yun.

430
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,910
You must want to be the wife of Young Lord,

431
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,790
right?

432
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,910
I don't care.

433
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,630
Young Master Shangjue is a nice guy too.

434
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,070
Not him.

435
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,070
Why?

436
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,390
Because

437
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,430
I fancy Young Master Shangjue.

438
00:31:59,230 --> 00:31:59,990
Open the door.

439
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,710
I said, open the door. I'm going out.

440
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,790
Young Master Ziyu.

441
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,390
Today is Young Lord Huanyu's wedding day.

442
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,510
All the gates have been closed.

443
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,470
The Sword Wielder

444
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,870
has banned anyone from leaving.

445
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,790
Here comes Young Master Shangjue.

446
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,470
If Gong Huanyu didn't choose me as his bride,

447
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,190
would that mean I failed my mission?

448
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,710
If you fail,

449
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,390
you die.

450
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,510
I just finished reading the file you submitted.

451
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,510
Sword Wielder.

452
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:35,909
Come on.

453
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:36,630
Sit.

454
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,429
Sword Wielder.

455
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,270
I can stand.

456
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,469
It's okay.

457
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,590
Sit down.

458
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,989
I'll make us some tea.

459
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,070
It's late.

460
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,830
Drinking tea now

461
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,110
may give you a sleepless night.

462
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,469
Don't worry.

463
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,350
I couldn't sleep well

464
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,830
a while ago

465
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,910
and asked Yuanzhi

466
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,030
to make me an herbal tea that helps me sleep.

467
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,030
Why don't you try it?

468
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,790
The herbal tea Brother Yuanzhi made.

469
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,790
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

470
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,190
Sword Wielder.

471
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,950
Let me do it.

472
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,150
The Zheng family of Hunyuan and the Phoenix Villa

473
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,630
refuse to bend to Wufeng.

474
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,150
They want to seek protection from the Gong family.

475
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,950
But…

476
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,190
I see your dilemma.

477
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,430
Since the accident ten years ago,

478
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,590
the Gong family has been keeping a low profile

479
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,110
and gathering our strength.

480
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,310
There's really not much we can do

481
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,150
to help those two families.

482
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,070
Zheng Zhongyi, head of the Zheng family,

483
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,310
is a friend of mine.

484
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,990
I visited him

485
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,910
and explained the situation.

486
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,630
But

487
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,270
to continue their family line,

488
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,470
the Zheng family made their daughter,

489
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,790
Zheng Nanyi,

490
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,070
sign up for the marriage selection this year.

491
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,670
By this time,

492
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,990
she should have settled in the Gong Residence.

493
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,470
Thank you.

494
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,430
I just did my job.

495
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,990
I intended

496
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,470
to let you have a few days off.

497
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,990
But I sent for you at this late hour

498
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,910
because I have something important to tell you.

499
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,390
I'm all ears.

500
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,470
For the past decade,

501
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,390
the Gong family

502
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,830
has been accumulating wealth

503
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,270
at a steady rate

504
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,550
and become far richer than when the former Sword Wielder was in power.

505
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,470
Your contribution to the accumulation

506
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,070
of our family wealth

507
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,990
didn't go unnoticed.

508
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,990
The martial world thinks

509
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,030
that you

510
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,670
are the ablest one

511
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,430
among your peers in the Gong family

512
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,190
in terms of both martial arts and intelligence.

513
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,110
It's just empty fame.

514
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,790
Don't take it seriously.

515
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,910
Wufeng is afraid of you.

516
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,470
The martial world respects you.

517
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,470
But in the martial world,

518
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,270
in most cases,

519
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,950
fear

520
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,150
works better than respect.

521
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,590
Whether they fear or respect me,

522
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,110
it's because of the Gong family,

523
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,870
not me.

524
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,670
Shang, Jue, Zhi, Yu.

525
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,630
These four lineages

526
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,750
all have a role to play.

527
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,670
The Shang Lineage forges

528
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,990
and invents weapons.

529
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,430
The Zhi Lineage

530
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,910
creates all kinds of poisons and antidotes

531
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,110
that can be used with hidden weapons.

532
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,790
Brother.

533
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,790
These are the gunpowder and hidden weapons from the Shang Lineage

534
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,310
and the poisons and antidotes I made for you.

535
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,950
If you need anything else,

536
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,510
just let me know.

537
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,510
Of course.

538
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,510
The most important lineage

539
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,110
is the Yu Lineage

540
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,830
which runs the Gong family like a tight ship

541
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,470
so that I do my job outside

542
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,550
without worries.

543
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,470
Shangjue.

544
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,030
You

545
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,350
are a clever man.

546
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,270
I should apologize to you

547
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,350
for the decision I made back then.

548
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,030
The next

549
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,270
Sword Wielder should…

550
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,110
Lord Sword Wielder.

551
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,550
It's late

552
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,990
and I'm tired.

553
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,630
If you have anything to say,

554
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,550
just say it.

555
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,350
I've been thinking

556
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,950
about it for some time.

557
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,470
Father.

558
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:38,630
Father.

559
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,030
When you came in,

560
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,870
didn't the guards tell you

561
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,830
that I don't want to be disturbed now?

562
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,550
They did,

563
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,390
but it's something urgent.

564
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,070
Shangjue is not an outsider.

565
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,550
Go ahead.

566
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,390
I've found out the identity of the assassin

567
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,790
Wufeng planted in the brides.

568
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,990
She

569
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,990
is the second daughter of the Zheng family of Hunyuan,

570
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,110
Zheng Nanyi.

571
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,630
It's getting late.

572
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,070
I'll take my leave.

573
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,350
What should I do

574
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,750
if Gong Huanyu didn't choose me?

575
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,470
You have to figure that out yourself.

576
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,990
You're handy.

577
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,990
You'll find a way.

578
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,110
So, Yun Weishan,

579
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,470
you need to try your best

580
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,510
to get a golden token.

581
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,070
It'd be better

582
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,390
if you were the only girl getting it.

583
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,590
It's chilly tonight.

584
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,110
I'm afraid that you may catch a cold

585
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,910
and was about to close the window.

586
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,150
The wedding is coming soon.

587
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,990
Why is he going out?

588
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,350
Who do you mean?

589
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,830
Gong Shangjue.

590
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,070
Young Master Shangjue.

591
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,670
Who cares about him?

592
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,510
Just now,

593
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,950
I dreamed of my mother.

594
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,990
It must have been a beautiful dream.

595
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,110
People say

596
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,270
that dreams are the opposite of reality.

597
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,430
The more beautiful a dream is,

598
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,630
the sadder you will be after waking up.

599
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,310
Because dreaming of someone

600
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,150
means you can't be with them

601
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,630
or have lost them.

602
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,750
Now,

603
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,470
I can only see my mother in dreams.

604
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,950
So it doesn't matter whether it's a beautiful dream

605
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,990
or a nightmare.

606
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,190
Miss Jiang, you're here too.

607
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,630
It's a private area.

608
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,950
Do not disturb.

609
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,430
How private?

610
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,910
Who am I disturbing?

611
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,350
Why don't you make it clear?

612
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,350
Jin Fan!

613
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:58,830
Eldest Young Miss.

614
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,470
I…

615
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,510
What a surprise.

616
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,950
You're here too.

617
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:06,630
Eldest Young Miss.

618
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,190
What are you doing here?

619
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:09,830
That's my line.

620
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,270
What are you doing here?

621
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,630
I'm here…

622
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,510
Oh, Jin Fan.

623
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,150
You look like a gentleman

624
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,270
but actually visited somewhere like this.

625
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,790
Do I look

626
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,270
exotic?

627
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,270
Very exotic.

628
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,110
Yellow Jade Guardian.

629
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,990
Seriously?

630
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,470
Gong Ziyu is a regular here but no one came to take him back.

631
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,670
This is my first time here

632
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,110
but a Yellow Jade Guardian came to take me back.

633
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,830
Maybe it's because Gong Ziyu didn't dress like you.

634
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:57,990
The Council of Elders

635
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,750
wants Young Master Ziyu back immediately.

636
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,150
Sorry to disturb you this late.

637
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,190
I couldn't sleep

638
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,830
and saw the lights in Miss Shangguan's room still on.

639
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,190
so I came for a little chat.

640
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,350
Did I disturb you?

641
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,870
No.

642
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,990
I couldn’t sleep either,

643
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,430
so I came to chat with Miss Shangguan.

644
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,790
I thought

645
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,390
I was the only one who couldn't sleep.

646
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:30,470
It turned out that you can't sleep either, Miss Yun Weishan.

647
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,950
Earlier today,

648
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,750
I didn't get the chance to congratulate you

649
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,950
on becoming Young Lord's bride, Miss Jiang.

650
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,030
I envy you.

651
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,070
The fragrance in the room smells so good.

652
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,150
It's from an incense called Autumn Slumber.

653
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,750
It's a well-known incense

654
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,390
from my hometown.

655
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,950
Miss Jiang said she couldn't sleep,

656
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,910
so I decided to use it.

657
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:08,990
It helps with sleeping and calms the nerves.

658
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,750
If you like it, Miss Yun,

659
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,350
I have more.

660
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,470
Miss Shangguan

661
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,470
insisted on letting me try

662
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,670
some aged tea from her hometown in the middle of the night.

663
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:23,830
I'm afraid

664
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:25,350
I can't sleep well again.

665
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,910
But it's good.

666
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,910
The three of us can chat

667
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,270
and relax.

668
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,470
What were you talking about?

669
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,670
Why do you look like

670
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,830
you have been crying, Miss Jiang?

671
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,990
We were talking about

672
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,750
Miss Jiang's sweetheart.

673
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,310
Her sweetheart?

674
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,990
Miss Jiang

675
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,150
has a sweetheart in her hometown.

676
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,550
So she doesn't want to marry into the Gong family.

677
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,470
Tell me.

678
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,510
What can we do

679
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,470
to help her?

680
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:20,030
Miss Yun Weishan,

681
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,430
do you not like tea?

682
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,270
I'm a light sleeper.

683
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,350
Judging from the color of the tea,

684
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,310
it should be a strong tea.

685
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,550
If I drink this,

686
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,790
I'm afraid I can't sleep until dawn.

687
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,910
Please have it instead, Miss Jiang.

688
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,950
Don't be too upset.

689
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,470
It's bad for your health.

690
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,070
Yes.

691
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,070
Young Lord

692
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,830
has only temporarily chosen you.

693
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:57,950
The wedding has yet to be held.

694
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,870
Plans might still change.

695
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,350
It would've been great if Miss Yun were chosen instead.

696
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,830
It's rare for a bride of the Gong family

697
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,870
to have her heart elsewhere

698
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,550
like you, Miss Jiang.

699
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,110
They all say the Gong family is good.

700
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,030
It's a blessing to marry into the family.

701
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,590
When Yu Lineage comes to pick up Miss Jiang tomorrow,

702
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,750
I'm afraid the rest of us

703
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,790
will be ushered out of the Gong residence

704
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,790
and sent home.

705
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,910
You won't be sent home.

706
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,950
According to the Gong family's rules of marriage selection,

707
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,990
even if you're not chosen by the young lord,

708
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,870
all the bride candidates will be

709
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,950
given a good family to marry to.

710
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,270
First, these bride candidates

711
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,790
are the daughters of the Gong family's allies in the martial world.

712
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,310
The Gong family cannot embarrass anyone.

713
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:49,390
Second, the Gong family is very cautious.

714
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,590
It tries to keep people who come here.

715
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,070
Miss Yun and Miss Shangguan, with your beauty,

716
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,310
you will certainly find a good husband.

717
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,430
I hope so.

718
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,110
Besides,

719
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,030
Young Master Shangjue

720
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,990
and Young Master Ziyu

721
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,750
are not married yet.

722
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,870
So don't worry.

723
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,150
Miss Jiang,

724
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,590
you are so nice.

725
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,310
I wish that

726
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,270
your dreams will come true, Miss Jiang.

727
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,150
After drinking this tea,

728
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,750
I should rest.

729
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,830
We should rest too.

730
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,670
Did you do something again?

731
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,310
Of course it has nothing to do with me!

732
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,630
They said that the Elders wanted to see Young Master Ziyu.

733
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,670
Am I Young Master Ziyu?

734
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:06,790
Forget it.

735
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,350
No matter what I do, I can't escape it.

736
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,430
Let's wait until we get there.

737
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,270
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

738
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,910
Don't you have a mirror in your room?

739
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,750
If not, you should drink more water,

740
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,550
so you can see your reflection when you relieve yourself.

741
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,270
It may be a good thing

742
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,310
if the Elders were meeting Gong Shangjue or Gong Yuanzhi.

743
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:25,070
But we?

744
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,630
You and I?

745
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,110
The last time I went to the Council of Elders,

746
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,270
they almost skinned me before they let me out.

747
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,510
Look at what you're wearing. They'll skin you for sure this time.

748
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,550
What do you know?

749
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,670
This is the latest autumn and winter style from Jiangnan.

750
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:40,550
It's classy.

751
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:41,350
Understand?

752
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,990
It's quite mixed.

753
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:44,990
But it's not classy.

754
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,110
I feel cold just looking at it.

755
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,150
You might be weak and sickly,

756
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,470
but the rest of the world isn't afraid of the cold like you.

757
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:52,350
Who was it?

758
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:55,110
Who cried eating ice in the hot June weather?

759
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,990
You don't have the right to feel cold for others.

760
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,910
I was only seven then.

761
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,510
By age seven, your development for the rest of your life is determined.

762
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,270
Stop talking about this.

763
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,550
I'm telling you, it's all your fault today.

764
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,670
If it weren't for you,

765
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,150
how could such a classy person like me

766
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,470
go to such an unclassy place?

767
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,470
Also,

768
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,030
can you stop taking Jinfan

769
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,750
to brothels?

770
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,470
You're leading him astray.

771
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,470
I'm leading him astray, so you'll have a chance with him.

772
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,750
I have a bad feeling.

773
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:29,510
The Yellow Jade Guardian

774
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,310
only accepts orders from the Elders.

775
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,630
Looks like we're in for some trouble.

776
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,150
Truly, you get to see everything if you live long enough.

777
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,550
Maybe I will even see

778
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:41,630
the Red Jade Guardian in this life.

779
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,270
Is there really a Red Jade Guardian?

780
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,150
I think the Elders lied to us.

781
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:54,350
To me, Red Jade Guardian

782
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:56,910
is just like Nuwa and Fuxi.

783
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,430
They are all people from myths and legends.

784
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,950
Why did you change the subject again?

785
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:01,950
Let me tell you.

786
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,950
Drop me off at the Gong residence.

787
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,910
I can’t accompany you to the Council of Elders.

788
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,030
They clearly stated that they want you.

789
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,950
I'll now cut ties with you.

790
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:10,950
Sorry.

791
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:11,910
Then get off now.

792
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:12,550
Can I?

793
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,550
Stop the carriage.

794
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,430
Why did my brother leave in such a hurry?

795
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,590
This mission was posted directly by Sword Wielder.

796
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,870
I don't know anything about it.

797
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,350
Besides,

798
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,310
there is no checkpoint along the way

799
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:43,750
to tell where Young Master Shangjue is.

800
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,430
He went out alone.

801
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:49,870
He even left you behind.

802
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,110
Why did the lantern on the tower

803
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:55,990
turn red?

804
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,470
A red light warning.

805
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,590
It's been years since the previous one.

806
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,110
Whose funeral is it?

807
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,430
What happened?

808
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:21,270
Brother.

809
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,110
Come back soon.

810
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,030
Something bad

811
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,590
is about to happen in the Gong residence.

812
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,470
All female guests come out of the room.

813
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,510
Count the number.

814
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:24,670
My lords,

815
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,030
are you

816
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,910
looking for Miss Yun Weishan?

817
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,430
She's resting in my room.

818
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,950
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

819
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:36,910
Because...

820
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,390
Miss Yun Weishan seems to have eaten something wrong.

821
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,270
She has rashes all over her face.

822
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:45,950
She doesn't want others to see her like that.

823
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:47,070
And...

824
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,190
It looks very scary.

825
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,470
She's afraid of infecting others.

826
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,350
Miss Yun Weishan.

827
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:32,350
Please show your face.

828
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,550
You said she's afraid of infecting others.

829
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,550
Then why is she

830
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,110
resting in your room

831
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,950
instead of her own room?

832
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,270
Why is she in my room?

833
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:57,030
Yes.

834
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,390
I'm asking you.
