[My Journey to You]

3
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,070
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,030
Although you fought me with a saber,

5
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,930
all your moves

6
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,390
were sword lunges.

7
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,640
Besides, I happen to know the sword technique you used.

8
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,400
It was Qingfeng Nine Moves Sword.

9
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,039
It's a top-class sword technique that Qingfeng Sect keeps secret.

10
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,920
And Qingfeng Sect happens to have surrendered to Wufeng.

11
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:51,920
Tell me.

12
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,500
Who are you from Qingfeng Sect?

13
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,009
I'm not from Qingfeng Sect.

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,130
Even the legitimate disciples of Qingfeng Sect

15
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,860
can only master three or four moves.

16
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,180
There are only few people

17
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,140
who can master all the nine moves.

18
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,320
Yet you were saying you're not from Qingfeng Sect?

19
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,630
Nonsense!

20
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,729
My mother

21
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,890
is just an ordinary woman.

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,380
Father has been a businessman all his life.

23
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,040
Cut it out.

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,060
You've played that card when you were launching the river lanterns.

25
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,450
My father has been a businessman all his life.

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,730
He travelled extensively.

27
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,380
Fourteen years ago,

28
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,750
when he was transporting goods by water,

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,579
he found a swordswoman

30
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,829
hiding in a secret cabin at the bottom of the ship.

31
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,750
She's the traitor

32
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,060
that Qingfeng Sect had been chasing,

33
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
who's known as

34
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,380
the rare swordsmanship genius that may only be found once in 50 years, Zhuo Mei.

35
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,660
You saved her life,

36
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,920
so she taught you Qingfeng Nine Moves Sword?

37
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,100
Actually, my foster mother had her self-serving reasons

38
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,630
for teaching me the sword techniques.

39
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,640
She wanted me to avenge her.

40
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,420
Back then,

41
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,230
Zhuo Mei fell in love with a young man

42
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,250
and violated the discipline of the sect.

43
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,340
The sect leader back then,

44
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,540
who was also her peer senior, Dian Zhu,

45
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,510
punished her severely.

46
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,530
Back then,

47
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,810
this incident shocked the whole martial world.

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,200
You must have heard about it, right?

49
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:22,850
Yes.

50
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,030
I heard it from my mother that

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,620
Zhuo Mei's lover

52
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,270
lost his hands and feet, and had his mouth sealed.

53
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,000
He was almost lifeless when he was sent to Zhuo Mei.

54
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,300
It's said that Zhuo Mei couldn't handle the shock,

55
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,040
so she went out of her mind and killed a dozen people.

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,450
She ran away from Qingfeng Sect

57
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,170
with blood all over her.

58
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,940
Turns out Zhuo Mei who disappeared from the martial world

59
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,090
has been hiding in your place.

60
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,380
So you married into the Gong family

61
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,150
to take revenge on Qingfeng Sect with the Gong family's help?

62
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,950
Foster Mother passed away

63
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,870
a few years ago.

64
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,430
All those years,

65
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,010
she had been depressed and couldn't let it go.

66
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,710
Before she died,

67
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,510
she told my father that

68
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,829
if there's still a place that's peaceful in the world,

69
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,220
that is the Gong family.

70
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,680
All right.

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,370
Stop being sad.

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,950
Can I go to the back hill now?

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,430
Jin Fan.

74
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,380
If that trial

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,040
is really as dangerous as you said,

76
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,050
isn't it better

77
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,400
if someone takes care of Gong Ziyu by his side?

78
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,770
There's something

79
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,260
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,670
We're family.

81
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,430
Just say whatever you want.

82
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,190
I heard from

83
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,010
Shangguan Qian that

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,160
Young Master Shangjue and Yuanzhi

85
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,970
were very happy to know that

86
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,280
the Sword Wielder had entered the hill,

87
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,910
and they were talking about doing something.

88
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,130
I don't know the details about what they plan to do.

89
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,260
But they said

90
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,060
it wouldn't be easy for the Sword Wielder

91
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,750
to pass the first round of the trial,

92
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,650
so they'd have enough time to do it.

93
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,990
Oh my god.

94
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,360
What good could they be up to?

95
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,390
They really said that?

96
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,620
We must hurry up.

97
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,930
Let's meet up tonight

98
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,130
and try to send Yun Weishan over to Gong Ziyu

99
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,120
first thing tomorrow morning.

100
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,780
However,

101
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,270
scent tracking is the hardest one.

102
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,860
Besides,

103
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,050
the longest time the scent can last

104
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,550
is only 12 hours.

105
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,310
-No.
-No.

106
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,460
If we want to find the Sword Wielder,

107
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,020
we must go in there tonight.

108
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,460
We may not be able to see him

109
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,270
tomorrow morning.

110
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,960
Ziyu.

111
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,810
Elder Yue.

112
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,480
Why are you here?

113
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm worried that

114
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,380
you might be nervous

115
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,800
going through the trial for the first time.

116
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,940
So I'm here to walk with you for a while.

117
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,740
Ziyu.

118
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,120
According to the rules,

119
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,159
you have to cover your eyes.

120
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,600
Okay.

121
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,800
Give me your hand.

122
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,720
Come on.

123
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,300
Ah.

124
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,370
Slowly.

125
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,300
Jin Fan, where are you? Jin...

126
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,180
Jin Fan, you are here.

127
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,440
I've been looking for you.

128
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,440
I...

129
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,870
My Lady.

130
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,890
Can I help you?

131
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,620
Yes.

132
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,660
Let me ask you.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,770
Which color do you like the best, gold,

134
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,180
purple,

135
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,070
or golden purple?

136
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,020
I like neither gold nor purple.

137
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,940
I only like my green jade

138
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,240
and my black guardian uniform.

139
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,220
My lady.

140
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,670
I still have a task to complete.

141
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,910
I don't have time to mess around with you.

142
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,300
You have a task?

143
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,480
You've always been inseparable from Gong Ziyu.

144
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,990
Now that he's in the back hill,

145
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,300
you should be on holiday.

146
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,980
During the holiday,

147
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,170
you should spend some time on nice things

148
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,680
and nice people.

149
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,110
Before the Sword Wielder left,

150
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,890
he asked me to keep an eye on

151
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,150
Gong Shangjue and Gong Yuanzhi.

152
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,620
Are they important?

153
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,580
They are not,

154
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,540
but the Sword Wielder is.

155
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,500
So

156
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,960
who's more important, me or Gong Ziyu?

157
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,490
Gong Ziyu.

158
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,600
This way.

159
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:34,940
Ah.

160
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,820
Wait.

161
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,690
Elder Yue.

162
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,440
What?

163
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,490
Are you making a detour?

164
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,110
Why would you say that, Ziyu?

165
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
We turned left three times in a row,

166
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,780
and we took similar number of steps each time.

167
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,500
So,

168
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,900
are we back to where we started?

169
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,740
Ziyu, you're smart indeed.

170
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,690
But you are still wrong.

171
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,650
What?

172
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:06,810
Am I wrong?

173
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,660
If

174
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,790
the height of the secret tunnel didn't change,

175
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,780
then as you said,

176
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,300
we'd have come back to where we started

177
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,700
since we took three left turns or right turns in a row.

178
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,930
But did you notice that

179
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,860
the secret tunnel

180
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,650
is ascending?

181
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,850
I kind of get it now.

182
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,920
Alas.

183
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,790
Ziyu.

184
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,370
They all say you are unruly and rebellious,

185
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,820
but I always think

186
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,260
you are gifted, smart, and kind.

187
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,320
You're also amiable.

188
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,290
You know the names of all the servants in the Gong family.

189
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,440
So they all

190
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,700
favor you

191
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:47,950
and care for you.

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,000
But

193
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,230
you are too young.

194
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,370
Sometimes,

195
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,620
you make rash judgments

196
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,730
out of overconfidence.

197
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,970
As the Sword Wielder

198
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,340
this kind of rashness can be fatal.

199
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,210
Ziyu.

200
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,250
In your future life...

201
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:16,940
Here.

202
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,920
Look.

203
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,190
You'll have to

204
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,390
probe and advance in the dark a lot.

205
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,180
And by then, perhaps no one will guide you anymore.

206
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,460
Being alone in the dark,

207
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,700
no matter how hard it is,

208
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,410
you have to make the right decision.

209
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
I look forward to

210
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,740
the day you become the real Sword Wielder.

211
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,430
By that time,

212
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,680
I'll help you put on your Sword Wielder robe.

213
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,720
Jin...

214
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,430
Lady Wuji.

215
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,320
Why are you here?

216
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,240
I heard from the servants that you are here.

217
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,130
You are the Eldest Young Miss of the Gong family

218
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,530
and the lord of the Shang Lineage.

219
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,270
How could you follow a Green Jade Guardian around all day?

220
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,800
What a disgrace.

221
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,050
Jin Fan said he can't spend time with me since he has a task to complete.

222
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,520
If he said he has a task,

223
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,970
it must be something serious.

224
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,840
If you keep interfering,

225
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,790
he will only be more disgusted,

226
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,690
distant, and alienated.

227
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:29,910
I know.

228
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,150
But I just want to keep him company.

229
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,080
Have you heard

230
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,450
a joke rumored among the servants?

231
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,760
The lord of Shang Lineage has three things to do every day.

232
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,240
Eating, sleeping and looking for Jin Fan.

233
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,940
I also want to fulfill the responsibilities of the lord of the Shang Lineage,

234
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,270
but no one takes me seriously.

235
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,530
Father...

236
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,880
Father is just waiting for my younger brother to grow up.

237
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,300
Everyone knows that

238
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,940
I'm just temporary.

239
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,750
My Lady.

240
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,020
Yes?

241
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,210
Tell me.

242
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,860
Why doesn't Jin Fan like me?

243
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,480
The world is vast.

244
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,010
Everything has a reason

245
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,650
and can be figured out,

246
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,250
except love.

247
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,480
Love is inexplicable,

248
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,140
and can't be forced.

249
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,730
But I must force it.

250
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,850
I must get Jin Fan to like me.

251
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,700
My Lady.

252
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,820
Check out the orchids.

253
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,080
This is the third time they've bloomed this year.

254
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,060
The Sword Wielder is so thoughtful.

255
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,640
I'll get the scissors,

256
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,130
lop several branches off,

257
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,690
-and put them in the vase.
-No need.

258
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,060
Throw them away.

259
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,370
Don't you always like orchids?

260
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,960
The flowers only bloom forcibly

261
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,320
after I've used all kinds of means

262
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,890
and tricks.

263
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,230
They smell bitter.

264
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:42,940
Ouch.

265
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,580
Ah.

266
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,500
Why are you so careless?

267
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:47,940
Don't move.

268
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,820
It's not a big deal if you want to force it.

269
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,420
I'm just afraid that you may hurt others

270
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,540
and yourself.

271
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,260
It seems to hurt

272
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,660
no matter I force it or not.

273
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,460
Poor girl.

274
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,010
Sometimes, taking a step back works better

275
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,240
than pushing too hard.

276
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,620
If one day, you don't like him anymore,

277
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,190
maybe he'll start to like you.

278
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,930
By then,

279
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,530
Jin Fan will be the one to follow you around all day.

280
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,490
You will understand.

281
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,110
Ziyu.

282
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,830
What you are carrying is not your own fate,

283
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,280
but the future

284
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,090
of the whole Gong family.

285
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,700
No matter how hard it is,

286
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,000
you must make the right decision.

287
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,710
[Back hill of the Gong Residence, Xue Lineage]

288
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,850
Ziyu.

289
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,940
You may take off the black cloth and open your eyes now.

290
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,440
The entrance to the Xue Lineage is right ahead.

291
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,530
It's also the first realm you'll be facing.

292
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,390
If you have a thick coat with you, put it on here.

293
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
You'll be surrounded by snow and frost-covered leaves.

294
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Keep yourself warm.

295
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,140
I'll stop here since there's someone waiting for you ahead.

296
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,330
Ziyu.

297
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,810
Take care.

298
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,800
Brewing wine with fresh tea.

299
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,470
Melting snow with birchleaf pear.

300
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,640
It's quite poetic.

301
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,840
Young Master Ziyu.

302
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,150
Or,

303
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,300
maybe I should call you Lord Sword Wielder.

304
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,599
Well.

305
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,280
Just call me Gong Ziyu.

306
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,040
It'll be more appropriate to call me Lord Sword Wielder

307
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,490
after I pass this round.

308
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,500
It won't be enough to pass this round only.

309
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,839
What's your name, please?

310
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,099
My surname is Xue.

311
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,470
Xue from "feng hua xue yue", as in the idiom describing romance.

312
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,220
You can call me Young Master Xue, Lord Sword Wielder.

313
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,220
So,

314
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,730
you are a descendant of Elder Xue?

315
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,330
Yes.

316
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,380
I've never heard Elder Xue talk about it.

317
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,780
No one of the Xue family

318
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,300
is allowed to leave the back hill except Elder Xue.

319
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,180
We live here all year long.

320
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,570
Of course he wouldn't talk about us.

321
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,780
What about your other clansmen?

322
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,290
Why are the two of you here by yourselves?

323
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,970
They're not part of your trial,

324
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,720
so there's no need for them to show up.

325
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,230
I grew up in the front hill.

326
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,880
I didn't know

327
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,060
the back hill of the Gong Residence is so extensive.

328
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,460
You are the Trial Keeper of the first round.

329
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,130
Does that mean

330
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,620
the other two clans

331
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,200
also live in the back hill of the Gong Residence?

332
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,660
Young Master Ziyu, you're quick-witted.

333
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,970
After you pass this trial,

334
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,800
you will get to know

335
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,980
the whole picture of the back hill, Lord Sword Wielder.

336
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,220
Looks like there are quite a lot of secrets

337
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,260
in the back hill of the Gong Residence.

338
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,440
It's getting late.

339
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,450
Rest early, Young Master Ziyu.

340
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,790
We'll officially start the trial

341
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,370
tomorrow morning.

342
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,380
There's no need to wait for tomorrow.

343
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,420
Let's start today.

344
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,490
I'm not tired,

345
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,780
and I don't need to rest.

346
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,700
I heard that you made a promise to someone

347
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,760
that you'd pass the trial in three months, Young Master Ziyu.

348
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,700
Is that why you're in such a hurry?

349
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,770
Not for that.

350
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,970
You should take a rest, Young Master Ziyu.

351
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,250
There's no rush.

352
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,760
Xue Chongzi.

353
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,470
Please.

354
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,640
The baggage is heavy.

355
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,960
I've prepared an outfit that you can move around easily in for you.

356
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,850
Thank you, Guardian Jin.

357
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,830
He's only giving this to you because it's his job.

358
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,080
It's not personal.

359
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,800
Don't overthink.

360
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,820
Her Ladyship and I

361
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,860
will distract

362
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,930
the guardians at the entrance of the secret tunnel to the back hill.

363
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,250
Wait for the right time to enter.

364
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,370
There should be mechanisms in the secret tunnel.

365
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,300
Be careful.

366
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,780
Also,

367
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,630
before entering the back hill,

368
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,810
there's something I need to give you.

369
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,530
Young Master Yue asked me to bring him these herbs.

370
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,920
Please give it to him.

371
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,860
Help!

372
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,670
Oh my god!

373
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,140
It sounds like Eldest Young Miss.

374
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,450
Eldest Young Miss?

375
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,670
Help!

376
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,900
Are you not familiar with

377
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,860
Eldest Young Miss's voice?

378
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,990
How could I be familiar with it?

379
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,320
What do you mean?

380
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,950
I, Gong Zishang, am so beautiful,

381
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,940
gorgeous, and charming.

382
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,630
Am I going to die here today?

383
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,240
Come with me to save Eldest Young Miss.

384
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,590
Let's go!

385
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,860
[Feng]

386
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,170
The longest time the scent can last

387
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,780
is only 12 hours.

388
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,890
The longer the time, the lighter the smell,

389
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,200
and the harder it is to track.

390
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,380
You have to hurry.

391
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,700
The scent is already faint.

392
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,710
I can hardly smell anything but burning candles.

393
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,660
You can go.

394
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,580
I can handle it myself.

395
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,880
Oh.

396
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,740
So you can't speak.

397
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,290
But I don't know sign language.

398
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,540
Oh.

399
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,460
I got that.

400
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,520
There are fewer and fewer snow lotuses this year.

401
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,050
It seems the miasma in the back hill

402
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,470
is getting worse.

403
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,520
I wonder when the miasma will fade.

404
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,420
If the new Sword Wielder can ascend the throne as soon as possible,

405
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,680
I hope he can make a difference.

406
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,700
You have expectations for him?

407
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,840
Don't you?

408
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,910
When Gong Shangjue was trapped for 12 days,

409
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,400
he was almost lifeless when he came out.

410
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,470
His vitality was greatly damaged.

411
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,800
Even Gong Shangjue was like that.

412
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,830
How good do you think Gong Ziyu can be?

413
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,660
Let him try.

414
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,890
Go wake him up.

415
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,760
I'm ready.

416
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,510
Let's go.

417
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,810
You don't need to go anywhere.

418
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,250
Here is where the trial is.

419
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,250
Young Master Ziyu.

420
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,420
This is where the first round

421
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,550
of the Trial of the Three Realms is,

422
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,030
Ice Lotus Pool.

423
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,660
Ice Pool...

424
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,450
I heard it from the front hill

425
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,620
that you've had poor circulation since you were a kid.

426
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,810
You were born incapable of handling the cold.

427
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,550
Yes.

428
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,750
Everyone knows that I have cold intolerance.

429
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,480
This round wasn't deliberately designed

430
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,360
to target me, was it?

431
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,370
You're quite self-complacent, Sword Wielder.

432
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,990
The Ice Lotus Pool

433
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,830
has always been the first round for trial takers.

434
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,640
It's been like this

435
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,680
for over a hundred years.

436
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,380
The water here

437
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,230
is icy

438
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,730
and extremely freezing,

439
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,160
but it never freezes.

440
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,450
There's a box made of black iron at the bottom of the pool.

441
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,270
In it is the Xue family's Saber Scripture,

442
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,920
The Snow Three Moves Saber.

443
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,170
As long as you can dive into the Ice Pool

444
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,970
and get the Scripture,

445
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,650
you'll pass this round of trial.

446
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,950
Dive in...

447
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,490
If you think you can't do it,

448
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,980
just leave the Xue Lineage

449
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,920
and give up, Sword Wielder.

450
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,720
You don't have to be cornered

451
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,480
or suffer from it.

452
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,230
Loosen the soil over there more.

453
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,640
What are you doing?

454
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,500
Young Master Shangjue.

455
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,760
We're planting flowers.

456
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,720
Planting flowers?

457
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,460
Planting flowers...

458
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,530
Brother.

459
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,010
Miss Shangguan said

460
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,410
the orchids in the Yu Lineage bloomed.

461
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,380
They're very beautiful.

462
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,700
So

463
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,610
she gathered us to plant azaleas.

464
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,260
She said when spring comes,

465
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,060
they'd bloom even more beautifully than the orchids in the Yu Lineage.

466
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,060
You're speculating about my preferences again.

467
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,240
Why don't you kneel?

468
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,050
Brother wasn't asking you to kneel.

469
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,060
He was just asking why you didn't kneel.

470
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,170
Brother Yuanzhi, you're good at reading Young Master Shangjue's mind,

471
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,920
while Young Master Shangjue is good at putting people through the mill.

472
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,460
It's wrong no matter I kneel

473
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,150
or not.

474
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,490
I grew up with my brother,

475
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,060
yet I dare not speculate about him.

476
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,000
Wipe your face clean.

477
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,740
The most important thing for a girl

478
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,430
is to be clean.

479
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,070
A clean family,

480
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,450
a clean face,

481
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,120
and clean hands.

482
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,840
You are right, Young Master Shangjue.

483
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,650
Remove all these messy flowers.

484
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,660
Only keep the white ones.

485
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,160
Young Master Shangjue said he only wants the white azaleas.

486
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,970
Sorry, everyone.

487
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,130
What's wrong?

488
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,170
Young Master Shangjue said he wants the white azaleas.

489
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,950
Yes.

490
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,690
Sorry that the whole morning's work went to waste.

491
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,220
No, Miss Shangguan.

492
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,470
It’s really something.

493
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,110
Yes.

494
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,390
I've been in the Jue Lineage for a long time.

495
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,230
I've only heard Young Master say no,

496
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,480
or what he didn't want.

497
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,580
This is the first time I've heard him say what he wants.

498
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,770
Yes, Miss Shangguan.

499
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,940
You've only been here for a short while,

500
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,890
and Young Master started to eat chicken and fish,

501
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,850
and he started to ask for things he wants.

502
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,170
What will it be like when you officially get married?

503
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,580
Stop making fun of me.

504
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,240
It must be because Young Master Gongjue couldn't bear to see

505
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,490
your hard work go to waste.

506
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,390
Sorry that I was reckless.

507
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,780
I'll go brew some sugared water for you in the kitchen.

508
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,540
Thank you.

509
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,260
Miss Shangguan.

510
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,320
Once the trial begins,

511
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,980
if you feel it's too hard,

512
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,870
get hurt,

513
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,780
or want to reconsider how to pass it,

514
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,850
you can return to your room anytime.

515
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,610
There's no limit to

516
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,500
when you want to try it again

517
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,400
and how many times you want to try.

518
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,100
However, if you leave the Xue Lineage halfway,

519
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,650
it means you fail the trial.

520
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,250
Young Master Ziyu.

521
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,300
Take care.

522
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,060
Although Yun prepared winter clothes for me,

523
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,820
I can't dive in the water with my clothes on.

524
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,430
Stop crying. Save your energy.

525
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,930
Otherwise, you'll feel colder.

526
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,610
His meridians are different from ordinary people.

527
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,040
He's born with poor circulation.

528
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,390
That's why he can't stand the cold.

529
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,740
So, shall we take him back and make adjustments to his meridians?

530
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,580
There're some snow lotuses left.

531
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,690
What adjustments?

532
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,060
He's from the front hill,

533
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,120
and he's not here for the trial.

534
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,090
He must have got in by mistake.

535
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,410
Just send him back.

536
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,230
So I've really been here.

537
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,620
Lady Wuji.

538
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,020
Young Masters.

539
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,750
Why didn't you give me a heads-up before you came?

540
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,170
I didn't even get to prepare hot tea for you.

541
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,719
How rude of me.

542
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,230
My apologies

543
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,380
if we offended you, My Lady.

544
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,400
We're here

545
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,230
for Gong Ziyu's background.

546
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,110
Have you forgotten?

547
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,210
I'm from the Yu Lineage.

548
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,510
Although I'm not Ziyu's birth mother,

549
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,550
everyone in the Gong family knows that

550
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,710
I'm Ziyu's mother nominally.

551
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,190
That doesn't stand in the way of our cooperation.

552
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,550
Cooperation?

553
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,690
Fair cooperation.

554
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,630
We each get what we need.

555
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,990
I've been in the Gong family for so many years.

556
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,400
I've got everything I want.

557
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,070
The Lantern Festival is coming.

558
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,790
Lady Wuji.

559
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,240
Don't you want to take a walk in the streets

560
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,780
and enjoy the lanterns?

561
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,120
I'm old.

562
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,080
I don't want to go to lively places anymore.

563
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,630
I don't mind it.

564
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,340
In this vast world,

565
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,450
there must be a quiet place where people rarely go.

566
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,160
Don't you want to

567
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,660
walk freely somewhere, Lady Wuji?

568
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,520
I can help you leave the Gong family,

569
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,890
and I promise that you can live carefreely ever after.

570
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,310
The Gong family

571
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,050
will never come to bother you.

572
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,420
Is Gong Ziyu's background

573
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,010
really that important to you?

574
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,160
I don't care about his background.

575
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,080
But if he wants to be the Sword Wielder,

576
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,050
I must find it out.

577
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,340
It's been a long time.

578
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,230
There are many details

579
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,190
I need time to recall.

580
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,640
If you remember anything,

581
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,410
come to me anytime.

582
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,130
We'll leave now.

583
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,780
It's already midnight.

584
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,760
You're always up so late?

585
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,260
Time is money.

586
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,920
Then why are you busy

587
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,420
following Jin Fan around during the day all the time?

588
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,980
The "money" I was talking about

589
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,810
is Jin Fan.

590
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,920
I cherish every second I get to spend with him.

591
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,640
That's why I have to work hard at night.

592
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,260
Laugh if you want. No need to hold it in.

593
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,420
Others laugh at you,

594
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,420
but I only feel sorry for you.

595
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,100
Could it be that

596
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,160
it's the other way around?

597
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,060
You're so tired, living like this.

598
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,020
Does Gong Shangjue ever say he's tired?

599
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,510
Does Gong Yuanzhi ever say he's tired?

600
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,030
The lord of a lineage shouldn't say he or she is tired easily.

601
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,340
But you are just a woman.

602
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,700
So what?

603
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,390
I'm the person who'll revitalize the Shang Lineage.

604
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,100
Among Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, and Yu Lineages,

605
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,290
Shang ranks first.

606
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,150
Anyway.

607
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,520
Anyway,

608
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,000
I must make my father feel that

609
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,680
having a daughter like me

610
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,860
is something to be proud of.

611
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,180
It's so dark at night.

612
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,550
There's not even a mouse here.

613
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,550
Who will see how hard you work?

614
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,190
They only see you following Jin Fan around all day.

615
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,060
They only think you're the Eldest Young Miss

616
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,970
who's obsessed with male charm.

617
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,390
I don't care what others think.

618
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,720
As long as I know what it is myself.

619
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,670
We should live for ourselves.

620
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,600
Are you living for yourself?

621
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,080
More like you're living for your father.

622
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,490
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,530
It doesn't matter.

624
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,890
Anyway, before anything's achieved,

625
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,340
I'll just work hard in silence.

626
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,930
I believe that

627
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,110
one day,

628
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,600
I will make it.

629
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,150
One day, you'll impress the whole world?

630
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,180
Wrong.

631
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,990
I'll shock the whole world.

632
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,170
What we are doing

633
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,060
is something as powerful as thunder and fire.

634
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:55,960
Yes.

635
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,860
Why did you say yes?

636
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,110
I was talking to him.

637
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,340
Yes.

638
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,250
I've got the herbs.

639
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,830
How about we brew them into medicine

640
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,790
and send it to him?

641
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,050
I heard from the servants that

642
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,240
he had tried several times.

643
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,510
His vitality has been greatly damaged.

644
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,780
If he can't take it, he can return to his room anytime,

645
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,020
get his mind straight and 
his energy back,

646
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,090
and try again later.

647
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,840
You don't have to worry so much.

648
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,550
If only he's that

649
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,860
flexible and resilient.

650
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,440
If the rumors in the front hill are true,

651
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,900
he has a stubborn personality.

652
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,280
He'll definitely act tough.

653
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,190
Didn't you say the rumors in the front hill are untrustworthy?

654
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:47,780
You win.

655
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,540
Since you've got the herbs,

656
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,220
don't brew it into medicine.

657
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,700
It'll be hard to swallow.

658
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,790
Make him a bowl of medicinal porridge.

659
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,650
Put a snow lotus in it.

660
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,940
You seem to have a good impression of him.

661
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,460
I just don't want him to die in the Xue Lineage.

662
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,980
I'll go get the snow lotus.

663
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,220
Well,

664
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,780
should I get an ordinary snow lotus or...?

665
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,820
You asked me this question.

666
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,100
That means you have a good impression of him.

667
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,740
You're even willing to give him the snow lotus in the Ice Pool.

668
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,460
Up to you.

669
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,470
I'll go check on the person we caught in the secret tunnel.

670
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,820
Where is this?

671
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,530
Somewhere you shouldn't be.

672
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,750
Are you from the front hill?

673
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,870
I'm from the Yu Lineage.

674
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,740
The Sword Wielder left in a hurry,

675
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,610
and he forgot something.

676
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,590
So I came to find him.

677
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,940
I accidentally got lost in the secret tunnel

678
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,490
and triggered the mechanism.

679
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,580
The fuel in the candles and torches in the secret tunnel

680
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,840
is a kind of special kerosene.

681
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,370
There is a small amount of poison in the kerosene.

682
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,570
If it stays in your body for long,

683
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,390
your limbs will become feeble,

684
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,180
and you'll become unconscious.

685
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,330
Here's the antidote.

686
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:38,970
Thank you.

687
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,590
I believe everything you said.

688
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,000
But tell me,

689
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,020
why are you wearing the black night suit of an assassin?

690
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,830
Elder Yue.

691
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,680
Are you going out at this hour?

692
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,500
Yes.

693
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,050
I'm going to the Meeting Hall.

694
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,140
Oh.

695
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,630
By the way,

696
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,190
send these books

697
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,510
to the Yu Lineage.

698
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,820
Ziyu told me

699
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,190
he had read all the medical books he borrowed from me.

700
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,360
These are all new books.

701
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,000
Ziyu is still going through the trial

702
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,060
in the back hill.

703
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,780
He can read these when he gets out.

704
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:38,610
Yes.

705
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,180
Ziyu.

706
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,770
Hope everything goes well for you.

707
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,250
The porridge will be ready soon.

708
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,240
I put a snow lotus in it for you.

709
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,490
This is something that's only available in the Xue Lineage.

710
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,370
It can help you regain your inner power

711
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:31,940
and strengthen your body.

712
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,340
The Fortnight Flies are

713
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,780
starting to take effect so soon.

714
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,180
So,

715
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,930
we have to get something important achieved

716
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,940
before the deadline

717
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,350
of the Fortnight Flies.

718
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,790
Or,

719
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,780
do something that can satisfy Wufeng.

720
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,950
What you used is a sword technique, not a saber technique.

721
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,770
You're not from the Gong family.

722
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:30,720
[The Sword Wielder is injured. The Elder is dead. The dead is silent. The murderer is Anonymous. The best of men is like water. The sharpest saber has no blade.]
