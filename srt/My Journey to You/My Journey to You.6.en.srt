[Episode 6]

4
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,740
In that case,

5
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,390
I'll check again.

6
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,310
A triangle mark

7
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
is used to leave a signal for allies.

8
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,280
It indicates a direction,

9
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,570
or where something is hidden.

10
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,820
Young Master Yuanzhi, sorry to keep you waiting.

11
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,980
What's in your hand?

12
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,270
Nothing special.

13
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,670
Let me see.

14
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,140
My brother never wears

15
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,790
such a golden and flashy accessory.

16
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,710
I just want to make Young Master Shangjue happy.

17
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,640
I don't know if something like this

18
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,450
will make my brother happy.

19
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,260
But if I don't send you to him

20
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,690
before dark,

21
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,810
he must be unhappy.

22
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,960
A union of fish and water in broad daylight!

23
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,440
That's not how you use that phrase.

24
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,120
What a beautiful couple!

25
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,330
I actually feel a little sad.

26
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,880
How should I put it?

27
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,790
It's like when I have to let my adult son go.

28
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,140
I think you're taking advantage of Sword Wielder.

29
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,190
What are you talking about?

30
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,140
He's my brother.

31
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,720
No matter how handsome he is, we can't be together.

32
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,459
My sister doesn't filter her words.

33
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,110
Don't mind her.

34
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,780
However,

35
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,410
she's a kind and nice person.

36
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,230
Miss Yun?

37
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,640
Eldest Young Miss has a good personality.

38
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,170
She's not arrogant

39
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,430
and is friendly towards others.

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,310
I also like listening to her talk.

41
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,950
Then you're doomed.

42
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,050
She'll annoy you to death if she sets her eyes on you.

43
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,900
It's a narrow road ahead. Follow me.

44
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,930
You must be wondering why there are so few people here.

45
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,030
Young Master Yuanzhi, you're amazing.

46
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,540
You can read people's hearts.

47
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,540
My brother likes peace.

48
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,040
Unless summoned,

49
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,170
the servants usually won't show up on their own.

50
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,290
I see.

51
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,570
Is Young Master Shangjue in the main hall?

52
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,430
Should I...

53
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,670
Why the hurry?

54
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,260
I'm new here.

55
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,690
I should greet Young Master Shangjue first.

56
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,340
I should honor

57
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,710
the basic etiquette.

58
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,600
Brother treats you so well.

59
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,650
He was worried that you would be neglected

60
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,600
in the Ladies' Hostel.

61
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,850
So he asked me to bring you here ahead of time.

62
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,380
I've never seen him

63
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,909
care so much for a girl.

64
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,290
He won't blame you

65
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,670
if you greet him a little later.

66
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm grateful

67
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,190
for his kindness.

68
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,630
As such, I must further uphold my manners.

69
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,090
Why do you stop me?

70
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm just curious.

71
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,980
What kind of charm do you have

72
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,380
to make my brother fall for you all of a sudden

73
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,250
and choose to marry you?

74
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,870
Pretty women can coax people

75
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,920
and fool people.

76
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,980
You're too kind, Young Master Yuanzhi.

77
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,950
Young Master Shangjue had already sent someone

78
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,600
to check on Yun Weishan and my background.

79
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,340
Their method of investigation

80
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,790
is different

81
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,030
from my method.

82
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,090
What is this?

83
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,030
Didn't you say I can read people's hearts?

84
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,100
Then, let me have a good read of yours.

85
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,880
You know martial arts?

86
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,120
I never said I can't.

87
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,530
Are you scared?

88
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm not afraid of your investigation.

89
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,440
I'm just afraid of insects.

90
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,360
Leave the insect on your palm.

91
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,800
If you lie,

92
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,540
its venomous fangs

93
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,340
will pierce into your skin mercilessly.

94
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,340
In two hours,

95
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,330
your intestines and organs will rot.

96
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,510
Do you dare?

97
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,659
You dare not.

98
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,240
My feelings for Young Master Shangjue

99
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,790
are sincere

100
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,630
and genuine.

101
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,660
Even if you don't trust me,

102
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,030
you should trust

103
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,780
Young Master Shangjue's judgment.

104
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,540
You're right.

105
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,630
We have a long time ahead.

106
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,800
What is this impressive bug?

107
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,730
It can tell that someone's lying?

108
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,580
I lied to you.

109
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,540
It's just a medicinal ingredient.

110
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,460
In this world,

111
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,039
there's nothing that can really read people's hearts.

112
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,669
If there were,

113
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,409
it would have been destroyed long ago.

114
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,190
Shouldn't it be treasured?

115
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,510
How could it be destroyed?

116
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,290
People always say

117
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,060
they are chasing the truth.

118
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,160
But they are always running away from it.

119
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,970
People always say they despise secrets.

120
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,030
But everyone has secrets.

121
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,400
Even the abyss has a bottom,

122
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,130
but the human heart will always be unpredictable.

123
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,130
The human heart

124
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,580
is the most

125
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,130
vulnerable thing in the world.

126
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,860
Can I go see Young Master Shangjue now?

127
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,130
My brother doesn't meet guests at night.

128
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,440
Let me take you to the guest room first.

129
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,710
The servants will send the dinner

130
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,150
to your room later.

131
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,340
Thank you, Young Master Yuanzhi.

♫It's like a riddle♫

♫There's no answer♫

143

♫A world only for us♫

158
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,610
You...

159
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,130
What are you doing?

160
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,600
Young Master Yuanzhi.

161
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,950
What are you doing?

162
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,220
My concealed weapon pouch is missing.

163
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,920
What does that have to do with me?

164
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,950
Of course it does.

165
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,190
Search carefully.

166
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,100
Gong Yuanzhi.

167
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,350
This is against the rules.

168
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,570
Don't be guilty

169
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,900
if you didn't do it.

170
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,100
Otherwise,

171
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,560
you're suspicious.

172
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,140
I'm not suspicious.

173
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,150
But I have dignity.

174
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,270
Young Master Shangjue.

175
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,690
Young Master Shangjue.

176
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,700
Brother.

177
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,800
What happened?

178
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,590
Young Master Yuanzhi lost his concealed weapon pouch

179
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,840
and wanted to search my room.

180
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:25,780
You...

181
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,130
Brother.

182
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,510
When I went to pick up Shangguan Qian,

183
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,630
the concealed weapon pouch was still on my waist.

184
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,740
But now it's gone.

185
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,340
Back at the Ladies' Hostel's courtyard,

186
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,490
she suddenly fell down

187
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,770
and held my waist for support.

188
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,640
I didn't react back then.

189
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,160
Now that I think about it,

190
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,870
she must have stolen my pouch

191
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,420
at that moment.

192
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,170
Why would I steal your concealed weapon pouch?

193
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,660
I don't even know how to use it.

194
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,480
Brother.

195
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,220
My concealed weapons

196
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,820
are different from the ones

197
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,440
sold by the Gong residence.

198
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,850
The structure and poison used are completely different.

199
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,620
If someone were to study them,

200
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,350
the power and secrets of these concealed weapons

201
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,880
will be exposed.

202
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,430
Miss Shangguan, have you been out of this room

203
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,140
since arriving here?

204
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,400
No.

205
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,970
The food was sent in.

206
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,200
The servants can testify.

207
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,490
Keep searching.

208
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,220
Yes.

209
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,980
Young Master Shangjue.

210
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,850
Young Master Yuanzhi.

211
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,220
We didn't find the concealed weapon pouch.

212
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,100
It must be on her.

213
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,800
Young Master Shangjue, did you really choose me

214
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,220
because you wanted to marry me?

215
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,990
I am the daughter

216
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,730
of an upright and righteous family.

217
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,140
Brother, trust me.

218
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,680
It's definitely on her.

219
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,700
Miss Shangguan,

220
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,660
I’m sorry.

221
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,140
Search her.

222
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,070
Found it.

223
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,560
This is not the one.

224
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,450
It shouldn't be a jade pendant in the pouch either.

225
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,250
It was her last time.
Enough.

226
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,190
Brother.

227
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,630
Young Master Yuanzhi.

228
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,930
Lord Sword Wielder found your concealed weapon pouch

229
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,860
by the river.

230
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,190
I went to the Zhi Lineage earlier.

231
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,800
The servants said you are here.

232
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,100
Lord Sword Wielder told me

233
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,430
to deliver it to you in person.

234
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,610
If you refer to Gong Ziyu as

235
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,230
Lord Sword Wielder in front of me again,

236
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,220
I'll cut off your tongue

237
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,800
and make medicine out of it.

238
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,670
Leave us.

239
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,010
Yes.

240
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,900
Brother Yuanzhi.

241
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,170
Apologize to Miss Shangguan.

242
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,490
Brother.

243
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,360
I...

244
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,079
Miss Shangguan,

245
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,390
I wronged you.

246
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,680
Sorry.

247
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,360
You don't have to return it to me.

248
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,110
This was originally my gift to you.

249
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,810
I've always wanted to ask

250
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,040
where this jade pendant

251
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,880
came from.

252
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,160
You don’t remember?

253
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,830
This jade pendant

254
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,270
belongs to you.

255
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,260
Of course I remember

256
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
about my jade pendant.

257
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,490
I'm asking about

258
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,320
where you got

259
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,760
this jade pendant.

260
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,460
Brother.

261
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,150
You know my concealed weapon pouch won't...

262
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,310
Won't easily fall off.

263
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,490
But as you saw,

264
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,650
you can't do anything about her.

265
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,940
Even if I trust you,

266
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,330
no one will believe you.

267
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,520
Brother,

268
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,320
you lost

269
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,950
that round just now.

270
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,250
I was careless.

271
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,330
Do you know what tool lions use to hunt?

272
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,120
Their sharp claws and fangs?

273
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,700
No.

274
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,860
Teamwork?

275
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,330
It's patience.

276
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,940
Patience?

277
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,000
When a lion is not completely certain,

278
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,090
it lies in the grass

279
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,140
and stays as still as a rock.

280
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,490
It never acts rashly.

281
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,280
Otherwise, once the cows are alarmed,

282
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,380
it will not be able to catch anything.

283
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,220
If a lion

284
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,250
were as reckless as you were just now,

285
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,090
it'd starve for the day.

286
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,440
What's worse,

287
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,790
this lion may be isolated by other lions

288
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,540
and eventually be exiled.

289
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,120
Understood.

290
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,160
Brother.

291
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,680
What do you understand?

292
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,960
Things are much more complicated than I thought.

293
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,980
And more interesting than I thought.

294
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:20,880
By the way,

295
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,830
go back and

296
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,160
check the concealed weapons in your pouch.

297
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,380
If I'm not mistaken,

298
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,430
someone must have tampered with them.

299
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:32,950
Brother,

300
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,130
You mean...

301
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,720
There is someone from Wufeng

302
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,380
still hiding in the Gong residence.

303
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,490
Young Master Ziyu.

304
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,130
You dropped something.

305
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,620
Young Master Yuanzhi.

306
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,790
Lord Sword Wielder found your

307
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,130
concealed weapon pouch by the river.

308
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,120
Sister Zishang gave me this pastry.

309
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,390
It's really delicious.

310
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,420
I'll give you this.

311
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,980
Can you show me your little butterfly?

312
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,050
♫Will I see you again?♫

313
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,030
No.

314
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,070
Father said

315
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,460
we are brothers.

316
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,220
Brothers

317
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,590
must give each other the best things.

318
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,110
♫The summer we spent together is a blur now♫

319
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,030
I don't want to be brothers with a bastard.

320
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,060
I'm not a bastard!

321
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,460
You are!

322
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,360
♫Night breezes tousled your gray hair♫

323
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,600
♫You looked at me in silence♫

324
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,780
Mother.

325
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,050
They said I...

326
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,510
They said I'm...

327
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,610
♫When you put your hands on my shoulders♫

328
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,330
How can a boy cry so easily?

329
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,710
♫All my fear and hesitation were gone♫

330
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,070
How many times have I told you?

331
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,970
Remember to go to the clinic

332
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,280
when you're injured.

333
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,770
♫Snow falls, my wounds would never close♫

334
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,020
I don't want to go to Zhi Lineage.

335
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,170
Gong Yuanzhi called me a bastard.

336
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,280
I don't want to play with him.

337
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,770
♫I've been adrift for too long but now I'm home♫

338
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:35,950
Mother!

339

Mother!

340
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,950
Who made you cry?

341
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,820
Father will punish him severely.

342
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,630
Father, why is Mother ignoring me?

343
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,910
Well,

344
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,340
I can't help you with that.

345
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,150
Because your mother

346
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,960
is ignoring me too.

347
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,990
♫Yesterday fades like a distant mountain♫

This jade pendant

352
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,020
belongs to you.

353
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,940
Of course I remember

354
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,060
♫You whisper loving words in my ear♫

355
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,660
about my jade pendant.

356
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,230
I'm asking about

357
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,090
where you got

358
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,520
♫Yet we have no choice but to part♫

♫I hold the blade in my hand♫

Help!

366
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,340
Go!

367
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:06,920
♫And slice through the night♫

♫At the shore of the flow of time♫

377
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,640

Young Master Shangjue, you

379
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,400
♫I heard a door open♫

380
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,340
happened to pass by and rescued me.

381
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,620
♫The later the night, the warmer the heart♫

382
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,990
You dropped this

383
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,410
back then.

384
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,880
♫Yet the hug feels colder than the snow♫

385
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,720
I've always wanted to repay you for saving my life.

386
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,990
♫Why do we stand side by side?♫

387
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,100
You don't have to.

388
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,690
I was just dealing with people who were in my way.

389
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,360
I did not intentionally save you.

390
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,310
It was just a coincidence.

391
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,970
Don’t worry about it.

392
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,330
Even if you didn't intend to save me,

393
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,750
in my opinion,

394
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,180
you protected my dignity, which is most important to a lady.

395
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,230
As such, my heart already belongs to you.

396
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,370
In the past,

397
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,410
I dared not dream about it

398
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,120
due to the difference in our status.

399
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,260
I didn't expect

400
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,040
to be able to marry you now.

401
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,190
We're only engaged.

402
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,850
The Gong residence is huge.

403
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,850
Don't wander about.

404
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,750
Stay where you belong,

405
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,870
in the right place.

406
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,650
Don't take the wrong path.

407
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,430
I'll listen to you.

408
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,260
Miss Yun.

409
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,560
It's late. Why are you still up?

410
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,990
Aren't you still up too?

411
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,100
Are you not used to sleeping in a new place?

412
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,020
Shall I ask the servants

413
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,160
to prepare some soothing medicine for you?

414
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,950
Did I say something wrong?

415
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,710
You can't sleep either,

416
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,480
but you worry about getting soothing medicine for me instead.

417
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,470
Did I say something wrong?

418
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:21,900
No.

419
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,430
I just moved to a new place too.

420
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,020
They said I'm already a Sword Wielder.

421
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,600
So they moved me into my brother's old room.

422
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,420
Lord Sword Wielder.

423
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,640
These are the former young master's clothes.

424
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,620
The room

425
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,760
is filled with traces of his past.

426
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,060
The decoration hasn't changed either.

427
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,260
It's like

428
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,390
he never left.

429
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,240
It's almost winter.

430
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,650
It's cold at night.

431
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,810
But your face is full of sweat.

432
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,740
Did you have a nightmare?

433
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,830
Why aren't you wiping your sweat?

434
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,540
Looks like

435
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,110
you're used to being served.

436
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,480
Did others wipe your sweat for you in the past?

437
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,440
No.

438
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,690
Except my mother.

439
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,720
My mother

440
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,040
would wipe my sweat,

441
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,700
but she wouldn't wipe my tears.

442
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,850
Did you cry a lot

443
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,940
when you were young?

444
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,300
We all have things we're sad about.

445
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,890
But my mother told me

446
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,120
a man shouldn't cry.

447
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,410
So later,

448
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,310
I stopped crying.

449
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,960
I used to

450
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,210
often have nightmares too.

451
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,390
When I couldn't sleep,

452
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,780
my younger sister would sing for me.

453
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:31,400
♫The sun rises in the east and sets in the west♫

454
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:38,880
♫Our parents call us home for dinner♫

455
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:47,290
♫We grew up together♫

456
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,760
♫We never wake up from our sweet dreams♫

457
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:01,410
♫Spring brews life, and Winter brews coldness♫

458
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,920
♫You're always in my thoughts♫

459
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,750
♫Summer is long, and Autumn is brief♫

460
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,330
♫I hope we can reunite again♫

461
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,660
As long as I listened to her singing,

462
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,820
I stopped having nightmares.

463
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,340
You and your younger sister

464
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,080
must be very close.

465
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,250
You left Lixi Town

466
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,170
and came to the Gong residence.

467
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,620
She must miss you very much.

468
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,250
Thank you.

469
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,650
For what?

470
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,210
I didn't answer.

471
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,410
You didn't ask again.

472
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,080
Sometimes,

473
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,330
giving no answer

474
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,710
is also an answer.

475
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,980
I always wanted to return this to you,

476
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,200
but I didn't find the right time.

477
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,290
This ornament.

478
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,960
I saw you hang it on yourself every day.

479
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,770
It must be something you cherish.

480
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:12,950
Yes.

481
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,270
My father gave it to me.

482
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,060
My father used to be a businessman.

483
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,280
He had also seen all kinds of leather.

484
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,700
This fox fur

485
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,050
has a pure color

486
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,680
and a symmetrical pattern.

487
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,760
The fox fur is the finest.

488
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,370
Your father must have put

489
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,540
a lot of effort into finding it.

490
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,530
My father

491
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,570
had always been meticulous.

492
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,410
He had his intentions.

493
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,460
But

494
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,600
I'm young and shallow.

495
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,880
I've never understood them.

496
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
At the age of 30, people stand firm.

497
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,880
At the age of 40, people have no doubts.

498
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,610
Sword Wielder, you're still young.

499
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,239
How can you see everything clearly?

500
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,400
Why did you call me Sword Wielder again?

501
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,900
Didn't I ask you to call me Young Master Ziyu

502
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:19,969
in private?

503
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,300
Then

504
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,980
don't call me Miss Yun anymore.

505
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,780
Okay.

506
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,880
What should I call you?

507
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,699
Why don't you answer?

508
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,520
Sometimes,

509
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,239
giving no answer

510
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,719
is already an answer.

511
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,120
You're amazing.

512
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,290
All Gong Ziyu thinks about

513
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,550
is you.

514
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,690
But I'll still fail him.

515
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,390
You'll fail him.

516
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,590
You'll destroy his life

517
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,350
completely.

518
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,370
When there are rivers of blood in the Gong residence,

519
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,890
I really want to see

520
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,900
how Gong Ziyu will look at you.

521
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,860
When will Gong Ziyu go to the back hill?

522
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,830
Soon.

523
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,180
I'll try to ask.

524
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,580
Your task

525
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,400
is to draw a map of the Gong residence,

526
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,580
right?

527
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,550
For a long time,

528
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,230
only Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, and Yu have been known in the martial world.

529
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,770
I've never heard

530
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,700
of the back hill.

531
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,190
It's so mysterious.

532
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,810
I asked several servants,

533
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,520
but they said they didn't know.

534
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,290
If you can find out the situation of the back hill,

535
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,790
Hanya Si will be very happy.

536
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,370
I don't need you to tell me.

537
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,940
I'll definitely investigate it.

538
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,820
The back hill is an important place.

539
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,560
It's not easy to enter there.

540
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,290
I have a way to trail him.

541
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,220
How?

542
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,470
There are just several tracking methods

543
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,000
in the Wufeng.

544
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,580
Make inferences from traces.

545
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,940
Tail people in disguise.

546
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,350
Predict destinations.

547
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,050
Change shifts.

548
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,190
Yes.

549
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,790
There is another method.

550
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,920
Scent tracking.

551
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,460
But

552
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,010
scent tracking is the hardest one.

553
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,210
Why haven't I heard

554
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,160
people at the Chi level can do this?

555
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,600
There are many things you don't know about the Wufeng.

556
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,780
Fine.

557
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,620
Good luck.

558
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:12,730
Thank you.

559
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,670
Shouldn't you thank me too?

560
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,830
You're so bold.

561
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,830
Only risky moves

562
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,410
can bring people back from the brink.

563
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,150
Did you gain a lot?

564
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,160
It's enough.

565
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,420
Enough for what?

566
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,350
It's enough for me to survive half a month.

567
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,720
What about you?

568
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,830
I'm not worried about this.

569
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,530
What I'm worried about

570
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,820
is how we can go out

571
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,280
after half a month.

572
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,730
Are you telling me or not?

573
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,610
Are you telling me or not?

574
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,810
Everyone knows

575
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,240
the Trial of the Three Realms is dangerous.

576
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,350
You know something about it.

577
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,270
Why don't you tell me?

578
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,210
Are you still my Green Jade Guardian?

579
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,740
Lord Sword Wielder.

580
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,770
I've sworn

581
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,860
that I won't mention anything about the back hill.

582
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,340
Don't force me.

583
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,470
Recently, there has been a lot of explosions in the Shang Lineage in the front hill.

584
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,060
At first, I thought people from the Wufeng stormed in.

585
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,860
Later it turned out

586
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,930
that Eldest Young Miss Gong ZiShang was doing research.

587
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,130
It was just a false alarm.

588
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,350
What research was she doing?

589
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,520
I don't know.

590
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,630
She seemed to

591
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,460
combine gunpowder and weapons.

592
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,660
Isn't it a hidden weapon

593
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,020
made by Young Master Yuanzhi before?

594
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,670
Interesting.

595
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,090
I'm going to the front hill.

596
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,260
Forget it.

597
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,220
You don't want to tell me.

598
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,590
I can't force you to do it.

599
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,010
You don't want to leave.

600
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,030
I can't break your legs.

601
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,150
When I leave,

602
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,630
remember to keep an eye on Gong Shangjue and Gong Yuanzhi.

603
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,380
Lord Sword Wielder.

604
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,490
Please be careful.

605
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,140
Don't act tough.

606
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,810
You...

607
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,770
You refused to tell me, but you look like you want to say something.

608
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,850
Why are you so annoying?

609
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,990
It was nothing.

610
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,300
After hearing what you said,

611
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,320
I'm more nervous.

612
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,100
Lord Sword Wielder.

613
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,430
What's this? It's so heavy.

614
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,220
Miss Yun is so thoughtful.

615
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,380
She's already packed your luggage.

616
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,000
I heard from Guardian Jin

617
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,380
that

618
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,930
you can leave the back hill only after completing the first trial.

619
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,200
The back hill is damp and cold.

620
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,870
Sister Zishang said

621
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,410
you've been afraid of cold since childhood.

622
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:14,540
So I brought some warm clothes.

623
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,870
There's also alcohol.

624
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,900
Unfortunately,

625
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,000
I'll go alone this time.

626
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,460
Some heartless people won't go with me.

627
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,390
It seems

628
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,160
that I can only drink alone.

629
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,900
This is not ordinary alcohol.

630
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,750
The back hill has a heavy miasma

631
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,800
and high humidity.

632
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,390
Miss Shangguan had cold in her body before.

633
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,290
A physician in the clinic gave her a prescription.

634
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,610
I made the medicinal alcohol according to it.

635
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,940
It can prevent cold and damp.

636
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,590
There're also some cakes.

637
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,500
I'm afraid you won't like the food in the back hill.

638
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,710
By the way,

639
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,880
I made a pouch.

640
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,770
The herbs inside are for repelling mosquitoes.

641
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,360
My hometown Lixi Town was built along a river.

642
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,870
There are many snakes, insects, mosquitoes, and ants there.

643
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,220
When I was a child,

644
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,360
my mother always asked me to carry it with me.

645
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,230
Here is the Gong residence.

646
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,910
No snake, insect, mosquito, and ant can get close to me.

647
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,020
It doesn't matter.

648
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,320
You've already made it.

649
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,120
I'll take it.

650
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,090
Look at you.

651
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,380
You just came to the Gong residence.

652
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,150
You prepared so many things.

653
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,400
You must be tired.

654
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,420
After my father passed away,

655
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,110
the situation in my family changed.

656
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,830
Many servants were dismissed.

657
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,600
I'm used to working.

658
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,500
It's nothing.

659
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,480
From now on,

660
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,990
you don't have to do these things.

661
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,820
Let others do them.

662
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,170
I should do these things.

663
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,440
After all, I was selected by you as...

664
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,000
I was selected by you as...

665
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,660
As what?

666
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,950
Sword Wielder, is there anything else you need?

667
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,100
What's wrong with your eyes?

668
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,650
When are you leaving?

669
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,670
Three days later. It's the eighth day of the first lunar month.

670
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,950
It's unsuitable to farm but suitable to go out on that day.

671
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,900
Let me go with you.

672
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,360
I can take care of you.

673
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,720
I'm afraid you can't.

674
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,780
The offspring of the Gong family who go for the trial

675
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,620
can only bring their personal Green Jade guardians.

676
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,570
Be careful, Sword Wielder.

677
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,260
What went wrong?

678
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,570
What went wrong?

679
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:02,240
Tell me.

680
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,570
Why?

681
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:20,580
This is the room

682
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,750
of Eldest Young Miss who likes doing research?

683
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,460
The saltpeter produced too much smoke when burning.

684
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,470
The amount of charcoal and sulfur was obviously too much.

685
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,840
It burnt too fast,

686
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,000
so it was easy to expand.

687
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,270
Alright.

688
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,740
You don't need to clean here.

689
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,850
Yes, Eldest Young Miss.

690
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,820
I'll leave now.

691
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,240
Stop!

692
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,480
What did you say just now?

693
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:55,300
The saltpeter

694
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,510
produced too much smoke when burning.

695
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,190
The amount of charcoal and sulfur was obviously too much.

696
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,840
It burnt too fast,

697
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,260
so it was easy to expand.

698
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,590
What's your name?

699
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,340
Xiaohei.

700
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,660
Who do you work for? Why do you know these things?

701
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,820
My grandpa makes fireworks.

702
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,120
He's really good at it.

703
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,660
The fireworks made by my family were also set off in the capital city before.

704
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,080
Alright. Stay here.

705
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:28,920
To clean here?

706
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,480
Let's play together.

707
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,520
It's time to say goodbye.

708
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:45,670
Enough.

709
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,120
You two are heartless. Stop acting.

710
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,770
It's okay for you to blame Jin Fan.

711
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,200
Why

712
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,240
do you also blame me?

713
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,330
Sword Wielder.

714
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,650
Remember,

715
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,790
don't act tough.

716
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:05,280
Young Master Ziyu.

717
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,040
Let me go to the entrance to the back hill with you.

718
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:08,980
-No.
-No.

719
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:11,390
The back hill is an important place.

720
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,640
Outsiders are not allowed in.

721
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,330
The back hill is an important place.

722
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:16,500
People who are free are not allowed in.

723
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,540
People who are free are not allowed in.

724
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,340
We don't know martial arts.

725
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,640
We don't have many things to do.

726
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,970
The back hill is dangerous and terrifying.

727
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,200
Let him go

728
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,790
and have an adventure.

729
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,120
Young Master Ziyu.

730
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:31,720
Take care.

731
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,520
Wait for me.

732
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,010
[Gong Residence, the Entrance to the Back Hill]

733
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:48,800
Jin Fan.

734
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,930
Did you practise handstands after breakfast again?

735
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:51,840
You look so pale.

736
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,430
Jin Fan.

737
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,740
Do you know something

738
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,690
about the Trial of the Three Realms?

739
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,190
You're so nervous.

740
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,190
Will Young Master Ziyu's life be in danger?

741
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:14,920
You're so annoying.

742
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,040
Even a mute is not as annoying as you. Say something.

743
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,690
Jin Fan.

744
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,310
I know you swore

745
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:21,790
that you won't mention anything about the back hill.

746
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,060
You don't have to say anything.

747
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,380
Just nod or shake your head.

748
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,930
It's not a violation of your vow.

749
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,450
Will his life be in danger

750
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,380
in the Trial of the Three Realms?

751
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:44,640
Do you know

752
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:46,790
what the first trial is?

753
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,690
Does it test his intelligence?

754
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:53,900
Does it test his martial art skill?

755
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,130
Does it test his zero-gravity martial art skill?

756
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,770
Does it test his internal skill?

757
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:16,500
Zishang.

758
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,130
Jin Fan.

759
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,950
I need you to do me a favor.

760
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,040
What is it?

761
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,500
Help me to go to the back hill.

762
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,610
Let me replace Jin Fan to protect Sword Wielder.

763
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,430
No way.

764
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:26,940
The back hill is an important place.

765
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,360
Outsiders are not allowed in.

766
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:28,810
Right?

767
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,450
People who are free are not allowed in.

768
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,510
I'm not free.

769
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,840
I'm not an outsider.

770
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:36,620
I was selected by Lord Sword Wielder as his wife.

771
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,870
Although I haven't officially married Sword Wielder,

772
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,420
he's already my husband

773
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:45,680
in my heart.

774
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,780
Jin Fan.

775
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,290
You just said his life will be in danger in the Trial of the Three Realms.

776
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,210
If Young Master Ziyu dies in the trial,

777
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,500
I won't live.

778
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,870
But if he passes the trial,

779
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,660
he'll be the legitimate Lord Sword Wielder.

780
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,960
Is the wife of Sword Wielder

781
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,190
eligible to enter the back hill?

782
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,440
Dear, stop messing around.

783
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,370
Even though you're not an outsider, you don't know martial arts.

784
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,390
What can you do there?

785
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,090
Jin Fan knows martial arts.

786
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,200
He can protect Sword Wielder.

787
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:16,740
If you go...

788
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,320
What if I can defeat Jin Fan?

789
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:33,790
Why are there

790
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,250
many kinds of dishes today?

791
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,850
The food is hot.

792
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,250
You came just in time.

793
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,320
Were all these dishes

794
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,440
cooked by you?

795
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,870
Don't mind if they look bad.

796
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,060
They indeed look bad.

797
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,330
What is this?

798
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,980
It looks like

799
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:15,820
a pheasant.

800
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:20,370
I specially asked people from the kitchen to go up the mountain and hunt it.

801
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,590
I removed the skin and bones and fried them once before putting it in a pan.

802
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:26,630
The Shangguan family is distinguished in Dafu City.

803
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,350
You're Eldest Young Miss.

804
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:29,720
You know these?

805
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,620
My mother said

806
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,450
only women who can cook

807
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,660
can keep people.

808
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:38,970
Have a seat.

809
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,080
Brother Yuanzhi, why don't you eat after Young Master Shangjue?

810
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,570
My brother spoils me.

811
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,760
He always lets me eat delicious food first.

812
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,030
Although you're spoiled,

813
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,240
you should have good manners.

814
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,660
We're brothers.

815
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,020
There is no need to stand on ceremony.

816
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,550
I think

817
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,110
Lord Sword Wielder

818
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,800
is quite polite.

819
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,040
That's why he's not our brother.

820
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,250
What do you mean?

821
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,720
And he's not Sword Wielder.

822
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,420
Eat.

823
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,770
Young Master Shangjue, help yourself.

824
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,530
There's food in Brother Yuanzhi's bowl.

825
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:37,510
Don't call me

826
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,370
Brother Yuanzhi.

827
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,560
Only my elder brother can call me brother.

828
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,420
Aren't you polite?

829
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:48,050
Then call me Young Master Yuanzhi from now on.

830
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,240
After we get married,

831
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:54,760
you can call him brother.

832
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,500
My brother is a vegetarian.

833
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,950
He eats stew at most.

834
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,250
I'm afraid the dishes you cooked will be wasted.

835
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,630
That's why

836
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,520
Young Master Shangjue has a weak stomach and has no appetite.

837
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,970
You grew up with Young Master Shangjue.

838
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,060
He only eats one meal every day.

839
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,940
Don't you feel sorry for him?

840
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,430
I did wrong.

841
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,110
Please punish me.

842
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,090
Oh?

843
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,550
What did you do wrong?

844
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,710
It was my fault

845
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,280
for speculating about your thoughts.

846
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,520
What did you get?

847
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,780
You

848
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,230
only eat stew.

849
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,040
You don't eat whole chicken and fish.

850
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:07,940
I guess

851
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,340
it's because of their eyes.

852
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,820
My father once told me

853
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,550
that soldiers who fight on battlefields

854
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,310
seldom eat fish.

855
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,460
Because the eyes of fish

856
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,860
are the same

857
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,260
as the eyes of the dead.

858
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,470
All these years,

859
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,290
you've been risking your life for the Gong family.

860
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,840
You've seen many bloody scenes.

861
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:36,730
Actually,

862
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,230
you never said it,

863
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,800
but you still have hard feelings.

864
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:44,410
You know a lot.

865
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,370
Aren't you giving it to me?

866
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,700
Aren't you giving me

867
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,490
the soup you ladled into the bowl?

868
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:12,890
I want it too.

869
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,110
Let her ladle it.

870
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,370
[Yu]

871
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,970
A competition between gentle people

872
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:55,950
doesn't hurt each other.

873
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,350
This is the knife used by guardians.

874
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,300
It's a bit heavy

875
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,200
for girls.

876
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,370
It doesn't matter.

877
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:01,610
Brother.

878
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,120
Gong Ziyu has gone to the back hill.

879
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:07,760
There is nothing to worry about.

880
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,820
If he has self-awareness,

881
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,160
he should give up early.

882
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,350
If he doesn't have self-awareness,

883
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,360
let's remind him.

884
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,580
His shameful background.

885
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,400
Do you know where to start?

886
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,150
Miss Shangguan.

887
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,670
I want a bowl of sweet soup.

888
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:31,100
I wonder

889
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,060
if there is some in the kitchen?

890
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:33,530
Yes.

891
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,250
Lady Lan.

892
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,120
Lady Lan?

893
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:51,300
Isn't she dead?

894
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,690
Dead people can't speak,

895
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,980
but people who are alive can speak for her.

896
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,690
The personal servant who served Lady Lan when she was pregnant

897
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:04,970
must know more than us.

898
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:55,980
I won.

899
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:03,730
Jin Fan.

900
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,180
Although you battled with me with a knife,

901
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,590
all your moves are the moves for using swords.

902
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,110
I happen to know the sword technique you used.

903
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,860
Qingfeng Nine Moves Sword.

904
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,430
It's the Qingfeng Sect's secret top-class sword technique that hasn't been passed down.

905
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,380
The Qingfeng Sect has joined the Wufeng.

906
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,360
Tell me.

907
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:24,950
What's your identity in the Qingfeng Sect?
