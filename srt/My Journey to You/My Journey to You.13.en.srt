1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,630
A lot of couples are here to admire the lanterns

3
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,190
in pairs.

4
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,960
Exactly.

5
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,079
Your Young Master Yu's eyes

6
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,800
has been stuck on you

7
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
like gum.

8
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,710
It's such a beautiful scene.

9
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,150
I should let you two

10
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,630
spend some time alone.

11
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,870
Jin Fan.

12
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,470
It's not safe to be alone.

13
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,910
Go look for Gong Zishang.

14
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,800
How about you?

15
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,630
It's okay.

16
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,310
I won't go far.

17
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,430
Besides, Miss Yun is still here.

18
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,400
After you find Gong Zishang,

19
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,190
go to Housekeeper Jia's house to check.

20
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,680
Let's go.

21
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,960
I went to the pharmacy to get some medicine today.

22
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,750
I made some porridge with the prescription from my hometown.

23
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,840
I don't know why

24
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,150
my chest has been feeling warm lately.

25
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,960
There's miasma in the valley.

26
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,800
It's cold and humid.

27
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
You always burn charcoal.

28
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,240
It would cause your chi and blood to be boiling.

29
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,360
So I added some red dates,

30
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,630
glutinous rice,

31
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,960
and dried longan specially.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,960
I thought

33
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,240
it will also present the good omens of a Laba congee.

34
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,520
Young Master Jue,

35
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,910
would you like to try some?

36
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,360
I've been simmering it for the whole afternoon.

37
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,400
Your hands are very steady.

38
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,960
My family practiced medicine for generations.

39
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,430
When I was young, my father trained me

40
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,000
to weigh medicine.

41
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,510
He said my hands must be steady.

42
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,680
I can't tremble.

43
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,040
A milligram difference in

44
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,600
the weight of herbs

45
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,240
could cost someone's life.

46
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,040
Young Master!

47
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,120
This position...

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,190
It is the life meridians.

49
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,510
It's so deep.

50
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,430
Can we take it out?

51
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,190
Take it.

52
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,510
Take it out!

53
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,240
Go get the white frost powder to stop the bleeding!

54
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,800
Hurry!

55
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,920
Bring the blood clotting powder!

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,310
Get me a wild ginseng.

57
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,310
Quick!

58
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,750
Young Master.

59
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,270
Young Master!

60
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,830
Brother...

61
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,120
The porridge is poisonous...

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,720
Be careful...

63
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,000
The porridge...

64
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,190
is... poisonous.

65
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,190
And then?

66
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,480
Are they all folded?

67
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,630
Are they all folded like this?

68
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,390
Lang'er.

69
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,240
Shangjue.

70
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,040
Mother.

71
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,830
Mother.

72
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,270
Have a lantern.

73
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,310
Thank you, Mother.

74
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,950
Shangjue.

75
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,950
Play with your brother.

76
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,600
Okay.

77
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,560
I want Brother's.

78
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,430
Brother's dragon lantern is pretty.

79
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,190
Do you like it?

80
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes.

81
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,870
Brother is a dragon.

82
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,270
This lantern is also a dragon.

83
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,190
I have two brothers!

84
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,120
You

85
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,160
are so greedy.

86
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,870
Isn't it enough to have me as your brother?

87
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,680
You practice martial arts every day.

88
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,360
You don't play with me much.

89
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,510
This dragon lantern can accompany me.

90
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,430
All right, all right.

91
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,080
But you can't have two younger brothers.

92
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,390
You can only have one that is me.

93
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,510
Okay.

94
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,870
You're my only younger brother.

95
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,870
Come out.

96
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,550
You're Gong Yuanzhi,

97
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,510
right?

98
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,480
What are you doing here?

99
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,120
My father is dead.

100
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,360
No one will teach me martial arts anymore.

101
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,270
The bad guys will bully me.

102
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,600
I'll teach you.

103
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,200
Don't teach me anything too difficult.

104
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm afraid I can't learn it.

105
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,030
My father hasn't taught me

106
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,960
any of those moves you just made.

107
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
It's fine if you can't learn it.

108
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,870
From now on,

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,750
I'll protect you.

110
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,360
From now on,

111
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,910
you are my younger brother.

112
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,030
Our fathers are different.

113
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,200
Am I also your younger brother?

114
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,320
As long as your last name is Gong,

115
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,270
you are my younger brother.

116
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,630
Do you have your own younger brother?

117
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,600
Will he be angry if I turn up?

118
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,750
My brother...

119
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,750
Went somewhere else.

120
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,510
Don't cry.

121
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,440
I'll be your younger brother.

122
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,200
Brother.

123
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,840
Let's go.

124
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,080
Mm.

125
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,270
Let's go.

126
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,510
Where are the lanterns?

127
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,630
Calm down, Young Master.

128
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,630
It might have been

129
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,030
a servant who didn't know better that kept them.

130
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,000
Go look for it.

131
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,870
Yes.

132
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,120
Brother.

133
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,000
Look.

134
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,550
I've fixed all the spoiled parts.

135
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,360
Who allowed you to act on your own?

136
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,080
I...

137
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,390
I thought the lantern looked a little old.

138
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,870
So I...

139
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,790
Do you think a new one will always be better than an old one?

140
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,960
You leave first.

141
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,480
Young Master Yuanzhi.

142
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,720
The sun is up.

143
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,200
Go back and rest.

144
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,240
The stain on the tail of the dragon lantern

145
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,480
was caused by the ink from the first time

146
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,000
Lang learnt to write poems.

147
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
The broken dragon whiskers

148
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,440
were broken by Lang's tight grip

149
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,670
when he was having a nightmare.

150
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,510
To Young Master Jue,

151
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,550
these are all traces left by Lang.

152
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,720
They're the only memoirs left.

153
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,600
I know now.

154
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,000
I won't repair the old one anymore.

155
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,790
Keep it.

156
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,440
I'll...

157
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,790
make a new one for Brother.

158
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,390
New clothes are better.

159
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,390
But not people.

160
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,510
Young Master Yuanzhi,

161
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,510
please try and understand.

162
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,390
But I...

163
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,320
But I'm not clothes.

164
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
What's wrong with your hand?

165
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,790
When I was making herbs,

166
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,030
I got cut by the dry hard herbs.

167
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,670
It's minor.

168
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,480
I’m fine.

169
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Miss Shangguan.

170
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,510
I’m here to see Young Master Shangjue.

171
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,960
He went to the clinic.

172
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,080
I'll go to the clinic then–

173
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
He said he'd like

174
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,000
no one to disturb him tonight.

175
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,270
Young Master.

176
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,790
You've transferred so much internal skill to Young Master Yuanzhi.

177
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,790
Can you take it?

178
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,790
I'm fine.

179
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,630
You're looking for me?

180
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,550
The guards reported

181
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,270
tgat Gong Ziyu has left the palace.

182
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,840
Flowery lights

183
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,400
and beautiful sceneries

184
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,750
are nothing to him.

185
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,310
But

186
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,030
he's with three other people this time.

187
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,550
Among them,

188
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,480
there's also the bride, Yun Weishan.

189
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,200
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

190
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,790
To keep an eye on Gong Ziyu?

191
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,240
To keep an eye on Yun Weishan.

192
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,349
If I'm right,

193
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,960
that invisible net will be reeled up soon.

194
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,640
I can't leave.

195
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
Go make arrangements quickly.

196
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,110
Brother.

197
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,200
Go.

198
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,790
I'm fine.

199
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,310
Go to the Yu Lineage now.

200
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,830
Wait for them to return,

201
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,510
and confront them right there.

202
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,480
Otherwise, they will deny it again.

203
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,750
Send someone to protect the clinic.

204
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,350
Without my permission,

205
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,790
no one can enter or leave.

206
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,400
Yes.

207
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,830
Brother.

208
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,510
That porridge...

209
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,830
That porridge was not poisonous.

210
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,550
I've checked.

211
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,350
Have a good rest.

212
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,590
If there's anything,

213
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,310
call for me with the whistling arrow.

214
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,680
Don't worry.

215
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,350
Brother.

216
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,590
Miss Yun.

217
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,030
This rabbit lantern is quite cute.

218
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,200
Miss Yun?

219
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,550
Do you like it?

220
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,240
If you like it, I will buy it for you.

221
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,200
Sorry, sir.

222
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,510
Our lantern

223
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,350
is a prize.

224
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,640
You can't just buy it.

225
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,070
If you like it,

226
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,160
you can solve the lantern riddles.

227
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,400
If you solve three riddles right,

228
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,880
you can take it away.

229
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,440
Solving lantern riddle?

230
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,400
Miss Yun.

231
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,160
Do you know how to solve lantern riddles?

232
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,030
It comes from the valley

233
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,350
and moved to a tree.

234
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,310
When it's young, it wears green.

235
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,830
When it's old, it wears yellow.

236
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,920
I know this.

237
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,030
It's banana.

238
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,590
Second Young Miss.

239
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,030
Second Young Miss.

240
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,000
I know Eldest Young Miss is Gong Zishang.

241
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,790
But I have no clue about the Second Young Miss...

242
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,000
The second-in-line of the Gong Family

243
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,270
is a man who wears nothing but a cold face everyday.

244
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,030
Poise.

245
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,310
Posture, poise.

246
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,070
It's made up of the words that means "second daughter."

247
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,350
You're amazing.

248
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,110
Solve one then.

249
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,160
It's been a long drought with no rain,

250
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,550
only thunder is heard.

251
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,000
Guess a word.

252
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,240
Field.

253
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,000
There's only thunder but no rain. It has to be field.

254
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,350
You're so smart?

255
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,200
Why didn't you say anything just now?

256
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,550
You wanted to see me make a fool of myself?

257
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,350
They all say the Sword Wielder doesn't like studying.

258
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,680
I wanted to see if the rumors were true.

259
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,160
Please be careful with

260
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,480
how you talk to the Sword Wielder.

261
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,310
Understood, the Sword Wielder.

262
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,920
I know my mistake.

263
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,720
In the past,

264
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,750
I often solved riddles with my younger sister.

265
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,680
My younger sister would give the question,

266
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,000
and I'll answer it.

267
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,240
As time passed,

268
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,590
I understood the key to it.

269
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,000
You have a younger sister?

270
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,510
I've never heard you talk about her.

271
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,440
Godsister.

272
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,200
I've told you about her before.

273
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,070
The one who'd sing for you at night?

274
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,960
I only hope that the one I love

275
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,000
can understand the light in my hand.

276
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,880
Speechless.

277
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,270
Annoying!

278
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,720
So many lanterns.

279
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,790
What?

280
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,750
Stealing lanterns?

281
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,400
Buying lanterns.

282
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,830
I want the brightest lantern here

283
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,310
that'd stand out the most in the ground.

284
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,070
Do you have any?

285
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,480
You must be on a date with someone you like.

286
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,480
Look at this delicate jade rabbit.

287
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,160
Many girls like it.

288
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,400
Delicate?

289
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,070
I don't like it.

290
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,160
Wait.

291
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,750
I have a tough one.

292
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,830
You must like it.

293
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,790
This colorful phoenix lantern

294
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,400
is bigger and brighter.

295
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,310
But

296
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,960
it's too heavy. Ordinary girls...

297
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,440
can't lift it.

298
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,510
You are quite something.

299
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,240
Quite,

300
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,400
but not too much.

301
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,400
Is this lantern bright enough?

302
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,070
There are so many people here.

303
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,720
What if my lover can't see it?

304
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,920
What should I do then?

305
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,640
Is your lover old?

306
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,070
Does he have a bad eyesight?

307
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,200
Stop it.

308
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,720
I'll buy

309
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,880
this entire cart.

310
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,640
Miss,

311
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,000
you are more beautiful than a fairy.

312
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,550
Deal.

313
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,880
Deal.

314
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,000
But this cart is a bit heavy.

315
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,400
Isn't it too much for you to push it alone?

316
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,440
No.

317
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,720
I purposely lost him

318
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,000
in the crowd to make him come look for me.

319
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,350
If he could still find me among this crowd,

320
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,000
then we are fated to be.

321
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,350
Miss,

322
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,160
if you buy my entire lantern cart,

323
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,270
isn't that cheating?

324
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,350
In this way,

325
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,960
aren't you going to win easily?

326
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,480
As the saying goes,

327
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,110
with a calm mind can I win more easily.

328
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,680
Everything else is fine.

329
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,880
But what about fate?

330
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,110
As long as your hearts are connected, it will naturally be a long-lasting love.

331
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,160
You don't have to be too stubborn.

332
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,480
I insist on being stubborn.

333
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,480
All right.

334
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,000
Good luck to you.

335
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,270
Be it manmade, or natural fate,

336
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,720
I want all these fates.

337
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,440
Jin Fan!

338
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,480
Come quickly!

339
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,920
Jin Fan.

340
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,400
Come quickly.

341
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,680
Watch out for the fire.

342
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Look, that man is holding on a rabbit lantern.

343
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,350
Young Master, let me take the rabbit lamp.

344
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,070
No.

345
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,350
This is a gift from you.

346
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,240
You paid for the lantern riddle.

347
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,070
It can't be considered as a gift from me.

348
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,030
Some things can't be bought with money.

349
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,720
Sir,

350
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,550
Miss, do you want to make a braid?

351
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,790
Love braids can ensure fulfilling love

352
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,920
and a harmonious marriage.

353
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,880
Sure.

354
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,350
I'll just buy something for you then.

355
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,030
Sir,

356
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,550
take as much as you need for the braiding.

357
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,310
I think this lady here has a thin wrist.

358
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,310
You don't need that much.

359
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,440
I accidentally pulled too much.

360
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,590
I will make two then.

361
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,070
Okay.

362
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,350
Sir,

363
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,920
this is a bit deliberate.

364
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,350
Haven't you been trained to lie?

365
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,480
Who will train to lie?

366
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,030
Sir.

367
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,270
Your hand.

368
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,720
Put it on for me.

369
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,070
This is for girls.

370
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,400
They said this will ensure fulfilling love and a harmonious marriage.

371
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,880
How can the girl wear it but not the man?

372
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,310
Miss.

373
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,480
Is the person you like not here yet?

374
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,480
They will come.

375
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,350
Good luck.

376
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,480
Jin–

377
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,440
Why do you look so lonely?

378
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,480
Did you get separated?

379
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,830
How about

380
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,240
enjoying the lanterns with us?

381
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,750
Yes.

382
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,510
Come.

383
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,550
Let's enjoy the lanterns together.

384
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,350
What are you doing?

385
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,110
Let's go see the lanterns together.

386
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,750
Let go!

387
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,310
Let go!

388
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,000
Jin Fan...

389
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,960
You finally found me.

390
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,480
Well...

391
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,240
How does that poem go again?

392
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,550
Something marriage...

393
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,110
Something lights.

394
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,590
This is for you.

395
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,200
But this lantern is small.

396
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,350
You probably like big ones.

397
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,240
No.

398
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,110
Small ones are cute.

399
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,720
Fireflies?

400
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,790
You caught them yourself?

401
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,000
When did you prepare a gift for me?

402
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,830
It's sold over there.

403
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,160
Ten copper coins for one.

404
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,680
You don't mean what you say.

405
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,960
I'm going to raise them,

406
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,640
and name them.

407
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,310
Fireflies can only live for three to five days.

408
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,270
I don't care.

409
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,590
I will put them in the valley of the Gong Residence

410
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,790
so that they can continue to reproduce.

411
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,000
The insects multiply

412
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,640
and go on for

413
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,200
endless generations.

414
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,000
Only male bugs

415
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,270
glow, no?

416
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,510
Bad apples fall from rotten trees.

417
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,200
Gong Ziyu doesn't study and so don't you.

418
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,830
All fireflies, regardless of gender, glow.

419
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,830
What should I name it?

420
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,160
Why don't we use your surname and my name?

421
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,310
Let's call it Little Jin Zi.

422
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,000
Little Jin Shang might sound better...

423
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,680
Sure.

424
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,350
Naming is something important. I'll listen to you.

425
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,070
You just said there are pottery and candied haws here.

426
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,550
Did you inquire about these

427
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,480
because you thought about going around this lantern festival with me hand in hand?

428
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,680
No.

429
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,790
I'm a dog if I'm lying.

430
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,070
You'd rather be a dog than admit it.

431
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,070
Young Master, I didn't lie to you.

432
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,110
I told you the person you like would like it

433
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,510
if you gifted it to them.

434
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,000
He forced me into

435
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,160
buying it from him

436
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,110
and refused to let me leave

437
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,400
so I bought one.

438
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,030
Sir,

439
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,030
that's not what you said. You said–

440
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,240
What did he say?

441
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,510
He said this lantern can't be blown out by the wind.

442
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,440
It's good.

443
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,960
How sweet.

444
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,160
Don't rush to meet up with Gong Ziyu.

445
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,200
Let the couple

446
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,270
spend more time together.

447
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,110
I'm not looking to meet up with him,

448
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,350
but the Sword Wielder gave us two a mission.

449
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,830
So exciting?

450
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,640
Gong Zishang sneaked out for so long.

451
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
I feel sorry for Jin Fan.

452
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,110
I thought you wouldn't notice.

453
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,680
I can see through her little trick.

454
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,400
But you still helped her.

455
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,830
I have my own ideas.

456
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,070
What are you talking about?

457
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,640
Nothing.

458
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,830
What's wrong?

459
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,110
Oh no!

460
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,110
My necklace!

461
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,030
It's my sister's ring on it.

462
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,920
Take this.

463
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,640
Wait for me.

464
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,880
Please spare my life!

465
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,710
Today is a good day.

466
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,840
I don't want to ruin the mood.

467
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:31,960
Scram.

468
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,360
Thank you, sir.

469
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,670
Is anyone here?

470
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,190
Where did you get the mirror from?

471
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,070
Mind your own business.

472
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,880
Okay.

473
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,550
Miss Yun.

474
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,550
Miss Yun!

475
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,030
Are you here for Old Man Jia too?

476
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,630
What happened to him?

477
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,320
People keep coming to look for him these days.

478
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,230
Who else came?

479
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,840
A few days ago,

480
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,400
a rough and tough gy

481
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,440
with a fierce face came too.

482
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,840
What happened to Old Man Jia?

483
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,880
It's nothing.

484
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,320
What can happen to him when he works in the Gong Residence.

485
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,320
We are Jia's distant relatives.

486
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,510
We came to visit him since it's the festival.

487
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,960
But he's not here.

488
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,070
Tell me about it.

489
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,070
He

490
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,110
is my husband.

491
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,710
He's not good at talking.

492
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,190
Please don't mind him.

493
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,920
Sword Wielder.

494
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,230
You call me the Sword Wielder

495
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,190
but you don't listen to my commands.

496
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,960
We will do everything

497
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,710
you order.

498
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,400
I didn't ask you to come,

499
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,880
but you came.

500
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,590
Who ordered you to do this?

501
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,510
I want to protect you.

502
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,030
Do you want to protect me...

503
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,760
or spy on me?

504
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,280
I dare not.

505
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,840
Stop!

506
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,030
Where are you going?

507
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,920
Are you going back to report to your master?

508
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,510
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

509
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,030
Wait for me here.

510
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,150
You are Ziyi?

511
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,070
I won’t drink the tea.

512
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,320
I'm not here for tea.

513
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,070
And tea is not only for drinking.

514
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,920
Leave it.

515
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,840
It's good to just look at it too.

516
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,190
She's also a Chi?

517
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,670
A Mei?

518
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,360
Is she...

519
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,070
a Wang?

520
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,710
But there are only four Wangs

521
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,070
in Wufeng.

522
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,400
I've never seen them before.

523
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,110
Stop guessing.

524
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,110
I am nobody.

525
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,360
I'm just helping Han Yasi.

526
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,280
You must have an identity.

527
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,230
But I have no right to know.

528
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,400
I won't guess.

529
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,550
I'm here

530
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,920
to get the antidote for Shangguan Qian and me.

531
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,000
Why didn't Shangguan Qian come herself?

532
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,000
She can't get out.

533
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
She trusts you so much.

534
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,670
Not bad.

535
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,070
The young generation is really different.

536
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,760
Did you bring the thing?

537
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,110
The antidote.

538
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,880
Young Master Ziyu.

539
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,480
It's been a long time.

540
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,400
Young Master Ziyu.

541
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,710
It's been a long time.

542
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,960
But unfortunately,

543
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,280
Ziyi has guests today.

544
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,480
Did you see

545
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,190
a young and beautiful female guest entering just now?

546
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,150
Come on.

547
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,630
Are you kidding?

548
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,960
Why would a female guest come here?

549
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,190
Let me get you some–

550
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,440
Did you really not?

551
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,800
No.

552
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,030
Fine.

553
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,670
I'll take take a look myself. You get back to work.

554
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,800
Come here often.

555
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,230
You should.

556
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,480
Come often.

557
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,030
Come more often.

558
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,280
Does Miss Ziyi have a guest?

559
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,030
No.

560
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,590
I just passed by.

561
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,510
The pattern hung out on her door is still a Bud.

562
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,760
Within the Gong Residence,

563
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
besides Shangguan Qian and me,

564
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,880
is there anyone else from Wufeng?

565
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:35,960
Wait.

566
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,920
The charcoal has been burning for too long.

567
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,190
Let me open the window for some fresh air.

568
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,840
You can't leave through the window.

569
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,800
Hide first.

570
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,760
Do you know each other?

571
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,110
Of course not.

572
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,840
You know Miss Ziyi?

573
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,280
The tea is not only for drinking.

574
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,360
Leave it.

575
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,110
It's good to just look at it.

576
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,030
This signal

577
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,800
means to attack.

578
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,360
This signal

579
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,760
means to retreat.

580
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,030
Miss Ziyi.

581
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,280
Someone told me you have a guest just now.

582
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,960
I didn't expect...

583
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,190
it's Miss Yun.

584
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,070
That's right.

585
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,710
I'm Miss Ziyi's

586
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,800
guest.

587
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,480
Miss Yun.

588
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,760
I...

589
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:26,880
This...

590
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,630
I heard from Sister Zishang that

591
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,400
you often leave Gong Residence

592
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,360
to come here the most.

593
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,360
Even when the former Sword Wielder was angry,

594
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,110
he couldn't stop you from coming to visit one person.

595
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,670
I was really curious,

596
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,630
so I came to see.

597
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,110
I thought

598
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,840
she must know more than me.

599
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,920
I want to know you better.

600
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,280
So I came here...

601
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,030
alone.

602
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:10,800
Yes.

603
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,230
I was surprised when I heard that

604
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,760
there was a female guest looking for me.

605
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,110
Later, I heard the servants say

606
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,920
it's the lady that Young Master Gong Ziyu

607
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,670
was walking around the lantern market with,

608
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,550
and figured it out.

609
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,800
That's why I invited her here

610
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,400
to have some tea

611
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,000
and talk about what you usually do when you come to look for me.

612
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,880
I didn't do anything.

613
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,630
Are you nervous?

614
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,320
This is the first time

615
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,150
I'm seeing you so nervous.

616
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,550
But don't worry.

617
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,840
I won't give her a hard time.

618
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,590
In fact, even before you came,

619
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,630
we were having a good time chatting.

620
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,190
Am I right, Miss Yun?

621
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,670
Miss Ziyi

622
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,480
told me a lot about your past.

623
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,150
There are not many things between us.

624
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,360
Yes.

625
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,800
That's all we have between us.

626
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:17,960
All right.

627
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,840
This is not the best place

628
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,670
for Miss Yun to stay around for too long.

629
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,880
Please take her back, Young Master.

630
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,590
My tea is cold.

631
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,920
I won't keep you.

632
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,280
Let's go.

633
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,510
There's something I haven't taken yet.

634
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,440
Blood...

635
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:36,480
Who?

636
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:46,510
Who are you?

637
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,320
There is no woman with martial skills like you in the Gong family.

638
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,630
What should we do?

639
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,510
Do we keep waiting?

640
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,480
Yun Weishan is missing.

641
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,630
We can't keep waiting.

642
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,440
Shoot the whistling arrows.

643
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,840
Notify Young Master Shangjue that

644
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,110
the bride is suspected to have escaped.

645
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,800
Ask if they would like to order the gueards

646
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
to search the whole city.

647
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:03,960
Oh no!

648
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:04,840
Something happened.

649
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,590
Go look for the Sword Wielder.

650
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,840
Gosh. Goodbye.

651
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,110
Let's talk next time!

652
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,280
Who's there?

653
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,440
What are you doing?

654
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,360
I thought

655
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,800
Miss Yun has escaped.

656
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,920
Escaped?

657
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:45,880
No.

658
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,440
I mean...

659
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:46,960
Lost...

660
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,000
Lost your way.

661
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,190
Sword Wielder.

662
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,110
Go to the Council of Elders.

663
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:23,550
What happened?

664
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:24,360
Report,

665
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,510
Lady Wuji was attacked.

666
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,030
She has been sent to the clinic for emergency treatment.

667
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,440
The Anonymous Murderer

668
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,440
has appeared again.

669
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,030
Jin Fan,

670
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,000
escort Yun Weishan back to the Yun Lineage first.

671
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,320
Sister Zishang,

672
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,960
go to the clinic to visit the Concubine.

673
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,320
I'm going to the Council of Elders now.

674
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,360
You two

675
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,070
go check over there.

676
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,000
Yes!

677
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,590
Search carefully!

678
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
What happened?

679
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,150
Elder Hua ordered for a search.

680
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,190
The Sword Wielder has gone to the Council of Elders.

681
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:12,110
Eldest Young Miss

682
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,960
went to the clinic to see Lady Wuji.

683
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,550
What we are looking for is any females among the different lineages

684
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:16,710
for any injuries sustained.

685
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,400
Why are you looking for a wounded woman?

686
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:20,840
We're just following orders.

687
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,760
As for the reason,

688
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,150
please ask Elder Hua.

689
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,800
Miss Shangguan Qian.

690
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,030
Miss Shangguan Qian.

691
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,480
Young Master Shangjue.

692
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,190
What’s wrong?

693
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,960
Elder Hua has made an order

694
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,400
to search the various lineages to see if there are any injured women.

695
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,710
Please ask Shangguan Qian to open the door.

696
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:30,760
All right.

697
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:34,710
Miss Shangguan Qian.

698
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:38,550
Miss Shangguan Qian.

699
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,230
Break the door.

700
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46,510
Young Master Shangjue?

701
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,800
Young Master Shangjue...

702
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,440
What happened?

703
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,280
Why didn't you open the door?

704
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,440
I feel a little feverish.

705
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,800
I'm afraid I caught a cold.

706
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,070
So,

707
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,630
after taking the sleeping medicine,

708
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:03,960
I went to bed early.

709
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,400
I heard someone knocking on my door in my dream,

710
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,590
so I just woke up.

711
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,150
Sorry for intruding.

712
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,550
You light such a

713
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,440
heavy incense when you're sleeping?

714
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,710
I have insomnia recently.

715
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,280
So I put

716
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,920
a little more spices.

717
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,110
You're smart.

718
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,230
You know I'm sensitive to the smell of blood,

719
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,030
so you deliberately lit such strong incense.

720
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,960
Unfortunately,

721
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,480
there was one small flaw.

722
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:52,510
Sir,

723
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,480
I don't understand what you're talking about.

724
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,670
Tell me.

725
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,630
Whose blood is this?
