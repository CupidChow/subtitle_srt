[Sacrifice the Important Ones. Forge the Unrivaled Saber.]

6
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,140
Your kite really works.

7
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,700
Didn't I tell you it can only be used in an emergency?

8
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,690
Of course it's an emergency.

9
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,060
Why else would I trouble you?

10
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,860
If it weren't for you, I couldn't have come to the back hill.

11
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,140
Don't let anyone know that

12
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,280
-I brought you here.
-Got it.

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
I can't go any further from here.

14
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,660
Remember.

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,030
The ancestral hall is on your right.

16
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,630
The left is where Gong Ziyu is taking his trial.

17
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,930
Don't take the wrong path

18
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,820
and disturb the peace of our ancestors.

19
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,860
Got it.

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,540
Sacrifice the Important Ones.

Forge the Unrivaled Saber.

22
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,410
Who took the Heart Devouring Moon

23
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,300
during Young Master Shangjue's trial?

24
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,310
His subordinate.

25
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,880
Was it Jin Fu?

26
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,340
No, it was someone else.

27
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,690
You're poisoned.

28
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,820
Who did it to you?

29
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,170
Lady Wuji.

30
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,400
I've taken the Herb Elixir,

31
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,130
but the poison hasn't been completely detoxified yet.

32
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,070
I'll go find her.

33
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,190
Elder Yue.

34
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,720
She's not in her room.

35
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,610
I've looked for her.

36
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,670
The servant said

37
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,780
she left with a bunch of joss paper and candles.

38
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,440
Let me have a try.

39
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,880
If I can't detoxify it,

40
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,010
we'll have to ask someone else for help.

41
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,700
Ziyu and Jin Fan

42
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,590
have made it to the Hua Residence today.

43
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,370
The ancestral hall is on the right.

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,980
The left is where Gong Ziyu's taking the trial.

45
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,260
I should go left.

46
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,910
Careful.

47
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,040
I don't have much time.

48
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,190
Jin Fan.

49
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,660
Lord Sword Wielder.

50
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,830
If you're ready,

51
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,210
we can start anytime.

52
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,770
They're waiting for you at the front hill.

53
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,970
I won't

54
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,360
forge this saber.

55
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,700
No.

56
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,610
You have to.

57
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,200
This is your mission.

58
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,560
I have my mission too.

59
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,670
This is your fate.

60
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,050
Wake up, okay?

61
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:16,870
What?

62
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,540
I'm willing to sacrifice myself

63
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,590
for you to forge the Unrivaled Sword, Young Master.

64
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,670
But I'm not willing.

65
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,750
You must be.

66
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,810
Only by forging this saber

67
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,060
can you become the Sword Wielder of the Gong family.

68
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,110
Then tell me,

69
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,540
why did the ancestors

70
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,680
have to make us take this ridiculous trial?

71
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,770
I don't know.

72
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,420
But the ancestors must have their intentions

73
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,650
making this rule.

74
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,320
Maybe

75
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,640
they believed that

76
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,220
only those who are brutal and determined enough,

77
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,630
both to themselves and to others,

78
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,659
to achieve their goals

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,560
are qualified to be leaders of the Gong family.

80
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,930
I don't agree with that.

81
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,080
I'll become the Sword Wielder

82
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,850
in my own way,

83
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,909
and lead the whole Gong family

84
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,210
to take a different path.

85
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,140
What's wrong? Are you chased by a ghost?

86
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,700
Lady Wuji is dead.

87
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,980
Save her.

88
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,440
Save her!

89
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,810
Lady Wuji is still alive.

90
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,420
Lady Wuji!

91
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,230
Lady Wuji!

92
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,480
Young Master Hua.

93
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,660
We found someone in the ancestral hall.

94
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,780
Young Lord.

95
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,930
[Yu]

96
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,700
Look.

97
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,450
Lord Sword Wielder.

98
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,630
What?

99
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,810
How dare you stop the Sword Wielder?

100
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,980
Please forgive us, Young Master Ziyu.

101
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,980
Elder told us that

102
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,060
no one is allowed to enter.

103
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,010
How dare you!

104
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,900
How dare you call him Young Master Ziyu

105
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,450
instead of Sword Wielder?

106
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,540
You should be punished severely.

107
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,280
Ziyu.

108
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,340
Brother.

109
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:02,920
Brother.

110
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,450
Are you okay?

111
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,380
My son found Huanyu in a secret room

112
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,230
in the ancestral hall in Hua Residence.

113
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,230
He had been imprisoned there.

114
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,960
Huanyu had bruises all over his body,

115
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,270
and was hungry and weak when he was found.

116
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,190
He just woke up.

117
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,680
And

118
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,480
the person who imprisoned him

119
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,660
took all his martial arts skills away from him.

120
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,800
Brother.

121
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,900
Who on earth

122
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,750
did this to you?

123
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,490
It was Anonymous.

124
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,440
Anonymous.

125
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,160
Why was it Anonymous again?

126
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,510
Who on earth is Anonymous?

127
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,680
It's Lady Wuji.

128
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,700
Young Lord identified her himself.

129
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
It can't be wrong.

130
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,860
Don't call me Young Lord anymore.

131
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,810
My younger brother is the Sword Wielder now.

132
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,500
Ziyu.

133
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,390
Before you came,

134
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,170
Huanyu

135
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,870
has told us

136
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,050
the ins and outs of what happened.

137
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,260
Wuji

138
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,460
and the spy from Wufeng who pretended to be Miss Zheng Nanyi

139
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,040
worked in collusion.

140
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,160
They killed the former Sword Wielder

141
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,850
and imprisoned Huanyu.

142
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,970
At that time,

143
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,870
we saw the body of Huanyu.

144
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,330
It was just smoke and mirrors created by Wuji.

145
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,650
She took my martial arts skills

146
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,940
and locked me up.

147
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,020
After that, every once in a while,

148
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,660
she'd use the excuse of burning incense for my father

149
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,460
to come to the ancestral hall.

150
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,250
Every time she came,

151
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,390
she'd leave after leaving me some food.

152
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:27,950
But...

153
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,070
But why

154
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,830
would Lady Wuji do that?

155
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,380
Yes.

156
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,500
Why didn't Wuji kill you?

157
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,130
Why did she go through so much trouble

158
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,440
to imprison you?

159
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,840
What she wants

160
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,090
is that thing in the Hua Residence, of course.

161
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,800
What is it?

162
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,270
Then why did she kill Elder Yue?

163
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,770
She couldn't get the answer from me,

164
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,740
so she threatened me that

165
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,220
if I didn't tell her,

166
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,300
she'd kill every one in the Gong family.

167
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,350
I know how powerful that would be,

168
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,140
so I didn't budge.

169
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,500
It was me who got Elder Yue killed.

170
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,900
Young Lord.

171
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,500
Don't take it too hard on yourself.

172
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,860
Wufeng

173
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,100
has always been vicious.

174
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,490
However,

175
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,710
if Wuji is Anonymous,

176
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,110
then who

177
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,430
could be the one that attacked her?

178
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,520
She was attacked?

179
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,320
No matter what,

180
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,440
it's a good thing for the Gong family

181
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,510
that Anonymous is gone.

182
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,940
But we can't help but wonder

183
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,170
who did it.

184
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,730
Could it be someone that

185
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,620
had suspected the identity of Wuji for long,

186
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,900
but couldn't find any evidence?

187
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,600
So that person decided to kill her no matter what,

188
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,310
to prevent future troubles.

189
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,220
I was seriously injured and have been bedridden.

190
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,450
I can't even protect myself.

191
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,100
Elder Xue, there's no need to suspect me.

192
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,440
The person who assassinated Wuji

193
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:14,960
doesn't dare to admit it

194
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,750
after that.

195
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,770
It must be someone else from Wufeng.

196
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,180
How could there be so many people from Wufeng in the Gong Residence?

197
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,450
Yes.

198
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,880
It must be another spy who sneaked into the Gong Residence.

199
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,560
Maybe they disagreed on something

200
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,980
and got into internal conflict.

201
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,520
Or maybe

202
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,010
Wuji's existence became a threat to that person.

203
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,080
So that person decided to kill her to silence her.

204
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,530
Why don't we just ask Lady Wuji

205
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,420
who attacked her?

206
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:47,780
Where is Lady Wuji?

207
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,720
Is she okay?

208
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,510
Lady Wuji is severely injured.

209
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,670
The murderer crushed her throat

210
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,600
and injured her trachea.

211
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,300
Although her life was saved,

212
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,740
she's barely holding on.

213
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,290
Report. Sword Wielder.

214
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,220
Elder.

215
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,420
Young Master.

216
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,380
Lady Wuji's life is at stake,

217
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,380
but she still struggled to write these words down.

218
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,520
I dare not make a decision,

219
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,490
so I came to report it to you.

220
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,390
So many "Sword"s.

221
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,770
It seems that even when she's dying,

222
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,700
she's still thinking about how nice the former Sword Wielder was to her.

223
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,090
I think she must feel guilty.

224
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,050
Did she say who assassinated her?

225
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,130
Yes.

226
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,990
But

227
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,510
I'm not sure what she meant.

228
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,770
What do you mean?

229
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,730
She kept repeating a word.

230
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,900
Xu... Xu...

231
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,740
Xu?

232
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,740
What could it be?

233
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,180
Yun.

234
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,650
It's Yun.

235
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,490
But there's no one surnamed Yun

236
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,310
in the Gong family.

237
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,780
My Lady.

238
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,550
I've come to see you.

239
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,700
When I was little,

240
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,740
you took care of me day and night

241
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,030
every time I got sick.

242
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,100
Every time I quarreled with my father,

243
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,670
you managed to make both of us happy.

244
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,990
On my birthdays,

245
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,360
you'd make me longevity noodles.

246
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,590
In winter,

247
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,420
you know I can't stand the cold,

248
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,480
so you used to make me sugar-coated haws.

249
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,710
I could only be so at ease

250
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,170
because you were by my side.

251
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,250
My Lady.

252
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,210
In my heart,

253
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,810
I've already regarded you as my mother.

254
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,820
But now,

255
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,420
I realized that I've never seen your true colors.

256
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,190
Gong Shangjue always told me

257
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,870
that you are Anonymous,

258
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,940
but I never believed him.

259
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,780
But now, even my brother Huanyu

260
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,970
said you're Anonymous.

261
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:53,580
I...

262
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,050
I have to believe it.

263
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,540
Men, unlike grass or trees, have feelings and emotions.

264
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,460
I'll keep your kindness in my heart.

265
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,700
But you killed my father

266
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,600
and hurt my older brother.

267
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,010
They are my closest family.

268
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,870
I can't forgive you.

269
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:23,900
My Lady.

270
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,050
Mother!

271
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,050
Elder Yue led a team to search the back hill.

272
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,550
He found the weapon that killed Elder Yue

273
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
behind the memorial tablet of the former Sword Wielder.

274
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,670
They were here on the Elder's order

275
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,090
to execute Her Ladyship.

276
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,650
To be honest,

277
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,810
I haven't had sugar-coated haws

278
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,000
made by you for a long time, My Lady.

279
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,040
I'll prepare some for you.

280
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,930
You can have them when you come back.

281
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,190
Thank you

282
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,140
for defending me this time, My Lady.

283
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,420
I'm really grateful.

284
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,400
Although you are not my biological child,

285
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,540
I've always treated you as my own child.

287
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,460

to investigate your background.

339
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,070
Father!

340
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,150
Your father Ming Xiong

341
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,590
was once the best sword forger in the martial world.

342
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,640
Wufeng wanted him to work for them,

343

but your father turned them down.

So,

00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,570
Wufeng got so angry that

346
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,680
they kidnapped your father and imprisoned him.

347
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,950

00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,560
Not long ago,

378
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,340
I sent a message to Wufeng

379
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,380
♫Winning or losing isn't important in this game♫

380
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,930
and revealed the time of the next marriage selection.

381
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,760
Do you need me

382
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,500
♫The black and white pieces♫

383
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,150

♫Leave traces on the board♫

385
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,980

♫They create a small world♫

387
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,490
you are my family.

388
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,600
Here,

389
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,100
you don't have to bear any burden.

390
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,320
Just

392
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,560
I'll try my best to run towards you...

393
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,750

♫Our story has tenderness♫

401
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,780

When I grow up,

409
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,700
I'll forge the best sword

410
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,890

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,170
[If you want to save them, do as I say. Find Infinite Heat.]

It's getting cold.

422

Go back to your room and rest.

423
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,330
I thought I could never see you again.

424
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,890
I sneaked to the Hua Residence today

425
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,340
because I was afraid you'd be sacrificed.

426
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,450
I didn't expect that I would find out Lady Wuji's secret.

427
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,050
When I was little,

428
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,940
every time I went to the Yu Residence,

429
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,660
Her Ladyship would give me a lot of delicious food.

430
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,070
She treated me and Gong Ziyu very well.

431
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,030
Could all of this

432
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,900
be fake?

433
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,240
Don't be too sad, Young Master.

434
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,570
For Lady Wuji,

435
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,680
her death

436
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,630
was punishment,

437
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,290
but it was also a kind of relief.

438
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,620
What exactly

439
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,860
is Wufeng like?

440
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,560
And what are

441
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,100
those from Wufeng like?

442
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,580
Those from Wufeng Sect are cold and brutal.

443
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,489
They are merciless and heartless.

444
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,130
The biggest taboo for a spy

445
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,380
is love.

446
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,100
Because love brings weaknesses,

447
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,870
which brings fear.

448
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,239
Wufeng doesn't allow us to have fear.

449
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,929
As long as you're alive,

450
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,760
you must be useful to Wufeng.

451
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,500
Even if you die, you still have to be useful to Wufeng.

452
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,949
We can only

453
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,199
have missions in our minds,

454
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,679
and nothing else.

455
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,080
Not even ourselves.

456
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,239
Can you feel any pain?

457
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,320
Yes.

458
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,030
But I'm used to it.

459
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,400
Do you know why

460
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,220
I envy that the Gong family uses sabers,

461
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,830
while Wufeng uses swords?

462
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,230
Why?

463
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,640
Because a saber is single-edged.

464
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,220
It protects you when doing damage to the enemy.

465
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,130
However, a sword is double-edged.

466
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:25,920
It hurts yourself as well

467
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,050
when hurting others.

468
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,360
You are one of the Gong family now.

469
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,640
I'll teach you how to use a saber in the future.

470
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,800
You can't stay in the Gong family anymore.

471
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,230
I know.

472
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,810
I will leave.

473
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,360
Do you have fear

474
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,880
in your heart?

475
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,690
I know you want to ask

476
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,780
if there's love in my heart.

477
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,040
I asked you if you like me

478
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,990
when you took the truth grass.

479
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,380
You said no.

480
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,660
What is this?

481
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,480
This is the truth grass made by Elder Yue.

482
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,490
This is not fake.

483
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,270
Take one.

484
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,100
I'll ask you again.

485
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
You're lying to me again.

486
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,520
This is just a piece of licorice candy.

487
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,400
So, do you like me?

488
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,080
♫The mountains become sand with the wind♫

489
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,450
♫The river takes me home♫

490
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,050
Why did you steal my candy?

491
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,690
♫The cloud in the sky doesn't speak♫

492
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,420
Because it's my turn.

493
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,600
♫Where are you, where are you?♫

494
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,130
Now that I've taken the truth grass,

495
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,450
♫How are you?♫

496
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,570
it's your turn to ask me a question.

497
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,210
You already know

498
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,780
that I'm from Wufeng.

499
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,260
Will you really not despise me,

500
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,590
and resolutely stand by my side forever?

501
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,130
I will resolutely stand by your side.

502
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,140
No matter in the past,

503
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,920
at present,

504
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,310
or in the future.

505
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,390
My choice

506
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,140
is always you.

507
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,300
This is not truth grass.

508
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,030
I know.

509
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,150
But...

510
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,540
This is the vow grass.

511
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,440
Vow.

512
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,620
So what I just said

513
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,590
is my vow.

514
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,200
I'll keep my word

515
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,090
for all eternity.

516
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,160
Look.

517
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,980
Your hands are already warm.

518
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,830
I told you that

519
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,470
I could warm them up.

520
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,650
Do you remember?

521
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,630
The elders say that

522
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,620
our hands are connected to our heart.

523
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,290
Those who have warm hands

524
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:55,920
are naturally warm-hearted.

525
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,590
Young Master Ziyu, you look cold, but you're warm-hearted.

526
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,350
I can feel that.

527
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,350
But I'm the opposite.

528
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,340
I'm actually

529
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,260
envious of you, Young Master Ziyu.

530
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,240
I can warm you up.

531
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,550
Brother Yuanzhi.

532
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,110
Where are you going

533
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,020
in such a hurry?

534
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,960
Chuyun Chonglian lotuses have bloomed.

535
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,660
I cultivated three new ones for us.

536
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,080
One for my brother.

537
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,350
One for myself.

538
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:22,800
Then...

539
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,370
What about the third one?

540
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,540
Miss Shangguan, you are too courteous.

541
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,040
You've moved to the Jue Residence for so long.

542
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,790
We've become family.

543
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,340
So of course, the third one

544
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,580
is for Young Master Yue for research.

545
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:39,800
What?

546
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,100
You want one, too?

547
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,920
Chuyun Chonglian is truly precious.

548
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,810
It's attractive indeed.

549
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,960
But I advise you not to have designs on it.

550
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,410
If you have any evil thoughts about it

551
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,660
and upset my brother,

552
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,300
even deities can't save you.

553
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,090
I don't need deities to save me.

554
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,450
No matter what happens,

555
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,950
your brother

556
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,970
won't be willing to let me die.

557
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,380
Don't you believe it?

558
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,880
It's not dawn yet.

559
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,110
Do you want to go back to sleep?

560
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,230
So you can keep on dreaming.

561
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,140
Do you

562
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,090
want to take a bet?

563
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,280
Go find Gong Ziyu

564
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:17,960
at Wanhua Pavilion.

565
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,810
He likes gambling.

566
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,210
By the way,

567
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,540
thank you.

568
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,360
Thank me?

569
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,730
The mattress you gifted your brother,

570
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,650
which is made of the jade seal and ink bamboo,

571
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,700
is really warm and nourishing.

572
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,260
No wonder

573
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,980
Young Master Shangjue said

574
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,000
I've been looking better these days.

575
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,890
What's that smell?

576
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:47,930
Oh.

577
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,700
It's the smell of tea.

578
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,880
Sister.

579
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,300
I'm here to see you.

580
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,100
See me?

581
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,760
See if I'm dead?

582
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,700
You're funny, Sister.

583
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,450
Everyone knows that

584
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,680
all the three lineages in the back hill, Xue, Yue, and Hua,

585
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,150
are backing you up.

586
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,740
I thought your identity

587
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,150
would definitely be revealed this time.

588
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:39,060
I didn't expect that Gong Ziyu would defend you like that.

589
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,200
Sister, you're good.

590
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,020
You didn't just sneak here

591
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,730
to praise me, right?

592
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,290
What do you want?

593
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,920
I want a way to get out of the Gong Residence.

594
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,530
You are imprisoned in the Yu Residence

595
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,700
under strict surveillance.

596
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,750
Between you and me,

597
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,140
one of us has to send the message out, right?

598
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,750
After all,

599
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,560
it's about to be half a month.

600
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,440
By the way,

601
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,060
I suddenly thought of the Fortnight Flies.

602
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,130
I was thinking

603
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,800
maybe I should reveal this secret to the whole world.

604
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,620
This way, Wufeng

605
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,800
can no longer let you work for it.

606
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,830
The Fortnight Flies

607
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,780
are just one of Wufeng's means to threaten the martial world.

608
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,740
The real leverage of Wufeng

609
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,080
is secrets.

610
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,500
Secrets?

611
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,910
Wufeng has the secrets of all sects,

612
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,300
and it threatens them with them.

613
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,350
Then, let's stay put for now.

614
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,060
We'll get them all

615
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,240
when the time is right.

616
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,470
What about Shangguan Qian?

617
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,340
Should we tell her?

618
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,360
Shangguan Qian is scheming.

619
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,870
She's hard to read and unpredictable.

620
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,070
It's not the time yet.

621
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,480
This is the secret passageway to exit the Gong Residence.

622
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,720
It also marks

623
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,280
the location of the mechanisms and how to shut them down.

624
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,620
You must have taken it down

625
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,850
last Lantern Festival

626
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:40,800
when Gong Ziyu took you down the hill.

627
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,370
Thank you, Sister.

628
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,760
I will bring the antidote back for you.

629
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,550
Where is Yun?

630
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,470
I haven't seen her for days.

631
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,710
Eldest Young Miss has come to Yu Residence a lot to hang out with her these days.

632
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,340
They've been spending a lot of time together.

633
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,480
What is Gong ZiShang up to?

634
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:06,750
Discipline her.

635
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:09,570
I...

636
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,200
What's wrong?

637
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,100
Nothing.

638
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,320
There's something I don't understand.

639
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:20,640
Go ahead.

640
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,460
Anonymous is dead.

641
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:23,960
We've also successfully rescued Young Lord Huanyu...

642
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:25,960
I mean, the former Young Lord,

643
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,990
from the back hill.

644
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,070
It has come to an end for now.

645
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,350
But why hasn't anyone held us accountable

646
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,820
for blowing up the prison and saving Yun Weishan?

647
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,900
Perhaps it's inappropriate for the Elders

648
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,240
to make this proposal

649
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,190
since their descendants were involved in this activity.

650
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,950
But why hasn't Gong Shangjue brought it up either?

651
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,580
It's like this never happened.

652
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,040
Given his personality in the past,

653
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,870
he should have made a big fuss out of this.

654
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,410
I think

655
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,100
he must be up to something.

656
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,150
I found Anonymous.

657
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,770
Wuji is Anonymous.

658
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:21,940
You want the antidote.

659
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,550
This little information isn't enough, right?

660
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,170
What about Gong Shangjue's weakness?

661
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,900
Isn't Gong Shangjue's weakness

662
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,340
Gong Yuanzhi?

663
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,120
Besides Gong Yuanzhi,

664
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,120
there's a fatal weakness

665
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,110
in his body.

666
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,160
Every half a month,

667
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,380
there're four hours

668
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,290
when Gong Shangjue has absolutely no internal skills.

669
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,490
Is it enough in exchange for the antidote?

670
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,260
From 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

671
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,650
Besides,

672
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,920
the hidden place of Infinite Heat

673
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,260
is the Underground Palace in the back hill.

674
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,120
The Infinite Heat is the top secret of the Gong family.

675
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:36,830
You even managed to know that?

676
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,180
Of course, I went through a lot of trouble for that.

677
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,800
I've sacrificed a lot this time.

678
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,200
Let's have a talk

679
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,550
after it's done.

680
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,210
I feel

681
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,330
you're more like my superior.

682
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,630
Brother, what's wrong?

683
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,410
I'm okay.

684
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,110
I stayed in the secret room for too long,

685
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,010
so I'm not used to strong light.

686
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,750
It occurred to me that there's a cellar for wine storing here.

687
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,730
There's no light,

688
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,910
so it's suitable for me to recuperate.

689
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,910
So I asked them to carry me here.

690
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,440
I plan to clean this place up

691
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,830
and move here.

692
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,000
How can you live in the cellar?

693
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,250
Ziyu, you're kind and reasonable.

694
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,390
I understand.

695
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,870
Besides,

696
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,050
you're already the Sword Wielder.

697
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:36,630
Brother.

698
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,450
The position of the Sword Wielder

699
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,970
should be yours.

700
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,460
When you get better,

701
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,350
I'll return this position to you.

702
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,170
What nonsense are you talking about?

703
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,700
We are brothers.

704
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,000
What's mine is yours.

705
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,430
There's no

706
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:04,750
borrowing or returning between us.

707
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,390
It doesn't matter

708
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,050
which of us is the Sword Wielder.

709
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,900
As long as we can protect the Gong family.

710
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:15,450
Besides,

711
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,280
I've lost all my martial arts skills.

712
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,150
I'm not qualified to be the Sword Wielder anymore.

713
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,860
Yun Weishan managed t o start internal conflict in the Gong family?

714
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,020
She's capable, indeed.

715
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,100
She made Gong Ziyu obsessed with her.

716
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,610
No one in the Gong family can do anything about her.

717
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:44,900
Although she's imprisoned in the Yu Residence

718
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:47,430
under the request of the Elders,

719
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,730
no one dares to touch her.

720
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,190
If Gong Ziyu really becomes the Sword Wielder,

721
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,730
the Gong family

722
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,560
will soon face their demise.

723
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,760
Why don't we give him a hand and

724
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,630
accelerate it?

725
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,090
How?

726
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,300
Since the Gong family is caught in internal conflict now,

727
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,810
we can gather the elite,

728
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,640
break into the Gong Residence

729
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,350
on the day Gong Shangjue's the weakest,

730
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,130
and catch them all.

731
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,880
Even if Gong Shangjue has no internal skills,

732
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,930
it won't be easy

733
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,680
to break into the Gong Residence.

734
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:06,660
Brother.

735
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:08,820
This old scar

736
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,890
is from when you saved me

737
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,310
back then.

738
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,410
Gong Ziyu. Bad news.

739
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,230
Elder found out that I went to the back hill secretly.

740
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,250
He wanted to punish me by making me kneel in the cellar...

741
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,020
Why are you still so reckless?

742
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,850
Remember to knock now that Brother is back.

743
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:29,790
Right.

744
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,640
I'll knock.

745
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,400
Brother, she's still the same.

746
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,680
[Jue]

747
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,980
Are you thinking about something, Young Master?

748
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,900
We can read each other's minds.

749
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,510
I'd like to guess

750
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,260
what you're thinking.

751
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,070
Take a guess.

752
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,420
Once Gong Ziyu passes the Trial of the Three Realms,

753
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,740
he'll be able to secure the position of Sword Wielder.

754
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,070
You are worried, Young Master.

755
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,050
Right?

756
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,350
I'm surprised

757
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,080
that he managed to get there this fast.

758
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,370
But I'm afraid

759
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,320
he's still a step away from that throne.

760
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:01,850
What's that step?

761
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,550
I've always wanted to give you this kite.

762
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,750
From now on,

763
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,530
fly high like a swan goose.

764
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,090
From now on,

765
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,680
fly high like a swan goose.

766
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,110
Your fate is unique.

767
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:39,810
Your fate is unique.

768
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,230
Be at peace.

769
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,740
Be at peace.

770
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,450
Gong Huanyu

771
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:50,130
is no longer unknown.

772
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,820
Everyone in the world will know you.

773
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,580
In troubled times, flowers bloom.

774
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,750
In troubled times, flowers bloom.

775
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,850
Wuji.

776
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:05,610
Lady Wuji wrote you this

777
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,170
when you were taking the trial, Young Master.

778
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,310
She also made you sugar-coated haws.

779
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,620
So where's yours?

780
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,030
I didn't write any.

781
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,020
But I prepared something else for you.

782
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,290
The white feather stays still.

783
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,420
Wind blows in every direction.

784
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,820
Clouds float around.

785
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,760
We met, and we'll see each other off.

786
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:10,990
Do you like it, Young Master?

787
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,240
So during the days I didn't see you,

788
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,450
you've been working on this with Gong Zishang.

789
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,730
I just forged a saber.

790
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,050
I happen to need a hilt.

791
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,320
You're so thoughtful.

792
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:30,770
Of course I like it.

793
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,880
But

794
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,970
I don't like the last line.

795
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,270
We finally found each other.

796
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,660
Let's not see each other off.

797
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:50,350
For the rest of our lives.

798
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,020
You prepared a surprise for me.

799
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,070
I'm happy.

800
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,650
So why are you upset?

801
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,220
You must leave.

802
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,010
Before then,

803
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,360
don't let Lord Sword Wielder know.

804
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:40,990
Otherwise,

805
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,190
he won't let you go.

806
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,090
You always carry

807
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,800
your saber with you.

808
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,400
Now you have this hilt.

809
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:50,790
It will feel like

810
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,440
as if

811
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,460
I'm always by your side.

812
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:00,160
I also have a saber to give you.

813
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,050
But

814
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,960
I have to pass the test of the third realm first.

815
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,330
You will.

816
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,020
As long as I can hold the saber,

817
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,950
I will always protect you.

818
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,090
No matter what happens,

819
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,280
you have to hold on.

820
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,810
This is the last thing I can do for you.

821
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:47,130
What if Young Master Ziyu

822
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,860
manages to take the last step?

823
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:52,580
What will you do then, Young Master?

824
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,310
I will recognize him.

825
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,400
And I'll hold an official

826
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,090
Sword Wielder accession ceremony

827
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,590
for him.

828
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,360
Really?

829
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:12,820
Are you serious

830
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,030
about that?

831
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,680
Can't you read my mind?

832
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:25,040
What do you think?

833
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,170
Then I need to have a talk

834
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,790
with your heart.

835
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,260
How?

836
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,440
Your heart tells me

837
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,560
you care about the Gong family very much, Young Master.

838
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,100
So,

839
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,530
it doesn't matter

840
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:17,390
who becomes the Sword Wielder of the Gong family.

841
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,510
But what matters is that

842
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,530
that person has to be able to shoulder the responsibility of the Gong family.

843
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,400
You're always against Gong Ziyu

844
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:31,370
because he knows there's a spy from Wufeng beside him,

845
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,900
but he's always covering up for her and deceiving others.

846
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,820
He's putting the safety of the Gong family behind him.

847
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:41,680
However,

848
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,540
you couldn't do anything because you had no evidence.

849
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,280
I will do my best

850
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,310
to fulfill your wish, Young Master.

851
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,370
What is this?

852
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:10,670
This is the hard evidence

853
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,350
of Yun Weishan

854
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,060
being Wufeng's spy.

855
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,290
She secretly took down

856
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,470
all the secret tunnels and posts in the Gong Residence,

857
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:29,620
as well as the location of the Xue, Yue, and Hua Residences

858
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:31,700
in the back hill.

859
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,470
Good job.

860
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,890
But I'm also curious.

861
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:43,690
How did you get

862
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,270
such an important item?

863
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,900
I found it in her room.

864
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,130
It's getting cold.

865
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,780
I went to borrow some clothes from her,

866
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,420
when I found

867
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,400
a hidden pouch

868
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,000
sewn in a pocket of her coat.

869
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,900
This drawing

870
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,100
completely matches the layout of the Gong Residence.

871
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,440
But how can we prove that it was drawn by Yun Weishan?

872
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,460
Shangguan Qian

873
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,070
even managed to find the weakness of Gong Shangjue.

874
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,960
As expected from Mei. She's much better than Yun Weishan,

875
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,750
who got nothing done

876
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,110
and even got her identity revealed.

877
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,580
She's now imprisoned in the Yu Residence.

878
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,600
She can't even deliver any message to us.

879
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,230
She has to count on Mei to get the antidote.

880
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,100
Mei couldn't get out before either, right?

881
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:13,300
What's there to be proud of?

882
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:17,550
Besides,

883
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,190
how do you know that Yun Weishan didn't reveal her identity on purpose

884
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:21,920
because she had another plan?

885
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:25,520
The new Sword Wielder of the Gong family has completely fallen for her.

886
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,110
Sonner or later,

887
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,780
the Gong family will be torn apart.

888
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,880
Your judgment on Yun Weishan

889
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,200
is becoming more and more irrational.

890
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:34,920
I advise you

891
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,410
not to mess with me.

892
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,920
♫River lights, mountains dark, moon round♫

893
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,270

♫Love begins with a point in one's heart♫

♫I have an empty room in my heart♫

01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,760
♫But it can't be filled by gold and silver♫

♫Ask the flowers and leaves whom they fall for♫

01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,410
You can't stay in the Gong Residence anymore.

♫Wish moonlight can soothe the displaced ones♫

906
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,510
I know.

907

I will leave.

908
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:41,610
I won't make things difficult for him.

909
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:45,850
Yun.

♫We can't make the best of both worlds♫

I took Wufeng's order and came to the Gong Residence

913
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,470
for freedom.

914
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:13,070
I don't want to hurt people anymore.

915

♫Gazing at the vague outline of the mountains from afar♫

916
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:27,010
