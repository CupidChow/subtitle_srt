[My Journey to You]

3
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,000
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,110
I heard from the servants

5
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,750
that you didn't eat much dinner.

6
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,539
I was afraid you would be hungry.

7
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,750
So I made some cakes

8
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,100
and tea.

9
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,360
They can help to calm your nerves.

10
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,700
I wanted to go to the clinic

11
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,280
and get some herbal medicines which help to calm nerves.

12
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,250
But since the Gong residence became secure,

13
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,810
Young Master Yuanzhi

14
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,490
has placed many restrictions on the receipt of medicine in the clinic.

15
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,610
So I went to the kitchen,

16
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,340
took some ready-made food,

17
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,150
and made some mimosa flower tea for you.

18
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,520
Don't bother.

19
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,020
Let's eat together.

20
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,030
Chat with me.

21
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,380
Young Master,

22
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,360
are you still thinking about Lady Lan?

23
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,920
Since childhood, I thought

24
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,930
I was observant

25
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,190
and sensitive.

26
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,330
But it turns out

27
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,220
I never knew what my parents were thinking.

28
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,020
And my brother who died.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,160
It seems

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,800
that I never really knew them.

31
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,010
You suddenly lost your father and brother

32
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,340
and became the Sword Wielder.

33
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,750
And in a short time,

34
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,530
you have to pass three trials.

35
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,270
Murders also happened again and again in the Gong residence.

36
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,430
You must be very stressed.

37
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,370
No matter how stressed I am,

38
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,470
I can't say I'm tired

39
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,110
or complain.

40
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,380
I can't

41
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,560
let people think I'm incompetent either.

42
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,190
Otherwise,

43
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,520
people who are in the shadows

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,780
will take advantage of it.

45
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,310
You can tell me

46
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,580
about your suffering.

47
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,530
Although

48
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,140
I'm not good at speaking

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,610
and don't know how to comfort you,

50
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,140
I can be your listener

51
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,700
or sing for you.

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,440
You're not good at speaking?

53
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,300
You're eloquent.

54
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,890
But

55
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,870
even if you're a caring flower,

56
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,830
I don't want

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,010
to make you worry.

58
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,770
No caring flower

59
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,090
minds listening to people's problems.

60
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,210
You don't understand.

61
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,770
Growing flowers and grasses isn't easy.

62
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,650
If people keep complaining,

63
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
they won't flourish.

64
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,850
Really?

65
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:55,930
Of course.

66
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,260
It's like if you keep saying bad words

67
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,290
to a glass of water,

68
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,280
the water will become cloudy.

69
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,530
Are you lying?

70
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,180
I'm not lying to you.

71
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,680
So,

72
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,290
the same goes for growing flowers.

73
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,550
What should people say to flowers?

74
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,650
We should

75
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,580
praise her for her beauty,

76
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,670
praise her for being thoughtful,

77
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,040
praise her for being lovable,

78
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,960
praise her for being sensitive,

79
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,510
and praise her for having eyes

80
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,020
which are like stars.

81
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,190
Flowers also have eyes?

82
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm not talking about flowers.

83
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,630
You're blushing.

84
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,520
It's late.

85
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,640
You should rest early.

86
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,580
I'm leaving.

87
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,550
She's really shy.

88
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,810
It doesn't work.

89
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,000
There's half a month left.

90
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,030
What should I do?

91
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,280
Why are you still here?

92
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,530
This is my home.

93
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,690
Why should I leave?

94
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,930
Why did you

95
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,900
keep looking at the tiger embroidery just now?

96
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,280
You were in a trance.

97
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,820
That belonged to his younger brother.

98
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,320
Is he Brother Lang you mentioned

99
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,540
just now?

100
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,150
Yes.

101
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,240
Why can you always hear our conversations?

102
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,200
You like eavesdropping, right?

103
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,659
You should ask yourself

104
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,300
if you come to the Jue Lineage

105
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,120
too often.

106
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,100
Is it uncomfortable to live in the Zhi Lineage?

107
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,980
It's proper for me

108
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,350
to come and see my future husband.

109
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,640
You're almost an adult.

110
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,540
Find a wife.

111
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,710
Don't pester your brother every day.

112
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,080
Mind your own business.

113
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,460
It doesn't matter.

114
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,180
If you don't tell me,

115
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,580
I'll ask him later.

116
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,240
Don't ask him.

117
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,750
If you ask, he'll remember the sad thing again.

118
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,050
What is the sad thing?

119
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,370
My brother

120
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,740
had a biological younger brother

121
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,169
who he loved the most.

122
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,000
Aren't you the younger brother

123
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,950
who he loves the most?

124
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,430
In his heart,

125
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,780
no one can compare to Brother Lang.

126
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,710
Mother.

127
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,240
Yo.

128
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,900
Young Master Shangjue.

129
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,780
You're here to pick up your mother and brother again?

130
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,060
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.

131
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,430
Mr. Jingjie said it's my brother. Then it's my brother.

132
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,680
Okay. It's your brother.

133
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:10,820
Shangjue.

134
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,040
Which one do you like?

135
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,410
The little tiger.

136
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,040
You're an elder brother now.

137
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:17,980
In the future,

138
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,070
take good care of your younger brother.

139
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,210
Sure.

140
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,380
Brother, I want to practice using knives too.

141
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,070
You're still a kid.

142
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,770
You'll hurt yourself.

143
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,870
Brother, this dagger looks good.

144
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,860
Great!

145
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,830
I can also practice using knives.

146
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,940
I can also practice using knives.

147
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,210
Then

148
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,800
why have I never seen Brother Lang?

149
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,440
Ten years ago,

150
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,690
he and Lady Ling

151
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,270
were both killed by people from the Wufeng.

152
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,290
Anyway,

153
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,180
don't ask around.

154
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,410
Young Master Shangjue.

155
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,450
Leave it.

156
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,710
Why are you here?

157
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,430
The servants heard something

158
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,120
being broken.

159
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,070
They dared not come in.

160
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,900
They were afraid that they would offend you.

161
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,460
You dared to come?

162
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,110
I'm scared too.

163
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,820
But I know

164
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,230
no matter how angry you are,

165
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,860
there should be someone

166
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,340
in the room serving you.

167
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,260
Besides,

168
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,010
I know

169
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,730
although you look scary,

170
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,300
you're actually very gentle.

171
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,900
Come here.

172
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,870
Give me your hand.

173
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,940
How do you know

174
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,310
my hand was scratched?

175
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,730
The smell.

176
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,590
I've been in the martial world for years.

177
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,490
I'm very sensitive to the smell of blood.

178
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,940
Do you still think I'm gentle?

179
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,890
It's just a minor injury.

180
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,350
Fingers and hearts are inseparably linked.

181
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,290
It hurts.

182
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,510
I have to say it.

183
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,420
If you say it, will your hand stop hurting?

184
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,330
If you say it,

185
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,930
will the wound heal without medicine?

186
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:47,800
No.

187
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,140
But when I was a child,

188
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,480
every time I skinned my knees,

189
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,150
my mother

190
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,040
would...

191
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,720
When she was applying medicine for me,

192
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,510
she said,

193
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,800
"Qian, if it hurts,

194
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,310
tell me."

195
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,450
Every time my mother told me this,

196
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,670
the wound

197
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,730
didn't hurt that much.

198
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,600
Isn't it good

199
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,600
to be cared about?

200
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,940
The world of children

201
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,560
is different from the world of adults.

202
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
In the martial world,

203
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,890
happiness and prestige

204
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,400
can be shared and showed.

205
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,360
But pains and secrets

206
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,650
cannot be revealed.

207
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,300
So people

208
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,220
often laugh with others.

209
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,050
But few people

210
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,320
cry with others.

211
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,270
Few.

212
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,650
But not zero.

213
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,070
If you bury the wounds in your heart

214
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,420
and touch them

215
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,690
again and again,

216
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,190
you'll have more scars.

217
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,800
Have you ever seen wounded beasts?

218
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,670
They don't show their wounds to others.

219
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,780
Because the weak cannot be tolerated in the colony.

220
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,970
They just find a dark cave

221
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,220
and lick their wounds quietly,

222
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,570
waiting for recovery

223
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,300
or death.

224
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,520
But humans are not beasts.

225
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,660
Beasts have no heart,

226
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,140
but humans do.

227
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,860
A heart

228
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,010
must have a place to stay.

229
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,950
If you have someone

230
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,310
who can boil snow and warm alcohol for you,

231
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,830
even if it's not bright and hot enough,

232
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,880
it'll be enough for you to spend the winter in your heart.

233
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,680
But not everyone in your heart

234
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,250
will warm up a bottle of alcohol for you.

235
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,300
Maybe

236
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,710
he'll leave a scar

237
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,710
on your heart.

238
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,650
Go to the clinic

239
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,820
tomorrow.

240
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,220
The minor injury isn't serious.

241
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,040
That's not what I meant.

242
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,690
Hmm?

243
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,660
Your hands are hot.

244
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,000
The temperature of your hands isn't normal.

245
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,940
It's caused by either sickness

246
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,650
or poison.

247
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,040
I caught a cold a few days ago.

248
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,880
I'm feverish.

249
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,200
Have you taken medicine?

250
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,730
No.

251
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,599
After Elder Yue was killed,

252
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,140
people need Young Master Yuanzhi's permission

253
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,040
to come in and out of the clinic.

254
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,890
The rules on the receipt of medicine are stricter.

255
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
Take my token

256
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,670
and ask the doctor

257
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,160
to give you the medicine you request.

258
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,950
This token is...

259
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,230
In the Gong residence,

260
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,760
you're allowed to go everywhere.

261
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,320
Thank you, my lord.

262
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,020
This box contains

263
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,640
some of your father's old things.

264
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,850
I didn't give it to you before

265
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,200
because I didn't want you to be sad

266
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,080
when you see it.

267
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,900
Now,

268
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,130
I should give it to you.

269
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,200
New Snow leans on Taiyuan.

270
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,690
Start from New Snow.

271
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,700
Use strength at the Taiyuan acupoint.

272
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,620
The wrists are the most flexible

273
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,020
and the moves

274
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,250
are the fastest.

275
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,680
Air Frost.

276
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,380
Use strength at the Chize acupoint.

277
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,620
Using elbows to keep control is the most effective.

278
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,610
As for Cold Wave, using strength at the Yunmen acupoint

279
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,470
can stimulate all the qi and blood in the upper body

280
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,930
and increase the pressure of the knife.

281
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,160
You began to practice at dawn.

282
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,980
Did you learn it from an expert

283
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,170
or figure it out by yourself?

284
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,790
I learnt it from an expert.

285
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,060
Xue Chongzi.

286
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,580
In order to ask you to take him out for fun,

287
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,100
he helped you cheat.

288
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,020
I learnt it from my father.

289
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,640
Former Sword Wielder?

290
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,350
What a bad day.

291
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,520
You promised

292
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,510
that you would find Anonymous within ten days.

293
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,180
The deadline is up.

294
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,830
Logically speaking,

295
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,290
Young Master Shangjue

296
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,000
should come to the Yu Lineage and report it to me.

297
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,970
But I was worried

298
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,660
Young Master Shangjue didn't find the truth

299
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,510
and was ashamed to see me.

300
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,440
So,

301
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,660
I specifically came here to ask you.

302
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,060
It's not that he is too ashamed to see you.

303
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,590
He just doesn't want to see you.

304
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,460
My brother has already found something.

305
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,560
He's going to the Council of Elders and reporting it.

306
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,130
Really?

307
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,770
I've found out

308
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,360
the identity of Anonymous.

309
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,030
I was going to

310
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,820
discuss it with the elders.

311
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,970
Since you

312
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,430
came here in person,

313
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,270
I can tell you first.

314
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,810
But I don't know

315
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,930
if you

316
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,160
can take it.

317
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,110
There are three suspects.

318
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,460
The first one

319
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,590
is the leader of Yellow Jade guardians.

320
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,820
The second one

321
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,740
is the housekeeper of the Council of Elders.

322
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,690
But these two people

323
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,670
were temporarily cleared.

324
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,970
Then there's

325
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,190
the third suspect left.

326
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,040
Lady Wuji.

327
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,840
You were pushed so hard

328
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,300
and wanted to frame her, right?

329
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,910
Hey.

330
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,310
We have proof.

331
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,630
When you questioned my blood

332
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,900
in the Council of Elders,

333
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,030
you also had proof.

334
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,030
What?

335
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,240
Weren't you given a slap in the face?

336
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,860
That's why

337
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,060
we won't let you gloat again.

338
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,070
Besides,

339
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,730
we also want you to know

340
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,940
how a slap in the face feels.

341
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,020
We interrogated all the guardians

342
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,580
who were on guard that night

343
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,750
and found out

344
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,800
that no one knew where the three people were

345
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,250
on the night Elder Yue was killed.

346
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,210
And these three people

347
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,860
could approach Elder Yue easily.

348
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,460
Then why are you only suspecting Lady Wuji?

349
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,790
Why don't you hide

350
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,450
your ulterior motive?

351
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,030
What's the rush?

352
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,600
He hasn't gotten to the point yet.

353
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,720
According to the rules of the Gong family,

354
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,200
our servants and guardians

355
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,560
were all selected from Jiuchen Valley.

356
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,960
Most of the people in the valley

357
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,860
have been living there for generations.

358
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,940
They don't know martial arts.

359
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,830
It's hard to find spies from the Wufeng

360
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,220
there.

361
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,760
The leader of Yellow Jade guardians

362
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,420
and the housekeeper of the Council of Elders

363
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,480
are both from Jiuchen Valley.

364
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,020
For this alone,

365
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,570
they were cleared?

366
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,100
That's too arbitrary.

367
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,810
You're right.

368
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,140
According to my style,

369
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,380
I sent some people

370
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,430
to investigate their backgrounds.

371
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,640
The leader of Yellow Jade guardians

372
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,570
is Jin Yunfeng.

373
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,030
His surname used to be Qian.

374
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,870
His family ran a clinic.

375
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,190
Because of his strong body,

376
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,690
when he was seven,

377
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,890
he was chosen to enter the Gong residence

378
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,990
and trained as a guardian.

379
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,790
Later, he was granted the surname Jin.

380
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,670
The ancestors of the housekeeper Hu Hai

381
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,790
were carpenters.

382
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,060
Ten years ago,

383
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,830
he started working in the kitchen of the Council of Elders.

384
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,800
He had been working hard for many years

385
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,570
before being promoted

386
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,050
to the housekeeper of the Council of Elders.

387
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,060
These two people's families

388
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,090
have been living in Jiuchen Valley for generations.

389
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,300
But Lady Wuji is different.

390
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,790
Lady Wuji

391
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,820
became Lady Lan's servant before she married into the Gong family.

392
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,080
She's obviously an outsider.

393
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,010
Of course she's the most suspicious.

394
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,950
What's more ridiculous is

395
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,720
that her identity as a servant is fake.

396
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,900
She's not from the Gusu family.

397
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,260
Before entering the Yang family,

398
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,230
her identity

399
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,320
is unknown.

400
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,000
What's interesting is

401
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,820
that the year she entered the Yang family

402
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,160
and became Lady Lan's servant

403
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,470
was exactly the year the former Sword Wielder,

404
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,010
your father Gong Hongyu,

405
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,250
was attacked by people from the Wufeng

406
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,950
near the Yang family's mansion.

407
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,310
Everything you said

408
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,990
is just your conjecture.

409
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,200
I can also say

410
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,500
because you failed to threaten Concubine

411
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,400
and had a grudge against her,

412
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,620
you deliberately slandered her.

413
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,200
If you really want to accuse her,

414
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,210
show me evidence.

415
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,610
You said it yourself.

416
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,590
Argument

417
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,570
is quite boring.

418
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,600
It'll only make you

419
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,910
petty people who want to use this chance

420
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,840
to take revenge.

421
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,730
We dare to say this

422
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,820
because we have witnesses.

423
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,570
In the later investigation,

424
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,290
both Jin Yunfeng and Housekeeper Hu

425
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
had alibis.

426
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,590
Only Wuji

427
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,350
had no alibi.

428
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,220
She said

429
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,250
she's old.

430
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,390
She went to bed early.

431
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,160
It was cold at night in winter.

432
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,120
She didn't open the door and the windows.

433
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,430
She didn't want to catch a cold.

434
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,550
She also specially asked the servants

435
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,910
not to disturb her unless something happened.

436
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,190
What Concubine said is not wrong.

437
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,620
No one can prove

438
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,840
what they haven't done.

439
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,840
I've also told you

440
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,310
if you really want to accuse her,

441
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,510
show me solid evidence.

442
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,540
Witnesses

443
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,180
and physical evidence.

444
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,140
Don't worry.

445
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,230
I'll have evidence.

446
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
As long as I keep investigating...

447
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,740
Keep investigating?

448
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,830
Ten days are up.

449
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,820
You failed to keep your promise.

450
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,800
You haven't passed

451
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,900
the Trial of the Three Realms either.

452
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,740
There's not

453
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,780
much time left.

454
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,910
If you continue to be idle,

455
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,720
you'll lose the poistion

456
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,690
of the Sword Wielder.

457
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,040
Since neither of us

458
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,320
kept our promise,

459
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,690
we're even.

460
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,390
I hope

461
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,640
you can find solid evidence.

462
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,030
Otherwise,

463
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,310
don't waste time in pestering Concubine.

464
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,830
I don't need you to teach me how to investigate.

465
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,840
But you.

466
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,470
Do you need me to teach you

467
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,790
how to pass the next two trials?

468
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,220
I heard you were quarreling

469
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,770
outside.

470
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,340
It doesn't matter.

471
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,830
Why are you here?

472
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,980
I heard from the servants

473
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,670
that you've been tired

474
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,190
and haven't slept well recently.

475
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,670
These days,

476
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,810
you often wake up in the early hours of morning to light candles.

477
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,390
There's a kind of pillow

478
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,270
which can help to calm nerves in my hometown.

479
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,550
It's made from Huangyang Mu.

480
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,550
Putting some scented leaves

481
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,970
which are boiled by Wuteng soup

482
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,370
can help you to calm your nerves and sleep well.

483
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,860
If I can find it for you

484
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,420
from the market,

485
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,170
you'll sleep well

486
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,300
at night.

487
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,220
You've entered the Gong residence.

488
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,710
Don't always think about outside things.

489
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,170
If you really need anything,

490
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,820
ask the servants to buy it.

491
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,000
Of course.

492
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:24,860
Of course...

493
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,240
The bride of the Gong family

494
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,870
can't go in and out at will.

495
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,770
I know the rules.

496
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,600
I just wanted to say

497
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,280
since Young Master Yuanzhi is here,

498
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,570
I just wanted to ask

499
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,070
if I can go to the clinic

500
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,030
to see if there are these things.

501
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,190
Go quickly.

502
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,460
I have something to tell my brother.

503
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,490
Yes.

504
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,530
Brother.

505
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,840
Lady Wuji is cunning

506
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,680
and deceived us.

507
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,220
If she stops committing these crimes,

508
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,740
if we want to get evidence–

509
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,890
She won't stop.

510
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,020
Because her mission hasn't been completed yet.

511
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,700
You know her mission?

512
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,770
No.

513
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,620
But it’s not as simple as just

514
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,040
assassinating Elder Yue.

515
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,380
Let’s wait for her next move.

516
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,980
You have already adjusted

517
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,250
the security of the Gong family

518
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,050
and added so many

519
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,600
hidden guards invisible to the eyes.

520
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,440
If she kills again,

521
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,840
she will definitely give herself away.

522
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,540
But I won't allow her to kill again.

523
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,000
Every drop of blood of the Gong family

524
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,650
cannot be trampled by outsiders.

525
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,040
Ten years ago,

526
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,550
the promise I made gritting my teeth,

527
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,720
I will definitely keep it.

528
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:25,750
Miss Yun.

529
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,540
You can't enter

530
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,300
without Young Master Yuanzhi's command.

531
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,590
I'm sick.

532
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,810
Can't I see a doctor?

533
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,130
You can.

534
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,720
Miss Yun, please return home first.

535
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,900
I will send a doctor

536
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,840
to your residence

537
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,020
to take your pulse and prescribe medicine

538
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,170
and send the herbs back to Yu Lineage later.

539
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,470
Miss Shangguan.

540
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,540
Young Master Shangjue gave me his token

541
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,610
to me.

542
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,160
He asked me to come collect some medicine.

543
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:53,910
Understood.

544
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,170
You put the stones in front of the clinic.

545
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,750
How bold of you.

546
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,530
If I didn't put it in an obvious place,

547
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,210
I'm afraid you won't come.

548
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,470
The fire is burning you up

549
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,660
and you're trying to get some medicine

550
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,780
but can't, right?

551
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,490
I did though.

552
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,290
I can give you some.

553
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,980
You're so kind?

554
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,800
Thank you, then.

555
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
Don't be anxious, sister.

556
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,660
Take a walk with me.

557
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,090
He's really biological?

558
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,390
Yes.

559
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,590
It seems that in terms of blood,

560
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,850
it's difficult to find a breakthrough point for Gong Shangjue.

561
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,500
If Gong Ziyu

562
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,400
can pass the trials successfully,

563
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,240
his position as the Sword Wielder

564
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,640
will be concrete.

565
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,550
You pretended to cooperate

566
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,590
and gave me that half of the medical case.

567
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,930
But secretly,

568
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,730
you joined hands with Wuji

569
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,350
to humiliate Gong Shangjue in front of the Council of Elders.

570
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:43,990
At the same time,

571
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,960
you also made yourself

572
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,400
even more likeable to Gong Ziyu,

573
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,930
You're amazing.

574
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,500
Let's do it according to our capabilities.

575
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,610
You call that according to our capabilities?

576
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,860
Aren't you afraid of implicating me?

577
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,980
When you forced me to get the medical record

578
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,770
to please Gong Shangjue,

579
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,450
you didn't consider my situation.

580
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,980
Your internal skill is in disorder.

581
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,640
The burning of the Fortnight Flies

582
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,340
doesn't feel good, does it?

583
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,570
The skill I practice is extremely yin

584
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,020
and clashes with the burning poison directly.

585
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,200
No matter how painful it is,

586
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,210
it's just a disorder in my internal skill

587
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,000
Meanwhile, the skill you practice is extremely yang

588
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,170
and you can't even bring up your internal skill.

589
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,230
You must be more uncomfortable than I am.

590
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,700
But the medicine

591
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,760
is in my hands now.

592
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,420
Either

593
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,300
be obedient and cooperate with me,

594
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,910
or

595
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,780
be tortured slowly.

596
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,830
These herbs

597
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,610
can only suppress the poison temporarily.

598
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,550
As soon as the fortnight comes,

599
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,380
we still have to leave the Gong Residence

600
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,050
to get the antidote from the person sent.

601
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,350
Otherwise,

602
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,080
we'll all die.

603
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,200
It's just a matter of time.

604
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,560
I will definitely find a way out.

605
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,030
Do you even believe

606
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,380
what you said?

607
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,080
It must be hard to live

608
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:19,699
under the nose of Gong Shangjue.

609
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,570
You don't even dare to show your tail.

610
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,679
Why don't you give me the medicine?

611
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,580
I'll go exchange them for you.

612
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,409
I've found a way out of the Gong Residence.

613
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,010
What did you say?

614
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,560
Thank you, Sister.

615
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,530
Can you give me the medicine?

616
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,430
Yes.

617
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,210
But...

618
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,730
we don't have enough herbs.

619
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,090
You're going back on your words?

620
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,670
You underestimate me.

621
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,740
I never go back on my words.

622
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,430
Go to the clinic

623
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,810
with me again.

624
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,980
Thank you.

625
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,900
Look at my memory.

626
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,140
I forgot these herbs.

627
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,950
I have to

628
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,560
thank Sister Yun for reminding me.

629
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,360
[Shang]

630
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,810
Eldest Young Miss.

631
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,950
It's so hard.

632
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,160
So hard.

633
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,140
Why praise me?

634
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,420
It's so hard.

635
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,220
Eldest Young Miss.

636
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,940
Why are you working here alone again?

637
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,120
Where are your servants from the Shang Lineage?

638
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,490
They don't treat you like a lady at all.

639
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,160
That's outrageous.

640
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,320
Tell me.

641
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,830
Do you want me

642
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,960
to go knock some sense into them?

643
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,540
On what basis?

644
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,490
You're just a craftsman.

645
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,830
Take this

646
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,460
to knock on the roof

647
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,690
to see where's leaking.

648
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,090
What are you doing?

649
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,480
It's so lethal.

650
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,420
You're is amazing.

651
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,090
This must be the secret weapon you just invented?

652
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,980
This is the dessert I made for Jin Fan.

653
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,690
What did Jin Fan do wrong?

654
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,290
He doesn't deserve this, does he?

655
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,340
Shut up!

656
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,420
Eldest Young Miss,

657
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,470
how long has it been since you last did research with me?

658
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,220
Things like research

659
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,890
requires persistence.

660
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,340
You can't be distracted by these things,

661
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,200
especially men.

662
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,220
Stay away from men.

663
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,570
Otherwise,

664
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,360
you will encounter misfortune.

665
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,360
Then why are you

666
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,160
so close to me?

667
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,180
I don't count.

668
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,800
You're a lady disguised as a man?

669
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,270
I'm a real man of seven feet.

670
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,920
Do not insult me.

671
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:26,920
I'm sorry.

672
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:29,840
Hey!

673
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,370
Look at you.

674
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,110
You're so impatient.

675
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,880
Girls

676
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,800
should be gentle like a spring,

677
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,450
and reserved like a stone.

678
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,800
Look at you.

679
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,730
You're so loud.

680
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,140
What kind of impression are you leaving for Jin Fan?

681
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,760
You speak like a knife,

682
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,760
cutting into my heart.

683
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,790
Look at your dirty face.

684
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,960
Your beauty

685
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,250
has been covered by the clouds.

686
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,050
Xiaohei,

687
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,620
you're not only considerate,

688
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,860
but also have good taste.

689
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,010
What smells so good?

690
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,810
Hoho.

691
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,420
You have good taste too.

692
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,060
I boiled this handkerchief

693
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,790
in wintersweet on low heat

694
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,270
for a whole night.

695
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,530
The smell lingers

696
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,980
and is refreshing.

697
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,640
You are a man of seven feet

698
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,820
using a fragrant handkerchief?

699
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,930
You have a problem.

700
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,380
Who?

701
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,690
You.

702
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,220
Who stinks?

703
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,040
-You stink.
-Who has a problem?

704
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,040
You have a problem.

705
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,800
Although I'm a craftsman,

706
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,460
I take personal hygiene very seriously

707
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,380
and clean myself too.

708
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,420
All right. Got it.

709
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,850
Stay away from men.

710
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,400
Yes.

711
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,350
Otherwise, I will encounter misfortune.

712
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:40,750
Yes.

713
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,400
Hey!

714
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,800
Don't just listen to just this line!

715
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,130
Give it to me.

716
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,230
I'll go out

717
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,830
to get the antidote for you.

718
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,550
Give this to Hanya Qi for me.

719
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,260
What is this?

720
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,050
Gong Yuanzhi's hidden weapon.

721
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,660
I've drawn a sketch

722
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,050
and retrieved the fragments.

723
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,360
It can help Wufeng research

724
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,470
what kind of poison it is on it.

725
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,300
A Gong family secret weapon

726
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,250
can be bought at a price on the outside.

727
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,290
You can get the antidote

728
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,270
with just this?

729
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,840
You haven't opened up and researched on

730
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,510
Gong Yuanzhi's secret weapon pouch?

731
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,820
I thought you'd have at least

732
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,500
opened it and took a look.

733
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,210
If I opened it up to research on it

734
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,500
before sending it to you,

735
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,320
you would have been locked up in the prison by now.

736
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,000
You're right.

737
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,760
I should thank you.

738
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,200
The hidden weapons used by Gong Yuanzhi himself

739
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,180
is different from from the normal Gong family secret weapon

740
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,340
that can be bought outside.

741
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,730
It's way more lethal.

742
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,780
The structure is also exquisite.

743
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,540
It's like a craftsman's artwork.

744
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:08,920
What?

745
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,060
Gunpowder.

746
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,450
Gunpowder?

747
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,150
In the small secret weapon,

748
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,810
there's a firing pin

749
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,510
and gunpowder.

750
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,050
When triggered with collision,

751
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,360
it will explode,

752
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,220
causing the metallic blade with the poison to activate a second time.

753
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,960
It can even penetrate armor.

754
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,760
Looks like

755
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,300
you should be able to get the antidote.

756
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,290
What about you?

757
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,360
How is the map coming along?

758
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,290
I'm still short of a lot.

759
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,200
However,

760
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,600
my main takeaway is,

761
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,490
the direction Wufeng was going towards previously was wrong.

762
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,050
The front hill is not the focus.

763
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,510
The most important place in the Gong Residence

764
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,830
is the back hill.

765
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,150
Sir.

766
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,610
Yong Master Yuanzhi.

767
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,630
This is the prescription Miss Shangguan Qian just took.

768
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,130
Two?

769
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,670
She also got a serving for Miss Yun.

770
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:18,850
You may leave.

771
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,640
Is there any problem with the prescription?

772
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,300
It looks...

773
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,470
like two servings of

774
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,540
medicine that can help cool one's body down.

775
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,240
Medicine?

776
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,240
What happened?

777
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,250
What else could it be?

778
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:55,890
Jin Fan...

779
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,870
insulted me.

780
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,810
Don't you think you're being too harsh with your words?

781
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,240
I don't think he's that kind of person.

782
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,080
That's who he is.

783
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,760
You know a person's face,

784
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,560
but not their true nature.

785
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,050
What is this?

786
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,770
Today is the Lantern Festival.

787
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,200
I wanted to make him a box of delicate cakes.

788
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,420
I've been working

789
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,340
since morning.

790
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,630
I worked so hard. He didn't eat anything.

791
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,720
Could it be...

792
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,470
because Guardian Jin is vegetarian

793
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,100
so he's not eating the meat puffs?

794
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,970
This is peach blossom pastry.

795
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,080
Maybe he's allergic to peach blossoms–

796
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,430
This is peach blossom pastry?

797
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,600
How hurtful, Miss Yun.

798
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,470
I'll go teach Guardian Kim a lesson later.

799
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,850
Whatever this is,

800
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,540
it's a gift from you.

801
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,540
My sincerity was returned

802
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,000
with coldness.

803
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:10,930
Eldest Yong Miss.

804
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,010
When I see you making desserts,

805
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,990
it reminds me of my childhood.

806
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,130
Every year on the Lantern Festival,

807
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,690
there will be many delicate pastries sold on the streets every year.

808
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,580
Jujube cake,

809
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:28,850
osmanthus candy,

810
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,800
dragon's beard candy,

811
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,980
and even salted-egg yolk filling glutinous rice balls.

812
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,690
So many?

813
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,770
There should be some in the

814
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,830
Jiuchen Valley's market too.

815
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:39,950
Other than

816
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,930
the difference in customs at the borders,

817
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,260
the Lantern Festival

818
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,060
is well-celebrated everywhere.

819
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,670
Jiangnan, Saibei,

820
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,080
Bashu, Jiangliu,

821
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,330
there will be lanterns everywhere.

822
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,230
Thousands of families bustle with the music,

823
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,280
and the lanterns continue for over ten miles.

824
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,170
This talks about the Lantern Festival.

825
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,440
Eldest Young Miss,

826
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,190
haven't you visited the Lantern Festival?

827
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,180
No.

828
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,490
Since I was young,

829
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,880
I have never been out.

830
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,090
What a pity.

831
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,070
I remember a poem.

832
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,300
The colorful sky shines on the ground,

833
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,320
the lights stud the sky.

834
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,670
It looks like stars falling,

835
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,790
and moon hanging.

836
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,650
It talks about how

837
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,100
people enjoy the lanterns and the moon,

838
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,250
sing and dance.

839
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,720
Young men and women

840
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,510
will express their feelings to each other

841
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,030
on this romantic day.

842
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,550
You've read so many novels.

843
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:41,930
Do they not talk about it?

844
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,790
They do.

845
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,360
Yes, they do.

846
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,520
Every year at the Lantern Festival,

847
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,900
girls

848
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,580
will dress up nicely.

849
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,100
Because it is said that

850
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,020
it's on this night,

851
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:58,140
that you'll most likely meet your destined one.

852
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,210
The destined one?

853
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,520
In the sea of lanterns,

854
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,670
people's heads flutter.

855
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,120
If you can meet someone

856
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,660
you like on this night,

857
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,590
it's fate.

858
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,160
Do you know

859
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,650
what the last sentence

860
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,160
of the poem I said just now is?

861
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,720
The laughter of young ladies

862
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,580
sound before the thousand lights.

863
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,160
I can imagine

864
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,550
you shine brightly

865
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,240
under the fireworks.

866
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,540
Fireworks?

867
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,090
Jin

868
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,230
Fan.

869
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,260
Come quickly.

870
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,670
What are we waiting for?

871
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,070
Unfortunately,

872
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,260
we can't go out.

873
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,640
Gong Ziyu.

874
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,440
Gong Ziyu!

875
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,200
Can you be softer?

876
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,780
People who don't know would think

877
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,820
you have great internal skill

878
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,560
and can shout across a thousand miles.

879
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,020
Your voice is so loud.

880
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:17,340
There are fewer birds in the yard recently too.

881
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:18,580
Jin Fan.

882
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:20,070
Sit.

883
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,420
Do you know

884
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,130
what day it is today?

885
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,250
The Lantern Festival?

886
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,350
Guess again.

887
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,170
Are you trying to say

888
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,140
it's a big day for you and Jin Fan?

889
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,070
Do you think I am

890
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,100
someone who only think about

891
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,410
love and laugh all day long

892
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,200
and not do my job?

893
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,310
You are.

894
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,810
Today is the big day

895
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,390
we celebrate your passing of

896
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,240
the first trial.

897
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,660
It was the day before yesterday.

898
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,450
No matter which day it was, we have to celebrate it.

899
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:05,830
A good meal is not afraid of being late.

900
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,910
Good girls don't slack off.

901
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,610
To celebrate your success,

902
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,290
let's go to the market tonight.

903
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,570
It's inappropriate

904
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,990
to leave the Gong Residence at this time.

905
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,780
Miss Yun wants to go too.

906
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,260
Really?

907
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,510
You want to go too?

908
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,290
Sure.

909
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,130
Let's go then.

910
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,250
But Miss Yun,

911
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,440
as a foreign bride,

912
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,390
the elders

913
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,240
wouldn't allow her to leave the palace, right?

914
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,110
If it will cause inconvenience

915
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,210
to the Sword Wielder,

916
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,470
I won't go.

917
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,590
I can celebrate the festival alone too.

918
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,170
Enjoy your celebration.

919
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,550
No need to ask the elders for things like this.

920
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,660
I know the secret passage to leave

921
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,300
the Gong Residence.

922
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:01,740
Miss Yun.

923
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:02,620
Let's go.

924
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,040
Let's get changed.

925
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,600
It'll be dark in the secret tunnel.

926
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:33,450
I will hold your hand.

927
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,120
We haven't reached the secret tunnel yet.

928
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,140
Why is he holding her in such a hurry?

929
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,920
I heard it's dark inside.

930
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,530
Hold me tight.

931
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,190
I'm scared too.

932
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,940
That's why you have to hold me tightly.

933
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,220
Then I'm more scared.

934
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,560
Should I report it?

935
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,510
He's the Sword Wielder.

936
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,280
Who are you going to report it to?

937
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,030
Young Master Shangjue is in-charge of things outside of the Gong Residence.

938
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,300
We'll report it to Young Master Shangjue.

939
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,660
Young Master Yuanzhi.

940
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,500
Young Master Yuanzhi.

941
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,490
What a beautiful lantern.

942
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,230
Young Master Shangjue was born in the year of dragon.

943
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:48,690
This must be for Young Master Shangjue.

944
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,770
My brother doesn't like useless things like this

945
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,150
But

946
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,730
I thought it'd be nice

947
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,760
to make the room brighter

948
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,650
on the Lantern Festival.

949
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,890
You made it yourself?

950
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:03,570
Where is my brother?

951
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,070
I'm here to eat with him.

952
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,180
Young Master Shangjue and Miss Shangguan Qian

953
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,310
are already having dinner.

954
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:09,500
The servants

955
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,980
started a fire at the the backyard's pavilion.

956
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,340
They should be there.

957
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,910
Would you like to have dinner with them together?

958
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,000
Let me go report this to Young Master Shangjue first.

959
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:21,870
No need.

960
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:23,590
Understood.

961
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,830
Young Master Shangjue normally eat alone.

962
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,580
Why did you

963
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,470
invite me to dinner today?

964
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,030
Today is the Lantern Festival.

965
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,700
We should

966
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:57,960
celebrate.

967
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,690
In the past,

968
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,270
you must've gone shopping and watched shows,

969
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,180
admire the stars and the moon,

970
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,240
and lanterns

971
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,780
with your relatives and friends.

972
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,360
Right?

973
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,300
I wasn't in good health when I was young.

974
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,680
I didn't go out often.

975
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,580
The Lantern Festival at the Gong Residence

976
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,320
is not as happening.

977
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,440
I thought you might not be used to it.

978
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:27,800
Just right,

979
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,900
I'm done with my work,

980
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,380
so I came to accompany you.

981
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,480
You must have suffered a lot

982
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,470
marrying into the Gong family.

983
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,230
Though one may suffer

984
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,110
marrying into the Gong family.

985
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,340
But marrying Young Master Shangjue

986
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,230
does not make me suffer at all.

987
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,880
Actually,

988
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,450
you don't like crowds, do you?

989
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:14,640
No I don't.

990
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:18,290
Then I don't like it either.

991
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,610
Can you change

992
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,020
what you like?

993
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,040
Of course.

994
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,920
People develop likings

995
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,530
after they are born.

996
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,600
But hatred can be born with.

997
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,940
Some people are born

998
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:41,990
with hatred.

999
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,380
Yes.

1000
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:47,620
In this world,

1001
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,900
there is no love for no reason,

1002
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,300
but there is hatred for no reason.

1003
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,390
The two people who may not have met before

1004
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,530
can be enemies.

1005
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,200
Gong family has many enemies.

1006
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,690
Your enemy

1007
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,920
is my enemy.

1008
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,210
You're good at talking.

1009
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:24,960
Am I wrong?

1010
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,080
You just said

1011
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:32,710
my enemy

1012
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,580
is your enemy

1013
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,550
instead of

1014
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:38,640
Gong family's enemy

1015
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,650
is your enemy.

1016
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,600
Is there any difference?

1017
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,430
No.

1018
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,180
The top row

1019
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:00,560
is the prescription for Yun Weishan.

1020
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,490
The next row

1021
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,420
is Shangguan Qian's prescription.

1022
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,640
It can't be just a simple medicine.

1023
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,700
There must be something wrong with it.

1024
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:23,850
Bulbophyllum Thouars

1025
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,370
Fern-leaf corydalis.

1026
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,130
Angelfish orchid.

1027
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,160
Naked Star Bug.

1028
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,130
Bulbophyllum Levinei.

1029
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,490
Young Master Shangjue,

1030
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,740
would you like to try some?

1031
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,160
I've been decocting

1032
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,360
this medicine all afternoon.

1033
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,300
On top of that,

1034
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,440
plus brown-core cape jasmine

1035
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,090
Chinese liquorice that has budded,

1036
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,270
and amber with caterpillar fungus.

1037
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:03,660
With just cinnabar and saltpeter,

1038
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:06,970
this will be lethal.

1039
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,650
This is lethal.

1040
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,110
Brother!
