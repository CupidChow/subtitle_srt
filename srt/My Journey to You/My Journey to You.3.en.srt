1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,750
Miss Yun Weishan.

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,750
Please turn your face around.

4
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,000
You said it's contagious.

5
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,000
Then why is Miss Yun Weishan

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,560
staying in your room

7
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,360
instead of her own room?

8
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,680
Why is she in my room?

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,440
Yeah.

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm asking you.

11
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
You need to ask?

12
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,160
What do you mean?

13
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,400
Don't you know that my family has practiced medicine for generations?

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Our Ziyun Detoxifying Cream

15
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
is always in short supply.

16
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,280
Miss Yun Weishan.

17
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
Please lift the quilt

18
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,280
and let me take a look.

19
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,560
How audacious you are!

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,520
You broke into my bedroom

21
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,070
and now want her to lift the quilt.

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
Do you know who we'll be in the future?

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Forgive me.

24
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,560
Are you done?

25
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,120
We didn't marry into the Gong family to be humiliated by you guys!

26
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,120
Just wait and see.

27
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,960
Your limbs will be cut off and your eyes will be gouged out.

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,360
Apologies for the disrespect.

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,600
Please have a good rest inside.

30
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,960
Don't go out

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,400
until further notice.

32
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
You're in the clear.

33
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,829
Elders, good evening.

34
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,600
In an attack from our enemy,

35
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,720
the Sword Wielder and Young Lord Huanyu both died.

36
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,040
According to the rules of the Gong family,

37
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,160
the Council of Elders decided

38
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
to start Absent Inheritance instantly.

39
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,240
The successor,

40
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,720
Gong Ziyu, the second son of the Yu Lineage,

41
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,150
is appointed the Sword Wielder,

42
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,720
effective immediately.

43
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
Drink it.

44
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,600
If you delay any longer,

45
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,480
it'll leave a scar on your face.

46
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,920
Dark is the sky. Yellow is the earth.

47
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,800
Lurking around are devils and demons.

48
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
Are you a Chi too?

49
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm a Mei.

50
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Ziyu.

51
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,920
Drink it.

52
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,560
Drunk Blood.

53
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
An anesthetic.

54
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,800
Wait.

55
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
Ziyu.

56
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,600
Maybe you don't know

57
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,040
what it means to get this tattoo,

58
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,000
and what you'll be faced with.

59
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,920
Listen carefully.

60
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,240
After the script is tattooed,

61
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,600
you'll be bound to Jiuchen Valley for life

62
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,560
and have to stay here until you die.

63
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,360
You'll live for the Gong family

64
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,720
and die for the Gong family.

65
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,880
Dad.

66
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,840
Let me scrub your back.

67
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,840
Okay.

68
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,480
Dad.

69
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Why are there words on your back?

70
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,600
That's the duty

71
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,880
I need to fulfill as the Sword Wielder of the Gong family.

72
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,960
Understand?

73
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Notify every post that we have

74
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,600
a new Sword Wielder now.

75
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,960
Let it be known far and wide.

76
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,080
Yes.

77
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,000
All the legitimate heirs of the Gong family

78
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,720
have been taking the Herb Elixir you made.

79
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,240
They should be immune to all poisons.

80
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,000
Why were my father and brother poisoned?

81
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,600
What has the Zhi Lineage done?

82
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,000
Ziyu.

83
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,600
Stop!

84
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,000
Yuanzhi.

85
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,720
You can't be rude to the Sword Wielder.

86
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,000
The Sword Wielder?

87
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,720
Him?

88
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,440
Yuanzhi!

89
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,080
Ridiculous.

90
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,320
Gong Ziyu doesn't deserve to be the Sword Wielder.

91
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,360
The next in line for that position

92
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,600
should be my brother,

93
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,480
Gong Shangjue!

94
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,080
The first Sword Wielder of the Gong family set two rules.

95
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,200
First,

96
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,480
the Gong family must always have a Sword Wielder.

97
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,440
Once the Sword Wielder dies,

98
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,360
his successor will take his place immediately.

99
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,320
Second,

100
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,440
if the Sword Wielder and his successor die together,

101
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,600
Absent Inheritance will be initiated.

102
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,080
Gong Shangjue is not in Jiuchen Valley.

103
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,000
According to the rules,

104
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Gong Ziyu is the only one who's qualified

105
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,000
to be the Sword Wielder.

106
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
But Gong Ziyu is…

107
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,600
Enough!

108
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,480
Any objections

109
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,080
shall be dealt with after Shangjue returns.

110
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,240
Dad.

111
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,480
Can you teach me how to write my name?

112
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,960
Sure.

113
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Give me your hand.

114
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,520
Keep going!

115
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,600
Brother.

116
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,720
Will you and Dad leave me too?

117
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,480
No.

118
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,840
I'll always be with you.

119
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,840
Young Master Ziyu.

120
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,240
Drunk as a skunk again.

121
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,120
Get in.

122
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,720
Go back

123
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
and reflect in your room.

124
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,480
If

125
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,120
you keep being a useless good-for-nothing,

126
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,960
you won't have to stay in the Gong family anymore.

127
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,120
It's not like I want to stay here!

128
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,480
You…

129
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,480
Ziyu, where are you going?

130
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,640
Don't stop him. Let him go!

131
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,120
He'd better get as far away as he can

132
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,240
and never come back!

133
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,000
The Sword Wielder of the Gong family was killed?

134
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,480
Are you sure?

135
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,600
Yes.

136
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
I've confirmed it.

137
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,720
Our assassins did it?

138
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
I'm not sure.

139
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,880
But

140
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
I don't think the assassins we sent out

141
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,720
are capable enough

142
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,480
to take him down in such a short time.

143
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,720
Besides,

144
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,760
the mission we gave them

145
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,760
is not to kill the Sword Wielder.

146
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
Maybe they got exposed

147
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,640
and had no choice but to kill him.

148
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
I got word

149
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,240
that Miss Zheng Nanyi's cover was blown.

150
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,600
Gong Shangjue is headed to the Zheng family of Hunyuan

151
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,840
to look into it.

152
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,360
Have you taken care of it?

153
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,640
Rest assured.

154
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,360
It's all done.

155
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,600
No trace

156
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,200
is left behind.

157
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,120
Good.

158
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,000
The remaining Chis and Meis

159
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
must've made it into the Gong family.

160
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,120
Let's look forward to their performance.

161
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,640
Young Master Shangjue.

162
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,360
The entire mansion is empty.

163
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,720
All the valuables are gone.

164
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,080
Did you stay here all night

165
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,480
or come early in the morning?

166
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
You're already the Sword Wielder.

167
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,760
There are a lot of things you need to do.

168
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,440
You can't fall apart.

169
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
I never wanted to be the Sword Wielder.

170
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,840
But…

171
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Now that I'm already the Sword Wielder,

172
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
I can do whatever I want.

173
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,640
No one can stop me.

174
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
What are you going to do?

175
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Who found

176
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,280
my father and brother's bodies?

177
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,520
Lady Wuji.

178
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:12,800
Let's go.

179
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,200
I need to meet her.

180
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,480
Your father asked me

181
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,000
to give this to you.

182
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,480
Last month, he got a fine red fox pelt

183
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,440
and made a robe for your brother.

184
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,080
Then he used the remnant

185
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,640
to make this for you.

186
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,320
He said you like these exquisite things.

187
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He was too shy to give it to you himself

188
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,640
so he asked me to do it.

189
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,400
Your father's bark was worse than his bite.

190
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Actually,

191
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,200
he regretted being so harsh to you

192
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,280
because of the female assassin

193
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
but was too embarrassed to apologize to you.

194
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,320
Don't blame him.

195
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,240
Lady Wuji.

196
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,240
Can you tell me

197
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,760
what happened that night?

198
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,880
That night,

199
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,520
I was in your father's study

200
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,960
brewing tea for him.

201
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Young Lord Huanyu

202
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,680
suddenly came in with a woman

203
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,720
whose hands were tied.

204
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,280
I got up and left.

205
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,480
I went to the kitchen

206
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,560
to make supper for them.

207
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
After it was finished,

208
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,280
I returned to the yard

209
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,320
and heard a fierce fight.

210
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Through the window,

211
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,480
I saw three people fighting.

212
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,520
After a few loud thuds,

213
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,520
the room went dark.

214
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,800
Then

215
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,320
it became quiet.

216
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Lady Wuji.

217
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,920
Why didn't you call the guards?

218
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,000
I did.

219
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,800
But at that time,

220
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,040
there was no guard on duty in the yard.

221
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,000
That was strange.

222
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,200
The guardians should always be around to protect the Sword Wielder.

223
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
Seeing the candles go out

224
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,720
and the room plunged into darkness,

225
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,520
I rushed over immediately

226
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,160
and opened the door of the study.

227
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,720
I found the Sword Wielder,

228
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,480
Huanyu,

229
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,000
and that woman lying dead on the floor.

230
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,000
I met that female assassin once.

231
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,000
She wasn't good enough at martial arts

232
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,040
to kill both my father and brother.

233
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,760
I don't believe it.

234
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,960
But she used poison.

235
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,160
Maybe she managed it

236
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,960
by catching them unawares.

237
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,000
Lady Wuji, we shall leave.

238
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,320
Let's go

239
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
meet those two guardians.

240
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,880
That night, the Sword Wielder met Young Master Shangjue first.

241
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,400
Then Young Lord Huanyu suddenly came

242
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,800
and asked to see the Sword Wielder.

243
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,760
After the three of them talked for a while,

244
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,800
Young Master Shangjue left in a hurry.

245
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,720
Young Master Shangjue left Jiuchen Valley in the night.

246
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
The wedding is coming soon.

247
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,280
Why is he leaving?

248
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,800
Who do you mean?

249
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,480
Young Master Shangjue.

250
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,400
Young Lord Huanyu went to the prison to interrogate the female assassin

251
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
and brought her to the Sword Wielder.

252
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,920
He ordered me and the Green Jade Guardian to leave.

253
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,800
Young Lord Huanyu said he needed to discuss something important with the Sword Wielder

254
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,480
and asked me and Jin Yu to leave.

255
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
Do you think they were lying?

256
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
Then let's meet someone who doesn't lie.

257
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,640
The dead don't lie.

258
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,480
Be careful.

259
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,320
The hairpin may be poisonous.

260
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,920
Something was wrong

261
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,720
with the Herb Elixir your father and brother took.

262
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,760
The Herb Elixir you take may not be safe either.

263
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,160
The gem on the hairpin is hollow.

264
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,080
The poison

265
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,240
was hidden in the gem.

266
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,680
The fingers of Father's right hand are purple.

267
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,000
It's obviously caused by poison.

268
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,000
But

269
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,520
how did my father and brother

270
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,000
come into contact with the poison?

271
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,320
Maybe something was hidden in the secret groove of the hairpin

272
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,720
and taken out by them.

273
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,920
Perhaps, during that process,

274
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
they were exposed to the deadly poison.

275
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,000
Secret groove?

276
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,320
Did you find anything in it?

277
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,000
It was empty when I found it.

278
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,040
Maybe

279
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,000
Young Master Shangjue took away whatever was inside.

280
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,320
There is a burn on the female assassin's skin

281
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,800
which was left by poison.

282
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,000
But it didn't cause her death.

283
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,880
The cut that pierced through her chest

284
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,200
killed her.

285
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,040
How did she get on the bride list?

286
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,040
She was the second daughter of the Zheng family of Hunyuan,

287
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Zheng Nanyi.

288
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,000
But we don't know if that identity

289
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,760
is true.

290
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,280
After the accident happened,

291
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,920
did you check the Ladies' Hostel?

292
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
I sent guards over in time.

293
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,960
All of them were in the house.

294
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,080
None of them had gone out.

295
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,480
But

296
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,000
two brides were poisoned.

297
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,320
Who are they?

298
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,200
They're the two brides

299
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,080
who got the golden tokens.

300
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,480
Jiang Lili and Yun Weishan.

301
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,320
Let's go.

302
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,280
What brought you here at this early hour?

303
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
You think too much.

304
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,520
How can I help?

305
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,960
Since we're the same,

306
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,440
I think

307
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,480
I should be clear with you.

308
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,880
Wait. We're not the same.

309
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,920
I told you yesterday.

310
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm a Mei. I'm superior to you.

311
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,880
In Wufeng, you must listen to your superiors.

312
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,560
You must know that.

313
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,680
I do.

314
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,320
I just didn't expect them

315
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,000
to plant a Mei

316
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,920
in the Gong family too.

317
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,080
Everything comes with a price.

318
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,960
With prices come sacrifices.

319
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,320
If Miss Zheng hadn't been exposed,

320
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,440
you would've been the one

321
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,240
who was sacrificed.

322
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Was she a Mei too?

323
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,760
She was too stupid

324
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,480
to be a Mei.

325
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,480
So in the future,

326
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,880
the two of us

327
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
will carry out the mission together?

328
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,560
Is there anyone else with us?

329
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,280
Crows gather together.

330
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,240
The eagle flies high alone.

331
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,720
There is

332
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,040
no "us".

333
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,680
And we won't do anything together.

334
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,280
I see.

335
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,240
Wait.

336
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,800
You went out by stealth last night.

337
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,760
What did you find?

338
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,920
I saved you.

339
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
The least you can do is tell me

340
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,640
who's dead.

341
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,720
How did you know someone died?

342
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,080
There are so many white lanterns in the air.

343
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,400
And the servants have been bustling around with candles and funeral items.

344
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,040
I'm not blind.

345
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,560
I can guess.

346
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,040
The Sword Wielder and Young Lord Huanyu

347
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,000
both died.

348
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,320
You killed them?

349
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,000
Physician,

350
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,320
what's the poison that's making her sick?

351
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,680
It's complicated.

352
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,160
There seems to be more than one kind of poison.

353
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,640
Physician,

354
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,560
is the rash on her face

355
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,160
caused by poison too?

356
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes.

357
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,560
It's a kind of strong poison

358
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,040
that takes effect very fast.

359
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,280
Miss Jiang is unconscious

360
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,000
and keeps slurring.

361
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
She might have been affected

362
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,720
by a poison that targets her mind.

363
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,160
Is her life in danger?

364
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
I'm not sure of that.

365
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,640
The rash on her face will heal

366
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,480
after she takes some detoxifying decoction.

367
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,920
But as to the poison

368
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,000
that makes her delirious,

369
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,320
I haven't figured out

370
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,760
how to neutralize it yet.

371
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,560
I have to consult Young Master Yuanzhi later.

372
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,720
Physician, the decoction is ready.

373
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,920
Send it over.

374
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,880
Yes.

375
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,760
Physician.

376
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,640
That decoction…

377
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,480
Well,

378
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,800
it's for Miss Yun Weishan,

379
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,240
the girl who also got a golden token.

380
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,560
She has the same rash on her face too.

381
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I didn't kill them.

382
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,680
My mission is not to kill the Sword Wielder.

383
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,440
Then what's your mission?

384
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,960
I don't think

385
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,720
we can talk about that.

386
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,960
We can't.

387
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,040
But I just want to help.

388
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,960
If you act recklessly again

389
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,800
like you did yesterday,

390
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,880
I'll have to

391
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,720
clean up the mess for you.

392
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,080
If I know what your mission is,

393
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,880
I may be able to cover for you.

394
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,720
After all,

395
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,800
if you're exposed,

396
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,400
Miss Zheng Nanyi

397
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,200
would've died for nothing.

398
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,760
Weishan,

399
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,760
I mean no harm.

400
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,400
Don't overthink it.

401
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,640
Do you mind me calling you

402
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,760
Weishan?

403
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,160
You don't feel sorry for Miss Zheng at all.

404
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,960
You're just worried that if I'm exposed,

405
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,880
you can't stay hidden anymore.

406
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,040
The Gong family will realize

407
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,040
that there may be other assassins

408
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,040
besides me.

409
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,040
Am I right?

410
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,760
Look.

411
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,200
There is

412
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,400
an "us".

413
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,560
So,

414
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,480
we'd better work together.

415
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,720
I told you.

416
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,560
Our missions are different.

417
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,640
You poisoned Miss Jiang's tea.

418
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,920
You want to replace her.

419
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Our missions should be the same.

420
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,800
Didn't Miss Jiang get the rash on her face

421
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,000
from your nail polish?

422
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
You saw it?

423
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,560
I don't need to.

424
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,720
Isn't that the basic training in Wufeng?

425
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,240
I could've made Miss Jiang a lunatic

426
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,000
without arousing any suspicion.

427
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,560
But you suddenly showed up.

428
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,200
If I'm right,

429
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,640
before long,

430
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,800
I'll have to clean up your mess again.

431
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,320
Physician,

432
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,920
is the poison the two girls suffer from

433
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,400
related to the poison

434
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,640
that killed the Sword Wielder?

435
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
No.

436
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,480
Thank you, Physician.

437
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,440
Since the poison making Miss Jiang sick

438
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,960
is not the one that killed your father and brother,

439
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,000
shall we still go to the Ladies' Hostel?

440
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
You're already the Sword Wielder

441
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,320
and haven't chosen your bride yet.

442
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,640
It's inappropriate

443
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,200
for you to go there.

444
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,680
A clean hand wants no washing.

445
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
My hands are very clean.

446
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
There's nothing to be afraid of.

447
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,080
You always…

448
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,080
The tea I gave Miss Jiang

449
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,920
was not poisoned.

450
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Then it was the incense.

451
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,880
The incense was not poisonous either.

452
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,560
But inhaling the incense after drinking the tea

453
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,400
changed things.

454
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,800
At first, she'd just be delirious.

455
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,240
A few days later, she'd start to mumble to herself

456
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,080
as if she had dementia.

457
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
As an assassin of Wufeng,

458
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,200
you shouldn't

459
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,920
have that look on your face.

460
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,240
You're so soft-hearted.

461
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,080
It'll cost you your life sooner or later.

462
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,040
I don't hurt innocent people.

463
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,280
You're so interesting, Weishan.

464
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,040
Back to my incense and tea.

465
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,160
Both of them are harmless when examined separately.

466
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,320
Even if they get suspicious,

467
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,240
they can't find anything.

468
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,520
I kindly reminded you

469
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,560
that tea

470
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,680
had been tampered with

471
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,480
and you should not drink it,

472
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,880
but you tried to be clever and ruined everything.

473
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,480
Thanks to you,

474
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,800
both the rash on Miss Jiang's face

475
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,720
and your nail polish

476
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,800
have become solid evidence.

477
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,480
If I were you,

478
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,000
I'd wash it off now.

479
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,720
Young Master Yuanzhi, you came to the clinic too.

480
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,560
What are you here for?

481
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,680
Sword Wielder.

482
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,240
Young Master Yuanzhi.

483
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,800
According to the rules,

484
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,320
you should greet

485
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,760
the Sword Wielder.

486
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Who are you?

487
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,600
How dare you tell me what to do?

488
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,360
Jin Fan.

489
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,150
He must have a good reason for not greeting me.

490
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,080
Although I don't understand,

491
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,630
I won't force him.

492
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,760
The Council of Elders will deal with him.

493
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,440
Sword Wielder.

494
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,800
No need for formalities.

495
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,040
You specialize in making poisons and antidotes

496
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,400
and performed autopsies on my father and brother.

497
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,480
Did you find anything?

498
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,480
They were killed by Ascension,

499
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,800
a poison invented by the Gong family.

500
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,760
That poison takes effect very quickly. Without timely detox,

501
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
death is certain.

502
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,520
So you mean

503
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,440
it can be neutralized.

504
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,920
Yes.

505
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,280
But very hard.

506
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,400
Is it?

507
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,560
Since it was invented,

508
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,840
no one taking it has ever been brought back to life.

509
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,800
Ascension is deadly and spreads all over

510
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
the victim's body via bloodstream.

511
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,880
The window for detox is very short.

512
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,960
How short?

513
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,000
Within 200 heartbeats.

514
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,000
Is it difficult

515
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,000
to obtain such a lethal poison?

516
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,000
Seems that you're

517
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,200
not very familiar with the Gong family's business.

518
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,360
Ascension

519
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,640
is sold at every post of the Gong family

520
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,760
in and out of Jiuchen Valley.

521
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,480
Anyone can buy it.

522
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,680
So you mean

523
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,000
the poison called Ascension

524
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,480
is hard to cure but easy to get.

525
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,000
Young Master Yuanzhi.

526
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,040
Are there precautions

527
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,320
one can take?

528
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,480
I don't understand what you mean.

529
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,000
Let me put it another way.

530
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Will someone who takes the Herb Elixir every day

531
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,680
be affected by it?

532
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,840
No.

533
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,800
My father and brother

534
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,360
took the Herb Elixir every day

535
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,520
but were poisoned.

536
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,880
Does that mean I can hold

537
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,000
those who make the Herb Elixir accountable?

538
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,560
Everyone in the Gong family, from elders to madams,

539
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,080
has been taking the Herb Elixir and other tonics

540
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
made by the Zhi Lineage for many years.

541
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,400
Nothing had ever gone wrong.

542
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,280
You asked me why I came to the clinic.

543
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,800
I came to check

544
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,160
if there is any problem

545
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,280
with the Herb Elixir here.

546
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,280
Is there?

547
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,600
No.

548
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,160
We're right back where we started.

549
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,880
Why on earth

550
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,040
were my father and brother poisoned?

551
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,560
I'm in charge of making the Herb Elixir,

552
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,280
but after sending it to different lineages,

553
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,600
it's served by the servants of your own.

554
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,560
Why don't you

555
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,840
look into the servants of the Yu Lineage?

556
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,520
Maybe you'll be surprised.

557
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,280
Of course I'll look into

558
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
the servants of the Yu Lineage.

559
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,400
You should do that.

560
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,560
Besides,

561
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,000
you were just appointed the Sword Wielder

562
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,760
and made ungrounded accusations against the Zhi Lineage.

563
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,000
How impressive.

564
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,760
I'll find the evidence.

565
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,280
Wait and see.

566
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,000
The Sword Wielder and Young Lord Huanyu

567
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,480
both died,

568
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,640
so

569
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,000
Absent Inheritance must have been initiated.

570
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,520
Absent Inheritance?

571
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,160
Didn't your Raven

572
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,480
tell you about that?

573
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,440
I'm just a Chi.

574
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't overestimate me.

575
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,120
Your sudden humbleness

576
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,320
took me by surprise.

577
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,880
Absent Inheritance

578
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,120
is a rule of the Gong family

579
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,800
set to tide it through crises.

580
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,200
Basically,

581
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,040
it makes sure that the Gong family and Jiuchen Valley

582
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,480
always have a leader.

583
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,480
If the Sword Wielder and the Young Lord both die,

584
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,520
the next in line of succession

585
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,480
in Jiuchen Valley

586
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,960
will become the new Sword Wielder unconditionally.

587
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,840
So

588
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,160
the Sword Wielder now

589
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,320
should be Young Master Shangjue,

590
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,800
Gong Shangjue.

591
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,120
The current Sword Wielder

592
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,400
is the younger brother of Young Lord Huanyu,

593
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,360
Gong Ziyu.

594
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,840
Gong Shangjue left the Valley last night.

595
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,120
He's not here.

596
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,080
So according to the line of succession,

597
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,400
Gong Ziyu took the position of the Sword Wielder.

598
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,320
Sure enough.

599
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,840
That's what Absent Inheritance means.

600
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,800
The Gong family is a bunch of stubborn fools.

601
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,440
Pedantic and absurd.

602
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
Now that

603
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,120
Gong Ziyu has become the new Sword Wielder,

604
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,600
he'll choose a new bride.

605
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
It seems

606
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,000
that he's your new target now.

607
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,280
After losing Gong Huanyu,

608
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,920
you can't lose Gong Ziyu too.

609
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,760
I wish you good luck.

610
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,520
What about you?

611
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,000
Don't you need good luck?

612
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,960
Miss Jiang won't recover any time soon.

613
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,880
Don't you need

614
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,800
to get a golden token?

615
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,920
Why do I need that?

616
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,000
With a golden token,

617
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,920
whether Gong Ziyu chooses you or me,

618
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,520
our missions will be easier.

619
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,480
I don't need Gong Ziyu to choose me.

620
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,760
Besides,

621
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
do you think I didn't get a golden token

622
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,800
because I couldn't?

623
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,640
Girls, you all need to take a bath tonight.

624
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,160
Get up early tomorrow.

625
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,080
Don't put on any makeup.

626
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,560
Don't wear perfume.

627
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,800
Be your true selves

628
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,480
and wait to be summoned.

629
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,040
Physician.

630
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,680
Unpleasant body smell.

631
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,000
Low body temperature.

632
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Heavy dampness.

633
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,120
You gave up the golden token yourself?

634
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
What else could it be?

635
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,800
Your target is not the Sword Wielder.

636
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,280
My target

637
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,040
is much trickier than the Sword Wielder.

638
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,400
The Zheng family of Hunyuan

639
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,600
has moved away.

640
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,760
Someone must've tipped them off.

641
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,880
Besides,

642
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,200
the matter Young Lord Huanyu asked me to investigate

643
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,160
has not been leaked yet.

644
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,840
Send it back

645
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,960
to the Gong Residence as soon as possible.

646
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,760
Yes.

647
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:54,920
Hurry.

648
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,320
Urgent message from the Gong Residence.

649
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,800
Young Master Shangjue.

650
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,280
Read it.

651
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,080
Read it.

652
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,840
Yes.

653
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,440
Destiny can't be refused.

654
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,440
The lineages need a head.

655
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,800
The Council appointed

656
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,200
Gong...

657
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,480
Gong Ziyu

658
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
as the new Sword Wielder.

659
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,360
When Gong Huanyu was made the heir,

660
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,760
I thought

661
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,280
it was so unfair

662
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,680
and still think so now.

663
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,880
In my mind,

664
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,480
you're the one

665
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,480
who should be the Sword Wielder.

666
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,840
Instead of what happened to the Gong family

667
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,000
and how the late Sword Wielder

668
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,680
died,

669
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,000
you're concerned about

670
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,040
who is the new Sword Wielder.

671
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,000
In the future,

672
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,600
don't say anything like that again.

673
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,600
Sorry.

674
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,280
My horse has run for days

675
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,880
and is exhausted.

676
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,880
Find me the fastest horse here.

677
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,800
Yes.

678
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,520
You can see through people.

679
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,040
You're even more capable than I thought.

680
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,440
You flatter me.

681
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,520
I'm a Mei after all.

682
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,840
Well,

683
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,200
you're much smarter than I thought too.

684
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,000
I thought you were stupid to carry out an assassination

685
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,000
on the first night you arrived

686
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,000
at the Gong Residence.

687
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,480
But now that I think about it,

688
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,640
you didn't act on a whim.

689
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,480
When Gong Ziyu

690
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,360
brought us out of the prison,

691
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,360
you memorized the night patrol routes

692
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,880
of the guards in the Gong Residence.

693
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,840
The night before the wedding,

694
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,920
all the ladies went to bed early.

695
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,440
No one would disturb them.

696
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,160
It was the perfect time for an assassination.

697
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,400
If the Sword Wielder hadn't been killed,

698
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,880
you wouldn't have been discovered.

699
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,760
Besides,

700
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,280
you deliberately ran away from other brides that night

701
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,080
to attract the attention of Gong Ziyu, right?

702
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,640
When he came to the prison for the first time,

703
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,560
all he could see was me.

704
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,680
You pretended to escape

705
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,360
to let him chase after you.

706
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,440
Then,

707
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,800
you deliberately took his precious mask

708
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,360
to make him come to you again.

709
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,120
You're amazing.

710
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,600
I'm not as calculating as you think.

711
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,120
You think too highly of me, Miss Shangguan.

712
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,520
I just don't want

713
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,960
to meet my Raven empty-handed

714
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,000
half a month later.

715
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,000
No one wants that.

716
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,400
No one dares.

717
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,920
Drink this

718
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,280
and you'll be a Chi.

719
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,280
Don't chew.

720
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,360
Swallow them.

721
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,360
What are they?

722
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,120
Eggs.

723
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,440
Eggs of Bone-Gnawing Flies.

724
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,000
They're also called Fortnight Flies.

725
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,680
The poison made of them

726
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,280
is called Death Oath.

727
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,320
It means to be loyal to Wufeng until death.

728
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,280
It's solely used on assassins of Wufeng.

729
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,920
After drinking it,

730
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,440
Bone-Gnawing Flies will live in your body.

731
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,840
Usually, you won't feel them.

732
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,000
But you need to take the antidote

733
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,480
every half a month.

734
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,520
I don't know when I can come back

735
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,560
after entering the Gong Residence.

736
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,840
Shouldn't you give me more antidote

737
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,440
to Death Oath?

738
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,160
Every half a month,

739
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,000
someone from Wufeng will meet you

740
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,200
in the town in Jiuchen Valley.

741
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,840
If you have something to offer,

742
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,400
you'll be given the antidote.

743
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,160
No need to finish your words.

744
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,800
I can definitely get the antidote.

745
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,000
Don't worry.

746
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,200
Besides,

747
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,280
from a Chi to a Mei,

748
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,880
I suffered more than one can imagine.

749
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,360
I'm not afraid

750
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,600
of those flies and bugs.

751
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,280
No matter how painful the torture is,

752
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,880
I can bear it.

753
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,880
You can't.

754
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,360
Trust me.

755
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,880
You can't bear it.

756
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,480
So,

757
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,480
you must

758
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,600
get important information

759
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,480
before Fortnight Flies attack you.

760
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,320
You can also

761
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,040
do something that Wufeng deems satisfactory.

762
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,440
Yun Weishan.

763
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,000
Where are you going?

764
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,880
I'm going to send out the information

765
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,880
I gathered.

766
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,400
How?

767
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,960
I'll float lanterns down the river.

768
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,920
Wait.

769
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,400
River lanterns?

770
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,200
In the broad daylight?

771
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,200
Jin Fan.

772
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,400
Get the lanterns out and search upstream.

773
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,400
If you can't find anyone, come downstream to meet me.

774
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,520
Downstream?

775
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,480
Why are you going downstream?

776
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,080
Miss.

777
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,600
Miss.

778
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,280
Miss Yun Weishan.

779
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,480
Miss Yun Weishan.

780
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,320
Yuan Weishan.

781
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,000
It's really you.

782
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,840
Instead of staying in your room,

783
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,840
you're headed to the gate.

784
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,640
What are you going to do?

785
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,920
I want to leave.

786
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,160
You tried to escape

787
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,400
when I first brought you out of the prison.

788
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,360
I thought you ran away

789
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,480
just because you were scared.

790
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,800
Now the assassin has been found.

791
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,920
The dust has settled.

792
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,000
But you still want to leave.

793
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,360
Why?

794
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,440
I never wanted to marry into the Gong family.

795
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,800
Mother forced me to come here.

796
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,080
Don't let her go.

797
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,320
Sword Wielder.

798
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,400
There are words written on the lantern.

799
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,680
Yun Weishan.

800
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,000
You wrote so many words on the lantern

801
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,400
and floated it down the river.

802
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,040
Did you plan

803
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,080
to send messages out?

804
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,080
I'll float lanterns down the river.

805
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,760
Do you take the Gong family for fools?

806
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,160
How to make sure the lanterns end in the right hands?

807
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,000
If they're picked up halfway,

808
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,160
the information on them will be seen.

809
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,640
Yes.

810
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,200
That's my plan.

811
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,160
You didn't drink my tea.

812
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,640
Why are you out of your mind

813
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,440
like Miss Jiang?

814
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,360
I mean,

815
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,880
I'll expose myself.

816
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,480
You were taught to do that too.

817
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,400
I see.

818
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,440
When we're faced with a crisis that may expose us,

819
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,600
we leak insignificant information as a distraction

820
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,760
to hide our true goals and identities.

821
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,880
Yes.

822
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,200
The Gong family is smart,

823
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,600
but everyone will fall for that trick.

824
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,200
Just like Miss Zheng exposed herself willingly.

825
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,600
Once the Gong family believes

826
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,360
that the assassin has been found,

827
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,280
the true assassins,

828
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,600
you and I,

829
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,120
will be safe.

830
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,040
Maybe Miss Zheng

831
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,120
didn't expose herself willingly.

832
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,520
For Wufeng,

833
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,680
her death

834
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,160
is just part of their plan.

835
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,200
The death of every one of us

836
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,680
is just a willing sacrifice they want.

837
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,840
What if Zheng Nanyi was so selfless

838
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,360
and sacrificed herself willingly?

839
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,480
The mountain is steep.

840
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,840
The river runs fast.

841
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,640
Come back as soon as you're done.

842
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,800
No.

843
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,960
I'll go downstream.

844
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,400
I see.

845
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,080
Your target has always been the Sword Wielder

846
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,920
instead of Gong Huanyu.

847
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,360
Now,

848
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,680
the Sword Wielder of the Gong family

849
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,160
has become Gong Ziyu.

850
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,920
Gong Ziyu seems to be a toff,

851
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,880
but judging from what I observed,

852
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,040
he's smarter than he appears.

853
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,960
He'll follow the clue of Miss Jiang's poisoning

854
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,360
to look into the other girls,

855
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,640
especially me who was poisoned too.

856
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,640
To come here,

857
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,320
he'll have to walk up along the river.

858
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,800
I want him to think that our meeting

859
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,120
is by accident.

860
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,920
You want him to think that he's destined

861
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,640
to meet you, right?

862
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,480
You're so smart.

863
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,560
Why are you just a Chi?

864
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,840
But all the information I have

865
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,800
is about his brother's personality and preferences.

866
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,880
This is the information

867
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,960
we collected on Gong Huanyu.

868
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,880
That's all?

869
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,080
That's all.

870
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,400
We tried our best.

871
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,560
Irrelevant information is not included

872
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,760
in it.

873
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,200
For example, Gong Huanyu has a younger brother named Gong Ziyu.

874
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,320
Gong Ziyu?

875
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,760
Do you have his information?

876
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,480
What kind of person is he?

877
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,880
He's not important.

878
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,480
You should focus on Gong Huanyu.

879
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,000
Gong Huanyu is the Young Lord of the Gong family,

880
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,800
which means he's the future Sword Wielder.

881
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,480
Only from him

882
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,440
can you get what you need.

883
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,320
I know very little

884
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,200
about Gong Ziyu.

885
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,360
Gong Ziyu lost his mother at an early age.

886
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,800
That's why he became

887
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,040
a grumpy playboy.

888
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,080
After he grew up, he spent all his time drinking and fooling around.

889
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,480
He can't amount to much.

890
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,200
Gong Ziyu and his father were not close.

891
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,680
Seems that he's never

892
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,480
gotten his father's approval.

893
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,000
His father gave almost all his love

894
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,000
to Gong Huanyu

895
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,160
who was cleverer and better at martial arts.

896
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,080
Father.

897
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,120
I'm cold.

898
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,800
You're so delicate.

899
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,480
You don't deserve to be my son.

900
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,200
Look at your brother.

901
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,760
See how he practices martial arts.

902
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,160
That's why Gong Ziyu gave up on himself.

903
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,560
However,

904
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,960
Gong Huanyu doted on him.

905
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,800
I know what to write on the river lanterns.

906
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,040
Is this river lantern yours?

907
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,480
Yes.

908
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,160
Miss Yun, you're so smart.

909
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,560
You know that if someone discovers the lantern,

910
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,520
they'll go upstream

911
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,480
to find the person who floated it.

912
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,480
So you went downstream on purpose

913
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,000
and took a detour to go back.

914
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,400
But do you know how many guards

915
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,160
there are along the river?

916
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,040
You may…

917
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,640
You get me wrong.

918
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,560
I just want to leave.

919
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,320
Young Master Ziyu.

920
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,560
I beg you.

921
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,600
Please let me go.

922
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,880
There have been rumors

923
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,360
in the Gong Residence

924
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,320
that Gong Ziyu is not a Gong.

925
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,520
His mother, Lady Lan,

926
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,520
had someone she loved

927
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,520
before marrying into the Gong family.

928
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,880
She missed him day and night

929
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,040
and kept trying to escape.

930
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,280
In the end, she died from depression.

931
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,520
Father,

932
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,440
I've got married.

933
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,600
They gave me a lot of betrothal gifts.

934
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,840
I think

935
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,120
Mother doesn't have to work so hard

936
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,000
to support our family anymore.

937
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,360
Father,

938
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,600
I know you've been feeling bad

939
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,520
about not having a son to ennoble our family.

940
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,960
You always said

941
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,840
that I must marry a good man

942
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,360
to show everyone in the town

943
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,320
that the Yun family's daughter is blessed.

944
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,480
But Father,

945
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,000
I wasn't chosen by the Sword Wielder.

946
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,400
Sorry to disappoint you.

947
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,200
Is this really for your father?

948
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,800
Let her go.

949
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,480
No matter what your mission is,

950
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,560
if you want to leave this courtyard,

951
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,040
you must carefully avoid the guards' patrol route.

952
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,160
I can draw it for you.

953
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,760
Don't take the road on the east side.

954
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,960
Yun Weishan.

955
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,000
God help you if you lied to me.
