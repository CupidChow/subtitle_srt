[Episode 15]

4
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,300
Swallow it.

5
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,280
Elder Yue, what are you doing?

6
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,620
What did you feed her?

7
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,960
Poison.

8
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,170
What?

9
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,440
The second trial of the Three Realms

10
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,240
that you have to pass

11
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,140
is to detoxify her of this poison.

12
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,290
Your hand is so cold.

13
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,520
Let's go.

14
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,290
This poison is called the Heart Devouring Moon.

15
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,740
The trial taker of the second trial of the Three Realms

16
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,900
has to make the antidote

17
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,980
before the poison takes effect.

18
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,100
Otherwise,

19
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,260
the poisoned person will be tortured to death.

20
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,579
How long will it take to take effect?

21
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,550
It might be three days,

22
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,480
or a month.

23
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,579
Let's see if you can find out

24
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,920
what kind of poison this is.

25
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,230
These are all the books about poison and medicine

26
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,600
in the Yue Residence.

27
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,370
You can look at them at any time.

28
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,740
Young Master Ziyu, you're gifted.

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,260
I believe you can

30
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,940
discover the secret of the Heart Devouring Moon.

31
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,840
What's wrong, Miss Yun?

32
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,460
I'm fine.

33
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,660
At the bottom of the bookshelf,

34
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,980
there are books specific to internal injuries.

35
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,579
In the middle,

36
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,840
there are books about external injuries.

37
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,430
Those at the top level are about poisons and the ways of making antidotes.

38
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,290
There are so many books

39
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,220
about poisons.

40
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,970
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

41
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,650
Elder Yue.

42
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,250
Do you have any suggestions?

43
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,320
On account of our friendship,

44
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,320
I've pointed out to you how the books are categorized here.

45
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,040
It has already saved you a lot of time.

46
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,360
If you continue talking,

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,160
you will be suspected of cheating.

48
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,130
Elder Yue.

49
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,890
Tell me then,

50
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,520
if this Heart Devouring Moon

51
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,460
is a cold or hot poison.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,580
I might as well give you the antidote.

53
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,820
Since it's a trial,

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,240
it means this mission

55
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,060
can be completed.

56
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,520
However,

57
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,710
there are so many books here.

58
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,750
It's impossible to read all of them

59
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,990
in a short time.

60
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,260
So,

61
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,560
it's impossible

62
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,600
for it to be a short-term potent poison.

63
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,190
They should at least allow the trial takers

64
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,680
to have enough time

65
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,010
to research and make the antidote.

66
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,780
So,

67
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,980
it must be a slow-acting poison.

68
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,540
Slow-acting poison?

69
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,220
Slow-acting poison...

70
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,200
Here.

71
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,300
Am I right,

72
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,900
Elder Yue?

73
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:18,990
Yun.

74
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,230
You may leave.

75
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,220
Shangguan Qian.

76
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,370
[The murderer is Anonymous.] [The mastermind is Wufeng.]

77
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,070
[Anonymous]

78
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,010
You really are Anonymous.

79
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,620
You knew Gong Shangjue was suspicious of you

80
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,920
and you were afraid that he would close in on you,

81
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,240
so you hurt yourself

82
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,060
to enact a sympathy ploy to rid yourself of the suspicions.

83
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,170
You're smart.

84
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,140
Smart?

85
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,130
I think it's stupid.

86
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,640
Are all Wufeng juniors

87
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,280
so arrogant now?

88
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,760
You came at the right time.

89
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,610
I'm missing a scapegoat.

90
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,000
It's too risky.

91
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,720
If both of us are exposed,

92
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,780
both of us will suffer great losses.

93
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,780
If both of us are exposed,

94
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,380
do you think they'll believe me,

95
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,690
an obedient wife for over a decade,

96
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,580
or believe you,

97
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,720
a suspicious bride who just entered the Gong residence?

98
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,930
They can't do anything to me without evidence.

99
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,790
Instead, you should think carefully about

100
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,090
how you can protect yourself

101
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,440
after being suspected.

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,220
Do you think

103
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,410
I don't have an escape plan?

104
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,180
But

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,910
I've learned a lesson

106
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,160
about how a Wufeng senior operates indeed.

107
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,150
Sacrificing your fellow apprentices to protect yourself.

108
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,150
You're really cruel.

109
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,750
You can only blame Wufeng's juniors.

110
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,060
They're getting increasingly useless

111
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,000
as the generations pass.

112
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,460
The Fortnight Flies

113
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,520
would make your whole body feel like it's being burned in a raging fire

114
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,530
and you'll be in indescribable agony.

115
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,880
If you don't get rid of it soon,

116
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,290
the poison will attack the heart.

117
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,900
Once it invades the heart...

118
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,180
there'll be no cure.

119
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,280
You're awake?

120
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,790
Why didn't you wake me up?

121
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,690
The Yue residence is very humid

122
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,680
and gets cold at night.

123
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,430
Be careful.

124
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,940
Don't catch a cold.

125
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,850
You even have to take care of me now.

126
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,890
How are you feeling?

127
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,760
Do you feel worse?

128
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,910
Not really.

129
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,650
But I realized that this poison

130
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,590
will disrupt one's internal skill.

131
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,450
If I use my power,

132
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,830
it'll accelerate the poisonous gas's invasion to the heart.

133
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,770
Then try not to use your power.

134
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,270
If there's anything, tell me

135
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,590
and I'll do it.

136
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,730
By the way,

137
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,060
what are the most obvious symptoms

138
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,270
that you feel in your body?

139
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,640
Is it a burning heat

140
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,320
or a piercing cold?

141
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,780
I feel cold.

142
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,180
It's most obvious in my four limbs.

143
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,460
It's like

144
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,010
a numbing and piercing pain you get

145
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,100
when standing on ice barefooted.

146
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,590
I hope I'm not interrupting you two.

147
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,090
Cover yourself with this.

148
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,020
Have you

149
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,190
read all these?

150
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,220
I've sort of finished my rough reading.

151
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,600
Did you find anything?

152
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,980
I've figured out

153
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,330
the characteristics of the Heart Devouring Moon.

154
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,800
In this book,

155
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,400
there's a record of a poison.

156
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,560
Its symptoms

157
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,380
begin and end according to the lunar phase chronology.

158
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,580
The cycle changes

159
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,580
every half a month,

160
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,660
and the gains and losses increase by layers.

161
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:06,840
Besides,

162
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,490
this kind of poison is very interesting.

163
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,180
According to the poisoned person's

164
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,810
physical condition and internal skill,

165
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,670
the poison will evolve into two very different states,

166
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,280
which is a burning heat poison

167
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,680
or

168
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,020
an icy cold poison.

169
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,220
Therefore,

170
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,840
the way to expel it will be different too.

171
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,940
In order to increase the difficulty of the trial,

172
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,930
you altered the name of the poison

173
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,300
and gave it

174
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,450
a threatening new name,

175
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,030
the Heart Devouring Moon.

176
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,820
But the real name of this poison

177
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,330
is Fortnight Flies.

178
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Fortnight Flies?

179
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,890
That's right.

180
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
So the time limit for the creation of our antidote

181
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:49,810
is half a month.

182
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,840
Not bad.

183
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,130
It only took you one day to figure out what poison it is.

184
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,060
Until now, you're the one

185
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,850
who figured it out in the shortest amount of time.

186
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,140
Elder Yue, thank you for reminding me.

187
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,060
I'm not reminding you.

188
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,440
Don't talk nonsense.

189
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,580
For Fortnight Flies to be effective,

190
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,790
it needs to be made into pills

191
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,450
and consumed directly.

192
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,110
The ingredients include Qishe flowers,

193
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,040
carrion beetle brains,

194
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,280
Bombyx silkworms,

195
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,010
and a key ingredient.

196
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,240
It just so happens

197
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,350
that the page with the key ingredient was torn out.

198
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:24,810
What did you expect?

199
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,970
If I let you see them all,

200
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,450
what's the point of the test?

201
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,530
The types of medicinal herbs are innumerable.

202
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,420
By tearing this page out,

203
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,860
wouldn't there be no cure for the Heart Devouring Moon?

204
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,560
Finding a solution for the incurable poison

205
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,370
is the challenge.

206
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,400
Then I have to ask you

207
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,980
for something.

208
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,920
I want to ask you

209
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,580
for two pills of Heart Devouring Moon

210
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,080
so that I can study them

211
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,220
to figure out the missing ingredient.

212
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,620
It's not against the rules, right?

213
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,550
Of course not.

214
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,490
Sealing wax?

215
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,370
In these books,

216
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,890
the medicinal properties of many medicinal herbs are mentioned.

217
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,860
Have you tried them all?

218
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,950
For example,

219
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:27,940
Wujiang.

220
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,470
Wujiang

221
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,890
is mild and tastes bitter.

222
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,460
It's an effective cure for coughing up blood.

223
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,230
What about Jiemao?

224
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,170
Jiemao

225
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,420
is heaty and tastes spicy.

226
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,910
It mainly cures heart and abdominal pains.

227
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,050
What's wrong?

228
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:48,930
Nothing.

229
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,880
You really have a photographic memory.

230
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,790
The carrion beetle brain is highly poisonous,

231
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,420
which will mess up one's internal skill

232
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,390
and one's martial arts skills will be ruined.

233
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,020
When the poison reaches the heart,

234
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,220
one will die instantly.

235
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,680
After consuming the Bombyx silkworm,

236
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,950
one's blood flow, energy flow,

237
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,100
and breathing will not be smooth,

238
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,600
and one will get whole body chills.

239
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,040
The Qishe flower

240
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,670
will cause heart and abdominal pains.

241
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,390
I've had

242
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,240
all these symptoms.

243
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,250
What can the last ingredient

244
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,850
in the torn-out page be?

245
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,090
The taste of bitterness?

246
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,530
This smells

247
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,590
a little like the Kuxin grass.

248
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,730
Could it be the Kuxin grass?

249
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,670
The Kuxin grass's toxicity is mild.

250
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,640
After taking it,

251
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,270
although it causes one to cough up blood,

252
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,320
it also

253
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,390
treats internal coldness and blood congestion in the body.

254
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,830
The Heart Devouring Moon

255
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,230
is a poison,

256
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,230
so it shouldn't contain

257
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,870
herbs used in antidotes.

258
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,740
Besides, I don't have symptoms of coughing up blood.

259
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,590
In these books,

260
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,470
the medicinal properties of many medicinal herbs are mentioned.

261
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,240
Have you tried them all?

262
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,130
For example,

263
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,220
Wujiang.

264
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,180
Wujiang

265
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,920
is an effective cure for coughing up blood.

266
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,590
What about Jiemao?

267
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,820
Jiemao

268
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,220
mainly cures heart and abdominal pains.

269
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,630
I got it.

270
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,319
But...

271
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,839
what exactly is

272
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,760
the last key ingredient?

273
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,140
The key ingredient...

274
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,750
The key ingredient...

275
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,800
Yun.

276
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,080
What did you say?

277
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,540
The key ingredient...

278
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,310
The key ingredient is the insect eggs...

279
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,610
The Bone-Gnawing Flies.

280
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,300
Insect eggs?

281
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,140
Insect eggs.

282
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,650
Insect eggs.

283
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,420
[Feng]

284
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,760
The Mei who you trained

285
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,010
is outstanding both in skills and looks.

286
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,050
Unfortunately,

287
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,700
she couldn't even send out a message.

288
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,020
In the end, we still had to rely on

289
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,930
the help of my pitiful spy of the lowest level of Chi

290
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,620
to get this.

291
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,520
The game has just begun.

292
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,060
We have a lot of time.

293
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,600
What's the rush?

294
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,730
What is this?

295
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,490
The sample of a fragment of Gong Yuanzhi's hidden weapon

296
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,790
and its blueprint.

297
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,680
It's not worth it.

298
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,000
You're neither surprised nor happy.

299
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,290
What did your resourceful Chi

300
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,480
send you?

301
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,430
You don't need to know.

302
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,450
It's not fair.

303
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,850
You know mine.

304
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,460
It's the fault of your subordinates for being less skilled than others.

305
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,340
Next time,

306
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,900
if she helps to bring something out,

307
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,630
you'll know what treasure I have.

308
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,460
I don't think it's appropriate for you

309
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,670
to be teasing other Hanya lords.

310
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,230
It doesn't matter.

311
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,500
By the way, Miss Ziyi,

312
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,820
there are two more dogs downstairs

313
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,120
and they seem like they'd bite.

314
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,570
They're Jade Guardians from the Gong residence

315
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,870
who're disguised as servants and shadowing me.

316
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,990
I knew about them long ago.

317
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,620
Then why do you keep them around?

318
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,930
I see.

319
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,760
Miss Ziyi, you're really something.

320
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,420
It seems like someone from the Gong residence is going to be bitten by a dog.

321
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,350
How unlucky.

322
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,410
Young Master Ziyu.

323
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,830
Songlan flower.

324
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,100
Zhishangui.

325
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,420
Silver nut grass.

326
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,450
Jiemao.

327
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,890
Wujiang.

328
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,300
Get the medicinal herbs

329
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,140
according to this prescription.

330
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:53,790
Yes.

331
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,200
By the way,

332
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,470
I also need some Cold Knife Stones.

333
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,500
Oh?

334
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,220
Are there too many mosquitoes, mice, and ants in the Yue residence?

335
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,430
Should I bring you new blankets?

336
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,870
You even know your medicine?

337
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,250
You know that the Cold Knife Stone can repel insects.

338
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,850
People in the Yue residence know a little about medicine.

339
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,270
Excuse my poor knowledge.

340
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,860
I'll go get the herbs.

341
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,460
[Clinic]

342
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,280
What are you doing here?

343
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,140
To get the medicine for Lady Wuji.

344
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,190
Why didn't you ask the servants to come get it?

345
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,300
The Gong residence is in chaos.

346
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,530
The Sword Wielder is worried.

347
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,210
He asked me to take care of it personally.

348
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,020
Let me see your medicine bag.

349
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,280
Young Master Yuanzhi, here you go.

350
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:00,840
No need.

351
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,310
Thank you, Young Master Yuanzhi.

352
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,640
It's wrong.

353
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,670
What's wrong?

354
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,540
This is Danmu,

355
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,660
not Wujiang.

356
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,650
They look similar,

357
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,710
but Wujiang's core is brown

358
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,510
and it has a circular lenticel.

359
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,720
Congratulations, Sword Wielder.

360
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,390
Were you testing me?

361
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,800
I dare not.

362
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,930
Passing Danmu off as Wujiang

363
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,730
is Elder Yue's surprise test for you.

364
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,610
Congratulations on passing the test.

365
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,650
This is the Wujiang you asked for.

366
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,390
Has Lady Wuji finished taking the medicine?

367
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,350
How's your investigation going?

368
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,320
According to the clinic's medical records,

369
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,270
there were no doctors who left the valley to visit patients at their homes two years ago.

370
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,780
Then why did this neighbor

371
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,380
lie?

372
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,070
Maybe the medical records were altered.

373
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,830
We lost another clue.

374
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,210
Brother.

375
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,530
Just now, you asked me to check

376
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,140
the records of doctors who'd left Jiuchen Valley to visit patients at their homes.

377
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,620
I went to the clinic today.

378
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,310
Jin Fan was also investigating it.

379
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:00,960
What a coincidence.

380
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,150
Brother.

381
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,250
What are you investigating?

382
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,740
I'm investigating Housekeeper Jia.

383
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,800
Housekeeper Jia?

384
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,790
The valley's stronghold

385
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,150
sent a message over previously,

386
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,880
that said that Housekeeper Jia's wife and son are missing.

387
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,940
Then why was Jin Fan investigating this too?

388
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,810
Housekeeper Jia's son was seriously ill.

389
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,630
It is said

390
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,480
that he was cured

391
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,150
by the Gong family's doctor two years ago.

392
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,190
I guess

393
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,150
he also wants to investigate

394
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,460
if there is anything suspicious about it.

395
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,960
Brother, so you're also reading medical books for this?

396
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,960
A dying man

397
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,460
suddenly came back to life,

398
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,420
and became very strong.

399
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,140
It's suspicious indeed.

400
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,370
What did you think of?

401
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,310
Nothing.

402
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,380
I thought too much.

403
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,330
It's impossible.

404
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,720
Treating a disease can only symptomatically relieve the lesion.

405
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,330
The patient wouldn't suddenly become strong.

406
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,900
That just belongs in the plots of legendary novels.

407
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,890
Looks like we need to find the time

408
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,260
to go to the back hill and ask Elder Yue.

409
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,290
Brother.

410
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,500
When you go to the back hill,

411
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,820
can you also inquire about

412
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,460
Gong Ziyu's progress in his trial of the Second Realm?

413
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,900
Whether I inquire or not,

414
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,330
the results won't change.

415
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,240
Brother.

416
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,170
Aren't you worried?

417
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,160
If he is useless,

418
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,260
then there's no need to worry.

419
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,440
If he's really capable,

420
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,570
then there's no need to worry either.

421
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,590
Songlan flower.

422
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Zhishangui.

423
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,080
Silver nut grass.

424
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,020
Jiemao.

425
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,160
Wujiang.

426
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,050
Boiled in half-cooked water,

427
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,770
with ochre as the ingredient to enhance the efficacy.

428
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,150
Wait.

429
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,540
You're so smart.

430
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,400
You knew to use Cold Knife Stones.

431
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,530
How did you guess

432
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,160
that there were insect eggs in the pill?

433
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,830
It's a secret.

434
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,070
All right.

435
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,580
Elder Yue.

436
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,020
Is this antidote right?

437
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,330
Did I pass?

438
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,410
You'll know if it's right or not

439
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,020
after you take it.

440
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,170
I even have to take it?

441
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,820
Of course.

442
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,580
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

443
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,710
The medicinal properties of the herbs you used

444
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,410
are very strong.

445
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,220
When combined together,

446
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,520
it's even more potent.

447
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,900
It may be more tormenting than the Heart Devouring Moon.

448
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,340
Elder Yue.

449
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,870
I have another question for you.

450
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,700
Under the condition that you've consumed the Herb Elixir,

451
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,910
will you still be poisoned

452
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,730
if you take the Heart Devouring Moon?

453
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,510
The Herb Elixir doesn't work on the Heart Devouring Moon.

454
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,220
If you take the Heart Devouring Moon,

455
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,040
you will still be poisoned.

look so pale?

Do I?

476
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,540
Maybe I neglected my health and didn't rest well

477
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,620
because I was busy researching the antidote.

478
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,850
Why are you lying to me?

479
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,510
Don’t be angry.

480
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,280
I just wanted to pass the trial of the Second Realm as soon as possible.

481
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,510
After all,

482
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,160
only by understanding the realest

483
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,810
and most direct feeling of being poisoned firsthand

484
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,070
can I develop the antidote as soon as possible.

485
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,650
-I...
-You're still lying!

486
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,010
I'm sorry.

487
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,350
Is it worth it?

488
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,310
Of course.

489
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,380
You are the most...

490
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,630
the most important person to me.

491
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,050
Don't lie to me ever again.

492
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,600
No matter what happens,

493
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,300
we can discuss

494
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,010
and decide everything together.

495
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
Don't act tough alone, okay?

496
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,560
I won't lie to you ever again.

497
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,290
Even if I do something wrong

498
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,950
or something stupid,

499
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,860
you can hit me, scold me,

500
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,980
or even kill me with a knife.

501
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,540
But...

502
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,420
I will never lie to you ever again.

503
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,450
What about you?

504
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,830
What?

505
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,150
Will you lie to me?

506
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm undeniably loyal to you.

507
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,500
This is the message sent out by the Chi and Mei

508
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,020
in the Gong residence.

509
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,770
Ten years ago,

510
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,340
because we weren't familiar with the terrain of the Gong residence,

511
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,520
we suffered a great loss.

512
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,890
When the Yun map is complete,

513
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,690
the Gong residence will definitely be destroyed.

514
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,090
The Gong family's hidden weapons

515
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,909
are indeed invincible.

516
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,199
Gong Yuanzhi's exclusive hidden weapon

517
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,810
is even more unique

518
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,370
and exquisite.

519
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,790
Although we have the drawing now,

520
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,889
we'll still need time

521
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,780
to make a sample.

522
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,670
There are

523
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,170
four kinds of strange poison on the hidden weapon.

524
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,600
Each one is rare in the world.

525
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,060
Currently,

526
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,460
we've figured out three kinds.

527
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,469
And I believe we'll figure out

528
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,230
the last one soon.

529
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,350
Then Gong Yuanzhi...

530
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,219
will be useless.

♫The ground will nurture♫

565
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,070
♫And a pair of wings will grow♫

566
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,590
♫Take me to fly♫

567
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,060
♫The clouds and soil are different♫

568
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,360
♫You always tell me that♫

569
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,180
♫But in my heart♫

570
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,050
♫There's a little light♫

571
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,430
♫The cloud in the sky doesn't speak♫

572
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,460
♫Do you see me?♫

573
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,750
♫The most dazzling sunset♫

574
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,380
♫Turned into rain and feathers♫

575
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,290
Gong Ziyu

576
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,020
♫To stay with her♫

577
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,640
is soft-hearted

578
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,890
and sentimental.

579
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,050
He's even the Sword Wielder of the entire Gong family.

580
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,690
If you were an ordinary woman,

581
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,360
you'd be so blessed

582
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,200
to marry him.

583
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,820
Am I right?

584
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,140
What should I say?

585
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,600
Or...

586
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,200
What do you want to hear?

587
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,050
I want to hear

588
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,600
your honest feelings.

589
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,710
He's high-ranking,

590
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,110
young, handsome,

591
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,590
and has a passionate heart.

592
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,870
He cares for you attentively

593
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,450
and is devoted to you.

594
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,790
Will you fall in love with him because of this?

595
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,470
Wufeng only trained us how to fight.

596
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,650
We were never taught

597
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,980
how to fall in love.

598
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,640
You don't need to be taught how to fall in love,

599
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,700
nor is it teachable.

600
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,020
That means I won't.

601
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:14,890
Okay.

602
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,530
That's good.

603
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,500
If a spy

604
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,630
falls in love with her target,

605
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,990
she'll face a tragic ending.

606
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,770
I still remember

607
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,450
that Wufeng had a foolishly infatuated assassin.

608
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,410
It should be

609
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,020
described as

610
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,520
a tragic death.

611
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,860
Do you know what's the most fatal weakness

612
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,970
of a female spy?

613
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,090
The disparity between men and women's strengths?

614
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,220
No.

615
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,340
It's not about martial arts skills,

616
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,030
willpower, or fear...

617
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,230
but this.

618
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,450
The biggest taboo for a spy

619
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,790
is to fall in love.

620
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,610
Women have always

621
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,910
been more prone to becoming infatuated than men.

622
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,240
Don't be tempted.

623
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,160
This is my advice to you.

624
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,900
I hope you can really control yourself.

625
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,540
Don't hurt others,

626
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,130
or yourself.

627
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,880
Miss Yun, I just hope

628
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,730
that you won't let the Sword Wielder down from now on.

629
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,150
He...

630
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,980
is a foolishly good man.

631
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,950
From now on,

632
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,770
I won't let you suffer.

633
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,150
Is it worth it?

634
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,870
Of course.

635
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,830
You are the most...

636
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,490
the most important person to me.

637
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,030
He's still sleeping.

638
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,250
Give it to me.

639
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,130
Yes.

640
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,890
Bring these for me.

641
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,310
False daisy,

642
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,200
glossy privet,

643
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,350
and calcite?

644
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,560
Miss Yun.

645
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,400
These are all things that induce coldness.

646
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,060
You are poisoned by cold poison.

647
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,210
You can't take these.

648
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,060
Hurry and go.

649
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,320
Yes.

650
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,110
Your injury

651
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,510
is more or less fine now.

652
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,860
Apply the ointment a few more times

653
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,980
to reduce swelling and eliminate blood stasis, and you'll be fine.

654
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,230
My body of scars

655
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,420
is really ugly.

656
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,330
Why don't you add golden gentian

657
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,840
into my prescription?

658
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,220
Miss Shangguan.

659
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,810
It's no doubt that you're from a family of renowned doctors.

660
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,640
The golden gentian can promote the healing of wounds

661
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,710
and helps to prevent scarring.

662
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,370
It's perfect for your injury.

663
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,330
But a few days ago,

664
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,610
Young Master Yuanzhi was injured

665
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,830
and used up a lot of it.

666
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,080
The rest of the golden gentian in the pharmacy

667
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,550
were taken by the subordinates of the Yu residence to be given to Lady Wuji.

668
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,430
Thank you, doctor.

669
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,380
Young Master.

670
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,480
You may leave.

671
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,250
Yes.

672
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,220
Well.

673
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,160
Why are you in such a hurry to remove the scars?

674
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,920
Are you worried that my brother will dislike you?

675
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,390
Young Master Shangjue is not someone shallow

676
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,030
who judges people by their looks.

677
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,250
Then what does my brother like about you?

678
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,690
Is it because you're knowledgeable and sensible?

679
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,070
When you grow up,

680
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,180
you'll naturally understand.

681
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,810
Also,

682
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,160
why did you so kindly

683
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,540
give all the golden gentian in the pharmacy

684
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,430
to Lady Wuji?

685
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,600
It's an order from the Yu residence.

686
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,300
Who'd dare to disobey?

687
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,790
That's the Lord Sword Wielder.

688
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,640
But you've never bowed down to that Lord Sword Wielder before.

689
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,620
But thank you for specially making this visit

690
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,250
just to see me.

691
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,950
I'm here to tell you

692
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,730
that during these few days when my brother is not around,

693
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,120
you should recuperate well.

694
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,020
Don't wander around.

695
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:05,980
Where did Young Master Shangjue go?

696
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,770
The back hill.

697
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,060
The back hill?

698
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,040
The Gong residence even has a back hill?

699
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:14,910
As an outsider,

700
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,620
why do you ask so much?

701
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:18,880
I'm leaving.

702
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,670
Your tea...

703
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:26,400
is ordinary.

704
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,590
Your brother chose it.

705
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,930
My eyelid has been twitching recently.

706
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,360
I'm so anxious.

707
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:14,740
Which side?

708
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,520
As the saying goes,

709
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,520
twitching on the left eye forecasts fortune

710
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,510
but twitching on the right eye forecasts disaster.

711
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:20,900
Could Gong Ziyu and the lot

712
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,300
have encountered some difficulties

713
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,520
and are caught in trouble?

714
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,710
You're making me caught in your troubles.

715
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,700
Then you should face the troubles head-on.

716
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:58,510
Here.

717
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,150
What is this prescription?

718
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,190
I read it in the medical books over there.

719
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,180
Although it can't get rid of the Heart Devouring Moon,

720
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,900
it can greatly reduce

721
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,290
the pain of being tortured by the hot poison.

722
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,260
I do feel much better.

723
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,170
It doesn't take effect this quickly.

724
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,270
Don't try to please me.

725
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,820
Lord Ziyu.

726
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,350
if you randomly try different medicines again,

727
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:44,970
your condition will worsen.

728
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,990
You're really bold

729
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,590
to test the medicine on yourself.

730
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,060
As the Sword Wielder,

731
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,580
you really don't care about your health at all.

732
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,410
Shennong even tasted hundreds of herbs.

733
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,990
This is nothing.

734
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:58,760
Actually,

735
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,030
the Sword Wielder is the head of the Gong family,

736
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700
so it's understandable

737
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,070
that you test the medicine on others.

738
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,700
I've also tested my medicines on others.

739
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,630
In the previous trial,

740
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,500
there were countless casualties.

741
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,740
As long as the trial takers ask,

742
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,180
within the Gong residence,

743
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,060
there will be people who'd volunteer themselves for medicine testing.

744
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,250
As long as the antidote can be made,

745
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,780
some sacrifices

746
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,050
and some costs

747
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,480
are allowed.

748
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,670
I don't want innocent people

749
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:31,910
to test the medicine for me.

750
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,490
No one's life is worthless.

751
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,020
Even if it's a mayfly who's born in the morning and dies at night,

752
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,620
I don't need it

753
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,800
to sacrifice for the hardships of the trials that I deserve.

754
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,420
I'm not afraid of death.

755
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,630
What I fear

756
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,690
is that the person I love

757
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,850
dies because of me.

758
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,540
Actually, I really like

759
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,070
the name you gave this poison.

760
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:02,750
Heart Devouring Moon.

761
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,640
Watching your beloved suffer

762
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,060
indeed feels like

763
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,860
your heart is being devoured.

764
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,330
In that case,

765
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,870
I want to tell you

766
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,360
that this realm...

767
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,130
Elder Yue.

768
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,330
Go over there first.

769
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,420
What are you doing here?

770
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,700
I'm not here for you, of course.

771
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,010
I have something

772
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:58,620
to consult with Elder Yue.

773
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,580
Miss Yun is coughing up blood a lot.

774
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,130
Elder Yue,

775
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,620
please ask the servants to bring some blood-enriching medicine.

776
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:10,600
Interesting.

777
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,810
Although I'm not here for you,

778
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:14,860
I didn't expect

779
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,060
that I'd have an unexpected gain.

780
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:25,030
What are you doing?

781
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:26,880
Miss Yun.

782
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,400
Looks like you can move freely.

783
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:31,750
Elder Yue.

784
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,410
I want to take Yun Weishan back for interrogation.

785
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,670
What's wrong with you?

786
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,370
How dare you take Miss Yun back for interrogation?

787
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,480
Because...

788
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,800
she's a Wufeng spy.

789
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:44,870
What?

790
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,300
I've been through the the Trial of the Three Realms,

791
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,590
and I'm aware of the Heart Devouring Moon's potency.

792
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,710
First, one's internal skill is depleted

793
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,450
and one gets intermittent chest pains.

794
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,060
Then one starts coughing up blood.

795
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,850
After the blood-coughing ends,

796
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,770
starting with one foot,

797
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,450
one's four limbs will gradually become paralyzed.

798
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,170
Am I right?

799
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,800
However,

800
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,820
Yun Weishan's symptoms stopped at the stage of coughing up blood.

801
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,420
When she was avoiding me just now,

802
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,650
she was also very agile.

803
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,510
There are no signs of paralysis at all.

804
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,700
So obviously,

805
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,490
she wasn't poisoned.

806
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,480
Her body is resistant to the poison.

807
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,900
In the past decade,

808
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,790
in order to resist the Gong family's poison,

809
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,080
all those from Wufeng

810
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,460
have received

811
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,410
strict and cruel poison resistance training.

812
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:30,890
The daughter of an ordinary family

813
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,560
would never be trained like this.

814
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,100
What does that prove?

815
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,830
Everyone has different physiques,

816
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,030
and hence different symptoms from poisoning.

817
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,660
Just like how Miss Yun's poisoned by cold poison

818
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,930
and I'm poisoned by hot poison.

819
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,660
Don't you agree,

820
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:57,560
Elder Yue?

821
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,140
Different physiques

822
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,870
result in different symptoms indeed.

823
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,050
But...

824
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,640
Elder Yue, just be straightforward.

825
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:09,460
But the symptoms of paralysis

826
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,010
will definitely appear.

827
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,450
But it has been a long time and Miss Yun still hasn't shown this symptom yet.

828
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:15,990
It's either as Young Master Shangjue said,

829
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,610
that she has been through poison resistance training,

830
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:19,880
or

831
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,550
she knows this poison very well

832
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,000
and has detoxified herself.

833
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,510
The key ingredient is insect eggs.

834
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,150
Bring these for me.

835
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,290
False daisy, glossy privet, and calcite?

836
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:35,450
Miss Yun.

837
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,940
These are all things that induce coldness.

838
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,500
I read them in the medical books over there.

839
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,780
Although it can't get rid of the Heart Devouring Moon,

840
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,940
it can greatly reduce

841
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,770
the pain of being tortured by the hot poison.

842
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,250
So we'll find out the truth

843
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,600
if you let me take her back

844
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,940
for interrogation.

845
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:56,940
If you take her away,

846
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,720
will she still be alive?

847
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:01,450
I won't allow it.

848
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,050
For the safety of the whole Gong family,

849
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,910
you have no choice but to allow it.

850
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,010
Elder Yue is present.

851
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,720
How dare you be so audacious

852
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:08,850
and defy the Sword Wielder's orders?

853
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,000
You haven't even passed the second trial.

854
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,620
How can you call yourself the Sword Wielder?

855
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,210
Besides, for a woman,

856
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,160
you're risking the lives of the entire Gong family.

857
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,780
Are you even deserving of the Sword Wielder title?

858
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,640
She has lived in the Yu residence for so long.

859
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,610
I believe what I've seen.

860
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,730
I also believe

861
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,170
my own judgment.

862
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,290
The two of you don't have to argue.

863
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,720
I have an idea.

864
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,260
Elder Yue.

865
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,150
This medicine...

866
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,180
Don't worry.

867
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:02,810
This medicine is called the truth grass.

868
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,370
Those who take it

869
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,770
will tell the truth.

870
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,380
It doesn't harm one's health.

871
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,160
It only controls one's mind temporarily,

872
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,220
which makes one unable to lie.

873
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,520
May I begin the interrogation?

874
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:46,410
Yun.

875
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,240
This is what happens when your identity is exposed.

876
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,160
So as a last resort,

877
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,810
you have to take your own life.

878
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,970
If you don't cut it off in time,

879
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,330
you will be tortured

880
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,390
and die without an identity.

881
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,460
Are you okay?

882
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,540
Why?

883
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,340
Do you still want to protect her?

884
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,270
Miss Yun is from my Yu residence.

885
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:25,850
She's also my bride.

886
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,830
If anyone has to interrogate her,

887
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:29,040
it'd be me.

888
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,400
[Yu]

889
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,060
Will you hurt me?

890
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,310
No.

891
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,100
Will you hurt my family?

892
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,620
No.

893
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:57,490
No.

894
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,310
Stop asking unnecessary questions.

895
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,850
If you dare not face it,

896
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,790
then let me help you

897
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,890
get to the point.

898
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,560
Are you a Wufeng spy?

899
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:24,200
Tell me.

900
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,230
Who are you?

901
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,190
You...

902
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:31,550
Tell me.

903
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,250
Are you a Wufeng spy?

904
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:44,000
It has nothing to do with Wufeng.

905
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,760
No.

906
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,960
Then who are you?

907
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,520
Who are you?

908
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,510
As the last resort,

909
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,230
you have to take your own life.

910
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,360
The daughter of the Yun family.

911
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,360
Lixi Town's...

912
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,340
Yun Weishan.

913
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,690
Yun Weishan.

914
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,300
The effects of the medicine will subside after 15 minutes.

915
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,250
Take good care of Miss Yun.

916
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,420
Good job.

917
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,120
You're the only one who could persevere for four hours

918
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:58,820
and not reveal the truth.

919
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,140
It's okay now.

920
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,150
It's all in the past.

921
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,810
No one will bully you anymore.

922
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:44,610
I'll protect you.

923
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:11,400
Do you...

924
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,170
like me?

925
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,490
No.
