00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,100
[Episode 24]

4
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,260
A member of Wufeng.

5
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,020
You're just

6
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,740
a nobody.

7
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,510
I'm a member of the Gong family.

8
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,200
I used to

9
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,880
be a member of the Gong family too.

10
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,420
Did you fail to stop him

11
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,250
or did you let him go?

12
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,560
No.

13
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
There must be something wrong.

14
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,370
What's wrong?

15
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,880
Last night, he already got

16
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,430
the plan of the Infinite Heat.

17
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,930
Why didn't he leave?

18
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,100
Why did he wait until everyone has come to him

19
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,090
before confronting us face-to-face?

20
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,210
It seems like

21
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,710
he already knew.

22
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,450
He must have known

23
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,150
that the other half of the Infinite Heat's Coded Heart Sutra

24
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,770
is on my body.

25
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,170
Yun.

26
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,200
He's looking for Yun Weishan.

27
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,430
He wants to threaten me with Yun Weishan.

28
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:16,930
No.

29
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,740
You can't go out.

30
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,620
I was going to find you.

31
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,060
I didn't expect you to show up in front of me.

32
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,650
Brother.

33
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,260
It's never too late to repent.

34
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,110
You beat me

35
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,230
in the Trial of the Three Realms.

36
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,020
But now,

37
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,740
you are no match for me.

38
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,339
To defeat Gong Huanyu,

39
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:20,820
Sword Wielder,

40
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,060
you must master

41
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,050
all the nine forms of saber techniques

42
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,770
of the Snow, Moon, and Flower.

43
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,780
You're still lacking the Three Forms of Mirror Flower.

44
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,580
I've tried it.

45
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,220
Although I have Yun's Qingfeng mental technique

46
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,020
to help me in my cultivation,

47
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,580
my internal skill is insufficient.

48
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,620
I can't master it fast.

49
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,920
Jin Fan and I

50
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,060
can transfer our internal skills to you.

51
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,530
Yuanzhi, Xue Chongzi, and I

52
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,020
will go and buy you some time.

53
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,070
Sword Wielder.

54
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,860
The survival of the Gong family

55
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,170
is in your hands.

56
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,080
Brother.

57
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,400
It's indeed witchcraft.

58
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,730
I'll open up all your eight extraordinary meridians

59
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,570
and

60
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,240
help you transfer your internal skills quickly.

61
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,710
But you mustn't be impatient.

62
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,440
Because when all your meridians are opened up,

63
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,450
it's very dangerous.

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,410
It's easy for your aura to become deviated.

65
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,770
[Three Forms of Wind Snow]

66
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,060
Sword Wielder.

67
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,390
I'll go too.

68
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,150
Where are the Sword Wielder and Jin Fan?

69
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,360
Why haven't they come out yet?

70
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,040
We need to buy some time for the Sword Wielder.

71
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,460
Protect Yun Weishan.

72
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,180
She must persist to the end.

73
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,910
The Sword Wielder needs her.

74
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,570
Young Master.

75
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,980
Brother.

76
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,540
I don’t want to kill you.

77
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,070
[Three Forms of Wind Flower]

78
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,540
Three Forms of Wind Flower?

79
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,900
You're in your death throes.

80
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,200
[Three Forms of Mirror Flower] [The mastermind is Wufeng.]

81
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,470
That's impossible.

82
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,600
Where are you going?

83
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,910
You've already abandoned me.

84
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,570
Why shouldn't I leave?

85
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,310
Gong Huanyu lied to me, saying it was a cooperation,

86
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,140
but he just wanted to monopolize the Infinite Heat.

87
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,140
And you and I were husband and wife,

88
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,160
but you still showed me no mercy.

89
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,420
Why should I show mercy

90
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,830
to someone from Wufeng?

91
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,870
But my heart is no longer with Wufeng.

92
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,810
I don't believe it.

93
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,090
I'm not lying.

94
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm indeed an orphan of the Gushan Sect.

95
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,280
Back then, when I escaped from the secret tunnel,

96
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,320
I fell off a cliff and hit my head and lost my memory.

97
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,300
Dianzhu brought me back with her.

98
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,930
She lied to me and said

99
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,580
I was her disciple.

100
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,540
She took me in

101
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,070
and made me work for her.

102
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,230
And then?

103
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,880
Later, I regained my memory little by little

104
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,860
and put on an act to stay by her side.

105
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,600
I told you

106
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,990
that two years ago, I tried to poison Dianzhu to death.

107
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,770
After Dianzhu was poisoned,

108
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,070
the chief of Wufeng

109
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,480
actually canceled the Wufeng meeting, which was unprecedented.

110
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,150
Through these two things,

111
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,950
I inferred

112
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,960
that the chief of Wufeng

113
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,320
is Dianzhu.

114
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,300
That's why I've been working for Wufeng.

115
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,830
So that one day,

116
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,850
I can kill Dianzhu

117
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,740
and take revenge.

118
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:30,870
Now,

119
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,610
I have the Infinite Heat.

120
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,680
I can eliminate Wufeng and kill Dianzhu.

121
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,750
I've told you everything.

122
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,260
Could you spare my life this time?

123
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,830
Give me the Infinite Heat

124
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,680
and I'll let you off.

125
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,790
What if I don't want to?

126
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,740
Eliminating Wufeng

127
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,120
is good for the Gong family too.

128
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,620
Why aren't you willing?

129
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,120
The Infinite Heat

130
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,370
must not fall into the hands of an outsider.

131
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,270
Besides,

132
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,860
how would I know if you won't lie to me?

133
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,240
I won't lie to you.

134
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,150
Because...

137
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,970
♫I hold the blade in my hand♫

138

♫Feelings are always so bland on paper♫

140

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,740
♫I mock people who are obsessed with love and hate♫

142

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,300

♫The later the night, the warmer the heart♫

149
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,970

Do you like it?

153

I didn't expect

♫Like fireflies meeting in the same night♫

♫But the heart catches fire♫

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:11,200
♫For the fireflies, I'm willing for the night to be eternal♫

188
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,420
♫I didn't speak but I beg♫

189
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,920
♫For you to stay for the last time♫

190
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,420
♫You didn't look back, but I'm still♫

191
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,950
♫Waiting in place♫

192
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,240
♫The later the night, the more confused the heart gets♫

193
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,000
♫Embracing the blade for warmth♫

194
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:40,100
♫Sad and lamentable♫

195
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,630
♫It's all because♫

196
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,350
♫The night♫

197
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,200
♫Is young♫

198
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,070
The Wufeng organization has been rampant.

199
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,750
Since they rose abruptly, for decades,

200
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,640
they've been spreading fear throughout the martial world.

201
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,090
They control people from the martial world with the Fortnight Flies.

202
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,940
Wherever they went,

203
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,210
they stirred up bloodshed.

204
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,490
After investigation,

205
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,480
we've found out that the Fortnight Flies is not a poison.

206
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,410
It's not lethal.

207
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,860
It's just an illusion that put the martial world in shackles.

208
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,940
And the real identity

209
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,980
of Qingfeng Sect's Dianzhu

210
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,260
is the chief of Wufeng.

211
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,790
Dianzhu has a fierce and violent temperament.

212
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,140
She snatched kids and trained them into Wufeng spies.

213
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,370
She's ruthless.

214
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,890
It made the martial world furious,

215
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,290
but no one dared to resist.

216
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,320
Now, the Gong family has specially issued an announcement.

217
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,780
I hope all the scholars

218
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,850
and heroes from all walks of life

219
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,020
will no longer be threatened or shackled by Wufeng,

220
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,320
and help restore peace

221
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,480
to the martial world.

222
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,500
What's frozen melts and spring comes.

223
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,400
The fish leaps across a thousand miles.

224
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,900
The roc's wings climb up to Heaven.

225
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,690
You finally did it.

226
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,390
It's really you.

227
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
Actually, I knew it long ago.

228
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,710
But...

229
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,760
I really miss my father.

230
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,050
Before entering the Third Realm of the Hua residence,

231
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,760
this sachet strangely appeared out of nowhere.

232
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,630
The ink

233
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,520
was also clearly freshly dried.

234
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,540
It must have been written by a living person.

235
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,050
In the entire Gong residence,

236
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,320
there are many who can teach me.

237
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,480
But like this,

238
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,550
secretly,

239
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,390
and even doing it in the name of my father...

240
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,470
It could only be someone with a huge ego like you.

241
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,410
Back then, when you broke into the prison to save Yun Weishan,

242
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,100
we fought

243
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,790
and I noticed that your Three Forms of Moon Slash

244
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,970
were full of flaws

245
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,200
and your energy was in chaos.

246
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,820
So,

247
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,840
I wanted to give you some advice.

248
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,740
Thank you.

249
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,170
Back then,

250
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,590
if I didn't find the sachet

251
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,300
and had to spend three to five years

252
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,510
to learn the Three Forms of Snow Saber and Three Forms of Moon Slash,

253
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,850
what would you have done?

254
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,560
Then I could really

255
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,610
kick you out of the position of Sword Wielder.

256
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,230
You could,

257
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,080
but you wouldn't.

258
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,190
You wouldn't.

259
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:55,810
Right?

260
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,020
I finally understand now.

261
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,530
In this world,

262
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,710
in terms of wanting a punk like me to mature and fulfill my potential,

263
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,780
I guess

264
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,140
you won't lose out to Yun and Jin Fan, right?

265
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,800
You punk.

266
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,150
I was exhausted dealing with your nonsense.

267
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,220
Then, were you also pretending

268
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,980
to be discontented with me?

269
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,200
That was genuine discontent.

270
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,140
Right now,

271
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,690
when you look back,

272
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,420
are you satisfied with that version of yourself three months ago?

273
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,600
As the Sword Wielder,

274
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,570
you were neither responsible

275
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,560
nor competent.

276
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,630
How could you have protected the Gong family?

277
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,720
You've always lived a comfortable life

278
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,070
and were unrestrained.

279
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,650
If there was no one pressuring you,

280
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,030
could you have been tough enough with yourself

281
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,790
to break through the Three Realms?

282
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,810
Brother Shangjue, thank you.

283
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,670
You're now the Sword Wielder.

284
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,080
Be more dignified.

285
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,920
Don't always act like Yuanzhi

286
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,460
and keep calling everyone brother.

287
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,250
Okay.

288
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,520
You may leave now, Shangjue.

289
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:58,710
Young Master Xue.

290
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,210
The tea set is ready.

291
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,190
You may leave.

292
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,360
Young Master Xue.

293
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,590
You suddenly abolished the Burial Snow Heart Sutra

294
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,730
and can no longer restore your youthful vigor.

295
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,670
Your body

296
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,040
is also aging progressively.

297
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,390
You're not as strong as before.

298
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,720
It's cold outside.

299
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,840
Let me get you another coat.

300
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,230
No need.

301
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,910
Stop crying.

302
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,430
Remember to bury me

303
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,050
closer to you.

304
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,640
Also, don't build a tombstone.

305
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,020
It'll look too sad and lonely.

306
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,170
Plant a cedar tree.

307
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,270
It stays green for all four seasons,

308
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,840
yet it turns white when covered in snow.

309
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,350
The snow in the back hill

310
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,830
will never melt.

311
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,360
Bury me under the tree.

312
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,710
In this way,

313
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,120
I can always have tea with you in the snow.

314
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,760
There's no next year.

315
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,000
Have you forgotten

316
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,760
that I practice the Burial Snow Heart Sutra

317
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,920
and restore my youthful vigor

318
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,950
every four years?

319
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,200
Next spring

320
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,840
will be when I break through the last level.

321
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,480
If I break through it,

322
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,350
my body

323
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,060
and memories

324
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,480
will be renewed.

325
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,890
I will forget you

326
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,140
completely.

327
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,200
It's good if you forget me too.

328
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,160
I can't bear for you

329
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,740
to keep holding a grudge against me anyway.

330
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,430
Why will I hold a grudge against you?

331
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,210
You will.

332
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,580
You will hate me for abandoning you

333
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,780
and making you live a solitary life

334
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,940
in loneliness.

335
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,170
Jerk!

336
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,560
Then you can't die!

337
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,420
Didn't you say that the outside world

338
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,940
is always sunny...

339
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,150
and cloudless?

340
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,090
Is the outside world really as nice as he said?

341
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,830
If there's a chance, I really want to go out and have a look.

342
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,660
Do you think

343
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,500
it's not fun here,

344
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,910
so you want to leave?

345
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,270
This place is really boring indeed.

346
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,080
It's a world of ice and snow

347
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,680
all year round.

348
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,790
But don't worry.

349
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,260
As long as you don't leave,

350
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,620
I won't leave.

351
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,070
I'll always be with you

352
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,340
and we'll be bored together.

353
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,160
That's more like it.

354
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,130
I think I saw

355
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,590
such a vast and brilliant place.

356
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,440
It's really like what I dreamed about.

357
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,160
Let me

358
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,700
go and take a look for you first.

359
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,850
♫Will I see you again?♫

360
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,910
♫The summer we spent together is a blur now♫

361
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,160
♫Night breezes tousled your gray hair♫

362
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,400
♫You looked at me in silence♫

363
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,410
♫When you put your hands on my shoulders♫

364
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:42,510
♫All my fear and hesitation were gone♫

365
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:49,570
♫♫Snow falls and my wound will never close♫

366
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,180
Long time no see.

367
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,870
How are you?

368
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,420
♫Thank you, and sorry♫

369
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,170
♫Yesterday fades like a distant mountain♫

370
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,950
♫Tears are the snow♫

371
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,650
♫On the top of the mountain♫

372
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,140
Your sister is very happy now.

373
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,980
She has someone who loves her

374
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,200
and a peaceful abode.

375
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,980
You can rest assured.

376
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,490
What about you?

377
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,880
Are you

378
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,680
happy now?

379
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,100
Yes.

380
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,200
When I was little, my sister once said

381
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,340
that after people die,

382
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,870
they become butterflies

383
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,820
or insects

384
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,440
and go see their beloved ones who they miss

385
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,470
or their family members.

386
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,150
Then you mustn't turn into a spider.

387
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,520
I'm scared of spiders.

388
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,370
You will definitely recognize me,

389
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,660
right?

390
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,070
Yes.

391
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,580
I will.

392
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,370
Elder Yue.

393
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,440
While tidying up Young Master Hua's belongings that he left behind,

394
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,540
I found this box.

395
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,120
He planned to give it to you.

396
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
My sister gave me that bracelet.

397
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,020
After I first put it on,

398
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,670
I've never taken it off once.

399
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,380
When you come back,

400
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,670
I'll put it on for you again.

401
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,500
I'll ask the Gong family's

402
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,620
best craftsman, Young Master Hua,

403
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,840
to make a new bracelet for you.

404
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,640
I'll carve

405
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:48,850
a crescent moon on it.

406
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,790
Okay.

407
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,060
You will definitely recognize me,

408
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,450
right?

409
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,570
I will.

410
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,070
What are you looking at?

411
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,540
Hanya Si actually left me a letter.

412
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,320
My background is stated in it.

413
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,350
Then you should read it first.

414
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,660
You don't have to evade it.

415
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,060
I planned to tell you anyway.

416
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,870
It turns out

417
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,740
that I'm really the daughter of the Yun family.

418
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,620
That year, the Yun family gave birth to

419
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,330
a pair of twins.

420
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,630
No wonder, back then, when Gong Shangjue

421
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,030
was suspicious of your identity

422
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,199
and took your portrait to Lixi Town,

423
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,030
he found nothing.

424
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,710
So you have a twin.

425
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,530
Why are you carrying so many things on your own?

426
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,040
Why don't you ask for help?

427
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,380
I don't need their help.

428
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,370
I chose everything myself.

429
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,530
Take a look.

430
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,510
Do you like them?

431
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,220
Of course I do.

432
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,920
If you don't like them,

433
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,350
you don't have to force it.

434
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:24,880
You don't have to accept any of them.

435
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,370
Who said I don't like them?

436
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:38,860
Yun.

437
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,250
I like you.

438
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,660
So I really want to be with you

439
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,180
forever.

440
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,340
But

441
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,800
what I hope for even more is

442
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,120
that you can be happy every day,

443
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,830
instead of being trapped in the Gong residence

444
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,630
like my mother.

445
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,560
So,

446
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,790
if you want to leave the Gong residence...

447
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,160
How am I trapped in here?

448
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,580
With you here,

449
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,480
this is the most peaceful place in the world.

450
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,110
The rarest feeling in the world

451
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,160
is to feel at ease.

452
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,060
Haven't you heard of that saying?

453
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,690
Then why did you pack a little travel bag?

454
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,300
What about me?

455
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,870
I just want to go back to Lixi Town and have a look.

456
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,520
I always thought I was alone in this world.

457
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,350
I never thought

458
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,910
that I would even have a family.

459
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,850
But

460
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,610
I'm a little scared.

461
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,450
Don't be afraid.

462
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,980
It's just the common anxiety of returning to your hometown after a long time.

463
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,960
Unfortunately,

464
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,380
I can't go back with you.

465
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,260
I know

466
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,290
you have the Infinite Heat's Coded Heart Sutra on your body,

467
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,480
so you can't leave Jiuchen Valley.

468
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,730
I'll be back in two to three days.

469
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,230
Don't worry.

470
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,010
I'll wait for you to come back.

471
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,300
I just want to see

472
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,020
what you're hiding in your hand.

473
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,200
Why did you close your eyes?

474
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,970
I brought you a love braid.

475
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,730
I'll put it on for you.

476
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,100
You can't accept any more love braids.

477
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,000
Then you can't marry anyone else either.

478
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,610
Of course I won't...

479
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,660
I won't marry anyone else.

480
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,690
Only you.

481
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,650
Why send the green silk?

482
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,160
Worry about your lack of clothing.

483
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,310
Not envious of the world.

484
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,990
Only the cloud knows the feather.

485
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,440
Why are you sneaking around

486
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,270
and being secretive by yourself?

487
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,580
What happened?

488
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:52,900
It's something important.

489
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,290
Must you do it alone?

490
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,780
Yes.

491
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,640
Of course.

492
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,810
It's highly confidential.

493
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,990
I have to be a lone and brave hero.

494
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,510
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

495
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:07,920
I'll follow you.

496
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,450
How long will you be gone for?

497
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,820
For about two hours.

498
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:16,780
That long?

499
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,150
Yes.

500
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,870
Can't you let me follow you from afar?

501
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,470
What's wrong with you?

502
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,400
You're so clingy...

503
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,230
Stop talking.

504
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,140
Hurry.

00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:04,700
♫Yet we have no choice but to part♫

559
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,970
Because the symbolism of the azalea is

560
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,800
that I belong to you forever.

561
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:12,470
♫I hold the blade in my hand♫

562
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,980
♫And slice through the night♫

563
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,170
♫Feelings are always so bland on paper♫

564
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,100
♫But writing it feels so bitter and intolerable♫

565
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,310
♫I mock people who are obsessed with love and hate♫

566
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,420
♫But only half my heart remains♫

567
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,380
I belong to you forever.

568
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,730
♫Only I looked up when we crossed paths♫

569
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,180
♫Leaving a moment behind♫

570
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,940
♫At the shore of the flow of time♫

571
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,190
♫I heard a door open♫

572
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,690
♫The later the night, the warmer the heart♫

573
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,370
♫Yet the hug feels colder than the snow♫

574
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,090
♫Why do we♫

575
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,290
♫Stand side by side?♫

576
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,470
♫Like fireflies meeting in the same night♫

577
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,610
♫But the heart catches fire♫

578
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:22,580
♫The night is young but the heart is heavy♫

579
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:28,900
♫The moth embraces the blazing flames♫

580
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,840
Why are you already here

581
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,570
when the guardians are not even awake?

582
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:12,660
Today is the day that Yun will be

583
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,730
coming back.

584
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,720
I want to wait for her.

585
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,480
Are you going to wait here for the entire day?

586
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:22,710
Leave me alone.

587
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,040
Wait on your own then.

588
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,680
♫The memories you saw in your dream♫

589
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,710
♫Shone bright♫

590
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,650
♫In the rain♫

591
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,660
♫I set time into a chess game♫

592
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,580
♫Waiting for you♫

593
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,530
♫Every encounter is good luck♫

594
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,300
♫Every farewell is a regret♫

595
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,400
♫Fate is waiting to be written by the blade♫

596
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:16,000
♫The traces you left in the dream♫

597
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,810
♫It's like a riddle♫

598
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,730
♫There's no answer♫

599
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,590
♫I sewed winter clothes with memories♫

600
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,620
♫Every needle♫

601
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,870
♫Reminds me of you♫

602
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,660
♫Suddenly I forget the world♫

603
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,510
♫I hold your hand and worry about your lack of clothing♫

604
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,760
♫Without regret, the fallen do not give up on the world♫

605
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,770
♫I cross mountains and rivers to run towards you♫

606
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,700
♫To find you♫

607
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,510
♫And embrace your heart♫

608
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,170
♫I don't care about their reminder♫

609
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,650
♫I grip tightly to the blade♫

610
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,280
♫Let this sharp blade be the brush♫

611
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,320
♫To carve in my heart♫

612
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,150
♫You and me♫

613
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:13,190
♫A world only for us♫

614
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,010
♫The traces you left in the dream♫

615
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:46,770
♫It's like a riddle♫

616
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,650
♫There's no answer♫
