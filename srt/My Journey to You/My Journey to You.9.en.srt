[My Journey to You]

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,039
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:40,800
Father!

5
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,390
I don't want to go in.

6
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,940
It's cold inside.

7
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,220
No.

8
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,220
Young Master.

9
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:00,860
Yun.

10
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,250
Did I fall asleep?

11
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,800
You fainted from the cold.

12
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,550
I told you not to act tough or be impatient,

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,520
but you still acted recklessly.

14
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,860
If I hadn't come,

15
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,329
you might have

16
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,070
frozen to death in that ice bucket.

17
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,260
Why are your hands so hot?

18
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,020
I've had a nickname

19
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,340
since I was little,

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,070
called Little Furnace.

21
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,980
Why would a girl like you

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,920
have such a nickname?

23
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,340
My family said

24
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,290
that my mother had reached the full term

25
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,610
of pregnancy with me,

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
but there was no sign of birth.

27
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,950
I wasn't born until a dozen days later.

28
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,820
They teased

29
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,480
that I was well-cooked.

30
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,610
What a coincidence.

31
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,050
I had a premature birth,

32
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,420
so I tend to be cold.

33
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,750
With the two of us,

34
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,150
one is like ice

35
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,260
and the other is like fire.

36
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,240
We are a match made in...

37
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,090
Made in...

38
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,180
Yun,

39
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,970
you just said

40
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,700
it was you who pulled me out of the ice bucket.

41
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,950
I couldn't carry you by myself,

42
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,230
so I asked some servants

43
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,790
to help lift you out.

44
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,520
Young Master Ziyu.

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,160
You saw everything?

46
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,590
Yes.

47
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,630
I only saw your chest.

48
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,680
You're a man.

49
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,180
This is nothing.

50
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,040
Besides,

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,770
I'm already married to you.

52
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,779
We're not married yet.

53
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,590
Won't you ask me

54
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,890
why I came to see you in the middle of the night?

55
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,910
How would I know?

56
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,470
Young Master,

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,080
what are you thinking?

58
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,980
You asked me

59
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,620
why you came to me.

60
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,440
What?

61
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,090
I came to tell you

62
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,320
I seem to have found

63
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,020
the way to pass the first trial.

64
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,850
Really?

65
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,430
There are hundreds of mental techniques in the world,

66
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,300
but they can be roughly divided into

67
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,260
metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

68
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,360
[Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth]

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,280
These five types.

70
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,740
These five types

71
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,740
can be further divided into yin and yang.

72
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,900
Among them, metal and fire techniques

73
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,230
are the Supreme Yang techniques,

74
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,080
such as the Yang-Splitting Chant of the Kunlun Sect

75
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,310
and the Metal Language of the Cangshan Sect.

76
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,650
Water and wood techniques are the Supreme Yin techniques,

77
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,900
such as

78
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,520
the Brocade Heart Sutra of the Qingfeng Sect,

79
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,450
and the Water Avoidance Art of the Blackwater Sect.

80
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,500
Furthermore, the Yijin Manual

81
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,590
has an earth attribute.

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,640
It includes both yin and yang,

83
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,780
integrating all.

84
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,230
If the Gong residence's mental techniques

85
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,540
are under metal and fire,

86
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,250
then the Ice Pool can naturally be overcome.

87
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,240
This coincides

88
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,710
with what Jin Fan said.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,350
The first trial

90
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,330
seems to ask you

91
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,490
to find the Snow Saber Scripture at the bottom of the Ice Pool,

92
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,740
but actually,

93
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,580
it is testing your internal skill.

94
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,040
But

95
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,020
the Gong residence

96
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,510
has multiple kinds of mental techniques.

97
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,870
We have so many kinds.

98
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,780
The Gong residence

99
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,250
has created three unique mental techniques.

100
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,240
In addition,

101
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,280
my ancestors had fought in the martial world for years

102
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,370
and learned many top mental techniques.

103
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,430
Even

104
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,100
some long-lost mental techniques

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,220
from major martial sects

106
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,770
are also recorded within the Gong residence.

107
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,700
It's just that we are not allowed to cultivate them.

108
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,030
Then,

109
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,340
which one do you cultivate?

110
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,040
Snowmelt Heart Sutra.

111
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,490
I've never heard of it.

112
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,130
It's a unique method created by the Gong residence.

113
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,800
Few people cultivate it

114
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,280
even within the Gong residence.

115
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,409
Father,

116
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,690
it's too cold.

117
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,620
I can't stand it anymore.

118
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,250
If you don't want to be frozen, use the chant.

119
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,240
I've memorized it long ago,

120
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,930
but it's too cold. I can't recite it.

121
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,160
You're too weak.

122
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,250
You don't deserve to be my son.

123
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,340
Look at how your brother

124
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,630
practices martial arts.

125
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,740
Cold air...

126
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,380
Cold air enters the clouds.

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,610
The reception and delivery must be controlled.

128
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,150
You're not allowed to cry.

129
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,800
Continue.

130
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,570
Gather in the core.

131
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,010
Snow...

132
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,020
Snow falls, but the heart does not.

133
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,530
Both enter the Fengmen acupoint.

134
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,710
The pulse nears the end point.

135
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,730
That's great.

136
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,760
It's not great.

137
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,100
My internal skill

138
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,140
can't even hold up

139
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,970
against the winter wind,

140
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,710
let alone dive to the bottom of the Ice Pool.

141
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,150
After my mother passed away,

142
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,710
my father

143
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,730
became stricter and colder to me.

144
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,290
I was born with cold intolerance,

145
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,260
but my father forced me

146
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,710
to practice in frigid environments.

147
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,860
So,

148
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,900
I always resisted

149
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,530
cultivating the Snowmelt Heart Sutra

150
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,260
and gave up later.

151
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,110
The ginger tea is cold.

152
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,750
I'll heat it up for you.

153
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,630
It's okay.

154
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,900
I'm not afraid of this kind of cold.

155
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,700
Young Master, do you think

156
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,340
that the former Sword Wielder

157
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,790
was too heartless to you?

158
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,200
Do you remember what I told you

159
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,620
about my father's shipwreck?

160
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Of course I remember.

161
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,410
I misunderstood you at that time.

162
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,370
I thought you set the river lantern

163
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,170
to send some news out.

164
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,160
After my father passed away,

165
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,970
my mother supported the whole family by herself.

166
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,870
After that,

167
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,720
my mother, who once doted on me,

168
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,150
gradually became strict.

169
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,420
Is that similar to your situation?

170
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,740
When I was young,

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,910
I used to ride horses with my godmother Zhuo Mei,

172
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,330
and practice swordsmanship

173
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,590
and martial arts.

174
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,890
I was as free as a boy.

175
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,520
But after my father's death,

176
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,840
my mother started forcing me to the learn women's virtues.

177
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,030
Every day, I had to practice needlework,

178
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,550
instruments, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

179
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,510
Mother said

180
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,210
that Zhuo Mei had extraordinary swordsmanship,

181
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,490
but she lived a miserable life.

182
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,460
If I can't protect myself by learning martial arts,

183
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,900
it's better to marry into a good family

184
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,680
and protect my whole clan.

185
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,640
Mother told me every day

186
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,420
that a woman

187
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,700
can't live on her own.

188
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,510
Later,

189
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,390
I gradually gave up

190
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,230
and accepted myself

191
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,130
as a tool for my mother to climb up the social ranks.

192
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,470
But in my heart,

193
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,070
a voice continued to tell me

194
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,730
that a person

195
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
only lives once.

196
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,850
I should live the way I like.

197
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,020
A skylark

198
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,460
should call out in the valley,

199
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,260
listen to the rain,

200
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,720
and smell the fragrant flowers,

201
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,620
instead of singing in a cage.

202
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,260
So,

203
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,510
I told my mother

204
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,610
I just want to live for myself.

205
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,150
I don't want to be anyone's accessory.

206
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,730
What right do you have to say no?

207
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,480
Since I have no right to say no,

208
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,560
then why am I practicing this?

209
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,730
You are practicing this

210
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,310
so that one day,

211
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,710
you can say no to others.

212
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,510
That's why

213
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,660
you kept wanting to escape from the Gong residence.

214
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,250
But later, I realized

215
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,550
that my mother was just worried that our family

216
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,540
only has women left.

217
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,690
We no longer have someone

218
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,080
who can support us.

219
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,800
She was afraid that I'd be mistreated in the future.

220
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,690
You owe your life to Wufeng.

221
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,350
You also owe your skills to Wufeng.

222
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,080
As long as you're alive,

223
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,860
you must be useful to Wufeng.

224
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,340
Even if you die,

225
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,640
you must still be useful to Wufeng.

226
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,440
I can't live the way I want,

227
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,450
but at the very least,

228
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,140
I can die as I wish.

229
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,020
You can,

230
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,850
but you dare not.

231
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,400
Why not?

232
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,070
Because you still have Yun Que.

233
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,510
As long as

234
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,500
there is someone you love in this world,

235
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,670
you won't dare to die.

236
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,410
If you don't want to have weaknesses,

237
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,800
you must not love anyone.

238
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,880
In my mother's eyes,

239
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,950
the martial arts world filled with conflicts

240
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,300
is too difficult

241
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,600
for a woman.

242
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,740
So, to her,

243
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,100
the Gong family was what could be relied on.

244
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,290
There is a mission now.

245
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,550
You can leave Wufeng

246
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,380
once you complete it

247
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,850
and get the freedom you want.

248
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,420
Actually, the care given by parents

249
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,970
is like the delicate rain on a spring night,

250
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,950
replenishing soundlessly.

251
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,930
My strict mother

252
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,860
watched me suffer every day,

253
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,840
but she tried her best

254
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,290
to bring me new gimmicks from the outside world

255
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,670
to cheer me up.

256
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,590
Give it to your sister.

257
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,840
But she never said anything.

258
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,610
Our parents forced us to grow up,

259
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,690
but it's not their original intention.

260
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,000
They just hope

261
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,240
that before they pass away,

262
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,870
we can learn more

263
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,970
and be able to

264
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,500
safely survive in this world.

265
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,170
More than anything,

266
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,940
they wish we can be children forever.

267
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,370
You're not young anymore.

268
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,800
You'd better think it over.

269
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,500
If

270
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,650
you want to continue being useless,

271
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,170
there's no need for you to stay in the Gong family anymore.

272
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,180
Did I overstep boundaries again?

273
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,110
No.

274
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,660
I like to hear you talk about

275
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,860
your past life.

276
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,670
I also like to hear about

277
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,780
the outside world.

278
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,790
Young Master,

279
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,810
have you never been outside?

280
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,110
Never.

281
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,450
If we have time in the future,

282
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,200
I will accompany you out to see it.

283
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,720
Okay.

284
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,870
But

285
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,810
my back...

286
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,570
After the secret text is tattooed,

287
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,020
you will never be able to leave the Jiuchen Valley.

288
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,030
You must live here for the rest of your life.

289
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,470
What?

290
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,470
Now that I carry the weight of Sword Wielder on my back,

291
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,870
I might not be as free as before.

292
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,070
I got it.

293
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,640
Earlier, you said

294
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,920
the former Sword Wielder always had you practice

295
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,320
the Snowmelt Heart Sutra in frigid environments.

296
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,460
I wonder

297
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,780
if he wanted to

298
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,970
make things easier for you?

299
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,220
I don't dare to speculate

300
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,470
the former Sword Wielder's mind,

301
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,590
But I did hear from my godmother Zhuo Mei

302
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,360
that Supreme Yang techniques

303
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,780
should be practiced in extremely cold places,

304
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,380
while Supreme Yin forces

305
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,370
should be gained in burning places.

306
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,590
I've never heard of this before.

307
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,170
I didn't understand at that time either,

308
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,560
but my godmother explained it to me.

309
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,010
She said that ordinary people who don't know martial arts

310
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,860
can't help but run and jump

311
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,020
when faced with extreme cold

312
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,750
to warm up their body against the cold.

313
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,320
Those who have internal skills

314
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,820
unconsciously activate their internal skill

315
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,210
to resist the cold.

316
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,670
As time passes,

317
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,060
your internal skill will increase vastly.

318
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,730
Now that you mention it,

319
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,970
I accidentally got the way to pass the Ice Pool trial

320
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,700
by soaking in ice water.

321
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,530
Young Master,

322
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,849
you will depart again in a few days.

323
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,800
I'm afriad the cold from the ice water alone

324
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,470
is far from enough.

325
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,810
Then,

326
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,900
how about I sleep

327
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,260
in the lake of Xue Lineage's garden tonight?

328
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,980
I just wanted to liven up the atmosphere.

329
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,910
Ice water is only an external cold.

330
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,400
It's superficial.

331
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,440
It won't improve

332
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,120
your internal skills significantly in a few days.

333
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,510
External cold.

334
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,860
Then what should I do?

335
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,080
Should I chew ice and swallow it?

336
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,110
Miss Yun, are you hot?

337
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,550
My room is full of ice.

338
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,500
You shouldn't be hot.

339
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,620
I'm okay.

340
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,670
Ice and snow

341
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,310
are indeed external colds.

342
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,580
But what about poison inside your body?

343
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,970
Ingesting Supreme Yang poison

344
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,600
can make one feel like they're in hell,

345
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,060
suffering scathing pain.

346
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,380
Meanwhile, Supreme Yin poison

347
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,800
will make one feel

348
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,370
bone-gnawing coldness.

349
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,490
Young Master's extremely cold physique

350
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,480
is rare.

351
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,290
If you take Supreme Cold poison,

352
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,070
no matter what you're doing,

353
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,650
no matter the time,

354
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,640
your body will be constantly activating your internal skill

355
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,870
to resist the cold poison.

356
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,640
In this way,

357
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,010
your skills will

358
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,530
definitely increase vastly in a short time.

359
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,000
What's wrong?

360
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,640
Did I

361
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,350
say something wrong?

362
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,520
You're right.

363
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,380
There are

364
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,890
a handful of Supreme Cold poisons in the Gong residence,

365
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,360
but...

366
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,510
But what?

367
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,210
I've been taking Herb Elixir for a long time.

368
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,640
The poison won't work on me.

369
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,950
Then what if you stop taking it for now

370
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,690
and continue after passing this trial?

371
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,530
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,450
I was inconsiderate.

373
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,490
Yun,

374
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,540
the Gong residence...

375
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,180
Something just happened to the Gong residence.

376
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,280
Elder Yue was just assassinated,

377
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,020
while the former Sword Wielder and Young Lord

378
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,440
died of poisoning,

379
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,850
yet I suggested for you to stop taking the Herb Elixir

380
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,900
at times like these.

381
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,460
I am a fool.

382
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,890
Yun, don't say that.

383
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,260
What I meant was

384
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,950
all of the Gong residence's poisons and antidotes

385
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,310
are managed and distributed by Gong Yuanzhi.

386
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,130
The reception, usage, depletion, and surpluses

387
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,060
are all strictly recorded.

388
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,280
He definitely will not allow me

389
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,340
to take a Supreme Cold poison for no reason.

390
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,620
What do you want to say?

391
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,000
Say it.

392
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,390
I trust you.

393
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,170
You can tell me anything.

394
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,330
My godmother, Zhuo Mei,

395
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,870
had been too impatient

396
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,940
when practicing these past few years,

397
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,740
which led to rage.

398
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,250
So,

399
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,200
she produces a kind of cold poison

400
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,730
to suppress the fiery rage in her body.

401
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,910
She said it is attacking poison with poison.

402
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,440
Then,

403
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,450
do you know how to make such cold poison?

404
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,820
Young Master.

405
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,670
Just tell me

406
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,980
if you know how to make it or not.

407
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,530
Choosing to trust you

408
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,170
is my own decision.

409
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,430
You don't need to worry.

410
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,200
I can.

411
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,130
Come.

412
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,920
Let's go to the clinic together.

413
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,520
Absolutely not.

414
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,500
If you go,

415
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,310
I won't be able to make the poison.

416
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,250
Why not?

417
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,210
You are the Sword Wielder now.

418
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,670
You catch attention wherever you go.

419
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,270
Besides,

420
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,450
you are in the middle of the trial

421
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,930
and the Gong residence is amidst a turmoil.

422
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,440
The clinic

423
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,460
is under Gong Yuanzhi's authority.

424
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,640
If you go there,

425
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:33,870
it will

426
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,860
cause unnecessary speculations and setbacks.

427
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,970
If you trust me,

428
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,730
I'll go on your behalf.

429
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,190
Okay.

430
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,640
Wait.

431
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,050
What's wrong?

432
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,100
I haven't finished yet.

433
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,110
Do you know how tight

434
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,560
the Gong residence's security is at night?

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,230
Secret guards and patrols

436
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,270
are scattered in places you can't see.

437
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,100
The poisonous arrows and needles hidden in the shadows

438
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,270
are indiscriminate in their attacks.

439
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,490
This is the patrol route

440
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,150
and layout of the secret guards

441
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,610
from here to the clinic.

442
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,980
Try to avoid them.

443
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,450
Don't run into any trouble.

444
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,800
Be careful.

445
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,350
[Zhi]

446
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,680
Who goes there?

447
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,870
Yun Weishan, the Sword Wielder's new Green Jade Guardian.

448
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,410
I was ordered to come to the clinic

449
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,200
to make a soothing decoction.

450
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,310
The Gong residence is on alert tonight.

451
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,090
Return as soon as you're done.

452
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,040
Yes.

453
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,990
[Clinic]

454
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,580
If the burning pain of the Fortnight Flies

455
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,060
is too insufferable,

456
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,610
you can use these herbs to make a tea.

457
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,250
Add brown gardenia,

458
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,650
sprouted fire licorice,

459
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,450
and amber with winter worms

460
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,480
to this prescription,

461
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,370
Then add cinnabar and saltpeter,

462
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,160
and boil with half-cooked water.

463
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,240
You will create a Supreme Cold poison.

464
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:22,530
[Cinnabar]

465
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,410
[The Yang family of Gusu]

466
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,340
[Has symptoms of dizziness, may have risks of premature birth]

467
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,220
Has symptoms of dizziness.

468
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,210
Thus gives birth prematurely.

469
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,450
Nepeta.

470
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
As expected of the former Sword Wielder.

471
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,020
It's indeed deceptive.

472
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,250
Someone is making medicine.

473
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,150
Put down the bottle.

474
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,510
Otherwise,

475
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,120
the blade will come down.

476
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,890
It's you, Miss Yun.

477
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,660
Why are you

478
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,690
sneaking around the clinic

479
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,820
in the middle of the night?

480
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,570
I'm here on the order of the Sword Wielder.

481
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,520
How am I sneaking around?

482
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,080
All the guards along the way saw me

483
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,610
and guided me.

484
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,560
If you don't believe me,

485
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,220
you can ask them.

486
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,180
Okay.

487
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,370
They know you're here,

488
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,870
but do they know why you are here?

489
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm here to help the Lord Sword Wielder

490
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,870
make a soothing decoction.

491
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,140
Those who enter the clinic without permission

492
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,480
can be executed by the Zhi Lineage.

493
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:09,900
Did you know that?

494
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,740
Does the Sword Wielder's permission

495
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,790
not count either?

496
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,180
There are traces of cinnabar on your clothes.

497
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,630
The decoction smells of saltpeter.

498
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,670
There's also gardenia.

499
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,860
Miss Yun,

500
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,020
these ingredients

501
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,570
are not soothing at all.

502
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,770
You are making poison.

503
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,180
The people of the Gong family

504
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,510
all take the Herb Elixir made personally by you.

505
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,980
What's the use of poison?

506
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,360
Unless there's something wrong

507
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,890
with your Herb Elixir.

508
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,640
Give me your hand.

509
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,390
This is a witchcraft bug.

510
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,820
If you are honest,

511
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
it will not hurt you.

512
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,350
But if you lie,

513
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,640
it will mercilessly stab

514
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,820
into your skin.

515
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,970
Tell me.

516
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,030
Who do you plan to harm

517
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,010
with this poison?

518
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,130
Is it me

519
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,010
or my brother?

520
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,580
Or

521
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,200
do you want to kill Gong Ziyu?

522
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,260
It is said that Young Master Yuanzhi

523
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,400
is a rare pharmacology genius.

524
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,430
I didn’t expect you to be so childish.

525
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,080
If witchcraft bugs really do exist,

526
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,020
you should have used it to prove your innocence

527
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,980
when Housekeeper Jia accused you the other day.

528
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,130
You wouldn't have ended up

529
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,390
thrown into the dungeon by the elders.

530
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,670
Although you are not as beautiful as Shangguan Qian,

531
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,830
you seem smarter than her.

532
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,720
But to me,

533
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,870
beauty and brains

534
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,200
are both useless.

535
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,140
Drink half of this.

536
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,610
This is the decoction made for the Sword Wielder.

537
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,390
I can't drink it.

538
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,540
It's supposed to be soothing.

539
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,400
What are you afraid of?

540
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm not qualified to drink the Sword Wielder's medicine.

541
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,780
I have many herbs here.

542
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,730
I'll help make another one for you and send it to the Yu Lineage.

543
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,670
This clinic

544
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,900
is under the Zhi Lineage's jurisdiction.

545
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,640
If something from this clinic

546
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,560
made Young Master Ziyu sick,

547
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,740
it would be difficult for me to explain myself.

548
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,500
Happy?

549
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,500
Young Master Yuanzhi, what are you doing?

550
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,020
I am the Sword Wielder's wife.

551
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,740
The Sword Wielder's wife?

552
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,270
I don't even respect the Sword Wielder,

553
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,720
let alone his wife.

554
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,620
You don't qualify.

555
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,530
No matter who I am,

556
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,630
how will you explain it

557
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,060
if something happens to me in your jurisdiction?

558
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,140
What's so hard to explain?

559
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
It's a dark, moonless night

560
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,350
with no lights or candles.

561
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,420
I found someone

562
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,750
stealing medicine in my clinic

563
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,880
and killed them.

564
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,060
Afterward, I found that the medicine thief

565
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,340
was the Gong residence's bride-to-be.

566
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,250
What did I do wrong?

567
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,580
If they also find some poison

568
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,680
on your body,

569
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,620
people will definitely not suspect me

570
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,710
for acting first and reporting later.

571
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,270
It's just poison.

572
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,550
I have plenty.

573
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,980
Gong Yuanzhi,

574
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,970
do you know what you are doing?

575
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,740
Gong Ziyu,

576
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,820
do you know what she is doing?

577
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,860
Of course I do.

578
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,510
Otherwise, why would I come to protect her?

579
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,560
That's great.

580
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,010
Tell me.

581
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,980
How dare you, the Sword Wielder,

582
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,540
send your unmarried wife

583
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,660
to infiltrate the clinic in the middle of the night

584
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,970
and secretly create a poison?

585
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,670
Who is it for?

586
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,790
I'm the Sword Wielder.

587
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,910
I don't need to explain this to you.

588
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,680
Young Master Ziyu,

589
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,620
were you

590
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,770
waiting for me outside the clinic all this time?

591
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,030
Yes.

592
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,400
I was worried about you,

593
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,440
so I followed you.

594
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,880
It's heavily guarded here at night.

595
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,850
I feared you would run into trouble.

596
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,450
Then I heard a commotion inside,

597
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,740
so I rushed in with Jin Fan.

598
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,080
Thank you.

599
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,340
Young Master,

600
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,180
I prepared the medicine,

601
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,290
but the dosage is not enough.

602
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,520
I'll make some more tomorrow.

603
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,860
Is there not enough reserve in the warehouse?

604
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,680
The Gong residence's pharmacy

605
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,730
has everything.

606
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,360
But just now,

607
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,620
Young Master Yuanzhi asked me to prove

608
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,010
that the medicine isn't poisonous,

609
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,670
so he ordered me to drink half of it.

610
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,210
Give me your hand.

611
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,670
This is...

612
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,780
Herb Elixir.

613
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,310
Young Master, you'll give me

614
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,140
something so precious?

615
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,140
Rumor has it

616
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,060
that one Herb Elixir is worth ten taels of gold,

617
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,330
but it doesn't have a market.

618
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,180
No one has ever

619
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,980
bought a genuine Herb Elixir before.

620
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,130
But for us,

621
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,100
it's just an everyday object.

622
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,120
If you take it now,

623
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,110
it can remove the Supreme Cold poison

624
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,690
you ingested for me.

625
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,160
The Herb Elixir is the most effective

626
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,630
when taken daily

627
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,430
and it can protect you from the toxin

628
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,870
before being poisoned,

629
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,980
But if you can take it promptly after being poisoned,

630
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,540
it can also have most of the same effects.

631
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,300
This poison

632
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,010
is extremely cold and painful,

633
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,250
but it's not fatal.

634
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,930
I'll be fine after just one night.

635
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,790
You should keep

636
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,110
this Herb Elixir for yourself.

637
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,430
Don't waste

638
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,320
something so precious on me.

639
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,430
It's not a waste

640
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,890
as long as it's for you.

641
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,750
Besides,

642
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,070
according to our arrangement,

643
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,870
I should stop taking the Herb Elixir for a few days.

644
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,780
Instead of wasting it,

645
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,130
I'd rather give it to you.

646
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,090
Alright.

647
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,360
Stop hesitating.

648
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,219
Take it.

649
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,929
What's wrong?

650
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,929
It's dark.

651
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,440
Let me lead you.

652
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,160
♫River lights, mountains dark, moon round♫

653
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,510
♫Moonlight shines upon the mountain south♫

654
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,320
♫My beloved♫

655
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,540
♫Gazes at me but with a river between us♫

656
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,100
♫The clouds and wind don't speak♫

657
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,780
♫Love begins with a point in one's heart♫

658
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,840
♫I have an empty room in my heart♫

659
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,990
♫But it can't be filled by gold and silver♫

660
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:42,890
♫A refuge in this world is rare♫

661
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:50,740
♫How the years go by with whitening hair♫

662
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,450
♫Listen to the shepherd boy's song♫

663
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,970
♫Ask the flowers and leaves whom they fall for♫

664
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:03,510
♫Wish moonlight can soothe the displaced ones♫

665
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,050
What's wrong?

666
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,840
I bumped into Yun Weishan in the clinic

667
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,010
and caught her in the act of making poison.

668
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,190
But then Gong Ziyu used his Sword Wielder status

669
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,670
and took her away.

670
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,730
Yun Weishan

671
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:32,940
produced poison?

672
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:33,940
Yes.

673
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,200
I saw her herbal residue.

674
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,740
It was gardenia, fire licorice, and amber with winter worms.

675
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,720
When boiling,

676
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,280
she added cinnabar and saltpeter.

677
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,580
This is obviously the prescription

678
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,740
for a Supreme Yin poison.

679
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,450
It was turned into a lump of black residue

680
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,020
and you could still distinguish the ingredients?

681
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,040
Brother,

682
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,870
others wouldn't know,

683
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,180
but to me,

684
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,270
it's a piece of cake.

685
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,130
Did Gong Ziyu know

686
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,510
that Yun Weishan was producing poison?

687
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,470
That fool.

688
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,140
He would say yes even if he didn't.

689
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:09,810
Brother,

690
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,100
you should've seen how he was

691
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,320
when he protected Yun Weishan.

692
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,380
Yun Weishan

693
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,320
is helping Gong Ziyu pass the Ice Pool trial.

694
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,750
Ice Pool?

695
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,900
What is this?

696
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,210
The Ice Lotus Pool

697
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,660
is the first test of the Trial of the Three Realms.

698
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,580
Brother,

699
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,810
according to the Gong family's rules,

700
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,430
you probably shouldn't have told me, right?

701
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,590
You've broken more than enough rules already.

702
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,530
Besides,

703
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,370
I don't think I told you anything.

704
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,170
You're so nice to me.

705
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,720
Brother,

706
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,660
what's so special

707
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,620
about the Ice Pool?

708
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,580
It sounds mysterious.

709
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,540
Don't ask about it.

710
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,480
When you are an adult

711
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,700
and go to the back hill for the trials,

712
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,240
you'll naturally find out.

713
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,830
It's easy.

714
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,350
I won't be a loser like Gong Ziyu

715
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,150
and be stuck in there for 3 or 4 days.

716
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,200
Back then, I was trapped there for 12 days.

717
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,870
But Brother,

718
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,950
I don't want to be the Sword Wielder.

719
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,160
You can do it.

720
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,570
So, I don't have to do

721
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,740
the trials in the back hill.

722
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,260
You must go.

723
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,570
If you don't want to be mistreated in the future,

724
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,000
you must go.

725
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,260
I'll do whatever you say.

726
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,180
By the way,

727
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,860
Yun Weishan's prescription

728
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,680
was very complicated.

729
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,850
It's not something that ordinary people can master.

730
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,710
Also, I just fought with her.

731
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,620
Her martial arts skills aren't bad either.

732
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,570
I don't think

733
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,930
she is Miss Yun from Lixi Town.

734
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,600
Of course she's not.

735
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,610
However,

736
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,320
there are no flaws in her identity

737
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,170
and Gong Ziyu is protecting her with all his might.

738
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,380
Without solid evidence,

739
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,440
it's hard to do anything to her.

740
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,600
However,

741
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,390
the frost and dew are heavy in winter.

742
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,530
If you walk too much at night,

743
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,350
things can get dangerous.

744
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,150
Are my hands a little cold?

745
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,960
I've been easily cold since childhood.

746
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,450
My body temperature

747
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,190
is always lower than the others.

748
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,560
But Miss Yun,

749
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,420
your hands are so hot.

750
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,080
I envy you.

751
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,760
What's there to envy?

752
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,630
The elders say

753
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,540
the palm is the heart of the hand.

754
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,390
Those with warm hands

755
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,100
are also warm-hearted.

756
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,830
Young Master Ziyu, you look cold but are warm inside.

757
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,610
I can feel it.

758
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,620
You're the opposite of me.

759
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,670
On the contrary,

760
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,550
I quite envy you.

761
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,730
The opposite?

762
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,540
Then, do you have a warm surface but cold heart?

763
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,910
I can warm you up.

764
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,970
The snow is thick.

765
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,970
We are further into winter.

766
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,430
Are you waiting for him?

767
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,010
I believe he will come back.

768
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,060
Jin Fan,

769
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,340
where's Gong Ziyu?

770
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,690
Lord Sword Wielder went to the back hill early in the morning.

771
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,380
Is he okay?

772
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,090
He has been frowning

773
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,430
ever since he returned from the back hill.

774
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,000
His brows are all knitted together.

775
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,270
The Sword Wielder seems to be in good spirits.

776
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,080
Don't worry.

777
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,100
He seems to be confident about the Ice Pool.

778
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,260
No wonder.

779
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,890
I secretly heard the servants say

780
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,420
that Miss Yun stayed in his room

781
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,410
for half the night yesterday.

782
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,740
It's all thanks to her.

783
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,020
The Sword Wielder and Miss Yun

784
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,280
merely had a chat

785
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,270
about their aspirations

786
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
and life.

787
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,830
How do you know they were talking?

788
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,600
You eavesdropped

789
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,870
while doing a handstand again?

790
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,310
I have no time to waste with you.

791
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,160
Lord Sword Wielder gave me a task.

792
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:23,780
Goodbye.

793
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,360
Okay.

794
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,920
I'll go with you.

795
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,760
Take me with you.

796
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,800
Wait for me!

797
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,910
Hey, stop running!

798
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,060
-Don’t follow me.
-Hey!

799
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,260
Lady Wuji.

800
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,680
Lady Wuji.

801
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:20,990
Lady Wuji.

802
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,400
It seems that Lady Wuji forgot to close the window.

803
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,770
You're lucky.

804
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,920
The Yang family of Gusu.

805
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,880
In good health.

806
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,760
A full-term birth.

807
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,290
Nepeta.

808
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,860
So this is Madam Lan's real medical case.

809
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,810
Hide a tree in a forest,

810
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,350
hide water in the sea.

811
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,070
It's indeed a smart trick.

812
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:14,950
Young Master Yuanzhi.

813
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,310
How dare a mere Green Jade Guardian

814
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,550
hurt the lord of the Zhi Lineage?

815
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,630
How dare you!

816
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,740
You broke into the Yu Lineage

817
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:42,940
and committed thievery.

818
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,860
As a guard of the Yu Lineage,

819
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,490
I have the right to arrest you.

820
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:49,890
You?

821
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,500
Guardian Jin,

822
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,350
are you alright?

823
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,080
I'm fine.

824
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,970
Miss Yun, please go back to your room.

825
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,160
It's not safe outside.

826
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,130
I knew

827
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,040
you would come back.

828
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,280
Young Master Xue, thank you for your leniency

829
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,180
and giving me another chance.

830
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,050
Agreeing to let you continue the trial

831
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,390
was the decision of the Council of Elders.

832
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,380
It's not us being lenient.

833
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,260
Cut the small talk.

834
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,680
Sword Wielder, you have already wasted many days.

835
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,260
You must hurry.

836
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,760
Actually,

837
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,590
you are the true Young Master Xue,

838
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:25,480
right?

839
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,120
Father,

840
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,210
it's too cold.

841
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:44,780
I can't stand it anymore.

842
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,040
Didn't I teach you?

843
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,460
If you don't want to be frozen, use the chant.

844
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:49,420
But...

845
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,950
But it's so cold.

846
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,500
I can't remember.

847
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,010
You're so weak.

848
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,030
You don't deserve to be my son.

849
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,470
Gong Ziyu,

850
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,330
come back!

851
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,290
Where are you going?

852
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,740
Mother!

853
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,490
Help me!

854
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:18,950
Cold air enters the clouds.

855
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:33,120
[Cold air enters the clouds. The reception and delivery must be controlled. Gather in the core. Snow falls, but the heart does not.]

856
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:23,310
The reception and delivery must be controlled.

857
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,680
Gather in the core.

858
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:32,360
Snow falls, but the heart does not.

859
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,290
Don't cry. Save your strength,

860
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,560
or else it'll be colder.

861
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,970
He knows the Snowmelt Heart Sutra.

862
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:42,390
It seems that he's a child of the Yu Lineage.

863
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,130
Do you

864
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,820
always stay here?

865
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:01,730
Yes.

866
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,070
Does it snow here all the time?

867
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,730
Aren't you afraid of the cold?

868
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,300
You know the Snowmelt Heart Sutra, but you're still afraid of the cold?

869
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,420
Did you know that the valley outside the Gong residence has a flower market,

870
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,120
a street market,

871
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,380
and a lantern market?

872
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,720
What are these?

873
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,470
It sounds interesting.

874
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,180
It's nothing.

875
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,060
My mother told me before

876
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,220
that if you leave the valley,

877
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,700
there are seas,

878
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:30,040
volcanos, and deserts.

879
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,140
There are lots of things that I've never seen before.

880
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,220
My father is the Sword Wielder.

881
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,520
My brother is the Young Lord.

882
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,680
They're all super cool.

883
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,280
When I grow up, I'll take all you to the sea,

884
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,330
see lanterns,

885
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,250
and the big camels in the desert.

886
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,260
The Gong family experienced

887
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,590
so much turmoil in the martial arts world.

888
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,650
Now, we live in isolation,

889
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,050
one generation after another.

890
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,140
What are we protecting

891
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,370
and what are we persisting for?

892
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,530
You'll understand when you grow up.

893
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,890
How could a mere Green Jade Guardian

894
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,990
be so powerful?

895
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,940
I'll investigate Jin Fan later.

896
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,700
Brother.

897
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,460
I only got half of the medical case.

898
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,400
How can we accuse Gong Ziyu?

899
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:20,890
You said

900
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,150
you have something important for me.

901
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,350
I have an idea

902
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,360
about what it is.

903
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:29,960
I'm so nervous.

904
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,530
But you didn't have to lock the door from the inside.

905
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,020
I have to go out later.

906
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,310
Tonight, you and I

907
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,120
will be locked together.

908
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,250
I'm going to call for help if you keep doing this.

909
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,730
This paper looks quite old.

910
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,610
I know why you came to me.

911
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,190
Physicians all have messy handwriting,

912
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,820
but you know that I'm cultured

913
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,250
and modest.

914
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,890
I know so, so many...

915
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,460
Young Master Shangjue,

916
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,110
you're hurting me.

917
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:14,710
How long have you been eavesdropping?

918
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,670
What is this?

919
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,290
Medicinal oil.

920
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,600
You were indeed eavesdropping.

921
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,090
Just now, I saw Young Master Yuanzhi come back

922
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,310
with injuries,

923
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,360
so I wanted to bring a bottle of medicinal oil over.

924
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,220
I didn't intend to accidentally hear...

925
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:36,740
Accidentally?

926
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:40,540
Young Master Shangjue,

927
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,880
I have a way to get it back.

928
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,900
Exactly how much did you hear?

929
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,150
Synchronizing the spleen and liver focuses on soothing the liver,

930
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,820
both in aura and blood.

931
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,970
Emphasize the regulation of aura in the last trimester of pregnancy.

932
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,400
It is best to eat less and eat light foods for nourishment.

933
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,370
Whose medical case is this?

934
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,580
Gusu.

935
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,490
Gusu?

936
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,120
Why are the words on the back torn?

937
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,410
Who would Gong Yuanzhi

938
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,390
care so much about?

939
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:25,790
Me.

940
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,540
It's the Sword Wielder.

941
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,480
I have a bold guess.

942
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:40,330
Is this the medical case of Gong Ziyu's mother?

943
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:42,870
I also suspected that.

944
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,800
His mother was indeed from the Yang family of Gusu.

945
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,120
Madam Lan had a premature birth due to illness.

946
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:50,870
Everyone in the Gong residence knows about this.

947
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:52,710
But look, it says here

948
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,400
that it was a full-term birth.

949
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,600
This medical case must be full of nonsense.

950
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,700
Where did you get it?

951
00:53:59,010 --> 00:53:59,910
Gong Yuanzhi

952
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,310
stole it from Lady Wuji's room.

953
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,340
Before Lord Sword Wielder entered the back hill for the trial,

954
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,870
he found that Gong Shangjue and Gong Yuanzhi

955
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,780
secretly contacted Lady Wuji several times.

956
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,850
He asked me to keep an eye on them.

957
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,000
Usually, they never interact

958
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,030
with people from the Yu Lineage.

959
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:18,770
There must be something wrong.

960
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,220
They must want to

961
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,690
cause a commotion about the Sword Wielder's birth.

962
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,120
That's despicable.

963
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,120
We must find the other half of the medical case.

964
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:27,610
We must be fast.

965
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,400
Can anyone help?

966
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,530
Lady Wuji.

967
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,180
Miss Yun Weishan,

968
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,040
what can I do for you?

969
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:07,230
I wanted to ask

970
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,710
if you lost anything.

971
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,740
How did you know that I lost something?

972
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:25,980
Did you steal it?

973
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:27,930
Speak.

974
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,520
Anonymous.
