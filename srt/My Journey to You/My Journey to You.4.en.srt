00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,030
My father was a businessman.

3
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,830
He often sailed out on ships.

4
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,110
Once,

5
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,550
he encountered a shipwreck

6
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,470
and never came back.

7
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,270
Today is the anniversary of my father's death.

8
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,670
There is a saying in our hometown.

9
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,390
If people who died at sea

10
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,990
saw a boat,

11
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,550
they would try to fly onto the boat

12
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,070
and see

13
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,070
if it's their family

14
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,590
coming to pick them up.

15
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,990
Your father won't be disappointed.

16
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,270
In this world,

17
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,710
what father

18
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,790
would be disappointed in his daughter?

19
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,390
Wipe the tears on your face.

20
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,550
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,150
I hurt you today.

22
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,510
I'm fine.

23
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,070
It's okay.

24
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,550
How can you be fine?

25
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,270
It's indeed my fault.

26
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,670
I'm very powerful.

27
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,950
Don't act tough.

28
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,870
I'll inform the clinic

29
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,230
to perform chiropractic on you.

30
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,270
Then take some medicine to liven up your body

31
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,870
and your shoulder should be fine.

32
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,230
Thank you, Young Master Ziyu...

33
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,270
Thank you, Sword Wielder.

34
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,390
It's better to call me Young Master Ziyu.

35
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,790
I'm not used to

36
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,390
the title of Sword Wielder.

37
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,990
You don't like it?

38
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,870
I said I'm not used to it.

39
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,590
But

40
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,270
I don't like it either.

41
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,430
Miss Yun,

42
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,790
it's getting late.

43
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,150
I have to take you back.

44
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,870
Sorry.

45
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,150
I must send you back.

46
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,590
But

47
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,550
you're the Sword Wielder now.

48
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,790
If you appear with me alone,

49
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,030
I'm afraid it will cause trouble for you.

50
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,470
Do you really not want

51
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,830
to be seen with me?

52
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,710
Don't worry.

53
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,150
I'm not afraid of trouble.

54
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,550
Besides, I'm going to the side residence.

55
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,670
Why are you going there?

56
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,030
Why are you looking at me like that?

57
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,830
Did I say something wrong?

58
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,710
You didn't say anything wrong.

59
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,990
But Miss Yun, your face...

60
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,910
What's wrong with my face?

61
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,350
I heard you were poisoned last night too

62
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,470
and had rashes all over your face.

63
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,550
But seeing you today,

64
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,590
your features look just as before.

65
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,030
You've already recovered?

66
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,470
Poisoned?

67
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,110
How?

68
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,910
You didn't get poisoned?

69
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,910
I just had rashes all over my face last night.

70
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,710
I heard that Miss Shangguan comes from a family of physicians,

71
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,390
so I asked her for some ointment to relieve poison.

72
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,909
It's indeed effective after dissolving and drinking it with water.

73
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,470
It went away in one night.

74
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,030
What did you eat

75
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,390
before you got the rashes?

76
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,110
Nothing.

77
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,590
I just visited Miss Shangguan for a while.

78
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,710
We had tea together.

79
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,150
Miss Jiang also fell ill

80
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,270
after drinking the tea

81
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,230
and went to the clinic.

82
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,830
The doctor verified that she was poisoned.

83
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,030
Did the tea belong to Miss Jiang?

84
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,710
Miss Yun,

85
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,910
did the tea

86
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,150
belong to Miss Jiang?

87
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,710
The tea was from Miss Shangguan’s hometown.

88
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,150
Miss Jiang and I

89
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,909
worried we wouldn't be able to sleep after drinking tea,

90
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,710
but Miss Shangguan

91
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,590
insisted on making it for us.

92
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,150
Take out the tea.

93
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,230
I think...

94
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,350
Yes.

95
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,230
Is everyone here?

96
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,030
Other than Yun Weishan and Shangguan Qian,

97
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,110
all the other girls are here.

98
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,150
What's wrong?

99
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,150
Seal the entire side residence.

100
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,710
Before the Sword Wielder arrives,

101
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,990
no one is allowed to enter or exit.

102
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,990
Yes.

103
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,150
The Sword Wielder is coming?

104
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,550
Yes.

105
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,590
Is it appropriate for him to come here?

106
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,110
The Sword Wielder's words are the law.

107
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,990
But this is too...

108
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,790
Madam Fu,

109
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,470
do you have a problem with my order?

110
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,110
No.

111
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,350
But Young Master, this is too...

112
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,270
Yun...

113
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,990
Miss Yun Weishan,

114
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,550
why are you with

115
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,030
the Sword Wielder?

116
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,790
I have a secret mission

117
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,030
that Miss Yun Weishan must help me complete.

118
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:44,590
Follow me.

119
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,230
Search the courtyard and every room.

120
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,390
Yes.

121
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,830
The river lanterns are ready.

122
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,030
The show is about to start.

123
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,710
Sword Wielder,

124
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,030
these tea leaves

125
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,350
were found in Miss Shangguan Qian's room.

126
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,990
This powder

127
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,910
was found in Miss Song's room.

128
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,230
It was contained in this bottle.

129
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,030
This is...

130
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,230
This is...

131
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,710
If I were you,

132
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,830
I would wash my nails right now.

133
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,350
Halt!

134
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,230
Scrape off the rest

135
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,190
before you wash yourself.

136
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,710
Do you want to leave evidence behind?

137
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,830
If the Gong family can't find any evidence,

138
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,870
they will keep investigating.

139
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,190
It'll be never-ending.

140
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,830
It's time

141
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,710
to put an end to this.

142
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,950
How?

143
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,110
Find a reasonable owner

144
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,590
for this thing.

145
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,830
Give it to me.

146
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,470
I know whose room to put it in.

147
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,070
Whose?

148
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,470
Miss Song.

149
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,230
Miss.

150
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,710
you are suffering from asthma.

151
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,590
If you have asthma,

152
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,470
it's definitely not suitable

153
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,230
to stay in the valley long-term.

154
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,470
Your condition will worsen.

155
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,630
No.

156
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,310
I just caught a cold last night

157
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,470
and have a cough.

158
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,750
I'll write it down first.

159
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,590
Later,

160
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,110
I will give you a private consultation.

161
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,990
The powder is poisonous.

162
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,870
How could it be?

163
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,310
This is the asthma medicine

164
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,750
I brought from home.

165
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,590
It's not poison.

166
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,110
Those who enter the Gong residence

167
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,870
are thoroughly searched.

168
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,070
No medication is allowed to be brought in.

169
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,470
Where did you hide

170
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,750
this little bottle?

171
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,870
I put it...

172
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,950
Put it...

173
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,470
Man up.

174
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,590
You said it is medicine.

175
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,070
Can you take it right now?

176
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,310
Sure.

177
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,510
Of course.

178
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,190
This color...

179
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,950
This color is wrong.

180
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,350
What's wrong?

181
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,510
You can't drink it?

182
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,830
I knew it.

183
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,110
What do you mean?

184
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,710
You have such a beautiful face

185
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,590
but such a vicious heart.

186
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,990
Take her away.

187
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,350
Send her out of the valley

188
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,230
and back to the Song family.

189
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,630
Yes.

190
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,630
It's not me.

191
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,350
You've made a mistake.

192
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,590
It's not me.

193
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,710
We've resolved the red powder issue.

194
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,470
It’s time to test these tea leaves.

195
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,870
I wanted Miss Shangguan to drink them personally,

196
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,990
but she’s not here.

197
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,630
Interesting.

198
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,750
Let me try.

199
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,470
Miss Shangguan

200
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,830
drank tea with us last night.

201
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,430
She also drank it herself.

202
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,710
I can testify.

203
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,950
So,

204
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,830
I believe these tea leaves are fine.

205
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,110
Besides,

206
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,590
it was indeed Miss Shangguan

207
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,710
who cured the rash on my face.

208
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,310
Let me do it.

209
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,990
Wait.

210
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,110
Since you're so frank,

211
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,870
you don't need to drink.

212
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,950
Sword Wielder,

213
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,310
I don't think it's a good idea.

214
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,830
You should be fair,

215
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,230
like holding a bowl of water evenly.

216
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,350
This is a bowl of tea,

217
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,990
not a bowl of water.

218
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,710
She doesn't need to drink it,

219
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,710
but

220
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,590
I want to question Miss Shangguan.

221
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,710
Why?

222
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,230
You might not have listened carefully.

223
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,710
All those who enter the Gong residence

224
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,590
must be searched thoroughly.

225
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,630
They cannot bring any medication

226
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,590
or weaponry into the valley.

227
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,230
Miss Yun just said

228
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,830
that last night,

229
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,310
she took Miss Shangguan’s ointment

230
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,510
to relieve the rashes.

231
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:17,990
So,

232
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,110
I want to ask Miss Shangguan

233
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,590
where her ointment

234
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,710
came from.

235
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,470
It's getting late.

236
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,950
I’ll wait here.

237
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,110
Miss Shangguan

238
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,630
should be back soon, right?

239
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,950
Otherwise,

240
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,350
she might not

241
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,990
be able to return after night falls.

242
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,870
Don't move.

243
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,630
Who are you?

244
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,070
Shangguan Qian.

245
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,230
Bride?

246
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,470
Yes,

247
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,590
a bride.

248
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,710
You shouldn't have come here.

249
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,470
I know.

250
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,510
Then why did you come?

251
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,350
Why

252
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,630
are you here?

253
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,750
Physician Zhou who checked my pulse

254
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,990
said I have a harsh aura,

255
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,950
and my physique is cold

256
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,710
and humid, blocking the flow.

257
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,590
I don't know if this is why

258
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,110
I only got the white jade token.

259
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,870
I came to him

260
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,190
to see

261
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,950
if there is any prescription

262
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,710
that can cure my physique.

263
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,470
Do you want to be chosen by the Sword Wielder this badly?

264
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,310
I did before,

265
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,190
but not anymore.

266
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,430
Then why did you come?

267
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,350
The doctor said humidity in the body

268
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,710
is not good for childbirth.

269
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,990
Then, what did you mean

270
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,230
by saying you wanted to before,

271
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,470
but not anymore?

272
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,310
You must be

273
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,590
Young Master Yuanzhi.

274
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,190
In my opinion,

275
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,990
Gong Ziyu,

276
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,110
the current Sword Wielder,

277
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,350
doesn't qualify at all.

278
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,470
The most qualified one

279
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,830
is the second young master,

280
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,830
Gong Shangjue.

281
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,990
Do you know me well?

282
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,470
Miss Shangguan.

283
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,710
Miss Shangguan.

284
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,030
Sword Wielder.

285
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,910
Miss Shangguan,

286
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,470
where did you go?

287
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,190
To the clinic.

288
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,230
Oh?

289
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,030
Do you feel unwell?

290
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,910
Physician Zhou checked my pulse the other day.

291
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,710
He said that my aura is harsh

292
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,230
and I have humidity in my body.

293
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,910
That's why I only received a white jade token.

294
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,950
I went to him to ask for a prescription.

295
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,390
Maybe

296
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,790
then I could receive the golden token.

297
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,510
and become

298
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,190
your bride.

299
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,310
Miss Shangguan,

300
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,790
the Gong residence has a very complex landscape.

301
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,230
How did you find the clinic?

302
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,670
Also,

303
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,150
security was strengthened

304
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,230
after my father and brother were killed.

305
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,190
You managed to come and go

306
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,430
without any obstacles.

307
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,950
It's indeed complicated.

308
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,550
I even got lost.

309
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,430
Luckily, I met a girl

310
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,270
who was going to the clinic to get medicine.

311
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,710
I found the right place by following her.

312
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,310
I had a lot of trouble on my way back too,

313
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,470
so it took a long time.

314
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,870
I don't know the rules of the Gong residence.

315
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,710
Sword Wielder,

316
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,470
please punish me as needed.

317
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,910
No need to punish you.

318
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,430
The ignorant are innocent.

319
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,270
Just be careful in the future.

320
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,150
If you don't understand the rules,

321
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,470
you can ask Madam Fu.

322
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,190
She passed so easily.

323
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,070
Thank you, Sword Wielder.

324
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,670
However,

325
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,630
I have something

326
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,230
to ask you.

327
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,990
Please ask.

328
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,030
I will answer what I can.

329
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,230
Miss Jiang and Miss Yun

330
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,950
had rashes on their faces last night.

331
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,150
Miss Jiang

332
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,990
even fell unconscious.

333
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,470
Miss Yun told me

334
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,670
that they all drank

335
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,750
the tea you brought from your hometown.

336
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,510
So, I wanted to ask...

337
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,070
Sword Wielder, do you want to ask

338
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,230
how I brought the tea into the Gong residence?

339
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,790
It was part of my dowry

340
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,310
and thoroughly inspected

341
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,990
before being brought to my room.

342
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,310
If you're worried,

343
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,430
you can ask the ones

344
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,310
in charge of the brides' dowry.

345
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,470
Besides,

346
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,910
I also drank the tea.

347
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,390
Yes.

348
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,950
Miss Yun

349
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,230
has testified for you.

350
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,990
Thank you, Miss Yun.

351
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,910
Miss Yun wants to thank you too.

352
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,910
Miss Yun,

353
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,670
what do you mean?

354
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,750
Miss Yun wants to thank you

355
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,070
because she used your family's ointment

356
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,310
to relieve the rash.

357
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,190
However,

358
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,510
tea can be brought in

359
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,190
to the Gong residence

360
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,470
as long as it's proven

361
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,270
to be harmless.

362
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,550
But there are two things

363
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,270
that can never be brought in.

364
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,710
That is medication and weaponry.

365
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,230
The ointment is a strictly controlled item.

366
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,790
Miss Shangguan,

367
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,230
how did you bring it in?

368
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,230
On my body.

369
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,750
I brought it in on my body.

370
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,470
Later,

371
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,670
Miss Shangguan,

372
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,990
please give the remaining ointment to the guards

373
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,430
and ask them to take them back to the clinic for research.

374
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,190
If it's really harmless,

375
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,230
it doesn't matter.

376
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,790
I just hope

377
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,150
you won't do it again.

378
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,790
But

379
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,710
if there is something wrong with this ointment,

380
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,790
I’ll come to you again.

381
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,470
Even if it’s harmless,

382
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,710
it's a taboo in the Gong residence.

383
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,750
It can't be fine.

384
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,510
I said it's fine.

385
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,390
Oh, dear.

386
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,710
Thank you for your mercy.

387
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,750
What's wrong?

388
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,030
Did you really go to the clinic today?

389
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:46,910
Yes.

390
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,030
You really went to see a physician?

391
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,910
No.

392
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,390
I made up the cold and humidity.

393
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,150
Like you,

394
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,150
I took medicine for several months

395
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,230
while I was in Wufeng.

396
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,150
My body has already been adjusted.

397
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,070
I went to the clinic to look for Gong Yuanzhi.

398
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,510
I didn't expect

399
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,190
to run into Gong Shangjue instead.

400
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,870
So, your target is Gong Shangjue.

401
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,310
You're quite smart.

402
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,190
Among the Gong family,

403
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,750
Young Master Shangjue is the most difficult to manage.

404
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,230
Everyone in the Gong family is difficult.

405
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,230
Is that so?

406
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,790
I saw that Gong Ziyu

407
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,550
kept staring at you.

408
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,790
You have a hold on him, right?

409
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,710
Yes.

410
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,750
I think so.

411
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,990
What about you?

412
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,750
Me too,

413
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,230
especially after I saw Gong Shangjue today.

414
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,430
I think I'm more confident now.

415
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,710
Gong Shangjue didn't say anything

416
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,070
after seeing my jade token,

417
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,910
but I know

418
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,710
it must have aroused his curiosity.

419
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,510
Curiosity is the biggest bait.

420
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,230
He won't let me go.

421
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,950
What is this jade token?

422
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,870
By the way,

423
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,470
tell me in advance

424
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,270
the next time you have a plan.

425
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,390
If something like today happens again,

426
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,550
I won't know how to help you.

427
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,190
Help me?

428
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,030
You think that telling Gong Ziyu I have an ointment

429
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,990
and having him investigate me is helping me?

430
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,070
With our identities,

431
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,990
do you think

432
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,390
it's better for everyone in the Gong residence

433
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,430
to think that we're very close to each other

434
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,230
or are enemies?

435
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,070
It's better to make people think

436
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,870
we hate each other

437
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,270
and want to kill each other.

438
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,710
The enemy of my enemy...

439
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,990
Is my friend.

440
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,150
You're risking your life.

441
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,430
This is the best solution now,

442
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,230
isn't it?

443
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,710
My target is Gong Ziyu.

444
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,670
Your target is Gong Shangjue.

445
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,030
To win their trust,

446
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,990
we must

447
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,870
first acknowledge their enemies

448
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,670
and stand with them.

449
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,710
Gong Shangjue has always been

450
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,230
the most popular successor.

451
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,430
Also,

452
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,310
he has been suspicious of Gong Ziyu's lineage.

453
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,630
Thus, he and Gong Ziyu

454
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,550
will definitely become enemies.

455
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,990
If Gong Ziyu really chooses me,

456
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,670
and Gong Shangjue keeps you...

457
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,150
Gong Ziyu will definitely not give up

458
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,630
on researching the brides,

459
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,390
so he'll definitely investigate me.

460
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,630
On the contrary,

461
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,270
Gong Shangjue definitely won't let you go either.

462
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,950
So, you and I

463
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,510
must become enemies.

464
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,550
The more we fight,

465
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,990
the more they trust us.

466
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,790
Let's fight then.

467
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,710
Weishan,

468
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,790
please show mercy.

469
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,710
Do we have it?

470
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,990
What?

471
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,670
Mercy.

472
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,990
You just asked me

473
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,710
to show mercy,

474
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,070
but do we have it?

475
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,430
Yun Weishan.

476
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,190
If we are both chosen at the end,

477
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,190
our future

478
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,230
will be very difficult.

479
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,030
Halt.

480
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,990
Jin Fan.

481
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,950
Eldest Young Miss.

482
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,470
Come here.

483
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,390
It's not dawn yet.

484
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,870
The rooster hasn't crowed yet.

485
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,750
Where are you going?

486
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,470
The clinic.

487
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,550
The clinic is over there.

488
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,550
Where are you going?

489
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,950
It's okay. I'll take a detour.

490
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,190
I won't disturb you.

491
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,430
What a loser.

492
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,670
As a man,

493
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,230
there are only some difficulties...

494
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,150
Oh no,

495
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,230
some surprises

496
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,950
and you're afraid to face it head-on.

497
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,030
No,

498
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,070
to welcome it head-on.

499
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,790
Your good looks are a waste.

500
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,030
What does this have to do with my looks?

501
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,230
Stop!

502
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,190
I need to go somewhere too.

503
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,190
Where are you going?

504
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:53,990
The clinic.

505
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,750
Herb Elixir.

506
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,150
How is it?

507
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,030
These two pills look identical at a glance,

508
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,390
but the one we just took out

509
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,230
has a smooth, glowing surface.

510
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,150
The Young Lord and former Sword Wielder's Herb Elixir

511
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,470
is slightly rougher and darker.

512
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,910
Smooth.

513
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,070
Rough.

514
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,310
What is this?

515
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,510
It's to warm it up.

516
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,950
This is what the Young Lord had before.

517
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,470
Hey.

518
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,550
Since you can't see clearly,

519
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,510
and can't feel it with your hands,

520
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,510
let the poison go through my body

521
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,470
and leave the truth in my heart.

522
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,190
Only if you take poison

523
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:06,990
can you rise to the top.

524
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,710
Spit it out.

525
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,230
It's just like what I usually eat.

526
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,270
It tastes quite good.

527
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,990
Go get me a cup of tea.

528
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,710
Are you sure no one will find out?

529
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,710
It's not a small issue to import the wrong herbs.

530
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,270
Shut up!

531
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,190
Keep your mouth shut.

532
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,550
Burn it all.

533
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,470
Yes.

534
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,870
Burn the bag too.

535
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,310
What are you eating now?

536
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,910
Since it's hard to tell whether it's real or not,

537
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,470
we can only test the medicine.

538
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,990
I found some poisonous herbs

539
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,070
to eat.

540
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,790
You're too reckless.

541
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,070
If I'm fine,

542
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,790
it means

543
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,070
there's nothing wrong with the Young Lord and Sword Wielder's Herb Elixir.

544
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,990
If I'm poisoned,

545
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,470
remember,

546
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,430
I died for you.

547
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,710
Spit it out.

548
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,470
Are you really angry?

549
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,630
I lied to you.

550
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,070
How could I take poison?

551
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,390
The Gong family doesn't place poison in the clinic.

552
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,310
The front hall

553
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,510
only contains some functional pills.

554
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,910
Not only can the Herb Elixir prevent poison,

555
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,470
it can also made some functional pills

556
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,550
lose effectiveness.

557
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,390
Were you worried for me?

558
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,630
I was worried you'd die.

559
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,470
You were worried I'd die?

560
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,950
I understand.

561
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,310
You're so sweet.

562
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,710
If you died here,

563
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,950
what would I say to Gong Shangliu?

564
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,390
You're lying.

565
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,710
Bird's Song.

566
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,670
This pill will affect one's vocal chords,

567
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,270
making one's voice narrow and sharp.

568
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,070
Men use it when disguising themselves.

569
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,870
Women should not take it.

570
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,230
Does that mean

571
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,630
the Young Lord and Sword Wielder's Herb Elixir

572
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,670
was replaced with ineffective fake medicine?

573
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,870
Then my sacrifice is worth it.

574
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,990
Do you smell...

575
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,190
My body scent?

576
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,870
A pungent smell?

577
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,150
Stop.

578
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,190
What do this mean?

579
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,550
It means "stop."

580
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,870
You already said it.

581
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,430
Why did you do the gesture?

582
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,150
Why did you say it if you did the gesture?

583
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,390
Wait for me here.

584
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:10,990
Okay.

585
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,950
What are you doing?

586
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,550
Guardian Jin.

587
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,910
I-I'm burning expired herbs.

588
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,710
Expired herbs

589
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,630
are shipped out and destroyed by specified personnel.

590
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,710
How could they be burned

591
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,430
in the clinic for no reason?

592
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,950
These herbs...

593
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,070
Thank you, Young Master Jin.

594
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,070
You even prepared a surprise for me.

595
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,390
This is our token of love.

596
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,750
This is the case evidence.

597
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,870
According to the medical book,

598
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,270
this is indeed an Ethereal Flower.

599
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:20,949
Then why did the clinic's servant act so suspiciously,

600
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,989
as if they were trying to destroy evidence?

601
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,510
How come I didn't know

602
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,750
that you're familiar with pharmacology

603
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,270
in addition to weaponry?

604
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,469
I don't.

605
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,949
None of us know pharmacology.

606
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,790
The Gong residence's antidote and drug production

607
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,389
have also been managed by the Zhi Lineage.

608
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,469
But Gong Yuanzhi

609
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,070
would never help me.

610
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,390
I...

611
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,190
I...

612
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,870
I like you too.

613
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,190
I know someone who knows pharmacology.

614
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,630
Lord Sword Wielder,

615
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,910
the three elders request a meeting.

616
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,670
Greetings, elders.

617
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:38,990
Ziyu.

618
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,670
According to etiquette, you should mourn your parents

619
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,470
for three years.

620
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,110
No marriage,

621
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,550
drinking or celebrations.

622
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,670
We should have sent all the brides-to-be

623
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,430
back to their hometowns

624
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,750
and apologize with gifts.

625
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,910
But

626
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,110
considering the changes this time,

627
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,430
and Wufeng

628
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,990
has also figured out how to enter the Gong residence,

629
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,270
we believe

630
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,750
for a long period into the future,

631
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,030
it won't be suitable to marry a bride from outside the valley.

632
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,030
So,

633
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,350
after discussing,

634
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,350
we hope

635
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,430
the Lord Sword Wielder

636
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,110
can choose someone you fancy

637
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,990
among the girls brought in this time

638
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,550
and keep her by your side temporarily.

639
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,910
Later, we'll find

640
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,470
another auspicious day

641
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,070
for the official wedding.

642
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,270
Yes.

643
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,430
Shangjue,

644
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,750
you are also of age for marriage.

645
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,630
How about

646
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,670
you choose together?

647
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,470
Fine.

648
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,350
The marriage selection was set for the former Young Lord.

649
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,910
I've been extremely busy these past few years.

650
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,270
I didn't intend to get married.

651
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,470
But the recent changes

652
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,830
made me reconsider.

653
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,590
The Gong family's lineage has always been sparse.

654
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:57,990
In addition,

655
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,950
various signs show

656
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,190
that Wufeng has started plotting

657
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,910
to attack the Gong residence.

658
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,350
This is a good thing.

659
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,990
Good things

660
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,110
come in pairs.

661
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:13,990
Ziyu,

662
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,590
what do you think?

663
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,270
If you wish to get married,

664
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,870
that is naturally great news.

665
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,790
However,

666
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,750
you've always had high standards

667
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,910
and a unique taste.

668
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,350
I wonder

669
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,470
if you're willing to compromise

670
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,950
with a girl that I pass over?

671
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,910
Ziyu,

672
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,590
I never compromise

673
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,870
for anything.

674
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,950
Help me keep Miss Shangguan.

675
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,110
Sword Wielder,

676
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:07,470
do you also want to choose Miss Shangguan?

677
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,830
Miss Shangguan Qian,

678
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,310
please go to the Sword Wielder Hall.

679
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,950
Lord Sword Wielder

680
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,830
chose Miss Shangguan?

681
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,070
What about us?

682
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,470
Miss Yun Weishan,

683
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,390
please go to the Sword Wielder Hall.

684
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,470
They have arrived.

685
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,310
Guards,

686
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,390
you may leave.

687
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,750
Yes.

688
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,350
Guardian Jin,

689
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,190
you can't enter the back hill.

690
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,070
I know.

691
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,990
Please bring this token to Young Master Yue.

692
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,790
Tell him

693
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,990
that a Jade Guardian is waiting for him here.

694
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,510
The Sword Wielder

695
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,790
and Young Master Shangjue

696
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,510
have chosen their future brides.

697
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,590
Then,

698
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,510
Miss Yun Weishan and Shangguan Qian

699
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,350
can become attendants starting tonight

700
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,390
and reside in the Jue and Yu Lineages.

701
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,270
No need to rush.

702
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,270
This marriage selection

703
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,910
was used by the Wufeng

704
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,590
to help assassins infiltrate the Gong residence

705
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,070
and kill the Sword Wielder and Young Lord.

706
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,470
Although we've found a one Wufeng assassin,

707
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,430
there might be another one.

708
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,510
That's why

709
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,670
I chose Miss Yun Weishan.

710
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,430
Lord Sword Wielder,

711
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,790
what do you mean?

712
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,590
When I tested the brides that night

713
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,870
by bringing them away from the Underground Palace,

714
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,150
Miss Yun Weishan

715
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,990
tried to escape from the Gong residence.

716
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,350
I met her again yesterday.

717
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,990
She wanted to escape yet again.

718
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,870
Someone who tries so hard

719
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,470
to leave this place

720
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,630
would never

721
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,830
be a Wufeng spy

722
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,830
that worked hard to sneak in.

723
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,390
But...

724
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,110
Shangjue,

725
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,510
how did you choose your bride?

726
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,750
Is it just because

727
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,390
Miss Shangguan is pretty?

728
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,990
I didn't even notice before you mentioned it.

729
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,110
Ziyu, it turns out

730
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,470
that you've paid attention to Miss Shangguan's features.

731
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,470
Elders,

732
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,870
no matter what reasons

733
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,470
Ziyu and I have,

734
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,750
to be sure,

735
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,190
I've already arranged for artists

736
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,990
to draw their portraits later.

737
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,270
Then,

738
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,990
I will send men to Yun Weishan's hometown,

739
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,670
Lixi Town,

740
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,630
and the Shangguan family in Dafu City.

741
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,630
They will verify

742
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,990
the ladies' identities

743
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,790
with the local neighbors

744
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,510
and relatives.

745
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,390
Coincidentally,

746
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,070
Lixi Town

747
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,430
is very close to Dafu City.

748
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,750
Only one trip is needed.

749
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,590
Elders,

750
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,590
and Ziyu,

751
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,070
I believe that it's not too much

752
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,990
to be cautious

753
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,070
in these extraordinary times.

754
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,270
Of course.

755
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,510
Of course.

756
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,990
So,

757
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,950
I ask you two

758
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,750
to stay in the side residence

759
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,870
for the time being.

760
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,470
I will arrange more guards

761
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,030
to protect your safety.

762
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,550
If nothing goes wrong,

763
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,070
you'll become family.

764
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,990
Thank you, Young Master Shangjue.

765
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,630
Dafu City is a bit far from here.

766
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,070
It seems

767
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,270
we will have to stay in the side residence

768
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,990
for quite some time.

769
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,830
We couldn't bring any daily necessities into the mountain.

770
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:26,990
May we

771
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,670
leave the Gong residence

772
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,350
to buy some items in town?

773
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,790
If you need anything,

774
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,790
just ask the servants to buy them

775
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,630
and it will be done within the hour.

776
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,590
No need to personally make the trip.

777
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,670
Besides,

778
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,470
I've already prepared the fastest men and horse

779
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,550
with the fastest pigeon.

780
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,630
We will have news

781
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,150
within three days.

782
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,790
Although we've found one Wufeng assassin,

783
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,470
there might be a second one.

784
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,550
We will have news

785
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,030
within three days.

786
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,030
Eldest Young Miss and Brother Yuanzhi have arrived.

787
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,190
I ask the elders to stay a while longer.

788
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,350
I have something important

789
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,750
to discuss with you.

790
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,830
The three elders are aged.

791
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,630
Let them go back and rest.

792
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,550
You can tell me

793
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,070
if there are any issues.

794
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,950
Although I'm still young and inexperienced,

795
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,790
I'm already the Sword Wielder.

796
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,390
Young Master Shangjue,

797
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,470
please mind your manners.

798
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:34,590
This is exactly

799
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,630
what I wish to discuss.

800
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,950
You must have noticed

801
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,150
I haven't called you "Sword Wielder"

802
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,750
since you came in, right?

803
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,750
If you want me to call you that title,

804
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,510
Ziyu,

805
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,150
it won't be easy.

806
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,470
It's not hard either.

807
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,430
The elders are all here today.

808
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,670
What I want to say is

809
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,030
I, Gong Shangjue,

810
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,510
don't recognize

811
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,510
and even oppose of

812
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,990
Gong Ziyu being the new Sword Wielder.

813
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:13,870
There must be a reason

814
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,190
why you object.

815
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,390
Gong Ziyu meets the conditions for succession in the absence of an heir.

816
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,590
Could it be

817
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,470
that you want to go against

818
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,390
the ancestral precept of the Gong family?

819
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,150
No one

820
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,710
can violate the ancestral precept,

821
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,590
but does Gong Ziyu

822
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,030
really meet the conditions?

823
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,750
I've copied the ancestral precept more than 30 times.

824
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,990
I remember it clearly.

825
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,950
Since you've copied it so many times,

826
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,150
why don't you recite it?

827
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,830
The successor must have become of age.

828
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:47,830
In this regard,

829
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,190
Brother Gong Yuanzhi isn't qualified.

830
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:51,550
Second,

831
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,510
the successor must be a man.

832
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,270
I don't qualify

833
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,510
for this.

834
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:56,630
Third,

835
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:57,790
the successor

836
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,150
must be a descendant of and present in the Gong residence.

837
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:00,990
For this,

838
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,030
Gong Shangjue,

839
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,470
who was outside the valley and unreachable at the time,

840
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,150
doesn't qualify.

841
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,430
You've counted it yourself.

842
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,870
The successor must meet four conditions.

843
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,550
Were you listening?

844
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,630
Of age,

845
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,390
male,

846
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,390
and present in the Gong residence

847
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,670
are only three points.

848
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,910
The point of the third condition

849
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,470
is not being in the Gong residence,

850
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,670
but being a descendant of the Gong family.

851
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,990
Just say what you want to say.

852
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,630
My brother means

853
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,430
that if Gong Ziyu is not a descendant of the Gong family,

854
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,310
then his succession right

855
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,390
is ridiculous.

856
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,070
Gong Yuanzhi,

857
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,190
don't speak nonsense.

858
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,470
Who are you?

859
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,870
Are you qualified to speak here?

860
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,910
I think many people here know

861
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,870
that Gong Ziyu was born prematurely

862
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:52,990
before 10 months.

863
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,470
It's always been rumored that Lady Lan

864
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,470
had an inseparable lover before marrying

865
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,510
into the Gong family.

866
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:01,390
So, was Gong Ziyu really born prematurely,

867
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,750
or was he a normal birth?

868
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,190
It's hard to say.

869
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,390
Gong Yuanzhi.

870
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:06,910
Sword Wielder.

871
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,430
Do not fight in the Hall.

872
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:08,910
Shangjue,

873
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:09,990
control your brother.

874
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,870
Gong Shangjue, are you crazy?

875
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:15,430
Enough!

876
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,870
Ridiculous!

877
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,470
It's fine for you to be lawless

878
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,950
and disrespect the ancestral precept any other time,

879
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,830
but the three elders are here today

880
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:35,910
and you still dare to fight?

881
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,470
Gong Yuanzhi is not yet an adult.

882
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,590
He is reckless and ignorant.

883
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,150
He can be forgiven.

884
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:43,830
But you,

885
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,110
Gong Ziyu,

886
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:47,070
you hurt your own family.

887
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:48,470
Whether it's your identity,

888
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,070
your ability,

889
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:49,830
or virtue,

890
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,270
you don't have any of it.

891
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:52,950
How can you say

892
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,310
you deserve this position?

893
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,070
I must kill the one

894
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,670
who killed my father and brother.

895
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,150
Sword Wielder,

896
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,030
do not say such harsh words

897
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,870
if there is no evidence.

898
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:05,990
You are framing someone

899
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,510
without evidence.

900
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:10,070
You don't deserve to be the Sword Wielder.

901
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:11,270
Of course I have evidence.

902
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,470
And Gong Shangjue,

903
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,630
you are also involved.

904
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,030
What's wrong with me?

905
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,550
You were the last person my father met that night.

906
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,070
What did you talk about?

907
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,950
Why were you in such a hurry

908
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,430
that you left overnight?

909
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,310
Where did you go?

910
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:26,990
What did you do?

911
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:27,750
Did anyone see it?

912
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,870
Can you explain it?

913
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,950
Of course I can.

914
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,470
Naturally,

915
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,310
there are also people who know,

916
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,350
but it's confidential

917
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,350
and ordered personally by the Sword Wielder.

918
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,910
I don't need to report it to you.

919
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,470
I am the Sword Wielder.

920
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:46,670
I order you

921
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,670
to report to me immediately.

922
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,270
If you don't,

923
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,470
you and Gong Yuanzhi

924
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,350
will be the suspects who plotted to kill my father.

925
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,950
If I had the intention to usurp power,

926
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,270
I would have stayed in the Gong residence that night.

927
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:10,350
If I were in the Gong residence,

928
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,990
you'd never have a chance

929
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,870
to be the Sword Wielder.

930
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,390
Do not blame others

931
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,190
if you fail at a task.

932
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,430
If you can't live up to the Sword Wielder position,

933
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,510
then don't accuse others of treason.

934
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,470
I'll show you

935
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,150
if I'm capable of being the Sword Wielder or not.

936
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:24,310
Don't be angry.

937
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,910
You know

938
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:26,790
that Shangjue and Yuanzhi

939
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:29,590
have always been like this.

940
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,310
The big one has an emotionless face.

941
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,630
The small one has emotionless eyes.

942
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,430
Sword Wielder,

943
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,350
the person I mentioned who can help us

944
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,190
identity the herb will be here soon.

945
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,030
Okay.

946
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:55,990
Later,

947
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,510
don't ask who he is

948
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,910
or ask me

949
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,870
where I found him.

950
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,310
But his words can definitely be trusted

951
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,950
and he won't harm you either.

952
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,550
Where else could he come from?

953
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,430
The Gong residence is only so big.

954
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:10,190
He's either from the clinic

955
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,030
or from Gong Yuanzhi's palace.

956
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:13,910
Hurry and call him in.

957
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:24,310
I've never realized that he dilly dallies like this.

958
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,910
I think I've lost interest in him.

959
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,350
If you go to the Guardian Camp

960
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,110
and peek at him bathing twice,

961
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,150
I promise you'll be interested again.

962
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,670
Don't slander me.

963
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:37,830
-I only went once.
-I didn't slander you.

964
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:38,430
Sword Wielder.

965
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,110
Who are you?

966
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,950
You agreed not to ask.

967
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:56,950
Sword Wielder,

968
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:58,470
my surname is Yue.

969
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,190
Yue as in "mountains"?

970
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:05,110
Yue as in "the romantic moon."

971
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:07,670
Young Master Yue.

972
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,470
Brother Yue.

973
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,990
I may be much older

974
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,310
than your brother.

975
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,950
Young Master Yue looks younger than Jin Fan.

976
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,510
How old can you be?

977
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,470
If you insist on calling yourself old,

978
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,510
I'll call you the old Matchmaking God in the moon.

979
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:41,950
Young Master Yue,

980
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,470
please take a look.

981
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:45,870
Is this

982
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:48,950
the most important ingredient of the Herb Elixir,

983
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,350
the Ethereal Flower?

984
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,270
This is not the Ethereal Flower.

985
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,670
It is a Spirit Herb.

986
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,790
If the Ethereal Flower is changed

987
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,110
into a Spirit Herb

988
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,630
in the ingredients,

989
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,790
would the Herb Elixir

990
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,150
still be effective?

991
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,590
Of course not.

992
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,590
The Ethereal Flower is the core of the Herb Elixir.

993
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,470
If the core is switched,

994
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,070
the medicine

995
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,830
will essentially be useless.

996
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,150
As expected, it's the Zhi...

997
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,990
As expected, it's the Zhi Lineage.

998
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,190
Since I've cleared the Sword Wielder's doubts,

999
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,110
I will return now.

1000
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:39,590
Wait.

1001
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,470
Sword Wielder, is there anything else?

1002
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,470
You said you will return.

1003
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:46,590
Return to where?

1004
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,870
You agreed not to ask,

1005
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:50,990
you liar!

1006
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,030
Sword Wielder,

1007
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:55,630
I think

1008
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,030
we'll meet again soon.

1009
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,870
At that time,

1010
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,350
you will know who I am.

1011
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:03,910
Goodbye.

1012
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,550
Brother Yue,

1013
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,430
let me see you off.

1014
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,310
Such a player.

1015
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,990
The books are right.

1016
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,550
All women are bad.

1017
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:26,110
What have you been reading lately?

1018
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,670
Should we first interrogate

1019
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,950
that suspicious servant?

1020
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:38,670
Jin Fan,

1021
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:40,550
hurry and find him.

1022
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:41,750
Now?

1023
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,990
It's so late.

1024
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,550
I'm afraid it's already too late.

1025
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:44,990
Okay.

1026
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,070
Thank you.

1027
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,270
The portraits are done.

1028
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,350
Thank you, my lord.

1029
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,670
Thank you

1030
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,270
for drawing me so beautifully.

1031
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,350
A few hours ago,

1032
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,110
it was still lively here.

1033
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,990
But in a blink of an eye,

1034
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,950
we are the only ones left.

1035
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:58,150
By the way,

1036
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,150
Miss Jiang has recovered

1037
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,910
and was sent out of the Gong residence.

1038
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,590
I thought you would care.

1039
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,070
After sitting for so long,

1040
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,790
my waist is in pain.

1041
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,150
I'm going to bed.

1042
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,870
You should rest early too.

1043
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,990
But I still want to chat with you.

1044
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,870
There's no one to talk to

1045
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,990
in such a big courtyard.

1046
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,030
It's quite scary.

1047
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,990
That's great.

1048
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,990
I asked you to bring the servant here.

1049
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:59,470
Why did you arrest Housekeeper Jia?

1050
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:00,670
I...

1051
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:01,910
When I went there,

1052
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,670
the servant was already gone.

1053
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,470
I saw the pharmacy's Housekeeper Jia looking sneaky.

1054
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:07,590
He's also suspicious,

1055
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,990
so I brought him here.

1056
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,430
How should we

1057
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:26,990
interrogate him?

1058
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:28,790
We should use the 18 methods

1059
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:31,430
of torture like, "I'll confess!"

1060
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:33,990
How about

1061
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,070
we go to Gong Yuanzhi's place

1062
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,990
and steal some poison for him.

1063
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:39,510
Let him speak.

1064
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,390
I'm done.

1065
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,390
I said to let him speak.

1066
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:52,670
Housekeeper Jia,

1067
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,070
you're a senior staff of the Gong residence now.

1068
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:57,990
For your dignity,

1069
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,190
I'll let you speak by yourself.

1070
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,510
What did the Zhi Lineage do?

1071
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:02,830
I don't understand.

1072
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,990
You can summon me if you need help.

1073
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,150
Why did you arrest me?

1074
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:09,990
Who ordered you

1075
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,750
to change the Ethereal Flower into the Spirit Herb?

1076
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,030
Sword Wielder, you lost your family.

1077
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,070
I know you need somewhere to vent your anger,

1078
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,310
but you can't slander

1079
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:29,990
the Zhi Lineage of switching the herbs.

1080
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,350
It seems

1081
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:38,030
that we've wronged Housekeeper Jia.

1082
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:40,470
Jin Fan.

1083
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,510
Untie him

1084
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,990
and escort him back.

1085
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,390
What are you waiting for?

1086
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,310
Untie him.

1087
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:57,270
Gong Ziyu,

1088
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,070
what's wrong with you?

1089
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:58,670
None of your business.

1090
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:03,990
In a while, everyone will see

1091
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:06,310
Jin Fan politely escort Housekeeper Jia

1092
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,990
out of the gates of the Yu Lineage.

1093
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:09,470
Tomorrow morning,

1094
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,470
I will release the news

1095
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,350
that Housekeeper Jia

1096
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,190
provided a critical clue for the former Sword Wielder's

1097
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,190
poisoning case.

1098
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,270
Then we will visit him

1099
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,750
with a grand reward.

1100
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:31,030
Sword Wielder,

1101
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,270
please forgive me.

1102
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,070
If this news reaches Gong Yuanzhi,

1103
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,190
it'll be the end of me.

1104
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,110
Housekeeper Jia,

1105
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,310
there are only two options in front of you.

1106
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:46,910
Either

1107
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:49,310
tell me everything you know

1108
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,950
and I can spare your life as the Sword Wielder,

1109
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:53,830
or

1110
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:56,670
keep playing tricks here,

1111
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:59,390
and we'll see about it

1112
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,310
in the morning.

1113
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:13,630
Sword Wielder, you are wise.

1114
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,670
I deserve to die.

1115
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,430
I was acting under orders.

1116
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:19,390
I had no choice

1117
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,430
but to switch the Ethereal Flower.

1118
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,270
I...

1119
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,030
I'm willing to testify for you.

1120
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,750
Who is the person

1121
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:37,910
that ordered you?

1122
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:42,430
Gong Yuanzhi.

1123
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:56,830
What do you want?

1124
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:59,790
You're so nervous.

1125
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,630
You and I have become enemies.

1126
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:04,670
You belong to Gong Ziyu.

1127
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,270
I belong to Gong Shangjue.

1128
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,110
So many people are watching.

1129
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,830
Why are you chatting with me?

1130
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:12,630
What are your plans?

1131
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:13,910
What do you mean?

1132
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:15,670
What should we do

1133
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:16,990
in three days

1134
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:19,110
when Gong Shangjue brings back

1135
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,350
the information about us?

1136
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:23,990
Watch them be proven wrong.

1137
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:25,830
What's there to be afraid of?

1138
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,990
Could it be

1139
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:29,950
that you're not Yun Weishan?

1140
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:31,550
Of course not.

1141
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,310
Han Yasi and I

1142
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,910
attacked Miss Yun in Lixi Town

1143
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:37,550
and I took her place.

1144
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:40,470
Then, you're in trouble.

1145
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,950
What about you?

1146
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,270
Are you really Shangguan Qian?

1147
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:48,910
Shangguan Qian from Dafu City?

1148
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:50,190
Yes.

1149
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,910
I am Shangguan Qian.

1150
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,750
Remember,

1151
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:59,070
no matter what happens,

1152
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,510
you must insist on your identiy.

1153
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,950
You are Yun Weishan

1154
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,590
from Lixi Town.

1155
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:10,190
Then why are you the Mei of Wufeng?

1156
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:13,190
As a member of the Wufeng,

1157
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,430
you really have naive trust

1158
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,110
in a stranger.

1159
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,470
Stranger?

1160
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,390
Who?

1161
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:25,510
Me.

1162
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:30,830
My family sent me to train in Wufeng since I was a child,

1163
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:33,750
but I always returned during New Years

1164
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,870
or the Lantern Festival

1165
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:36,670
and showed myself in public.

1166
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,430
I also took advantage of those days

1167
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:42,310
to do some blind dates with the city's rich families.

1168
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:43,870
The other days,

1169
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:46,310
my family would have a sickly maid

1170
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:47,470
pretend to be me

1171
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,030
and ask different doctors

1172
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,830
to take my pulse through a curtain.

1173
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:54,630
All kinds of prescriptions

1174
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,590
are brought to my house

1175
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:59,870
and piles of herbal residue are thrown out.

1176
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,110
Therefore,

1177
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,630
I can use the excuse of being sick

1178
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,430
to not leave the house

1179
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,750
and train in Wufeng.

1180
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,110
So,

1181
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:13,030
even if Gong Shangjue uses my portrait

1182
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:15,110
to throughout the city,

1183
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:17,750
he will only get one result.

1184
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:19,310
I

1185
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:20,990
am Shangguan Qian,

1186
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,630
a weak and sickly girl

1187
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:26,870
who doesn't like to go out.

1188
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:31,430
Then you can stay.

1189
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:34,190
I must go.

1190
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:36,630
I can't take the risk.

1191
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:38,950
What are you doing?

1192
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,430
Are you crazy?

1193
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,470
If I were you,

1194
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,310
I'd take a gamble.

1195
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,150
Gamble what?

1196
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:56,110
Gamble whether Wufeng has their hopes on you

1197
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:57,670
or has their hopes

1198
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:59,270
on Miss Zheng Nanyi

1199
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,830
who has already died after being exposed.

1200
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:02,990
What do you mean?

1201
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:05,550
With Miss Zheng Nanyi's skills

1202
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:08,190
and her idiotic brain,

1203
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:11,470
she'll at most be a Chi,

1204
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,510
just like you.

1205
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:16,670
Amazing.

1206
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,590
You insulted two people in one sentence.

1207
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:23,030
My mission is to get close to Gong Shangjue,

1208
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:25,390
while Miss Zheng Nanyi

1209
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:27,510
can only be completed by you now.

1210
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:31,750
If Wufeng doesn't want to break this connection,

1211
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,190
I think

1212
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:36,190
they will find a way

1213
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,790
to prove your identity in Lixi Town.

1214
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:40,830
For Wufeng,

1215
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,910
there's nothing they can't do

1216
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:45,270
as long as they want to.

1217
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:47,630
Remember what I said.

1218
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:49,550
No matter what,

1219
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,110
you must insist on your identiy.

1220
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,790
You are Yun Weishan

1221
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:56,870
from Lixi Town.

1222
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:31,470
What are you looking at?

1223
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:35,630
The pigeon brought back

1224
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:38,030
the investigation on Yun Weishan and Shangguan Qian

1225
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:38,990
early.

1226
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:41,430
Is it as you expected?

1227
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,470
Did you bring the hidden weapon?

1228
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,470
Yes.

1229
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:50,670
Let's go.
