00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Tell me.

5
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,940
Whose blood is this?

6
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,080
Young Master Shangjue.

7
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,289
This is what we found.

8
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,340
On the shoe soles, there's blood

9
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,110
and some shards of porcelain.

[Lasting Prosperity]

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,340
Shangguan Qian is Anonymous.

12
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,490
Why did she attack Lady Wuji?

13
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,110
Her target

14
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,680
is not Lady Wuji,

15
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,780
but me.

16
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,540
Young Master Ziyu

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,760
just happened to have sneaked out of the Gong residence at night

18
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,310
and Lady Wuji happened to have come to look for Young Master Ziyu.

19
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,329
That's why

20
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,360
Lady Wuji was implicated.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,990
Lady Wuji treats me as her family.

22
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,900
I'm suffering more than anyone from her bloody disaster.

23
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,850
Shangguan Qian is a member of your Jue residence.

24
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,740
You have to take the blame.

25
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,860
I was negligent in management

26
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:47,390
and gave the villain

27
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,530
a chance to kill.

28
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,560
I should be punished.

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,190
But you

30
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,070
ignored the rules of the Gong residence

31
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,700
and left the Gong residence with Yun Weishan without permission.

32
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,510
How should you be punished?

33
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,140
My negligence was unintentional,

34
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,640
but you knowingly violated the rules.

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,260
You knew that once you became the Sword Wielder,

36
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,630
you can't leave the Gong residence.

37
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,440
The rule is that I can't leave Jiuchen Valley.

38
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,030
Don't subtly try to change the concept.

39
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,200
As the Sword Wielder,

40
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,200
I think I have the right

41
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,670
to take my wife out.

42
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,250
When my father was the Sword Wielder,

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,560
he took my mother out to look at the festive lanterns.

44
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,900
Your father was the Sword Wielder,

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,829
so he had the right to take his wife on a trip.

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,760
But you didn't even pass the Trial of the Three Realms.

47
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,850
How dare you call yourself the Sword Wielder?

48
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,670
And you and Yun Weishan are not officially married.

49
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,079
How is she your wife?

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,730
It's only a matter of time before I become the Sword Wielder.

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,150
Enough.

52
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,500
Now that you're in the position of the Sword Wielder,

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,250
you should know the rules that the Sword Wielder has to abide by.

54
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,700
You took Yun Weishan out of the Gong residence

55
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,710
without asking the Council of Elders for permission.

56
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,160
And you're still making excuses.

57
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm really disappointed in you.

58
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,050
If you break the rules,

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,550
you should be punished.

60
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,320
Even if you're the Sword Wielder.

61
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,040
Later,

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
please go to the Council of Elders Hall's confinement room

63
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,590
and reflect on your mistakes.

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,210
Now is not the time to evaluate the right and wrong

65
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,490
of the Sword Wielder's actions.

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,680
The most important thing now

67
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,899
is to confirm if Shangguan Qian

68
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,960
is Anonymous.

69
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,590
She's indeed a suspect.

70
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,010
We need to interrogate her properly

71
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,030
in order to confirm it.

72
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,000
Elder Yue was killed.

73
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,230
The Jue residence promises to find out who Anonymous is.

74
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:35,800
During this period,

75
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,550
I've been suspecting that the killer was inside the Yu residence.

76
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,380
But now,

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,180
the suspect actually appeared in the Jue residence.

78
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,540
And

79
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,580
it's even the future bride

80
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,500
selected by Young Master Shangjue himself.

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,690
Gong Shangjue.

82
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,240
Don't you have anything to say?

83
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,370
Shangguan Qian has been detained in the prison.

84
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,880
Naturally, I'll interrogate her properly.

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,110
Also, you previously suspected Lady Wuji.

86
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,870
Now, her life is at stake.

87
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,460
Shouldn't you apologize for that?

88
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,930
It's still too early to apologize.

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,870
Shangguan Qian

90
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,150
might not be Anonymous.

91
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,770
We have solid evidence and a witness.

92
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
You still want to protect her?

93
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,820
Shangjue.

94
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,140
Did you

95
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,660
notice another problem?

96
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,700
There are two things that I'm puzzled by.

97
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,530
Firstly,

98
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,260
the blood left by Anonymous on the screen in Gong Ziyu's room

99
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,480
this time

100
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,350
was obviously left in a hurry.

101
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,220
She left

102
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,880
before the last stroke was finished.

103
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920
And from the time I entered the Yu residence

104
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,310
to the time I entered Gong Ziyu's room,

105
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,350
there were no suspicious figures

106
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,990
or unusual noises.

107
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,320
The person was able

108
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,830
to escape without a trace

109
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,430
in my presence.

110
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,320
There are few people

111
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,400
in the world

112
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,630
who possess such Lightness skills.

113
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,440
Shangguan Qian

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,600
doesn't have such great Lightness skills.

115
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,340
So she's not the person who wrote the words in blood.

116
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,130
Then are you saying the killer

117
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,260
can disappear into thin air?

118
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,910
The one who left the words in blood

119
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,420
either has superior Lightness skills

120
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:16,950
or

121
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,010
she didn't leave the room.

122
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,550
That's ridiculous.

123
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,340
You were the one who said

124
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,000
that only you and Lady Wuji were in my room.

125
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,270
Are you pointing out

126
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,990
that you are Anonymous?

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,850
Do you still suspect Lady Wuji?

128
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,580
This is ridiculous.

129
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,560
Young Master Shangjue.

130
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,690
I really want to agree with your guess.

131
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,960
But I checked Lady Wuji's wound.

132
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,310
Her wound was on her back.

133
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,480
The cut was extremely accurate.

134
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,880
Someone must have

135
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,370
secretly attacked her from behind.

136
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,010
The sword was stabbed in with one thrust.

137
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,110
It couldn't have been done by oneself.

138
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,030
Lady Wuji's wound is very deep

139
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,790
and narrow.

140
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:05,860
It means

141
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,310
that the killer used a thin and resilient sword.

142
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,740
It's a weapon that's commonly used by Wufeng.

143
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:13,870
Wrong.

144
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,970
There was only a soft sword with blood in the scene.

145
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,300
This soft sword was hidden in the belt.

146
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,590
This belt

147
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,360
belongs to Lady Wuji.

148
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,640
Isn't that even stranger?

149
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,430
Lady Wuji

150
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,800
stabbed herself with her sword?

151
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,420
Elder Yue, be patient.

152
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,810
The second puzzling point

153
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,350
is even stranger.

154
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,640
Everyone should remember

155
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,030
that when the former Elder Yue was killed,

156
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,970
the Meeting Hall

157
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,640
was neat and clean

158
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,180
and everything was in place.

159
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,909
With Elder Yue's superior skills,

160
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,130
the fact that she killed him in one move

161
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,630
shows that Anonymous is highly skilled.

162
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,400
However, when Lady Wuji, who has ordinary martial arts skills,

163
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,160
was assassinated,

164
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,000
the room became a huge mess because of the fight.

165
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,980
If Shangguan Qian

166
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,410
had such a hard time dealing with Lady Wuji,

167
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,100
how could she have

168
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,590
killed Elder Yue in one move?

169
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,400
Right now, our conjecture is

170
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,240
that since the person could approach Elder Yue

171
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,150
easily in the Council of Elders Hall,

172
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,550
it must be someone who's close to Elder Yue.

173
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,260
But Shangguan Qian

174
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,160
is only a bride who just entered the Gong residence.

175
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,440
How could she have gone in and out of the Council of Elders Hall freely?

176
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,770
Even if she had a reason to approach Elder Yue,

177
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,130
Elder Yue wouldn't be defenseless.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,860
Then why did Shangguan Qian

179
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,760
wander around in black clothes

180
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,710
and head to the Yu residence?

181
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,020
We don't know about that for now.

182
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,930
But I'll know the answer soon.

183
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,820
Young Master Shangjue, I hope you

184
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,570
won’t show mercy

185
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,700
just because she's the bride you chose.

186
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,200
I will definitely give all the elders an explanation.

187
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:03,780
But

188
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,560
I’m curious about one thing.

189
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,120
How did Elder Hua know

190
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,180
that the person in black clothes is a woman

191
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,170
and that she's injured,

192
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,260
and ordered

193
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,680
for all residences to be searched?

194
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,390
Um...

195
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,760
Who are you?

196
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,740
There is no woman with such martial arts skills like you in the Gong residence.

197
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,630
It was because the Yellow Jade Guardian by my side

198
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,640
encountered a suspicious person.

199
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,060
During the fight,

200
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,830
judging from her voice and figure,

201
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,890
he determined that she was a woman.

202
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,100
I see.

203
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,180
Since Shangguan Qian has been imprisoned,

204
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,640
we'll wait for the result of her interrogation.

205
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,600
Anonymous appeared again.

206
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,270
Lady Wuji was attacked.

207
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,260
The Gong residence is now heavily guarded.

208
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,610
I can't come here for the time being.

209
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,130
My return date is uncertain.

210
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,150
I'll resume with the unfinished research

211
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,410
when I come back.

212
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,060
If it's urgent,

213
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,110
you can fly this gold leaf kite in the air.

214
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,730
I'll come to you as soon as I see it.

215
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,840
Don't worry.

216
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,240
From Xiaohei.

217
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,500
Who will miss you?

218
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,820
You're not Jin Fan.

219
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,290
The servants just informed

220
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,380
that the elders locked up the Sword Wielder in the confinement room

221
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,100
to get him to reflect on his mistakes.

222
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,930
He won't be back tonight.

223
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,110
Miss Yun, he asked me to tell you

224
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,190
to rest early.

225
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,290
Don't worry about him.

226
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,250
If I hadn't suggested to leave the Gong residence...

227
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,840
Don't blame yourself, Miss Yun.

228
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,390
It was also the Sword Wielder's decision

229
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,420
to leave the Gong residence.

230
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,030
He has accepted

231
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,320
the punishment willingly.

232
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,770
I'm just telling you what he said verbatim.

233
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,930
It doesn't represent my personal opinion.

234
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,510
Young Master Ziyu doesn't blame me.

235
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,720
But I know

236
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,030
you must have resentment towards me.

237
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,900
Miss Yun, you shouldn't have wandered around indeed.

238
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,500
Not only did you make Young Master Ziyu worried,

239
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,720
but also caused trouble.

240
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm sorry.

241
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,640
You don't need to apologize to me.

242
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,160
I'm just a Green Jade Guardian.

243
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,320
I can't afford it.

244
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,840
I just hope that...

245
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,360
you wouldn't let the Sword Wielder down from now on.

246
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,370
He...

247
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,190
is a foolishly good person.

248
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,920
Rest early, Miss Yun.

249
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,670
Wait.

250
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,200
Have you found the injured woman

251
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,120
after searching the residence tonight?

252
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,340
Yes.

253
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,180
It's Shangguan Qian.

254
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,260
The wine bowls are still full.

255
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,650
It seems

256
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,830
that it hasn't gone that far yet.

257
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,210
You've endured the whipping and clamping.

258
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,890
But...

259
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,770
this is just the beginning.

260
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,050
The razor in my hand

261
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,330
is durable and sharp.

262
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,420
It was forged by the Gong family's hidden weapon forging technique.

263
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,800
This razor is called

264
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,110
the Cicada Razor.

265
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,940
It can cut every piece of meat

266
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,560
into slices as thin as a cicada's wing.

267
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,880
Just slicing a leg

268
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,850
would take an entire day.

269
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,880
It's worse than death.

270
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,720
And this mask.

271
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,020
Such a beautiful face.

272
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,980
What a pity.

273
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,670
And this bowl of wine.

274
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,810
The razor and mask just now

275
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,510
are not worth mentioning

276
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,920
when compared to Brother Yuanzhi's poison wine.

277
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,300
So,

278
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,950
are you going to confess?

279
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,520
Trust me.

280
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,370
You won't be able to take it.

281
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,630
As long as you tell the truth,

282
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,070
I promise you won't suffer.

283
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,120
Can you keep me alive?

284
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,260
I promise you won't suffer.

285
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,650
If I tell you,

286
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,540
would you believe me?

287
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,460
Just tell me your perspective.

288
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,930
I'll make the judgment myself.

289
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,480
I'm not a Wufeng assassin,

290
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,580
nor am I the so-called Anonymous

291
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,660
who you're talking about.

292
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,090
But

293
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,790
I'm not the daughter from the Shangguan family indeed.

294
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,560
Then,

295
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,650
who are you?

296
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,670
An orphan of the Gushan Sect.

297
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,950
I entered the Gong residence

298
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,890
to protect myself.

299
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,700
The Gushan Sect?

300
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,120
Yes.

301
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,170
Back then, Zhuo Mei from Qingfeng Sect

302
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,130
fell in love with my uncle,

303
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,280
which met with strong opposition

304
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,400
from the Qingfeng Sect Leader, Dianzhu.

305
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,890
To force the Gushan Sect to hand over my uncle,

306
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,970
Dianzhu, who was already seeking refuge with Wufeng,

307
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,960
led the Wufeng assassins

308
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,660
to Gushan Sect

309
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,240
and wiped the sect out.

310
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,140
The entire Gushan Sect was wiped out.

311
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,090
I've never heard

312
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,339
that there were any Gushan Sect descendants who survived.

313
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,589
My father hid me in the secret tunnel.

314
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,300
That's how I survived.

315
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,150
Later, I wandered around

316
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,329
and was homeless.

317
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,740
Fortunately, I was saved by the Shangguan family

318
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,609
and they raised me.

319
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,530
The Shangguan family didn't want their daughter to marry into the Gong family.

320
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,090
In order to repay them

321
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,720
for raising me,

322
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,040
and for myself,

323
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,900
I pretended to be Shangguan Qian

324
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,620
and got married in her stead.

325
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,840
I swore

326
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,720
that I'd avenge my father

327
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,040
and my sect.

328
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,190
On the Lantern Festival that year,

329
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,410
I ran into a gangster.

330
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,130
You were the one who saved me.

331
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,530
That's why I came up with the plan to enter the Gong residence

332
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,360
to have someone to rely on.

333
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,150
Only with the power of the Gong family

334
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,210
can I take revenge.

335
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,330
Then what does this have to do with

336
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,080
you trying to assassinate Gong Ziyu?

337
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Gong Ziyu?

338
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,280
My target was Wuji.

339
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,050
Why?

340
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,520
Because I heard that day

341
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,570
that you suspected that Wuji is Anonymous.

342
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,500
And every one from Wufeng

343
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,820
is my enemy.

344
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,370
When I went to the Yu residence,

345
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,300
I saw Wuji in Gong Ziyu's room.

346
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
So I observed her from behind the window.

347
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,050
But I saw

348
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,920
that Wuji had a soft sword in her hand.

349
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,230
That sword was thin and tough.

350
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,760
It's no different from the sword that people from Wufeng usually used.

351
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,660
So I was sure

352
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,440
that Wuji is Anonymous.

353
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,400
But I was discovered by Wuji.

354
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,770
She's stronger than me in terms of martial arts skills.

355
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,040
Since she's stronger than you in terms of martial arts skills,

356
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,340
why

357
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,470
was she still stabbed by you?

358
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,980
Wuji did it herself.

359
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,640
She deliberately let the sword escape from her hand

360
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,110
and I grabbed it,

361
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,090
and she charged towards me to get stabbed.

362
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,670
You mean

363
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,190
she got stabbed on purpose?

364
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,800
Yes.

365
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,120
Is everything you said

366
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,480
true?

367
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,190
It's

368
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,130
all true.

369
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,060
Do you really want me

370
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,090
to torture you?

371
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,700
Everything I said

372
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,710
is true.

373
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,740
I'm not afraid of your torture.

374
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,410
I have proof that I'm from the Gushan Sect.

375
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,790
Untie me.

376
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,790
I'll prove it to you.

377
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,910
I'm already seriously injured.

378
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,310
If you are even afraid of me in this state,

379
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,380
you don’t deserve your reputation in the martial world.

380
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,260
Prove it.

381
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,720
♫You whisper loving words in my ear♫

382
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:04,180
♫Yet we have no choice but to part♫

383
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,100
♫I hold the blade in my hand♫

384
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,720
♫And slice through the night♫

385
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,010
Are you feeling better?

386
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,280
Brother.

387
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,640
I'm fine.

388
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,390
Did you find anything out from interrogating Shangguan Qian?

389
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,630
Brother, tell me.

390
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,670
Did Shangguan Qian confess?

391
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,370
Although she didn't poison the porridge last night,

392
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,210
I still don't believe her.

393
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,570
She told me she's not from Wufeng,

394
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,860
nor is she Anonymous.

395
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,850
Brother.

396
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,630
Do you trust her this much?

397
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,870
Shangguan Qian

398
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,870
has the birthmark of the Gushan Sect on her body.

399
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,090
This birthmark

400
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,250
represents the bloodline of the Gushan Sect.

401
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,860
There is a clear record of this in their family record.

402
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,200
Although the Gushan Sect has been wiped out,

403
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,900
there are relevant files

404
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,270
in the Gong residence.

405
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,210
I have reviewed them and verified it already.

406
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,740
Gushan Sect?

407
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,030
The descendants of Gushan Sect may still be from Wufeng.

408
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,370
Over these years,

409
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,860
there have been many righteous sects in the martial world that have fallen and joined Wufeng.

410
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,870
Indeed.

411
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,190
That's why I need to wait until Wuji wakes up

412
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,020
to hear what she has to say.

413
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,550
After all, there are so many puzzling points

414
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,860
that still can't be explained.

415
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,440
I don't trust Shangguan Qian,

416
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,900
but I don't trust Wuji even more.

417
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,050
You shouldn't believe

418
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,750
what she says.

419
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:21,870
Young Master Yuanzhi.

420
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,710
Young Master.

421
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,080
Lady Wuji is awake.

422
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:28,960
Brother.

423
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,590
I'll go with you.

424
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,110
No need.

425
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,430
Focus on your recuperation first.

426
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,270
Whether it's Shangguan Qian or Wuji,

427
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,870
I have my own plans.

428
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,480
Jin Fu, lead the way.

429
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,720
Lady Wuji.

430
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,710
You're awake.

431
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,180
Anonymous' target

432
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,050
was actually me.

433
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,280
I was the one

434
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,260
who implicated you.

435
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,200
I'm glad you weren't there.

436
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,040
At my age,

437
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,340
it's no big deal if I die.

438
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,530
But you still have to be responsible for the future of the Gong family.

439
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,130
Lady Wuji.

440
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,030
Calm down.

441
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,220
Luckily, Anonymous from last night

442
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,090
has been caught.

443
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,320
They are interrogating her now.

444
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,420
You've been avenged.

445
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,800
They've caught Anonymous?

446
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,790
Yes.

447
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,420
It's Shangguan Qian.

448
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,930
I heard you woke up,

449
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,400
so I came to visit you, Lady Wuji.

450
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,600
Thank you.

451
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,040
May I ask

452
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,120
if you remember

453
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,520
what happened last night?

454
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,010
Lady Wuji just woke up.

455
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,430
Her head isn't clear yet.

456
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,790
The doctor will determine

457
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,650
whether her head is clear or not.

458
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,940
Lady Wuji,

459
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,860
do you remember anything?

460
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,190
I also want to know

461
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,570
what happened.

462
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,960
A few days ago,

463
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,270
a small batch of fox fur arrived.

464
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,080
At night,

465
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,480
I wanted to get you to pick one

466
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,710
to make a cloak for you.

467
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,770
But Ziyu wasn't around.

468
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,800
Just now, Ziyu told me

469
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,640
he caught Shangguan Qian.

470
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,050
I didn't expect her

471
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,990
to be Anonymous.

472
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,330
She's not Anonymous.

473
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,330
She's not Anonymous?

474
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,800
Have you interrogated her?

475
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,410
If she weren't Anonymous,

476
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,350
why did she sneak into Yu Lineage

477
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,230
and stab Lady Wuji?

478
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,670
Shangguan Qian said

479
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,500
she heard our conversation during the day.

480
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,280
So she wanted to test Lady Wuji

481
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,410
and see

482
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,840
if she was Anonymous.

483
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,110
Ridiculous.

484
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,530
Is this

485
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,230
the soft sword you hid in your belt, Lady Wuji?

486
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:49,690
Yes.

487
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,770
Lady Wuji,

488
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,510
were you hurt by this soft sword?

489
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,800
When I arrived at the Yu Lineage,

490
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,240
I found the blood on the wall.

491
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,020
Shangguan Qian arrived

492
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,390
before I could call for help.

493
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,540
She attacked me

494
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,540
without any reason.

495
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,380
I can only draw my soft sword to fight the enemy.

496
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,180
I was no match for her.

497
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,400
She snatched my soft sword

498
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,620
and stabbed me in the back.

499
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,880
But Shangguan Qian said

500
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,860
she was no match for you.

501
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,210
It was you

502
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,180
who purposely ran into

503
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,300
this soft sword.

504
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:34,860
Enough.

505
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,250
Shangguan Qian was caught red-handed.

506
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,720
It's fine if you don't suspect her.

507
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,220
But you easily trusted

508
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,140
the nonsensical words

509
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,280
of a desperate prisoner.

510
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,240
This is not the brain

511
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,340
you should have, Gong Shangjue.

512
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,080
My father used to love to say,

513
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,420
"If one's not stupid, one must be evil."

514
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,100
I don't think you're stupid.

515
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,510
During the day,

516
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,050
I only just mentioned that Lady Wuji

517
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,850
might be Anonymous.

518
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,500
On that very night,

519
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,030
Anonymous attempted to assassinate her.

520
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,270
Isn't this

521
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,200
too coincidental?

522
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,110
Actually, this soft sword

523
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,000
can prove that

524
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,110
Lady Wuji isn't Anonymous.

525
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,360
What do you mean?

526
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,420
Elder Yue’s wound was thin and narrow.

527
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,510
But the width of this sword

528
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,150
is obviously longer than the width of Elder Yue’s wound.

529
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,880
So,

530
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,580
this sword is not the weapon used to kill Elder Yue.

531
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,890
And I think

532
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,950
there should be no reason

533
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,130
for Anonymous to change weapons

534
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,420
when they killed Elder Yue.

535
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,100
You're right.

536
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,950
But...

537
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,740
How did you know

538
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,430
how narrow Elder Yue’s wound was?

539
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,420
Unless

540
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,130
you're very familiar with

541
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,560
the murder weapon

542
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,960
we're looking for.

543
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,720
I told her about it.

544
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,880
When you were not here,

545
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,500
we were talking about this.

546
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,420
I told her

547
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,240
Master Yue

548
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,630
was killed by Wufeng's thin sword.

549
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,850
Shangguan Qian is indeed an orphan of the Gushan Sect.

550
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,610
The birthmark of the bloodline can't be faked.

551
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,420
With the previous inference,

552
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,730
it is enough to prove that

553
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,560
Shangguan Qian is not Anonymous.

554
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,700
Since she's not Anonymous,

555
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,350
then...

556
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,540
who left the words

557
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,850
on the screen?

558
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,770
I'm afraid the real Anonymous

559
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,710
hid in the dark

560
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,130
and deliberately left the blood writing

561
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,690
to confuse the witnesses

562
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,100
and cause panic.

563
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,360
Shangguan Qian

564
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,260
injured Lady Wuji.

565
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,850
But her action was understandable.

566
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,730
The torture she

567
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,110
received in prison

568
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,320
will be considered her punishment.

569
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,550
Can we

570
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,710
release her now?

571
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,900
Her background

572
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,730
is really pitiful.

573
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,000
The former leader of the Gushan Sect

574
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,170
was loyal and righteous.

575
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,090
It was also a rare sect in the martial world

576
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,330
who always supported the Gong family.

577
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,850
But in the end, they were killed

578
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,170
by the Qingfeng Sect and Wufeng.

579
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,340
Since

580
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,070
this is a misunderstanding,

581
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,160
I think

582
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,380
we can let her out.

583
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,950
Shangguan Qian

584
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,970
belongs to Jue Lineage.

585
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,750
Shangjue,

586
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,210
handle it yourself.

587
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,060
Yes.

588
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,620
Right now, Anonymous

589
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,100
is still at large.

590
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,880
I'm afraid they will continue to create trouble.

591
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:45,950
Should we

592
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,830
consider activating the Infinite Heat

593
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,330
to threaten Wufeng

594
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,520
and ensure the safety of the Gong family?

595
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,060
No!

596
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:00,570
No.

597
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,050
This

598
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,250
is not a good idea.

599
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,139
Elder Xue,

600
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,550
what is

601
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,630
the Infinite Heat?

602
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,449
Why have I never heard of it?

603
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,909
You will know about it

604
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,989
once you pass all three trials.

605
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,449
Sword Wielder, you should start

606
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,630
working on the second trial soon.

607
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,290
I'm here to visit Miss Shangguan Qian.

608
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,820
Young Master Shangjue,

609
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,840
Miss Shangguan is seriously injured.

610
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,420
Fortunately, it’s only external.

611
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,570
I prescribed some medicine and ointment.

612
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,430
She'll be fine after half a month of rest.

613
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:06,980
Okay.

614
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,580
You may leave.

615
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,720
Yes.

616
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,340
Looks like

617
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,000
you still showed mercy.

618
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,090
The fine brew I made

619
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,890
remains unutilized.

620
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:23,820
No hurry.

621
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,490
We'll use them eventually.

622
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,690
Not now,

623
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,360
nor on Shangguan Qian.

624
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,240
Sir.

625
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,200
Young Master Yuanzhi.

626
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,170
Miss Yun Weishan is here.

627
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,680
She said she wanted to visit Miss Shangguan Qian.

628
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,970
Hmm.

629
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,610
Let her in.

630
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:47,700
Yes.

631
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,240
Wait.

632
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,700
Did she bring anything?

633
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,010
Yes.

634
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,290
She brought a brocade box.

635
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,590
Stop.

636
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,860
Recently,

637
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,490
there are a lot of incidents in the Gong residence.

638
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,690
The Jue Lineage is heavily guarded.

639
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:17,990
My brother has ordered

640
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,020
to check everything that goes in and out

641
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,460
of the Jue Lineage.

642
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,990
Miss Yun.

643
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,030
Please open the box.

644
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,600
Hey.

645
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,910
Leave the box.

646
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,590
It's just an empty box.

647
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:52,940
Leave it.

648
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,480
Are you okay?

649
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,850
It's nothing serious.

650
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,880
Thank you for your concern.

651
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,320
Shangguan, your hands and feet are so cold.

652
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,460
It seems that your body is still weak.

653
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,280
I brought some ginseng for you.

654
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,170
I passed it to the servants.

655
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,170
The ginseng is of high quality.

656
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,570
It will help with your recovery.

657
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,010
Remember to eat it.

658
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,970
Thank you, Sister Yun.

659
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,630
I didn't expect you to be

660
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,280
an orphan of the Gushan Sect.

661
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,520
Is Lady Wuji really Anonymous?

662
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,000
Yes.

663
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,060
It seems that we're connected by fate.

664
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,590
I heard that your master is

665
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,750
Zhuo Mei.

666
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,190
You live in the Yu Lineage,

667
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,140
you spent the longest time with Wuji.

668
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,400
I don't believe you didn't suspect her.

669
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,230
It really is fate.

670
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,880
And now, we meet each other here.

671
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,600
What a coincidence.

672
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,560
I hope we can spend more time together in the future.

673
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,230
My family was destroyed and I was alone.

674
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,990
All these years,

675
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,470
I have no one to share my thoughts with.

676
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,700
Whether you really don't know or are playing dumb,

677
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,010
Wufeng's spies

678
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,560
won't interfere with each other.

679
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,510
If you don't mind,

680
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,610
you can come to me often.

681
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,780
Have a good rest.

682
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,880
I won't bother you.

683
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,780
I'll visit you again.

684
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:10,470
Brother.

685
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,400
Are you still worried about Anonymous?

686
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,710
Anonymous did not complete

687
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,010
the final stroke on the wall.

688
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,230
Obviously, they stopped when someone came.

689
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,590
If this person could come and go without a trace right under my nose,

690
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,540
I'm afraid the whole Gong family

691
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,030
is no match for Anonymous.

692
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,670
I've brought Yun Weishan's brocade box.

693
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,300
It's ginseng inside.

694
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:45,930
Shall I check it?

695
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:47,920
Yes.

696
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,370
Check both the ginseng

697
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,620
and the brocade box.

698
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,760
That's my brother.

699
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,980
I've packed the luggage for tomorrow.

700
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,770
Do you have anything else for me?

701
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,260
We haven't caught Anonymous yet.

702
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,100
I think Gong Shangjue

703
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,650
is still eyeing Lady Wuji.

704
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,750
When I'm not around,

705
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,490
you must protect Lady Wuji.

706
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,470
Don't give him the chance

707
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,100
to slander Lady Wuji again.

708
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,870
Understood.

709
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,330
That aside,

710
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,060
did you find anything

711
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,000
in Housekeeper Jia's house?

712
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,550
Housekeeper Jia's wife and child have moved away

713
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,030
one month before

714
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,120
the former Sword Wielder and Young Lord were killed.

715
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,890
What's more suspicious is...

716
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,100
According to the neighbors,

717
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,900
someone looked for his wife

718
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,320
and child before us.

719
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,200
Was it someone working for Gong Shangjue?

720
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,630
I think so.

721
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,350
The two people who came

722
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,460
also asked

723
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,390
why

724
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,270
Old Man Jia's family moved away.

725
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,860
Their family

726
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,700
moved away before the Laba Festival.

727
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,130
It seems that they moved away before the former Sword Wielder was killed.

728
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,110
There was another strange thing.

729
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,440
What?

730
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,080
Do they have any relatives?

731
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,720
They seldom have contact.

732
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,100
Because of their son.

733
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,410
People around here

734
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,780
were afraid of him.

735
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,090
What's wrong with his son?

736
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,700
Old Man Jia

737
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,860
got a son at such an old age.

738
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,040
He was very happy.

739
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,710
But two years ago,

740
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,890
his son suddenly got seriously ill.

741
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,490
No one could cure him.

742
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,020
They almost prepared a coffin for the kid.

743
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,220
Later, a physician from the Gong family cured him.

744
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,460
He came back to life?

745
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,320
The child

746
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,820
was cured, yes.

747
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,810
But since then,

748
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,310
he became a little weird.

749
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,180
How so?

750
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,900
That kid

751
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,050
became very strong

752
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,450
all of a sudden.

753
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,450
When he was playing with other kids,

754
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,840
he shoved

755
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,650
a little girl away

756
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,940
by a couple of meters.

757
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,520
Her head bled from the shove.

758
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,500
Isn't it scary?

759
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,900
So scary!

760
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,950
Housekeeper Jia's son was seriously ill.

761
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,740
In the end, he was cured by a physician from the Gong family.

762
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,540
But after he recovered,

763
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,320
he became very strong.

764
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,710
Keep investigating.

765
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,940
Understood.

766
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,340
We're already in the wild, right?

767
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,400
Yes.

768
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,410
It smells like grass.

769
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,400
I can smell the moisture in the wind.

770
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,370
We must have

771
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,870
left the secret tunnel.

772
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,280
Lord Sword Wielder.

773
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,320
We're here.

774
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,100
You can take off your blindfold now.

775
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,460
Elder Yue.

776
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,970
This is not the front hill.

777
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:29,880
So,

778
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,360
just call me Young Master Yue.

779
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,040
Young Master Ziyu, please come with me.

780
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,870
[Jue]

781
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:19,890
Young Master Yuanzhi.

782
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,120
Are you disappointed I'm not my brother?

783
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,090
Don't pretend to be pitiful.

784
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,990
My brother can't see it.

785
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,930
Young Master Yuanzhi, you must be joking.

786
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,310
Look at my wounds.

787
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,310
Do I look like I'm pretending?

788
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,680
Are you hoping that

789
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,140
if my brother sees you

790
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,710
looking so miserable,

791
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,350
he'll take care of you?

792
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,440
I know my place.

793
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,600
I've been injured for so long.

794
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,780
Young Master Shangjue has never visited me.

795
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,080
Unlike when you were injured,

796
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,900
Young Master Shangjue was always by your side.

797
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,120
I'm his brother.

798
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,690
You cannot even begin to imagine

799
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:05,480
the bond we have growing up.

800
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,870
If one day,

801
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,170
Young Master Shangjue would care for me

802
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,710
even a tiny bit as much as he cares for you,

803
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:16,990
I'll be satisfied.

804
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,490
I don't think you're the kind

805
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:21,750
to be satisfied so easily.

806
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,580
There is a word carved

807
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,040
between your eyebrows.

808
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,900
Greed?

809
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,790
Or ambition?

810
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,730
Wufeng.

811
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:48,250
Yuanzhi.

812
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:50,400
I heard from the servants that

813
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,700
you came here.

814
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,820
Don't worry, Young Master Shangjue.

815
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,240
Young Master Yuanzhi didn't disturb my rest.

816
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,030
He just came to check on my injuries.

817
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:03,900
I didn't say

818
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,110
he was disturbing you.

819
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,240
I didn't say

820
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:09,740
I was here to check on you either.

821
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,250
Why don't you take your medicine?

822
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,900
Thank you.

823
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:02,840
Yuanzhi.

824
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,210
Yuanzhi?

825
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,500
Why are you drinking alone?

826
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,310
Wine is not medicine.

827
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:38,550
Of course I drink it alone.

828
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,170
Should I wait for someone to feed me instead?

829
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,250
You're angry about that?

830
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,370
Young Master.

831
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,230
Young Master Yuanzhi.

832
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,350
News from the base of the valley,

833
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,620
about the thief on the night of the Lantern Festival.

834
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,420
Brother, you were right.

835
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,100
That night, the thief did not steal Yun Weishan's things

836
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,740
by coincidence.

837
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,520
It was indeed to distract Gong Ziyu.

838
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,590
The thief is a habitual offender of Jiuchen Valley.

839
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,730
According to him,

840
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,790
Miss Ziyi instructed him to do so.

841
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,610
Ziyi?

842
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,360
I can't believe Yun Weishan went to meet her.

843
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,300
Did she not find her dirty?

844
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,200
Have you investigated Ziyi?

845
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,260
Yes.

846
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,730
Her original name is Ye Xiao.

847
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,620
Her parents and brother used to be slaves of a wealthy merchant in Jiangnan.

848
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,630
Then, they were sent to the human hunting range.

849
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,950
What's that?

850
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,300
It's a game for the leisure and rich.

851
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,860
They put people in the forest

852
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,160
and hunt them like animals.

853
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,290
Her father and brother died in the hunting range.

854
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,230
So the human trafficker sold her to Wanhua Pavilion

855
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,020
and named her Ziyi.

856
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,170
She is also a pitiful person.

857
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,380
So Yun Weishan

858
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,680
went to see her

859
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,790
because she was jealous?

860
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,330
Of course not.

861
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,670
If she were just jealous,

862
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,790
there was no need to

863
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,530
fake the theft

864
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,140
and distract Gong Ziyu.

865
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,790
Yun Weishan is Gong Ziyu's legitimate wife.

866
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,440
If she wanted to establish her place,

867
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,870
she should have

868
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,300
brought Gong Ziyu with her.

869
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:38,810
Send two jade guardians

870
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:40,720
to keep watch in the Wanhua Pavilion.

871
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:41,880
Yes.

872
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:11,990
Elder Yue,

873
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,950
what is the content of the Second Realm's trial?

874
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,490
No hurry.

875
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,400
I have a few questions

876
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,360
to ask Miss Yun first.

877
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:22,290
Ask her?

878
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,450
Shouldn't it be me?

879
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:26,600
Elder Yue,

880
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,870
if you have any questions,

881
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,070
please go ahead.

882
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,960
The boat has docked.

883
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,560
[Gong residence back hill - Yue residence]

884
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,310
Let's go ashore first.

885
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,360
[Air Frost]

886
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:40,460
[New Snow]
