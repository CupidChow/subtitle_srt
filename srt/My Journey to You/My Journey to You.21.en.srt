[My Journey to You]

3
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,100
[Episode 21]

4
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,370
You drew this map of the Gong Residence, right?

5
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,370
There's your handwriting on it.

6
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,660
It's no use denying it.

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,990
I did draw this map of the Gong Residence.

8
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,110
But it was only because when I first got here,

9
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,750
I couldn't tell the direction.

10
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,420
I couldn't even tell east from west.

11
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,630
The layout of the Gong Residence is complicated.

12
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,490
So I randomly noted it down

13
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,270
for easy access.

14
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,310
You noted it down randomly?

15
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,880
How do you explain

16
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,500
the words behind it then?

17
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,150
There are 47 posts in the Gong Residence.

18
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,650
They are on alert day and night.

19
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,100
From 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.

20
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,250
From 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.

21
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,420
From 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.

22
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,020
The guards take turns keeping watch.

23
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,960
There are two secret tunnels in the Gong Residence.

24
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,180
One secret tunnel

25
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,150
leads to the back hill,

26
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,990
and the other

27
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,180
leads to Jiuchen Valley.

28
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,060
Wufeng can send their elite

29
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,920
to sneak in from here.

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,050
It's indeed for easy access.

31
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,700
However, it's for Wufeng's easy access.

32
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,980
At this point,

33
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,860
are you still trying to deny it?

34
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,280
Wufeng's spies

35
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,240
must be killed.

36
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,829
Execute her immediately right here.

37
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,990
Don't help me, Sword Wielder.

38
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,220
I lied to you.

39
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,700
I'm indeed Wufeng's spy.

40
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,160
Yun.

41
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,100
You...

42
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,640
Why did you leave?

43
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,840
She was going to send messages out.

44
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,040
Of course she had to leave.

45
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,110
Yun.

46
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,770
Are you really leaving?

47
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,120
You once asked me

48
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,140
what is something you can give me.

49
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,890
Actually, from the beginning,

50
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,670
what I wanted the most

51
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,390
is freedom.

52
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,290
No matter it's Wufeng

53
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,330
or the Gong Residence,

54
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,800
to me,

55
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,090
they are both surrounded by high walls,

56
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,240
and places of shackles.

57
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,550
Young Master Ziyu.

58
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,640
I've wronged your love for me.

59
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,940
From now on,

60
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,500
think of me as gone.

61
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,240
Take care.

62
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,810
But you are free now.

63
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,700
You can leave Wufeng,

64
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,030
find a quiet place,

65
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,970
find a reliable person,

66
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,750
and spend the rest of your life with him.

67
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,190
I won't look for

68
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,420
someone to spend my life with.

69
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,930
I've already found him.

70
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,700
Send the guards immediately

71
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,790
and lock down Jiuchen Valley.

72
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,660
No one is allowed to leave the valley.

73
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,850
Hunt Yun Weishan down.

74
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,580
Go after her!

75
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,680
Who dares?

76
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,250
You just let a Wufeng assassin go.

77
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,310
And you're standing in our way now?

78
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,810
Who do you think you are?

79
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,180
I'm ordering you as the Sword Wielder of the Gong family

80
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:00,860
to back off.

81
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,690
What did you say?

82
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,320
The Sword Wielder of the Gong family

83
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,950
won't repeat his words.

84
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,610
The saber Elder Hua was holding

85
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,350
is one of the six sabers

86
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,900
from the Saber Tomb of the Hua Residence.

87
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,340
I've hacked it off.

88
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,920
Therefore,

89
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,200
I've officially passed the trial of the third realm.

90
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,930
I've legitimately become

91
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,700
the Sword Wielder of the Gong family.

92
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,860
We'll definitely

93
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,280
obey your order, Sword Wielder.

94
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,420
No one

95
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,600
shall pursue Yun Weishan in the future.

96
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,840
The Sword Wielder won't repeat his words.

97
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,050
Yes.

98
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,610
Yun.

99
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,320
I finally did it.

100
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,820
You're finally free.

101
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,560
Flowers wither away,

102
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,980
and their fragrance fades.

103
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,450
Throughout the ages,

104
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,640
many people have written poems and songs

105
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,850
for fallen flowers

106
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,340
as expression of sadness.

107
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,250
But what they don't know is that

108
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,510
perhaps being free to bloom

109
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,790
and wither

110
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,230
is the flowers' fate

111
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,620
and wish.

112
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,470
Sword Wielder.

113
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,670
Don't be too sad.

114
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,160
I'm not sad.

115
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,780
I'm happy

116
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,330
that she finally gained freedom.

117
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,610
Hurry up and move the stuff.

118
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,300
These goods are to be delivered

119
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,600
to Wanhua Pavilion.

120
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,410
They are all cosmetics.

121
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,780
Be careful with them.

122
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,820
These are precious herbs.

123
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,900
Plus those over there,

124
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,390
all the goods will be ready.

125
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,260
Their footsteps are steady.

126
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,950
The bottoms of their trousers are clean

127
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,960
without any mud stain from goods delivery.

128
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,620
Chi, Mei, Wang, and Liang.

129
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,740
The higher the level, the stronger they are.

130
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,960
Those who operate daily actions

131
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,570
are of level Chi and Mei.

132
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,720
While the level of Wang

133
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,110
sounds like Wang, the character with the meaning of king.

134
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,690
And there are four of them.

135
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,460
So,

136
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,620
they are called Four Kings

137
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,510
within Wufeng.

138
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,500
The four of them don't interfere in each other's business,

139
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,730
and they each dominate one direction

140
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,470
with independent jurisdiction.

141
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,550
What about Liang?

142
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,120
Of course there are two of them.

143
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,500
But no one knows

144
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,920
their names and identities.

145
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,840
In fact,

146
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,500
no one even knows if Liang really exists.

147
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,330
So even you haven't seen it?

148
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,780
I've only seen

149
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,820
three of the Wangs.

150
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,390
[True Heart True Medicine]

151
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,540
Lead the way.

152
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,830
What are you talking about?

153
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,330
I don't know you.

154
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,100
Stop pretending.

155
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,990
Take us to Wanhua Pavilion.

156
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,550
Young Master Hua.

157
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,359
Who wants to see me, you or Elder Hua?

158
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,400
I've heard about Miss Yun.

159
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,579
I also heard that

160
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,700
you hacked off the old man's saber in just a few moves.

161
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,480
It seems that

162
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,120
my Heart Frost Saber is quite powerful.

163
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,690
The strongest saber

164
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,520
is never about the edge of killing,

165
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,970
but the blade of protection.

166
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,380
When you swung that saber,

167
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,180
the person you were trying to protect

168
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,840
must be very important to you.

169
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,190
Not just very.

170
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,220
She's the most important.

171
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,230
No matter what,

172
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,320
I must protect her.

173
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,310
When I was forging the saber,

174
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,870
I already figured it out that

175
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,690
the trial of the third realm

176
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,550
couldn't be about cold-blooded sacrifice.

177
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,570
The words carved on the stone were fake.

178
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,490
What you wanted me to do

179
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,630
is giving up the sacrifice.

180
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,120
Right?

181
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,710
You guessed it right.

182
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,240
The primary responsibility of the Sword Wielder of the Gong family

183
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,160
is to protect everyone in the Gong family

184
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,490
and all the people in Jiuchen Valley.

185
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,870
If a person is willing to sacrifice others

186
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,250
just to win,

187
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,790
someone that selfish and cold-blooded

188
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,680
doesn't deserve to be the leader of the Gong family.

189
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,880
But

190
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,120
those who made it through the trial,

191
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,300
including my older brother and Gong Shangjue,

192
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,100
all left Hua Residence alone.

193
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,720
If they did give up the sacrifice,

194
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,300
where did their guards go?

195
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,310
They were left in the back hill

196
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,930
to be taught higher-level martial arts skills.

197
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,000
They got special training to become Red Jade Guardians.

198
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,180
I see.

199
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,690
[Three Forms of Mirror Flower]

200
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,480
Three Forms of Mirror Flower.

201
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,240
Learn it yourself.

202
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,010
Learn it myself?

203
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,530
Shouldn't you teach me?

204
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,670
I don't know.

205
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,930
Are you trying to slack off?

206
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,260
Xue Chongzi and Young Master Yue

207
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,450
both taught me themselves.

208
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,060
I said I don't know.

209
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,400
What I meant is I don't know how to teach you because I haven't learned it myself.

210
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,710
It's not that I don't want to teach you.

211
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,140
My hands are tied.

212
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,510
Really?

213
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,480
Your eyes are full of contempt and sarcasm.

214
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,250
I'm so sad.

215
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,610
You've been in the back hill for so many years,

216
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,220
and you didn't even mange to learn the Three Forms of Mirror Flower.

217
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,020
You know that

218
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,910
the saber techniques of Xue, Yue, and Hua

219
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,810
become harder level by level, right?

220
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,270
I know.

221
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,100
So the Three Forms of Mirror Flower

222
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,140
are the most difficult three forms among all the saber techniques.

223
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,680
If I could master

224
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,860
such hard saber techniques,

225
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,150
I wouldn't be scolded

226
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,500
by that old man all day.

227
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,870
So, did my brother and Gong Shangjue

228
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,090
learn the Three Forms of Mirror Flower when they left?

229
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,450
No, neither of them did.

230
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,920
Gong Huanyu and Gong Shangjue only learned the first form.

231
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,370
The former Sword Wielder learned the essence of the second form,

232
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,590
but he stopped there.

233
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,690
Stop pretending.

234
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,720
As if you can understand.

235
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,630
Go back and take your time to learn it.

236
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,950
Okay.

237
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,330
It's not over yet.

238
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,380
Keep the scripture well

239
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,970
and come with me.

240
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,460
Since you have passed

241
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,530
the Trial of the Three Realms,

242
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,220
it's time to let you know

243
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,330
the biggest secret of the Gong family.

244
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,220
A century ago,

245
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,190
the first Sword Wielder of the Gong family

246
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,500
came here with the three families, Xue, Yue, and Hua.

247
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,320
He made a blood oath that

248
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,110
his descendants would

249
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,250
guard the back hill generation after generation.

250
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,560
However, actually,

251
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,680
there are very despicable infidels living

252
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,430
somewhere deep in the back hill of the Gong residence.

253
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,990
Guarding the back hill

254
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,490
is to protect the people and the world.

255
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,330
After the three residences of Xue, Yue, and Hua were built,

256
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,790
the first Sword Wielder

257
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,310
built another four residences,

258
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:50,980
namely Shang, Jue,

259
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:51,910
Zhi, and Yu,

260
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,250
in the front hill.

261
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,900
People in the martial world

262
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,990
only know how powerful the front hill of the Gong family is.

263
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,860
But they don't know about the core of it

264
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,410
is the support of the Xue, Yue, and Hua families.

265
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,660
If the front hill is the flesh and blood of the Gong family,

266
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,060
then the back hill

267
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,720
is where the heart arteries are.

268
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,590
The three families, Xue, Yue, and Hua

269
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,370
took use of the meteorite falling from the sky in the valley

270
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,960
and developed the extraordinarily powerful Infinite Heat.

271
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,340
They did that in case

272
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,600
one day the infidels get out of control,

273
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,680
they'll perish with them.

274
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,520
But the Infinite Heat is too powerful.

275
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,140
Once it falls into

276
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,660
some vicious people's hands,

277
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,660
the consequences would be unimaginable.

278
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,160
So

279
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,280
the families agreed

280
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,670
to terminate the research on Infinite Heat,

281
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,820
and sealed the existence of Infinite Heat

282
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,620
as well.

283
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,270
If it's not for the survival of the Gong family,

284
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,320
it should never be activated.

285
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,530
So this is the Infinite Heat you were talking about.

286
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,960
No wonder Infinite Heat has never been used to counter Wufeng

287
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,030
despite how powerful it is.

288
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,330
Exactly.

289
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,070
The power of Infinite Heat

290
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,380
should be used to deal with the infidels in the back hill,

291
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,730
not the people in the mortal world.

292
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,370
So why are there infidels

293
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,120
in the back hill?

294
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,650
What exactly are they?

295
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,460
No one knows.

296
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,820
Anyway,

297
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,930
the rule passed down by the ancestors

298
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,260
is to guard the back hill.

299
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,100
This is also a secret precautiously protected by the back hill.

300
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,120
You've become the Sword Wielder of the Gong family.

301
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,140
Remember.

302
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,020
You can't make judgments based on your own preferences.

303
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,980
Activating Infinite Heat

304
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,450
is a significant matter concerning all the people's safety.

305
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,720
You must

306
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,000
abide by

307
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,530
the will of the ancestors.

308
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,080
I understand.

309
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,610
Why didn't Wuji kill you?

310
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,370
Why did she go through so much trouble

311
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,650
to imprison you?

312
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,450
What she wants

313
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,770
is that thing in Hua Residence, of course.

314
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,130
Could the reason why Lady...

315
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,100
Could the reason why Wuji

316
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,610
imprisoned my brother

317
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,970
be to press him

318
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,630
for the Infinite Heat?

319
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:10,920
That's right.

320
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,860
How did Lady Wuji

321
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,850
get to know the Infinite Heat, then?

322
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,210
I'm afraid she was full of tricks,

323
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,910
so she managed to get this secret

324
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,300
out of the former Sword Wielder.

325
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,300
Do you remember

326
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,930
the hairpin that got the former Sword Wielder killed?

327
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,060
What Huanyu found

328
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,910
in that hairpin

329
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,100
was information about the Infinite Heat.

330
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,910
That's why he hurriedly brought Zheng Nanyi and the hairpin

331
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,390
to the former Sword Wielder

332
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,130
without knowing

333
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,550
that all of this

334
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,030
was a plot to murder the former Sword Wielder.

335
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,910
Now that I think about it,

336
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,870
it must be Wuji

337
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,270
who told Zheng Nanyi about it.

338
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,820
I see.

339
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,140
So did Gong Shangjue leave that night

340
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,570
also to investigate this?

341
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,990
Shangjue.

342
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,480
Please

343
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,530
go to the Zheng family.

344
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,660
Yes.

345
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,610
All the misunderstandings and conflicts between you and Shangjue

346
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,200
started from this.

347
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,790
Now that you've got to know everything,

348
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,740
don't get into more conflicts.

349
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,830
Although what Shangjue has done

350
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,420
is harsh,

351
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,740
what he did is all for the good of the Gong family.

352
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,280
His suspicion of Wuji and Yun Weishan

353
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,330
has also been confirmed.

354
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,700
You are of the same blood.

355
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,120
You are biological brothers.

356
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,330
In the future,

357
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,300
you should work in collaboration.

358
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,230
One more thing.

359
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,620
Since Yun Weishan has left,

360
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,990
at your accession ceremony,

361
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,860
you need to select a new bride.

362
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,340
The Sword Wielder

363
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,620
can't be unmarried and childless.

364
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,900
Elder Xue.

365
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,580
This...

366
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,120
Let's make it five days from now.

367
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,440
Five days from now,

368
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,530
the five stars will come together,

369
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,770
and the sun and the moon will collide.

370
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,860
It's an auspicious omen.

371
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,540
Elders.

372
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,220
Sword Wielder.

373
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,020
There was an explosion

374
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,220
in Eldest Young Miss Gong Zishang's research lab.

375
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,860
[Shang]

376
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,670
You should wrap your wound too.

377
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,040
When I held her just now,

378
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,540
I almost couldn't feel her.

379
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,820
They say

380
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,030
simple-minded people

381
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,200
are blessed and lucky.

382
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,420
I'm sure Zishang

383
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,360
will be fine.

384
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,030
How is she?

385
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,680
Eldest Young Miss is smart.

386
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,440
She wetted her body with water during the explosion

387
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,790
and covered her head with cloth.

388
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,690
So her skin wasn't severely burnt.

389
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,020
But continuous explosions

390
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,640
caused strong impact.

391
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,310
Her head,

392
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,170
heart and lungs

393
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,180
suffered concussions to different degrees,

394
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,300
which led to coma.

395
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,990
We have applied skin-restoring dressing on her wounds,

396
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,570
and silver needles to protect her heart and lungs.

397
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,370
But

398
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,950
it's up to her fate

399
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,580
if she's going to wake up

400
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,700
and when.

401
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,060
Is there no other way?

402
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,730
I'll give her acupuncture every day to recuperate her meridians.

403
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,390
As for you,

404
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,640
you can talk to her more.

405
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,610
Eldest Young Miss.

406
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,560
Can you hear me?

407
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,350
Let's go.

408
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,490
I've been hiding something

409
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,600
in my heart

410
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,820
that I didn't tell you.

411
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,050
You kept asking me

412
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,340
every day.

413
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,950
It's not that I don't want to.

414
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,540
It's because I dare not.

415
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,550
Since the day I became Green Jade Guardian,

416
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,680
I've only existed to protect Gong Ziyu.

417
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,060
Life and death

418
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,790
is not even up to me.

419
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,880
I'm not qualified to accept your feelings for me.

420
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,890
But now I regret it.

421
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,890
I regret it.

422
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,210
How nice would it be

423
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,170
to have let you know my feelings?

424
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,900
The fire on the ruins has been put out.

425
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,210
It's a complete mess.

426
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,350
Those from the Council of Elders are still investigating in the ruins.

427
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,230
Gong Shangjue was there too.

428
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,990
The fire and explosion took place out of the blue.

429
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,390
It's indeed suspicious.

430
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,220
Have you found

431
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,940
anything unusual?

432
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,260
I asked a few servants.

433
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,610
They all said

434
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,410
they saw Gong Yuanzhi

435
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,940
had an argument

436
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,860
with Gong Zishang

437
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,620
before the explosion.

438
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,300
Gong Yuanzhi...

439
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,670
It was about Miss Yun.

440
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:23,960
Stop there!

441
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,620
Can't you hear me?

442
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,530
Shut up!

443
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,020
This is my house. Get out.

444
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,720
You cover up for Wufeng

445
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,130
like Gong Ziyu does.

446
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,100
He doesn't deserve to be the Sword Wielder of the Gong family.

447
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,620
And you don't deserve to be

448
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,550
the head of Shang Lineage either.

449
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,740
Whether a person is good or bad

450
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,060
shouldn't be judged by their identity.

451
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,050
You need to feel it by heart.

452
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,960
Do you understand that?

453
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,220
Miss Yun has never hurt anyone.

454
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,660
You don't have a heart.

455
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,070
Of course you wouldn't understand.

456
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,490
Ridiculous.

457
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,000
You're both blinded by that spy from Wufeng.

458
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,630
If she were a good person,

459
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,740
why would she secretly draw the map

460
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,340
and led Wufeng to break into the Gong Residence?

461
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,240
I left the Gong Residence and went down the hill with Miss Yun once.

462
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,830
If she had that intention,

463
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,880
the map would have been in Wufeng's hands long ago.

464
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,410
How could she let you find it?

465
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,550
She has long defected to us.

466
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,560
She's always been on Gong Ziyu's side.

467
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,960
You drove her away.

468
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:10,960
Idiot.

469
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,790
No wonder your father hates you so much.

470
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,160
This fragment

471
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,000
was found in the ruins of the warehouse.

472
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,240
This is from the golden silk gloves

473
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,050
for Gong Yuanzhi's exclusive use.

474
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,230
Are you concluding that it was Brother Yuanzhi who did it

475
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,640
just for a fragment of a glove?

476
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,790
It could have accidentally dropped there when they had that argument.

477
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,230
Or maybe

478
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,300
he was framed.

479
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,940
Aren't you being too rash, Sword Wielder?

480
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,110
Young Master Shangjue, you've always been fair and strict.

481
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,650
You've never had selfish intentions.

482
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,050
Why are you trying to cover up

483
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,390
when it comes to your brother?

484
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,890
Verbal aguments are useless.

485
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,000
When Gong Zishang wakes up,

486
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,470
the truth will be revealed.

487
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,100
Fine.

488
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,440
When Zishang wakes up,

489
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,260
she will definitely accuse Gong Yuanzhi of what he did.

490
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,320
What if Zishang couldn't wake up?

491
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:37,110
[Feng]

492
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,470
When will the battle start?

493
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,530
In five days.

494
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,430
Why do we have to wait for five days?

495
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,410
The information was sent by Shangguan Qian,

496
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,790
a Wufeng spy of level Mei in the Gong family.

497
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,900
Hanya Si.

498
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,010
We met your subordinate on the way.

499
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,090
Do you want to talk to her?

500
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,230
Why did you run into them?

501
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,780
You should ask

502
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,750
why she left the Gong Residence.

503
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,739
I had lost my gloves before the explosion.

504
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,260
I sent someone to look for it for a long time.

505
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,650
I didn't expect them to frame me with it.

506
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,969
Gong Ziyu is so scheming.

507
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,780
So vicious.

508
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,540
It must be because you two young masters forced Yun Weishan to leave

509
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,449
that he wouldn't let you go.

510
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,940
They set you up and wronged you like that, Brother Yuanzhi.

511
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,030
Young Master won't sit by and do nothing.

512
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,480
Brother Yuanzhi, don't be angry.

513
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,610
They have no solid evidence.

514
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,679
They can't do anything to Yuanzhi.

515
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,159
The date of Gong Ziyu's accession ceremony

516
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,040
has been set.

517
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,380
It's already settled

518
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,300
that he'll be the Sword Wielder.

519
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,740
At this critical moment,

520
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,410
it's no good for us

521
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,590
to confront him head-on.

522
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,250
Accession ceremony?

523
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,820
Yes.

524
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,730
In five days.

525
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,330
In five days?

526
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,870
Why did they choose this...

527
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,960
They must have chosen that date

528
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,640
on purpose.

529
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,560
Brother.

530
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,190
This is too over.

531
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,170
Tell Gong Ziyu that

532
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,430
there will be a celestial phenomenon of five stars coming together

533
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,510
ten days from now.

534
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,290
Let him set the date of the accession ceremony

535
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,400
to that day.

536
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,200
Why?

537
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,920
Taking advantage of their internal conflict,

538
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,540
gather the elite,

539
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,940
break into the Gong Residence

540
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,740
when Gong Shangjue's the weakest,

541
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,600
and catch them all.

542
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,910
Don't worry about the reason.

543
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,460
Just do it.

544
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,150
It'll be no use telling Gong Ziyu.

545
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,970
It's too deliberate,

546
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,110
so it'll be suspicious.

547
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,630
Let the Elder tell him.

548
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,410
It's more natural,

549
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,310
and no one will be against it.

550
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,940
I'll find a way

551
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,490
to persuade Elder Yue.

552
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,620
One more thing.

553
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,130
Since Yun Weishan has left,

554
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,420
you must select a new bride

555
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,430
at your accession ceremony.

556
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,170
Let's make it five days from now.

557
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,190
Five days from now,

558
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,350
five stars will come together,

559
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,560
and the sun and the moon will collide.

560
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,730
It's an auspicious omen.

561
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,010
After Gong Ziyu becomes the Sword Wielder,

562
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,730
we'll have to answer to him, right?

563
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,060
We have to bear the consequences of losing the bet.

564
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,560
We made an agreement with him that

565
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,880
if he could make it through the Trial of the Three Realms

566
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,560
in three months,

567
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,280
we'd recognize him as the Sword Wielder.

568
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,590
I won't accept it.

569
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,460
Me neither.

570
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,360
My identity

571
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,310
was revealed.

572
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:12,880
I had no choice

573
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,690
but escape from the Gong Residence.

574
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,410
That's impressive.

575
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,980
Wufeng couldn't even get close to the Gong Residence

576
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,170
after fighting against them for more than ten years,

577
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,690
while you could enter and leave freely?

578
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,150
I'm truly stupid.

579
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,450
My identity has been revealed.

580
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,020
If I continue with the action,

581
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,260
I'm afraid I'll only hold you back.

582
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,910
I just want the antidote to the Fortnight Flies.

583
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,600
The perpetual one.

584
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,810
You promised me.

585
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,070
As long as I complete the mission,

586
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,830
you'll set me free.

587
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,350
Do you really want to leave?

588
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,950
Whether she wants it or not,

589
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,500
she can't leave.

590
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,280
Come with us to the Gong Residence.

591
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,550
Only by redeeming yourself

592
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,660
can you really complete your mission.

593
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,190
By then,

594
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,070
we'll set you free.

595
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,210
What's my guilt?

596
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,550
Everyone is guilty.

597
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,930
If I don't agree,

598
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,360
you won't give me

599
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,420
the antidote to Fortnight Flies, right?

600
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,020
Of course.

601
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,380
If that's all,

602
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,310
I'll get going.

603
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,640
Aren't you staying here?

604
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,580
There are many people watching here.

605
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,210
Many of them know me.

606
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,850
It's inappropriate for me to stay here.

607
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,310
If the Gong family finds out,

608
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,010
it'll ruin your plan.

609
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,590
I'll find a place to stay nearby.

610
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,600
Do you really trust her?

611
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,180
All these years,

612
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,030
only Yun Que managed to escape from the Gong Residence.

613
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,910
Could Yun Weishan

614
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,260
be the next Yun Que?

615
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,570
She's smarter than Yun Que.

616
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,680
She knows what she wants.

617
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,230
She won't be that stupid.

618
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,590
She is indeed smart.

619
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,840
And she knows what she wants.

620
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,370
But I wonder

621
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,850
if what she wants is what we want.

622
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,620
Anyway,

623
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,600
keep an eye on her.

624
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,230
I will.

625
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,020
If something goes wrong,

626
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:54,920
I can help.

627
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,570
I don't need your help.

628
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,170
I mean,

629
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,540
if you can't do it,

630
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,930
I can help.

631
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,070
Miss.

632
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,290
I remember you.

633
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,720
Where is that handsome young master?

634
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,910
Didn't he come with you?

635
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,540
We broke up.

636
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,920
I wronged him.

637
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,560
Stop joking, Miss.

638
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,940
You are still wearing the love braid

639
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,790
I knitted, aren't you?

640
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,690
I can see that you still haven't let it go.

641
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,480
There must be a misunderstanding between you two.

642
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,790
Go make up for it.

643
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,670
I think

644
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,600
he likes you very much.

645
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,340
Will you send a letter into the Gong Residence for me?

646
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,350
I want to make up for it.

647
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,910
I do want to help you,

648
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,090
but what we sell are not good enough

649
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,770
to be sent into the Gong Residence.

650
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,420
Help me send this letter and the braid

651
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,480
in there.

652
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,120
He will forgive me when he sees the letter and the braid.

653
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,710
You were the one who matchmade us.

654
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:26,710
You should be responsible.

655
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,870
After you send them in,

656
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,650
I'll buy all your braids.

657
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,420
Yes.

658
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,490
I'll go send them now.

659
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,190
Have you made up your mind?

660
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:12,740
Yes.

661
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,430
Then leave.

662
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,040
You're willing to let me go?

663
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,700
I let you go

664
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,150
because

665
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,840
you still have a choice.

666
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,520
But I have no choice.

667
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,520
What I can choose

668
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,510
is not to stand in your way.

669
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,240
You also have a choice.

670
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,230
Fortnight Flies

671
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,270
are not poison at all.

672
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,490
Now that your life is no longer at risk,

673
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,490
you don't have to be threatened by Wufeng anymore.

674
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,360
You can leave too.

675
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,200
Hanya(Ravens) only belong to winter.

676
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,030
They know

677
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,720
there are hunters

678
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:08,980
and traps in the dark forest,

679
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,890
but they can never fly to the light.

680
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,240
They've been eating dirty mice

681
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:19,970
and rotten meat since they were born.

682
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,490
Even their screams

683
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,890
are fearful and ferocious.

684
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,070
They can only

685
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,170
live in the dark

686
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,710
and beneath the sunset.

687
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,890
You look out of the window every time you pass by.

688
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,380
What are you looking at?

689
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,420
The sun.

690
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,270
There's no sun.

691
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,620
It's about to set.

692
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,760
What's there to see?

693
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,930
It's exactly because it's about to set

694
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,050
that I want to take another look at it.

695
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,980
You came in first

696
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,320
in this test.

697
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,150
What reward do you want?

698
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,090
Taking me to watch the sunrise.

699
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,110
This is the reward you want?

700
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,240
You always watch the sunset.

701
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,690
But the world after sunset

702
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,220
is black

703
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,530
and cold.

704
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,900
So I want to take you to watch the sunrise.

705
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,080
Everything after sunrise

706
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,810
is warm

707
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,700
and hopeful.

708
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,890
But

709
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,620
after sunrise,

710
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,530
it will be sunset.

711
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,030
No matter how long the night is,

712
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:56,350
there will be sunrise.

713
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,740
No wall in this world

714
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,930
can stop the sun from rising.

715
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,770
As long as you are willing to wait,

716
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,780
it will come.

717
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,360
Maybe you can.

718
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,360
But I can't.

719
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,170
Why do you have to stay in Wufeng?

720
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,710
What's so good about this place?

721
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,340
The world is so vast.

722
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,770
Why are you...

723
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:42,170
The world is vast,

724
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:45,940
but there's no place for me.

725
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,930
Chi, Mei, Wang, and Liang

726
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,690
can only walk alone in the dark.

727
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,420
You are not one of them.

728
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,480
You are Hanya.

729
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,170
Hanya is even more pitiful.

730
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,210
They only belong to winter.

731
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,740
They don't deserve the light.

732
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,680
They only deserve to live

733
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,050
in freezing cold nights.

734
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:19,960
Go.

735
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,280
No matter how long the night is, it will end.

736
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,770
Do you remember what I told you before?

737
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:56,010
♫The sun rises in the east and sets in the west♫

738
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,410

00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,400
I can finally watch the sunrise with you.

752
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,940
♫I hope we can reunite again♫

753
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:55,560
♫I hope we can reunite again♫

754
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:10,210
Look.

755
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,390
These are the fireflies

756
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,740
I saw in the forest last night.

757
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,510
I thought

758
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,750
these fireflies

759
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:20,420
might be the descendants of the fireflies

760
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,460
you set free before.

761
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,880
So I couldn't help but catch them for you.

762
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,570
I've put them in a bottle.

763
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,680
They'll shine at night,

764
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,620
like a light.

765
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,490
In the past,

766
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,860
you always said

767
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,310
everything you thought of without thinking.

768
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,600
What should I name it?

769
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,890
How about I put your surname and my first name first name together,

770
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,990
and call it Little Jin Zi?

771
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:03,090
Naming is such an important matter. I'll listen to you.

772
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,280
You've really put me

773
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:06,840
in a dilemma.

774
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,390
As a man,

775
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,070
when facing with a little difficulty...

776
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,610
No.

777
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:13,700
I mean, a little surprise,

778
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,400
you don't even know

779
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,390
to face it heads-on.

780
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,940
However,

781
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,880
now I miss you

782
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,360
that I haven't heard your nonsense in a while.

783
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,100
As long as you wake up,

784
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,720
I'll listen to whatever you say.

785
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,740
I won't refute.

786
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:45,960
Okay?

787
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,700
Marry me then.

788
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,530
You're awake.

789
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,340
Didn't you say

790
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,880
as long as I wake up,

791
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,450
you'll agree to whatever I say

792
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:43,640
and won't refute?

793
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,060
Go get Gong Ziyu for me.

794
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,090
Hurry up.

795
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,210
In such a hurry?

796
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:58,710
Yes.

797
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,680
Don't let others know I'm awake.

798
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:02,660
Okay.

799
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,790
You're already the Sword Wielder.

800
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,490
Leave these

801
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,760
to the servants.

802
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,000
Now that you're back, Brother

803
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,390
actually the position of Sword Wielder

804
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,830
should be yours.

805
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,170
You're being silly.

806
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,090
Now,

807
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:51,320
I'm not capable to be the Sword Wielder anymore.

808
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:54,390
I...

809
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,020
I have a favor to ask.

810
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:58,680
Okay?

811
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,020
Brother.

812
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,220
Go ahead.

813
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,930
As long as

814
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,480
I can do it,

815
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,340
I won't say no.

816
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,870
You can do it.

817
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,880
Only you can do it now.

818
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,330
Activate

819
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,400
the Infinite Heat.

820
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,060
Infinite Heat?

821
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,110
Don't you want to avenge your father?

822
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,260
Ten years ago, Wufeng slaughtered the entire Gong family.

823
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,130
My parents died tragically.

824
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,620
Thanks to Uncle, who adopted and raised me.

825
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:38,970
He treated me like I'm his own child.

826
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,980
I gradually started to call your father Father.

827
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,490
But he

828
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,850
was killed by Wufeng as well.

829
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,720
We must

830
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,670
take their revenge.

831
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:51,500
Brother.

832
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,480
Of course we must

833
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,350
take revenge on Wufeng.

834
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,640
But the Infinite Heat is too powerful.

835
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,060
Once it falls into the hands of the evil,

836
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,060
the people will be plunged into

837
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:07,780
an abyss of misery

838
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,060
and there'll be bloodshed everywhere.

839
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,500
However, as long as Wufeng still exists,

840
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,740
the bloodshed in the martial world will not stop.

841
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,060
In a world like this,

842
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,640
how can the people live in peace?

843
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,300
They're also living

844
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,480
under the dreadful shadow of being controlled by Wufeng.

845
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,790
Destroying Wufeng is not only personal,

846
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,550
but also about justice.

847
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,250
For righteousness,

848
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,110
sacrifice is inevitable.

849
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:35,940
Brother.

850
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,740
Take a good rest.

851
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,170
After you recover,

852
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,510
we'll give it further thought.

853
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,580
Ziyu.

854
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:55,880
You've grown up.

855
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:08,560
Lord Sword Wielder.

856
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:10,090
Eldest Young Miss is awake.

857
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:12,850
Take me there.

858
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,950
After the accession ceremony,

859
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,080
you will be the head of the Gong family.

860
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,700
You must shoulder the responsibility

861
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,290
of protecting

862
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,750
the Gong family.

863
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,440
I'll follow my father's example

864
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,400
and be a good Sword Wielder.

865
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:05,760
Congratulations, Young Master Ziyu.

866
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,460
Brother Yuanzhi.

867
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,560
From tomorrow on,

868
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,630
you'll have to call me Lord Sword Wielder.

869
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,690
I'm here

870
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,200
to report something to you, Elders.

871
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,470
I'm sorry

872
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,100
that I've been hiding it from you.
