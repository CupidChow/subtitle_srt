This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,400
Did the General
Episode 36

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,420
agree to this?

4
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,200
Young Master! I asked if the General agreed to this.

5
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,130
No.

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,540
I am the one doing it.

7
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,190
I, Lee Bang Won.

8
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,550
What about his bodyguard?

9
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,360
Does it matter? You're the best swordsman in the Three Kingdoms.

10
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,970
One servant and another petite person who looks like a girl

11
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,340
were waiting while holding swords.

12
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,650
Could it be...

13
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,290
Before Teacher Po Eun goes into the palace,

14
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,500
he has to die.

15
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon

16
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,660
Sam Bong, it's better for you to resent me

17
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,530
but I have to do this to protect the country.

18
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,520
Will all the fighting end by tomorrow?

19
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,950
Why are you asking that?

20
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,630
I just want it to end as soon as possible.

21
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,930
It will. We have to quickly end it.

22
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,480
You're also having a hard time, right?

23
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,380
Aren't you?

24
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:06,270
It pains me but it's something that I have to do, so I have no choice.

25
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:14,520
Fighting is also hard on me.

26
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,720
Blood thirst...

27
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,950
Is something wrong?

28
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,360
You should make haste and go back to the palace.

29
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,100
Is someone following us?

30
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,630
I will be there soon.

31
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,450
Lady! Is Young Master inside?

32
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,170
No matter how I look, I couldn't find him. Young Gyu Hyung-nim and Bang Ji weren't there either.

33
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,980
It seems that Young Master didn't tell you.

34
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,780
About what?

35
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,020
Did Young Master go somewhere?

36
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,460
Are you following Lord Po Eun?

37
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,110
Because Cheok Sa Gwang is a woman.

38
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,090
Are you perhaps...

39
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,890
So you're Lee Bang Ji, the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms.

40
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,000
Why are you following Lord Po Eun?

41
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,160
Are you going to kill Lord Po Eun?

42
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,450
I have a long-time dream buried in my heart that I couldn't fulfill.

43
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,200
A dream?

44
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,130
It's to end Goryeo.

45
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,580
Perhaps... Did he go to kill Lord Po Eun?

46
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,940
Please be quiet.

47
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:39,160
Tell me! Young Master, Bang Ji, and Young Gyu Hyung-nim. Did they really go to kill Lord Po Eun?

48
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,740
Yes.

49
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,680
Damn it. Where is it? Where did they go?

50
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,570
Why are you being like that?

51
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,130
- They will all die.
- What?

52
00:05:53,130 --> 00:06:00,310
Young Master Bang Won, Bang Ji, and Young Gyu Hyung-nim. They will all die.

53
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,510
What does that mean?

54
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,020
Cheok Sa Gwang is there. Where is it? Hurry!

55
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,020
It's probably on the way to the palace.

56
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,670
Palace.

57
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,540
But I couldn't send you to Lord Po Eun before you kill me.

58
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,470
Are you Cheok Sa Gwang?

59
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,170
Yes.

60
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,340
I've wanted to fight you at least once anyway.

61
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,200
That's what I despise the most. That kind of warrior's competitiveness.

62
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,880
Fortunately, you have a long life.

63
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,660
Is that so?

64
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,490
That's right. A really long life. As long as you don't meet the reaper.

65
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,610
Reaper? What is that?

66
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,280
In the life of a swordsman, there's a time when you will meet it.

67
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,960
A reaper can just be your luck on that day, the weather,

68
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,550
or at other times, it could even be the sudden urge to poop.

69
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,710
It could also be an amazing master (swordsman).

70
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,610
What if I meet it?

71
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,690
You have to hope that you won't meet it.

72
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,560
Teacher, I think I've met the reaper.

73
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,950
For a warrior, it is a very common thing

74
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,270
for his corpse to be left lying there in the mountains forever unfound.

75
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,490
Warrior-nim, you are very strong so

76
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I can't fight while being careful of your life.

77
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,870
I'm sorry.

78
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,790
Dying is not the problem. If we can't catch Po Eun tonight, it will be the end.

79
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,280
Lee Bang Won, you're doing it properly, right?

80
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,800
He blocked this. Let's finish it quickly.

81
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,980
So you're out of breath, Cheok Sa Gwang.

82
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,740
It seems that Lee Bang Won will attack Po Eun.

83
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,530
Lee Bang Ji went out with the Ga Byeol Cho. Moo Hyul also followed them.

84
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,040
Mugeuk!

85
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,790
Then, will Po Eun die?

86
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,270
But Lord Po Eun's side has Cheok Sa Gwang.

87
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,580
If Lee Bang Ji and

88
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,490
Cheok Sa Gwang fight, what will happen?

89
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,070
If I consider my experiences of fighting each of them,

90
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,820
Lee Bang Ji will die.

91
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,300
So you don't have to worry.

92
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:31,780
The Goksan swordsmanship can look impressive but it's actually simple.

93
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,580
This swordsmanship is familiar.

94
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,490
Could it be...

95
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,860
And she's become slower than when we started.

96
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,710
What's your relationship with the leader of the Wudang Clan?

97
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,210
He's my Teacher.

98
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,210
Our ill-fated relationship is deeper than I thought it was.

99
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,060
I have to make him run.

100
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,750
I have better stamina than her. I mustn't let her rest.

101
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,260
It wasn't a deep cut so why?

102
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,060
You...

103
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,310
It's your first time getting cut by a sword since you were born, right?

104
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,240
I didn't think this would take so long.

105
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,780
If someone else followed Lord Po Eun's side...

106
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,100
Let's quickly end this.

107
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,450
He's still alive.

108
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,550
Bang Ji. Cheok Sa Gwang.

109
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,160
This warrior is confident with his defense.

110
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,090
He'll definitely block it instead of avoiding. Let's end this.

111
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,810
Maincham.

112
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,150
No.

113
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,320
Don't block it! Move!

114
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,490
It can't be like this.

115
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,070
The thing about weakness is

116
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,270
that it doesn't just apply on swordsmanship, but to people as well.

117
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,250
People?

118
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,780
I actually

119
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,870
don't have much experience in fighting.

120
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:45,220
No matter how good the swordsmanship is, if she lacks fighting experience, it would be hard for her to respond to an unexpected situation.

121
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,130
Unexpected situation.

122
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,800
He threw away his sword.

123
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,360
Hesitating in an unknown situation.

124
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,300
I terribly hate to kill.

125
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,980
Hesitate, Cheok Sa Gwang.

126
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,890
Moo Hyul!

127
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,980
- What's with you?
- When morning comes,

128
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,950
are you going to execute Teacher Sam Bong and our people?

129
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:11,880
Since you guys tried to overthrow the country, your punishments won't be taken lightly.

130
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,350
Can't you really give up on this country?

131
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,820
This is the country where I was born and grew up.

132
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,660
This land where my family and I

133
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,020
and my colleagues grew up.

134
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:36,370
If I turn my back on this country, how can I call myself a Confucian scholar?

135
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,090
Country...

136
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,190
Country, you say?

137
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,670
You bastard. Are you going to use the people as an excuse?

138
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,550
You told me before to not sell the people out,

139
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,630
so I took another good look at the people.

140
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,010
But the thing about the people is

141
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,800
they don't care what happens to the country.

142
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:19,300
So are you saying that those pitiful people want a new country?

143
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,070
To those people, whether it happens this or that way,

144
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,620
what does it matter to them?

145
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:35,640
Whether you protect the country or Teacher Sam Bong establishes a new country,

146
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,060
it doesn't matter to those people.

147
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:49,890
The people are fine as long as they have food and are happy with life.

148
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,600
You're selling the people out again.

149
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,900
Even if the kudzu vines on Mansu Mountain are all intertwined,

150
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,670
what is wrong with that?

151
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,630
Teacher Sam Bong and you were intertwined like that, so

152
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:14,810
if you could hold hands and make the people enjoy life,

153
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:23,850
who would dare disgrace you with his petty brush in the history that you so cherish?

154
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,100
The people, you say?

155
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,920
The people enjoying life...

156
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,020
Listen well.

157
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,150
A Confucius scholar does not chase after the people.

158
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:47,420
It's about embracing the people and guiding them.

159
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,770
To embrace them, a country and system are needed.

160
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,720
And a Confucian scholar's heart towards that is called patriotism.

161
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:04,980
If he abandons that patriotism, then the people in his heart will disappear as well.

162
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,800
Whatever

163
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,030
happens tonight,

164
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:24,470
are you still not going to change your mind?

165
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:14,710
Can we really not get you to our side no matter what we do?

166
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,440
That's such a petty threat.

167
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,270
Look here.

168
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,270
General Lee Seong Gye and Sam Bong.

169
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,580
Whatever they do, the only thing that they can gain

170
00:21:51,580 --> 00:22:00,450
are Goryeo and this body just over a 100 geuns (unit of weight).

171
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,830
Try to kill me over and over again.

172
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:13,390
Try to kill me a hundred times over. Even if my bones rot

173
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,610
and my body become the soil

174
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,230
and become dust,

175
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:30,410
this one piece in my body, the unwavering and passionate heart I had towards this country,

176
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,210
you will not be able to get it.

177
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,810
That heart is indeed admirable.

178
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:46,660
Yes.

179
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,770
I understand what you mean,

180
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,310
Teacher.

181
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:58,310
Ah! There's actually one thing that you will get.

182
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,430
A thousand years of bad reputation.

183
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:10,930
Starting tomorrow, you will be entangled with my name, Jeong Mong Joo, for a thousand years,

184
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:17,710
and it will be recorded and be the talk of the town.

185
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,450
Try hard to endure it!

186
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,930
Yes! I will!

187
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,550
If I can't be entangled with you in this life,

188
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,410
I will at least try to be entangled with you after death

189
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,870
and enjoy it for thousands of years.

190
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,750
Young Gyu!

191
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,820
Sam Bong, it went according to you.

192
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,440
I tried to serve with my life for the thousand year history of Goryeo.

193
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,660
But this country has come to an end,

194
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,740
and I ended up living the thousand years.

195
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,700
Isn't this just ridiculous?

196
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,200
Was Cheok Sa Gwang defeated?

197
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,840
Fate is indeed capricious.

198
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,440
What happened here?

199
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,100
I think he's someone with a high position.

200
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,930
Isn't that Teacher Po Eun? Look.

201
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,280
Aigoo! You're right! What's going on here?

202
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,260
Aigoo! Lord Jeong Mong Joo! What's happening?

203
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,610
Come out.

204
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,950
Why are you doing this?

205
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,890
Isn't the execution at myoshi (5am-7am)?

206
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,030
Hyung.

207
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,960
It's okay. Are you okay?

208
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,640
Yes. Well, I've done even worse things than this.

209
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,680
But why am I trembling like this?

210
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:42,550
You've done a great thing. A great thing.

211
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,650
What will happen now?

212
00:27:52,460 --> 00:28:01,350
A lot of things will probably change. Immediately, by tomorrow, a lot will change.

213
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,160
What?

214
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,900
Tell me again.

215
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,800
What are you saying?

216
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:29,390
Lord Po Eun was murdered at Seonjuk Bridge.

217
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,770
It was done by Lee Seong Gye's fifth son, Lee Bang Won.

218
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,680
Po Eun...

219
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,900
Po Eun...

220
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,070
How did this happen...

221
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,530
How?

222
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:05,450
But Your Majesty, you need to control your emotions and be steadfast.

223
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,820
Po Eun!

224
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,160
Po Eun? What did you say happened?

225
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,420
Was he really murdered?

226
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,920
Yes.

227
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,360
Yes, Teacher.

228
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,940
This cannot happen.

229
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,470
How can Po Eun...

230
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,380
How can Po Eun end up like that?

231
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,220
Teacher...

232
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,880
It's probably done by Lee Seong Gye's people.

233
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,390
Just what are we going to do with these traitorous crooks!

234
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,260
Hyung-nim.

235
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,750
Don't be so surprised when you listen to what I say.

236
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:12,500
Lord Po Eun, when he was returning to the palace from here last night,

237
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,190
he was murdered.

238
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,200
He was murdered? Just who would...?

239
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,460
I think Bang Won did it.

240
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,500
Okay. Let's go!

241
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,550
Ah! You startled me.

242
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,160
Why are you all here like this?

243
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,220
What happened to my brother?

244
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,290
What happened to my Moo Hyul? My Moo Hyul?

245
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:54,840
Ddang Sae and Moo Hyul never came back.

246
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,910
They haven't come back?

247
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,630
Yes. Weren't you all together?

248
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,310
What could've happened? We split in two groups.

249
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,570
Then did Bang Ji follow after Cheok Sa Gwang?

250
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,100
Cheok-cheok Sa Gwang? Who's Cheok Sa Gwang?

251
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,760
Oh right. We were going to draw that warrior away.

252
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,440
Could they have...? Damn it!

253
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,620
Brother!

254
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,530
Moo Hyul. Where's Moo Hyul?

255
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,230
He hasn't come back yet?

256
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,460
What are you talking about? Were you not with him?

257
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,080
Last night, Moo Hyul fell off the cliff with Cheok Sa Gwang.

258
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,470
I haven't been able to find him yet.

259
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,070
Oh no... Oh Moo Hyul.

260
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:01,780
Ohhh nooo....

261
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,340
Did she use the falling technique while holding on to me?

262
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,970
Aigoo. What happened to my Moo Hyul...

263
00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:01,670
How could this happen to my Moo Hyul...

264
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:08,840
Since everyone is all looking for him, please don't worry.

265
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,500
Boon Yi is using the help of the whole marketplace organization

266
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,900
I even told Moo Hyul not to go out like that...

267
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:25,540
Moo Hyul isn't someone who will die that easily. Please don't get yourself worked up so much and just wait.

268
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,110
Moo Hyul! Where are you!

269
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,860
Have you found anything?

270
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,820
Where are you!

271
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,500
Daeseong Shrine (Shrine of Confucius)

272
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,560
Was it something that couldn't be done no matter what?

273
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,660
Was it really something that couldn't be forgiven?

274
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:19,060
As a Confucian scholar, all I did was follow your teachings.

275
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:26,250
After following your teachings to put the people above the country, this is the path I've taken, so why?

276
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,910
Why did Po Eun and I have to end up this way?

277
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,120
Why? Just why?

278
00:37:54,910 --> 00:38:02,260
If I really work hard, can I really make a world described in this literature?

279
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,400
You can! Let's make it.

280
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,000
We can make it.

281
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,780
What do you mean we can do it?

282
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:31,570
This useless crap. This useless crap that couldn't even convince Po Eun!

283
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,770
What's the use of all these plans?

284
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,800
Sahyung! Why are you acting like this?

285
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:54,260
What? Our great cause has already been ruined anyway. Can't you see?

286
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,780
Sahyung!

287
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,570
Husband, Father-in-law is calling for you.

288
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:19,360
I might die by my father today.

289
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,560
He won't be able to kill you.

290
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,060
So don't avoid it and go confidently.

291
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,640
Okay. I will go.

292
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,510
Husband.

293
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,790
I'm sure no one has yet told you this.

294
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,600
You did well.

295
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,040
Lee Seong Gye

296
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,850
Father. It's Bang Won.

297
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,510
Father.

298
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,720
I'm sorry. I did wrong.

299
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,010
Take your life as punishment for you sins.

300
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,840
Die!

301
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,010
Bang Won!

302
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:23,070
I definitely told you not to mess with Po Eun.

303
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:31,530
What's your reason for disobeying that order, but only obeying the order to kill yourself?

304
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:40,220
You are probably trying to say that even if you have to die you are still right.

305
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,560
"You, Father, are wrong! I am right!"

306
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,460
"That's why I did everything according to what I think!"

307
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,830
Even if it is against your own father,

308
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,200
even when you secretly stamped my seal on the Ahn Byeon Book,

309
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,090
even when you hit Po Eun to your heart's content until he died,

310
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:03,150
it's because of your temperament that you wanted to do everything according to your will!

311
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,640
I also don't like your temperament!

312
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:12,180
Even when the path you needed to take was obviously in front of you, you still looked somewhere else.

313
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,330
Why do you have to make it so complicated?

314
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:20,410
So then was turning all the Sadaebu following Po Eun

315
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:24,070
into your enemies all that easy for you?

316
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:31,950
Then, what is the right thing to do?

317
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:41,450
Teacher Sam Bong, Teacher Nam Eun, and everyone else.

318
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,330
Should we just let them be executed?

319
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:49,790
You have made our great cause into a usurpation!

320
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:56,670
And the little respect and sentiment the people had for is is going to disappear!

321
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,580
Are those really needed in the way to the great cause?

322
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,790
- Being king—
- I will not

323
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,960
be the king of the country!

324
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,210
Yes! If you don't want to, then just forget it!

325
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:21,170
If you're afraid of taking responsibility, if you're scared of being criticized,

326
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:28,000
if you hate getting your hands dirty that much, then just quit.

327
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,620
Bang Won, you bastard!

328
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,290
Hyung-nim! Don't do this!

329
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:59,020
You bastard! You killed Teacher Po Eun!

330
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,830
That's right. You probably made up your mind to die when you did it.

331
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,770
Hyung-nim!

332
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:09,930
Bang Gwa, immediately arrest this criminal!

333
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:13,710
Hyung-nim! Please calm down!

334
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,460
If you can't do it, I will do it!

335
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,540
Hyung-nim!

336
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,950
Bang Won! Run! Hurry and run!

337
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,140
Let me go! Let go!

338
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,540
Even the little kids know the fact that Teacher Po Eun was a loyal subject!

339
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:35,020
If His Majesty doesn't punish the man who killed such a loyal subject,

340
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,730
then who would ever be loyal to this country?

341
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:42,790
That's right! We need to sentence to Lee Bang Won, who killed Teacher Po Eun, to death.

342
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:47,170
That's right! We need to all stand together and put these notices up all over Gaegyeong.

343
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,160
We also have to make a petition to His Highness!

344
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,040
- Of course!
- We must do that!

345
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,390
Let's go!

346
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,400
- Let's do that!
- Let's go!

347
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:03,050
Isn't this a petition for resignation? What is this?

348
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:08,390
Until the criminal who killed Teacher Po Eun is punished,

349
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,360
we will not come back.

350
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,560
This is something that shouldn't have happened!

351
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,540
It's not that I don't know about your pain and tears.

352
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:39,220
But I'm scared that even you would get hurt if we acted recklessly.

353
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:43,140
We're already prepared to die!

354
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,150
Seriously, this bastard Bang Won...

355
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:53,200
Please, you need to support us!

356
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:57,020
We are prepared to die!

357
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:02,700
We are prepared to die! We are prepared to die!

358
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,330
Lee Bang Won Death Penalty

359
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,890
Bang Won will be executed?

360
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,740
How did this happen?

361
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,110
What does that mean?

362
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,020
Warrior-nim!

363
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,960
What happened?

364
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,490
What should we do about your face? Aigoo. Your handsome face...

365
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:33,840
Ah, whatever. Still, I knew nothing bad will happen to our Moo Hyul.

366
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,420
You said so yourself that I have the greatest luck in Goryeo.

367
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:43,790
Of course! That's why I didn't worry at all last night. I slept soundly all night long.

368
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,450
No, you couldn't sleep at all, so you were whimpering and scratching the wall.

369
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:51,170
Aigoo. When did I do that?

370
00:46:55,090 --> 00:47:00,740
Is it true that Teacher Po Eun has passed away?

371
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,580
While we were fighting, Young Gyu Hyung-nim...

372
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,780
I see.

373
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,330
What happened to you?

374
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:14,680
When I woke up, Cheok Sa Gwang was gone.

375
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,940
That's a relief.

376
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,430
Hey! Were you worried?

377
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:29,020
You planned to jump, right? You could've died.

378
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:34,160
That's right. If you meet a strong person, you have to avoid them in the first place.

379
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,410
It's not like you made up your mind to die.

380
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:43,030
I don't know why Cheok Sa Gwang was protecting Teacher Po Eun, but

381
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:48,030
if she's still alive, don't you think she'll want revenge?

382
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,200
By the way, what's with the notices put up in the marketplace?

383
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,470
That's because there are a lot of Confucian scholars who respect Teacher Po Eun.

384
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:06,810
It will all pass. Honestly, Teacher Po Eun's side was the one who started it anyway.

385
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:11,900
Would they think like that? People just side with the person who died.

386
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:55,850
Centering on the Seonggyungwan, it seems like the inclination to execute Young Master Bang Won is spreading.

387
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,690
Bon Won, in whatever situation—

388
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:04,660
In the end, I am the one who killed Po Eun.

389
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,320
He died because of me.

390
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,510
Are you still lamenting that the great cause is ruined?

391
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:16,910
Because I wanted to remain a Confucian scholar, at the last moment, I acted in a spoiled manner.

392
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:23,100
It was something that I shouldn't have done and something that shouldn't be done to Po Eun.

393
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:28,840
And so? What do you think you should have done?

394
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,790
Rather, what are you planning to do?

395
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,150
I have two options now.

396
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,950
Live brutally, or die brutally.

397
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,270
Bon Won.

398
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,670
The justification we lost in the beginning of our great cause,

399
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:12,720
can only be recovered by establishing a new country.

400
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,600
I have to leave; I need to go see the General.

401
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:30,480
I definitely told you not to mess with Po Eun.

402
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,970
Bang Gwa, immediately arrest this criminal!

403
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,520
Oh! Lee Bang Won!

404
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,500
Don't get close.

405
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,950
That murderer!

406
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,880
It's from things like this that people talk about "betraying someone's gratitude".

407
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,370
Look, it's Lee Bang Won. He must have no shame.

408
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,340
Isn't he the guy that killed Teacher Po Eun?

409
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,070
Aigoo. Just look at him.

410
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,720
Aigoo.

411
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:12,970
One more. Aren't you hestitating because you are afraid you will be shunned by the world and become lonely?

412
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:17,030
Just don't even pay attention to him. Aigoo.

413
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,340
Let's go. Aigoo.

414
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,030
Look here.

415
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,340
Look here!

416
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:56,330
I told you to lay low and not do anything rash. Why did you cause this trouble?

417
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,860
Do you think you would have had a different method?

418
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,760
I do.

419
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,220
Assassination. You should've assassinated him.

420
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,700
Of course, you would have been suspected,

421
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,880
but you could just deny it. What could they do?

422
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:24,200
The Jeon Joo Lee family has all the power right now. People will talk about it for a while and it will just pass.

423
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,310
I am fair!

424
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,420
Why do I have to assassinate?

425
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:37,160
I simply stopped someone who was trying to hurt Father

426
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:43,130
and got rid of the person who was preventing history from moving forward, in the name of Lee Bang Won.

427
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:52,770
Always so quick-tempered.

428
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:57,450
He doesn't even know what kind of weakness it can be to him.

429
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,180
You are okay, right?

430
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,300
What would I do even if I wasn't okay.

431
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,630
The General will eventually calm down.

432
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,560
Even if he doesn't, there's nothing we can do about it.

433
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,610
I have to see Teacher Sam Bong.

434
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,630
He's just entered the Gaegyeong residence.

435
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,570
Okay. Let's go.

436
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:30,600
Has your health gotten better?

437
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,900
Sam Bong...

438
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,870
How did...

439
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,740
How did things end up like this?

440
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,770
I think I can tell the public sentiment without even stepping outside.

441
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:10,070
How the world is thinking of me, of us.

442
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:12,750
I think I know it all.

443
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:20,150
What can we do now...

444
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,080
General.

445
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,870
Tell me.

446
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,170
Po Eun...

447
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:34,340
We have to denounce Po Eun as a criminal, and hang his decapitated head in the marketplace.

448
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,500
Wha-What?

449
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:46,200
We need to hang Po Eun's head at the commonplace and denounce him as a rebel.

450
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:50,340
Look here, Sam Bong.

451
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,910
Are you out of your mind?

452
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,400
Is this...

453
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,970
Is this the great cause that you wanted?

454
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,500
Killing General Choi Yeong, exiling Lord Lee Saek,

455
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:15,370
and beating to death the person who came to visit the sick. And now that's not enough,

456
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:19,870
so you want to hang his head and frame him as a rebel?

457
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:24,030
Even though I have killed countless numbers of enemies on the battlefield,

458
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,730
I've never killed them in this way.

459
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,360
Even though I've cut off the head of an enemy general running away

460
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,260
after abandoning his army to save only himself,

461
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,930
for the enemy general that fought till the end with his soldiers—

462
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:40,190
Yes. You've always held a grand funeral for them.

463
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:41,860
But,

464
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:49,350
but that Lee Seong Gye is going to frame Jeong Mong Joo as a rebel?

465
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:57,070
Then should we set up a memorial stone for him as the greatest loyal subject and serve him in a shrine?

466
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:02,770
General, we need to take responsibility.

467
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,360
In whatever situation, we need to take responsibility.

468
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:10,280
That's what politics is and is what a politician should at least do.

469
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:15,660
Since the beginning of history, the essence of politics has never changed.

470
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,080
Politics is responsibility.

471
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:23,310
Po Eun opposed our plans

472
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,540
and took political responsibility by dying.

473
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:34,540
And for us, on this road we chose to take, even by killing Po Eun in the process, we must achieve our great cause no matter what.

474
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:41,140
If we don't, we all have to die.

475
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,460
Is Teacher Sam Bong truly the only person capable of pushing Father forward?

476
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:58,330
If Po Eun hadn't died, I probably would've died.

477
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:05,200
Woo Jae, Nam Eun, Lee Shin Jeok,

478
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,920
and all the talented people that we raised and needed for our cause would have died.

479
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,840
It's my fault.

480
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:25,190
The first was when I thought Po Eun would agree with me, because what I was thinking (about the new country) was correct.

481
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,110
The second was when, even though I knew attacking those who are close

482
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:37,010
is much more difficult than attacking my enemies, I wanted to ignore it.

483
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,010
And at least to Po Eun,

484
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,720
at least to Po Eun,

485
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,820
my desire to be acknowledged.

486
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,500
That's my third fault.

487
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:05,210
I fully realize the responsibility. But

488
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:13,270
if we are alive, if we can't die,

489
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:18,310
then we have to take responsibility.

490
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,200
What happened?

491
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:25,070
Teacher!

492
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:37,550
There was no other way.

493
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,070
I am not reproaching you.

494
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,310
I did it fully determined to face the consequences.

495
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:51,400
What kind of consequences were you determined to face?

496
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:58,810
Now, in this great cause, there is no place for you.

497
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,280
You must have have been prepared to face this kind of consequence, right?

498
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,060
From the beginning...

499
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:21,380
From the beginning, there was no place for me, isn't that right?
