00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,900
Episode 8

3
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm that person.

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,170
The owner of the New Joseon is Jangpyeong Gate's Jantgar.

5
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,510
Jantgar: Strongest Man

6
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,610
I am Jeong Do Jeon.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,250
I am the leader of these people and the one who sent them to Ham Joo.

8
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,600
Hey, are you crazy?

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,030
This is a very strict area where Ho Bal Do is constantly waiting for an opportunity to strike.
(Ho Bal Do: Chief of the Yeojin tribe)

10
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,070
What's your reason for infiltrating us with spies and making things complicated?

11
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,740
That's the first reason.

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,690
Protect this area from Ho Bal Do,

13
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,820
General Lee Seong Gye's Ham Joo is strong,

14
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,920
so this place is completely safe from Japanese pirates.

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,470
That is the first reason.

16
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,080
What nonsense are you saying?

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,260
Hey, you disturbed the country by planting spies

18
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,640
and overturned the military camp. What is a bastard like you babbling about?

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,150
Do you think you'll get away alive?

20
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,760
Then, how can I live?

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,420
What's the method to live on this land?

22
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,150
What about it?

23
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,790
To stay alive.

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,290
That's the second reason why we all gathered here in Ham Joo.

25
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,050
I, and all these people,

26
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,230
came to Ham Joo to find a way to stay alive.

27
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,720
For a long time, General, you fought with your whole body

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,700
and saved a lot of people.

29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,480
But during the placement examination, these people's stories,

30
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,460
you heard them, right?

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,050
When you were fighting Japanese pirates,

32
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,700
those bastard alliance were taking lands from villagers with the excuse they were chasing off Japanese pirates.

33
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,070
If there are ten people who were killed by invaders, then the people who died because of the higher-ups' war business

34
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,740
would probably be a hundred.

35
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,110
Still, these people are asking, "Where can we live?"

36
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,290
"What's the method to live?"

37
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,110
That's why I answer, Ham Joo,

38
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,970
because General Lee Seong Gye knows our suffering,

39
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,270
and I know he has a lot of worries on his mind.

40
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,120
Isn't that so?

41
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,230
I'm asking, isn't that so?

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,170
If it's not, then

43
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,880
the plan I worked on for a long time is for nothing and has failed.

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Also, for the sin of disturbing the army, we who survived after all will fail and probably die here.

45
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,700
Therefore, give all of us your answer.

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,020
Is there a way for us to live without fighting the three high ministers?

47
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,740
Don't you know that, General?

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,280
Are you able to live as if you don't know?

49
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,000
I bet everything knowing you are not that kind of person.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,010
Therefore, either you kill all of us here or

51
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,620
save us by getting rid of the three high ministers and standing as our leader!

52
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,210
My father,
(Lee Shin Jeok)

53
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,950
because he was embarrassed for succumbing to the three high ministers' tyranny,

54
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,890
committed suicide.

55
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,120
This is the only reason why I did not follow my father.

56
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,020
It's because of this.

57
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,110
General! Eliminate the three high ministers of Do Dang

58
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,920
and put us in the front line!

59
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,570
In my arms, my child,

60
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,690
my baby died coldly.

61
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,540
I can't forgive those kinds of people.

62
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,680
Please put me in the front line, General.

63
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,450
Please put me in the front line, General!

64
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,880
I, for Uh Nyeon who died,

65
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,700
Uh Nyeon's dad, Pal Bong,

66
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,960
and Chil Seong Ajussi.

67
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,690
It's not because of these people who died.

68
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,190
It's for the people who are alive.

69
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,390
Allow us to just make a living,

70
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,550
as hard working, tax-paying citizens of our village.

71
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,920
I will be in the front line.

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,600
Please put me in the front line!

73
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,550
-I will also stand in the front line!
-General!

74
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,930
Please use us!

75
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,020
General!

76
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,940
He is the person who held out a taffy at Jangpyeong Gate, right?

77
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,700
Yes. He's that Jantgar.

78
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,620
Ah, the person who spoke about creating a new nation?

79
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,540
The owner of that room?

80
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,690
At that moment when everyone was busy abandoning, giving up, and compromising,
(Lee Bang Won)

81
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,220
Teacher Sam Bong was the only one who prepared.

82
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,580
It's like saying "Defeat? The dogs can have it!"

83
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,480
But why did he come to our General and why is he doing this?

84
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,970
Because he's going to establish a new country.

85
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,810
Because he is the one who will become king.

86
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,870
What? King?

87
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,550
King?

88
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,110
Then, he would need a military force.

89
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,620
There's nobody with as large a military army as Father.

90
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,610
Father is the first person Teacher Sam Bong will put under his command.

91
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,150
Then, when a new country is established, our General will be a part of the highest government office?

92
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,390
Father has to make the right choice though.

93
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,310
Sam Bong.

94
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,780
The General wants to see you.

95
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,840
Lee Seong Gye)

96
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,850
Why is it me?

97
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,270
Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon

98
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,940
In the year of Eul Myo, the Sadaebu asked for your help, right?

99
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:49,240
I was delighted when the Sadaebu managed to block the Yuan envoy, but

100
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,820
I told them this.

101
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,510
"Don't trust General Lee Seong Gye too much.

102
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,080
He's only going to war to become a good person. He won't take responsibility."

103
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,400
Also, you actually went back because of Lee In Gyeom, right?

104
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,870
But,

105
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,720
why did you come to me now?

106
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,900
As you might already know, after the Jangpyeong Gate incident, I went into exile.

107
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,580
Would the Japanese pirates, who invade almost once every ten days, have gone around a place of exile?

108
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,780
While in exile, I went around trying to evade the Japanese pirates.

109
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,790
Then, where you defeated Ah Ji Bal Do,
(Ah Ji Bal Do: Commander of the Japanese pirates that invaded Goryeo)

110
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,310
I have witnessed that great Un Bong battle.

111
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,330
It was as I heard.

112
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,340
Instead of sending off his subordinates first, he stands in front and fights.

113
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,390
He's a person who takes care of each one of his soldiers,

114
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,420
that person who doesn't take anything from people in the battleground,

115
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,060
while always a person who remains good.

116
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,970
What is it that you want to say?

117
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,400
Even so, a person who's not going higher in the government.

118
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,500
Why?

119
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,790
If it's political responsibilities, the moment you enter politics, people would not see you

120
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,440
as a good person anymore.

121
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,090
How dare someone like you, who don't even know me, say that?

122
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,720
Yes.

123
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,240
I didn't know anything about you back then.

124
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,720
After seeing that scene, I came to understand it a little.

125
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,870
That scene?

126
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm talking about those fake pirates.

127
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,980
Father!

128
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,320
Un Bong Village

129
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,810
What's this? Why a pirate?(Lee Ji Ran)

130
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,510
He's not a pirate.

131
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,350
While we fought the invaders' main force at Un Bong,

132
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,810
these bastards got into pirate costumes

133
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,130
and plundered grains from their fellow villagers.

134
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,710
It's not even a different village but their own!

135
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,060
They must have given up on being human.

136
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,680
These bastards deserve to die!

137
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,760
So you are traitors.

138
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,690
Why are we traitors?

139
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,370
When that chaos happened in Un Bong,

140
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,380
those bastard higher ups who said they would protect us,

141
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,180
whether it's land or grains, took everything.

142
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,490
What those bastards did wasn't betrayal, but why

143
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,750
do you call me, who doesn't have power, a traitor?

144
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,950
This bastard doesn't even have an ounce of shame!

145
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,930
Shame!

146
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,440
I don't have it. No!

147
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,290
I'm actually proud!

148
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,780
While my son was dying of hunger,

149
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,920
instead of being a father who couldn't do anything for my child,

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,590
I am proud of myself for at least doing something like this for my son!

151
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,230
I don't have shame, you say?

152
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,690
I am proud. I am proud.

153
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,800
Hurry and kill me.

154
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,650
Just kill me!

155
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,960
Since I'm proud, just kill me.

156
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,430
Aren't you embarrassed?

157
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,090
Aren't you ashamed?

158
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,030
Isn't it hard looking at your son?

159
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,650
That's why you are asking me to kill you.

160
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,410
Fine.

161
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,710
Then you said this to that person:

162
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,010
"Death is too light a punishment for your shame."

163
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,610
"For your remaining life, use all the strength in your body and live while being punished."

164
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,090
"Fight off pirates under my command and become a military leader."

165
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,830
"Even just a little bit, compensate your son and your fellow villagers."

166
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,210
That was what you said.

167
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,330
I knew on that day that I was wrong.

168
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,970
To you, war is a kind of atonement

169
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,430
so you only protected Goryeo

170
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,790
and made sure that the people were living well.

171
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,010
I saw it as your only hope to forgive yourself.

172
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,970
Was I wrong?

173
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,110
If what I said is not wrong,

174
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,490
while those three high ministers of Do Dang exist,

175
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,030
what you're hoping for will never happen.

176
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,550
Let's defeat the three high ministers of Do Dang

177
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,370
and establish a new country.

178
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,850
We need to establish a new country. It cannot be Goryeo.

179
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,870
Say yes no matter what. Don't say no.

180
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,170
Also, in the new country I'm going to establish,

181
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,530
I chose you

182
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,190
to be the king.

183
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,170
What?

184
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,170
What did you say? Who is his son?

185
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,470
Young Master Bang Won's father is General Lee Seong Gye.

186
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,170
What are you doing?

187
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,250
What you are saying is

188
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,180
I saved General Lee Seong Gye's son twice. Not just once, but twice. That's what it is, right?

189
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,000
His life! Not just anything but his life. He really almost died but I saved him!

190
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,420
It's this, right?

191
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,910
If you think of it that way, then yes.

192
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,810
Oh?

193
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,170
Grandma, I did it.

194
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,030
That sword!

195
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,550
- You. That...
- No...

196
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,380
It's Young Master's, right?

197
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,220
I will not deny that. Still, I saved him twice--

198
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,820
Stop saying that "twice, twice"! You don't know how precious this sword is.

199
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,390
Can't you talk to your young master and ask if I can borrow it for a bit longer?

200
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,820
I am a swordsman!

201
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,160
Go, you punk, go! Ah, so annoying!

202
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,410
Not Father.

203
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,640
Father is not someone who can be the owner of a new country.

204
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,430
Either Teacher, who caused the Yuan envoy to get lost,

205
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:20,010
or who sets fires to mourn for Unyeon, it should be someone who can embrace the people's hearts...

206
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,090
He is not like that.

207
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,900
Father is too weak.

208
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,210
I apologize.

209
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,030
Who kidnapped you?

210
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,940
I think they are from Bi Guk Temple.

211
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,280
They were the ones who kidnapped me

212
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,770
and I think I was followed.

213
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,260
But why would the people from Bi Guk Temple do that?

214
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,710
It's probably Hong In Bang. He must be looking for me.

215
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,990
Did your talk with the general go well?

216
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,500
It now depends on Heaven's decision.

217
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,480
We have to wait.

218
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,780
I have a plan. I have a way.

219
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,720
I can really make Ham Joo into a new country.

220
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,510
Therefore, stamp the An Byeon Chaek and give it to me.

221
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,950
I will make sure that the ministers will pass it.

222
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,740
As the new king of the new country I will establish,

223
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,310
I have chosen you.

224
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,980
You must have been surprised because of me, Father.

225
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,400
Where did you learn to listen to other people's conversation?

226
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,100
You knew? I hid myself well too.

227
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,960
Go back to Gaegyeong.

228
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,120
Yes. I have to. But...

229
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,430
Are you going to do it? You're doing it, right? Doing it with that person.

230
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,780
It's not something you should be concerned about.

231
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,290
How can I not be concerned?

232
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,620
It's about you. What are you going to do?

233
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,290
Do you think I will waver just because of the words of a scholar I just met?

234
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,960
The decision regarding that organization will start tomorrow morning.

235
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,370
No! That person is incredible.

236
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,840
Teacher Po Eun also acknowledged him. Even inside Sungkyungkwan, he is greatly respected.

237
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,410
He is someone you can trust.

238
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,950
It's a bit strange to say that you will work with him immediately.

239
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,150
Still, just stamp the An Byeon Chaek for now.

240
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,630
It will be good for defeating Ho Bal Do, for the time being.

241
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,700
You have nothing to lose.

242
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,150
Nothing to lose?

243
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,270
They will surely be suspicious, but try to do it first.

244
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,880
That person surely has a way. That's why he told you about it.

245
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,770
I will not do it.

246
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:46,050
I will not do it. I won't do anything.

247
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,960
Go and sleep.

248
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,900
You shouldn't have killed Jo So Saeng.

249
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,210
You should've kept the gate of the Sssang Seong Colonial Office,

250
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,000
fought till the end with Jo So Saeng, the Boowonbae, and died gloriously! (Boowonbae: those who received support from the Yuan Dynasty to become successful)

251
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,030
But

252
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,400
you killed Jo So Saeng.

253
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,430
Since you killed him... Since you have already done it,

254
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,820
suffering, self-blame...

255
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:55,210
Loyalty... You should have given such a thing to a dog! Cho Joo Ji Ga...! (Cho Joo Ji Ga: the dog-like family that bit its owner; refers to Lee Seong Gye that betrayed Jo So Saeng)

256
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:01,440
If Jo So Saeng mocks our family, it's simply a matter of accepting Cho Joo Ji Ga as our family motto.

257
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,260
You...

258
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,420
How did you know that?

259
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,250
I...

260
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,590
On that day, I was there.

261
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,860
When I was ten-years old, at Do Hwa Jeon,

262
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,190
I saw everything.

263
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,960
To a child that age, what kind of presence a father is,

264
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,270
you know that, right?

265
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,620
You were my whole world.

266
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,750
It must be the same for all the fathers.

267
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,420
But you, Father, are General Lee Seong Gye.

268
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,490
But that son,

269
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,560
who's father happened to be General Lee Seong Gye,

270
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,200
saw you getting stepped on by that evil person, Lee In Gyeom.

271
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,250
In my hands, my legs,

272
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,930
even in my knees, I...

273
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,070
The strength in my words seemed to disappear.

274
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,280
It was hard to even stand.

275
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,430
It was hard to speak too.

276
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,550
Even swallowing was hard.

277
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,130
- During that time, I—
- The three high ministers of Do Dang...

278
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,150
You know everything that they are doing.

279
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,150
You know how bad those bastards are.

280
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,180
Are you more of a sinner than those people?

281
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,580
You are not. You know that more than anyone.

282
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,480
But why can't you do it?

283
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,280
To me, a person more deserving to be king than you,

284
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,870
I have never seen one in Goryeo.

285
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,560
Powerful, just,

286
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,580
and cares for the people. More than anything,

287
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,740
because of what those people said earlier,

288
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,460
you were genuinely hurting.

289
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,300
No. Is there anyone who is pained more than you

290
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,370
in the whole of Goryeo?

291
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,710
There's no one. None.

292
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,800
But why, Father,

293
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:14,210
are you not going to do it whwn you only think of yourself as being the one at fault?

294
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:31,610
You think that I am someone who can be a king

295
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,930
and that person, Jeong Do Jeon,

296
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,340
thinks that I have the qualities of a king. The reason for that

297
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,760
is because I know pain

298
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,070
and I know how to feel shame.

299
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,190
But if I come forward,

300
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,130
I will become someone who doesn't know shame.

301
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:05,780
So how can I get involved?

302
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,480
I, your father,

303
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,970
am that kind of person.

304
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,630
That's why I'm not going to do it.

305
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,270
Stupid bastard.

306
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,970
What an idiot.

307
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,230
Why did you say that?

308
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,810
Half-wit.

309
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,270
Darn it.

310
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,830
This wind is just bloody awful.

311
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,400
Why is that person here?

312
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,950
If Father won't start it, that person cannot start either.

313
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,250
Who are you?

314
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,790
What are you doing?

315
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,610
Let go!

316
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,460
I'm sorry.

317
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,530
What's with you?

318
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:43,710
Father is sending this to Teacher Sam Bong.

319
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,470
And he wants to say this:

320
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:54,200
"I cannot immediately give an answer for what you asked

321
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,160
but take this and prove yourself."

322
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,360
Lee Seong Gye's stamp

323
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,430
Also, you must leave Ham Joo tonight.

324
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:16,630
When tomorrow comes, he doesn't know how his mind will change.

325
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,540
I have delivered what my father wanted to say. I'll be going.

326
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,720
To come to that decision,

327
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,180
he had a really hard time.

328
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,440
As Father said it would be better if you move right away.

329
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,860
I have done it.

330
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,120
There's no turning back now.

331
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,150
General Lee Seong Gye is

332
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,170
is my father.

333
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:44,390
That General Lee Seong Gye who everyone says is powerful, just, and great.

334
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,960
You also think that way, right?

335
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,310
I was like that too until that day.

336
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,400
Gaegyeong.

337
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,650
It was the day I first came to Gaegyeong.

338
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,160
It was a really scary place.

339
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,950
Dead bodies were not covered in the marketplace.

340
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,700
Beggars stole my clothes.

341
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,970
The nobles,

342
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,430
simply to be able to eat delicious grilled pork,

343
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,530
kidnapped women

344
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,150
to breastfeed piglets,

345
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,310
and those women's babies died.

346
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,320
What is this?

347
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,860
Gap Boon's mother got kidnapped because of this?

348
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:56,570
Still, I wasn't intimidated by that kind of Gaegyeong,

349
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:03,140
because once my father comes, those evil bastards would be destroyed in one sweep.

350
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,270
Just wait. If I tell my father,

351
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,420
he will destroy this place in one swoop.

352
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,010
But on that day,

353
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,400
the son

354
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,990
found out, at that moment, that his father was also just a weak person.

355
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,600
It was like that.

356
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:39,810
Instead, at an early age, I quickly matured into an adult.

357
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,600
The thing that you are all doing. That thing Teacher Sam Bong is doing

358
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,670
is so amazing.

359
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,940
It's a perfect plan.

360
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,850
There's only one thing that went wrong.

361
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,440
Calculating on that one person, Lee Seong Gye.

362
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,430
My father

363
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,390
is not strong.

364
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,580
He is very distressed.

365
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,620
He's having a hard time and has many thoughts. He's too--

366
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:27,230
You only live once, and life is only one big event.

367
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,040
That's why I, more than anyone else,

368
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,830
wish for Teacher Sam Bong's plan to work out.

369
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,690
To defeat the Do Dang officials, turn the tables, and proudly,

370
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,880
proudly live with strength in my guts!

371
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,070
I wish to live like that.

372
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:50,570
You too, and my father,

373
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,730
and me.

374
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:02,560
That's why I stamped the An Byeon Chaek. If I did it,

375
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,140
if I did it, then father would do something.

376
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,450
You...

377
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,860
I hope that you're on my side. You have to be on my side.

378
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,220
When you first bit me,

379
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,020
when you set the fire,

380
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,600
when you tied me up in the forest and left,

381
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,000
I was on your side.

382
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,630
You're not going to scream, right? You also won't bite me?

383
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,580
Ah...

384
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,930
I didn't bite you.

385
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,770
If there is a problem, you have to be responsible for it.

386
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,850
You said you became an adult early, right?

387
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,430
Being an adult means taking responsibility.

388
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,710
Thank you.

389
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:37,650
I have wanted to say this if we ever meet again

390
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,360
because you saved me three times now.

391
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,230
Three times?

392
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,710
It's just two though.

393
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,870
But she keeps on speaking informally--

394
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,190
I thought my father was the strongest

395
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,650
but he wasn't.

396
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:06,320
♫ I have recognized you a few times
Thanks to you, ♫

397
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,780
♫ I'm alive ♫

398
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,240
♫ I restlessly follow your voice ♫

399
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,290
♫ Even after pushing me down a thousand times ♫

400
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:22,190
You said Boon Yi, right? Hey!
♫ I get drawn to you ♫

401
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:27,290
Hey! You! Hey!
♫ I am looking at you ♫

402
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,820
♫ On the path that has already collapsed ♫

403
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:39,000
♫ that one person protected me. I'm very grateful ♫

404
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,970
♫ to that one person ♫

405
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,300
He immediately left for Gaegyeong last night.

406
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,370
Even in Gaegyeong, there are probably Teacher Sam Bong's followers, right?

407
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:10,710
He wasn't allowed to go into Gaegyeong when he got exiled. Do you think he still has followers left there?

408
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:16,180
Then how will he get the An Byeon Chaek approved?

409
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,870
If you're going to say something, go ahead.

410
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,860
What is it that you want, Myeong Jeong?
(Lee In Gyeom)

411
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,260
Well, for us to take care of our responsibilities
(Hong In Bang)

412
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,540
we need to have the power that fits them. That's what I want to say.

413
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,670
If I give one, I should gain one. If I gain something, I should give something.

414
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,160
Isn't that what you always say?

415
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,110
If we will lower the taxes that we already increased, aren't you supposed to give us something?

416
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,660
What if I can't do it?

417
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,690
You will.

418
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,060
Besides us, you don't have alternatives, right?

419
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,130
If something happens, who would supply that many soldiers?

420
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:03,620
For the management of the Court, who-- will provide all those supplies?

421
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,410
I believe in your intelligence.

422
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,820
A sure method...

423
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,740
Is that the only way?

424
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:48,210
Lee Seong Gye's constellation...

425
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,570
Then, the alliance is broken.

426
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,820
General!

427
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,210
I can't immediately get a hold of the taxes, right?

428
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:58,480
Yes. It's like that at the moment.

429
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,090
So what are you going to do? Are you just going to let those bastards be?
(Choi Yeong)

430
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,200
Do you think that would happen?

431
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,140
Of course!

432
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:10,200
Please give me a little bit more time.

433
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,660
What?

434
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,190
Haven't you mistaken it?

435
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,290
Lee In Gyeom is thinking of

436
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,190
bringing General Lee Seong Gye to the highest government office.

437
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,530
If it's General Lee Seong Gye, among you here,
(Cho Young, Hwa Sa Dan Owner)

438
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,710
he can be an alternative.

439
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,600
See? I told you we shouldn't do it.

440
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,810
Ah, seriously.
(Gil Tae Mi)

441
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,030
Lee In Gyeom is such a frightening person, too.

442
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:41,900
What are you going to do now?

443
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,040
If Lee Seong Gye enters the Do Dang and
becomes on Lee In Gyeom's side, then it's a problem.
(Han Goo Young)

444
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,190
If we combine Lee Seong Gye's
military power and Lee In Gyeom's wealth,
(Woo Hak Joo)

445
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,420
even without us, the state of the union would still function.

446
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,420
Lee Seong Gye.

447
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,530
It's Lee Seong Gye.

448
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,600
If Lee Seong Gye enters the Do Dang,
(Do Dang: Goryeo's highest political organization)

449
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,950
he will keep Hong In Bang and Baek Yoon's men in check.

450
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,960
What are you saying?

451
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,730
What?

452
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:17,210
No matter how much I want to torment Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi,

453
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:22,490
do you think I will approve of something that will cause disturbance along the border and confusion on the frontier?

454
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,830
When Ho Bal Do is constantly waiting for an opportunity to invade towards the south, (Ho Bal Do: chief of the Yeojin tribe)

455
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,210
you want to call in the most competent general in the frontier?

456
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,430
When forces on the border were summoned to aid Mi Shil in the Silla courts,

457
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,640
even she returned the troops to protect the borders.
(Mi Shil: a heroine in Silla that had the courts in the palm of her hand)

458
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,320
But what do you take me for, Hapha?
(Hapha: another name for formally referring to Su Shi Joong/Prime Minister)

459
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:46,830
So are you saying that you're against it?

460
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,940
Of course.

461
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,060
It's something that must never happen.

462
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,690
What a fake woman. There's a way in Lee Seong Gye's constellation?

463
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,570
Go and immediately bring me that wench!

464
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,560
Yes, Hap Ha.
(Hap Ha: a name they call Lee In Gyeom)

465
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,760
Where have you been, Elder?

466
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,240
We will lower the taxes.

467
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,750
How?

468
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,290
I continuously persuaded them.

469
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,040
We shouldn't be like this.

470
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,570
I understand. I know how much you hate Lee Seong Gye.

471
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:54,530
Because of us, you've decided on that.

472
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,740
Yes. You and we are one.

473
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,550
Please give up on Lee Seong Gye.

474
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,300
Whether it's the taxes or the Union, we will follow your orders.

475
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,470
Well, look at this.

476
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:20,480
She said there's a way with Lee Seong Gye's constellation.
So it was this way.

477
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:33,550
Is it still not the time? Can I still not reach them?

478
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,200
That person is Hong In Bang.

479
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,500
His face says he won't live long.

480
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,680
Lee Seong Gye, Lee In Gyeom!

481
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:12,550
Is this where the astrologer woman from the West stays?

482
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,520
Open it.

483
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,700
Since I didn't give you compensation last time,

484
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,100
think of this as your compensation.

485
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,570
I will only accept this one.

486
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:48,710
If I accept too much, I'm afraid that my fortunetelling powers will become dull.

487
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:54,000
Fortunetelling powers? Do you have those?

488
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,730
Without those powers, how can I dare say such a thing?

489
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,440
Then,

490
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,880
are you going to come whenever?

491
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:16,280
Can I even reject someone's command?
(Yeon Hee0

492
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,810
Today, a certain girl said there's a way north
(Jeok Ryong, Bi Guk Temple Head Monk)

493
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,920
and suggested it to be Lee Seong Gye.

494
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,090
Ah, that! That's absurd! He looked at his fortune?

495
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,420
I also think that it is absurd.

496
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:43,300
But Lee In Gyeom is the one who was extremely against Lee Seong Gye entering Do Dang.

497
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,150
Who is that girl?

498
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,650
They say she's an astrologer from the West.

499
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:54,010
As I looked into it, something feels suspicious. Do you want to see her?

500
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,150
Bring her in.

501
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:09,660
Are you an astrologist from the West?
(Bi Guk Temple)

502
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,910
If you do this to someone connected to the Heavens, you'll be punished.

503
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,720
Is that so?

504
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,670
But how come you don't know your own fate?

505
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:26,730
My star is Cheon Jun from the north. Because it has come—

506
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,110
Cheon Jun are twin stars and it's not in the north,

507
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,210
but the west.

508
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,950
Who exactly gave you orders

509
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,230
and told you to lie to Lee In Gyeom so he would call in Lee Seong Gye?

510
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:57,310
If I make the other side of your face like this, will you talk? Hm?

511
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,210
You're smiling?

512
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,880
Fine. I'm part of the Sa Dang Pae.
(Sa Dang Pae: A troop of roaming acrobats)

513
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,360
A scholar came to me with ten gold nyangs and asked me to do this.

514
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,990
How much will you give me?

515
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:33,270
So you're someone I can communicate with. How about 50 gold nyangs?

516
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:38,000
I will give them to you right away. Who was that scholar?

517
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,930
Fine.

518
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,950
A person beside that scholar

519
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:50,060
called him Sam Bong.

520
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,600
Jeong Do Jeon!

521
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,520
Why would that person do this?

522
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,830
Jeong Do Jeon! Sam Bong, you bastard!

523
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,110
Whatever his goal is, the important thing

524
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,480
is that this is blocking your path.

525
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,750
What are you thinking of doing? Could it be...

526
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,760
Are you trying to punish me for defecting?

527
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,500
Aren't we supposed to look for him?

528
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,640
Of course.

529
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,130
There's been no trace for the last eight years.

530
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:36,360
We need a lot of time and effort...

531
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,500
Didn't I say I would compensate you?

532
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:44,940
Do you think I don't have the wealth? Find him!

533
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:55,900
But why is he getting mad at me?

534
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:02,560
I have to keep it in. That man is not a person.

535
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,980
He's just my treasure storage.

536
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,180
Darong, Garong, Jurong, Darong...

537
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,430
I will come to you with good news soon.

538
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,890
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

539
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:44,870
I'm sorry, My Lord... Suddenly, it got cut off...

540
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:59,640
S-Save me, My Lord! I've committed a sin worthy of death!

541
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,590
Spare me! Spare me!

542
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,890
Elder Dae Sa Seong.
(Dae Sa Seong: Head of Sungkyunkwan)

543
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,160
Elder In Bang! Hong In Bang!

544
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,670
It's been a while, Brother.

545
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,120
It's really been a while, Sam Bong.

546
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,700
I was curious about you so I've been asking around,

547
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,810
but there's no way of finding you.

548
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,430
You were looking for me?

549
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,140
Of course.

550
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,630
Everyone who went into exile has already come back.

551
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,970
You are the only one who hasn't come back yet.

552
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,170
Isn't it just normal to be worried?

553
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:06,040
Elder Brother who is worried about me is still the same.

554
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,570
The rumors about Elder Brother.

555
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,500
Why are they all horrid?

556
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,190
Why did you betray?

557
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,710
Betrayal...

558
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,950
How about saying it like this?

559
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,430
When I was young, I played with a rattle. You must be the same.

560
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,980
Where is that rattle now?

561
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,620
You don't know, right? You don't have a choice but to not know.

562
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,080
You don't have a use for it as you become an adult.

563
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,810
It's just something that I don't need.

564
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,960
Goals, virtues, justice, these things.

565
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,460
I've thrown them away. Why did you do it?

566
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,700
What is?

567
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,040
I'm asking why you hired a girl from a roaming troop

568
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,840
and called in Lee Seong Gye to block my path.

569
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,970
Are you surprised?

570
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,370
Do you think I wouldn't know even that much?

571
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,950
How about this?

572
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,320
Aren't you in the same organization as Lee Eun Chang?

573
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,960
What are you doing?

574
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,110
Are you doing something that I can be grateful for?

575
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:10,530
Since you already know that much, then talking to you will be easier.

576
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:14,200
But Lee Eun Chang doesn't know about the organization.

577
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,600
We were separated in front of Jangpyeong Gate and didn't know about each other.

578
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,260
It is true that I hired the roaming troop girl. Why, you ask?

579
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,640
I needed to know your situation.

580
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,310
I'm thinking of helping you.

581
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:35,020
My situation? You're going to help me?

582
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,300
Yes.

583
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,730
You, bastard, can't even go into Gaegyeong. You're just a homeless bastard scholar.

584
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,140
I'm one of the three most powerful people in this country.

585
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,090
A bastard like you dares to know my situation and help me?

586
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:48,470
Your life only shone for a short time at Jangpyeong Gate.

587
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,370
Shameless bastard.

588
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,140
We shook it off and stood up again as scholars, but

589
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:59,740
during that depressing Year of Eul Myo, we were all severely tortured.

590
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,610
I became a criminal in one day and went to exile.

591
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:08,980
Also, I don't even think of the past conviction and great cause that I used to embrace.

592
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,800
How was it when you went into exile?

593
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,310
"When will this exile end?"

594
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,940
"Am I going to be forgotten like this? Is this the end of me?"

595
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:21,350
Desperation and horror. We went through sleepless nights.

596
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:25,170
I've forgotten a lot as a scholar, but...

597
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,770
There's one thing I didn't forget.

598
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,650
You would probably be the same.

599
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,850
Are you saying that a bastard like you is the same as me?

600
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,520
Yes. We are the same.

601
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,280
How exactly are we the same? A bastard like you?

602
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,660
Lee In Gyeom! Choi Yeong!

603
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:43,970
We won't just leave those people be. We will make them fall!

604
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,230
Isn't that right?

605
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,720
What exactly are you saying?

606
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,060
I, Jeong Do Jeon,

607
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,820
have also thrown that rattle away. That's what I'm saying.

608
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:59,320
Yes! I don't even know where I threw out such a thing. I don't even think about it.

609
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,900
Instead, I will gain strength, I will gain power.

610
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,000
Just that.

611
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:08,940
To do that, I need you.

612
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,430
You also need me.

613
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,850
Why do I need you?

614
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,040
You can never win against Lee In Gyeom.

615
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,660
I will put you higher than Lee In Gyeom.

616
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,840
You're saying that you will abandon your scholarly ways and join hands with me?

617
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,380
You want to be like me?

618
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,090
What are you planning?

619
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:36,290
Of course, I shouldn't be like you.

620
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:39,310
I can't be a bastard who the world talks about.

621
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:44,300
But we are going down the same road, so we are just accompanying each other for a while,

622
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,650
until we defeat Lee In Gyeom and Choi Yeong.

623
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,160
Let's do it together until then, Brother.

624
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,280
After that?

625
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,740
If we're going together until then,

626
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,850
what about after that?

627
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,260
After that...

628
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,090
You and I compete, like Gun-Gon-Il-Chuk, for Goryeo.

629
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:10,950
Gun-Gon-Il-Chuk: compete with fate on the line in a single match

630
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:15,070
Isn't it a very interesting thing in a man's life?

631
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:05,550
Jeong Ryun Am

632
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,450
Elder Bon Won.

633
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,470
So you're dressed like that.

634
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:27,670
It's my first time wearing it so it's awkward.

635
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,210
Do you have everything ready?

636
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:32,580
Last night, I was studying an astrology book for two hours.

637
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,490
You don't have to know that much.

638
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,170
That person called Jeok Ryong is good in astronomy

639
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,820
so you have to bluff a little bit.

640
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:48,210
It's about time for Lee In Gyeom to call you in.

641
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,040
Has he not come yet?

642
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,620
It must be coming.

643
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:58,550
Is there a astrologer woman from the West who stays here?

644
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:02,570
It seems that they are here.

645
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,040
Everything went according to your prediction.

646
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,660
Did you know it will go like this?

647
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,250
General Choi Yeong cares for General Lee Seong Gye.

648
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:18,040
I have done this, because I knew he would not be a man to take away troops from the more pressing front lines.

649
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:24,080
So you don't have a plan regarding bringing General Lee Seong Gye into Gaegyeong?

650
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,130
That's the second.

651
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:29,260
The first is the An Byeon Chaek.

652
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:34,520
The finalization of the An Byeon Chaek now hangs on to Hong In Bang.

653
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:40,080
Yeon Hee.

654
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,510
You know, I

655
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:47,920
am going to work with the bastards who killed Lee Eun Chang.

656
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,820
I haven't even found his remains yet,

657
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,710
but I put this humble drink here,

658
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:02,120
where Eun Chang and I shared a firm determination

659
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,520
in this place, Jeong Ryu Am.

660
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,470
He has lived through troubled times.

661
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,730
Don't be bothered

662
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:26,470
and don't look back.

663
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,950
Eun Chang, this is the beginning.

664
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:36,500
Please, watch over us until the end.

665
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,330
Six Flying Dragons

666
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,250
An Byeon Chaek?

667
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,790
Is there any better bill than this?

668
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,880
Did you send the An Byeon Chaek to the Do Dang?

669
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,170
-You've been found out!
-What is it?

670
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,190
You secretly stamping it.

671
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,150
Bang Won, you bastard!

672
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,910
I heard you were looking for a storyteller so I came.

673
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:27,930
I thought that as long as we were alive, the day we would meet would come.

674
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:28,910
Yeon Hee.

675
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,870
We have to get rid of them now.

676
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:34,980
He will soon come looking for me. I will put a knife in his anxious hands.

677
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,360
Lee Seong Gye...

678
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,780
Why are you here at this time of the night?

679
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,880
Approve the An Byeon Chaek tomorrow.

680
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,620
The deal will be after that.
