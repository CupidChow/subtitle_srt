Episode 24

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,420
Gil Seon Mi...

4
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,730
The merchant from before? No...

5
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,940
Teacher Ha Ryun who was disguised as a merchant.

6
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:15,070
I was extremely curious about who you are. Lee Bang Won, you say?

7
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,970
Looking at it closer, his physiognomy is not ordinary.

8
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,070
What are you doing right now?

9
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,540
Why do you follow Jeong Do Jeon?

10
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,760
Because I believe in Teacher's world.

11
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,610
What kind of world?

12
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,150
This world? A world like this?

13
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,920
It seems that you know something

14
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,620
Dividing the land among the people. Are you against that?

15
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,840
I don't have much interest in the affairs of the world.

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,730
Dividing the land? I don't care if it works or not.

17
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,710
It won't happen anyway. What I'm interested in

18
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,800
is the one who owns the world.
(Ha Ryun)

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,680
The connection among those people, where should I position myself.

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,390
I'm only interesting in such things.

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,860
Reading your face, you're probably the same.

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,200
You're like me.

23
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,010
Ah, this is really killing me. Why is everyone like this?

24
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,340
You have the same physiognomy as I?

25
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,340
Yes. We both look cute.

26
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,110
I'm sorry but when was the last time you looked at a mirror?

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,020
You don't know how to read your own physiognomy, right?

28
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,210
Ah, of course, you are a little bit more good looking than me,

29
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,310
but physiognomy is not read like that.

30
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,080
Hong In Bang. That man said that too.

31
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,000
The whole time I was a scholar, he would say, "You and I are alike."
(Lee Bang Won)

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,990
"Hold my hand." While saying things like that...

33
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,660
Well, you probably know how it ended for him.

34
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,650
Hong In Bang?

35
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,870
The two of you are totally not the same. You're total opposites.

36
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,180
Gil Tae Mi? He surely, died though...

37
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,040
I'm not Gil Tae Mi!

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,290
He's a twin.

39
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,220
Ah... Gil Seon Mi?

40
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,540
You know me, right?

41
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,490
I do. The new best swordsman.

42
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,920
So you don't remember.

43
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,400
I have a lot of things to ask you.

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,480
Isn't a swordsman supposed to ask with his sword?

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,810
You're a perfect "yang" person.

46
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,870
Hong In Bang is completely "yin" but he said you're the same as him?

47
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,720
You don't have darkness in your heart.

48
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,630
Of course, you commit shady schemes too.

49
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,910
But you really don't have shady thoughts.

50
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,350
Because you don't have darkness, you don't feel guilty either.

51
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,920
Of course, when something goes wrong, you would at least reflect.

52
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,860
But have you thought about it?

53
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,920
Bitter regret, a deep feeling of guilt in my heart...

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,430
As if it will swallow me up.

55
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,430
Have you felt that?

56
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,810
No?

57
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,620
It will come someday since I'm still young.

58
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,830
Also, the thing that separates the two of you.

59
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,730
You have to command people. Hong In Bang needed to serve them.

60
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,740
Until the end, Hong In Bang had to serve Lee In Gyeom.

61
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,280
But you are not like that. So from here on,

62
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,730
it would be good for you to find people you can command instead of people you will serve.

63
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,670
You remember Jang Sam Bong, right?

64
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,500
Jang Sam Bong?

65
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,060
What is your request?

66
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,390
Please protect that child.

67
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,200
You left me in Jang Sam Bong's care.

68
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,140
He's Yeon Hyang's son?

69
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,470
Yeon Hyang's son is the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms...

70
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,150
I think you have a lot to say to me...

71
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,900
Master!

72
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,750
The man who has the box is dead. The item also disappeared.

73
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,430
This... All of us failed in our tasks.

74
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,500
Let's look for it separately. Let's go.

75
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,190
Yes.

76
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,720
That is Young Master Bang Won's arrow.

77
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,050
There is also a man of power that we don't know about on this mountain.

78
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,390
Get rid of the corpse in such a way that we won't leave any trace behind.

79
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,110
Yes.

80
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,470
It means that Young Master Bang Won took it.

81
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,100
What are you doing? We need to hurry and find Young Master.

82
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,170
If those people find Young Master Bang Won first, they will steal it.

83
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,170
Hurry.

84
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,840
Let's go.

85
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,140
You said that you're not interested in the affairs of the world,

86
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,420
but what are you going to do with this?

87
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:56,170
Dividing lands. I'm not interested in that. It also won't work.

88
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,120
But this plan that was made to prepare for the division of lands

89
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,500
can be a very powerful weapon.

90
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,660
For example...

91
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,620
It's locked. Is anyone out there?

92
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,600
Try to break this lock.

93
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,810
There is no sword.

94
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,560
There is a spy among us.

95
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,470
Hurry and let them know.

96
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,730
You know that you will die if you scream, right?

97
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,010
He's someone who fully understands that.

98
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,830
Looking at how you're holding the knife, it seems awkward.

99
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,080
Have you even killed a person before?

100
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,450
No. It's my first time holding a sword and I haven't killed a person before

101
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,810
but I can do it any time.

102
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,070
Yes. I can guarantee that.

103
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,700
It's true. She's someone who can do that.

104
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,420
What are you going to do with this wooden box?

105
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,970
You're seriously noisy.

106
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,400
But what are we really going to do?

107
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,230
Escaping is not the important thing. We have to escape with this.

108
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,030
Let's do this.

109
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,830
If you come closer, this girl will die.

110
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,190
Just try to come.

111
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,100
Hurry and chase him.

112
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,360
How can that person's physiognomy also be a mess?

113
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,490
The corpse was stripped of her clothes.

114
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,210
A spy is hiding among us.

115
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:43,880
The hostage. It was the hostage you dragged out.

116
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,820
That's why you should've trained your brains while training your sword skills.

117
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,780
This bastard!

118
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,650
It will good if you don't do this.

119
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,000
It's Lee Bang Ji.

120
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,960
We're pulling out.

121
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,160
Young Master, are you okay?

122
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,320
Let's hurry and go. Boon Yi is waiting with the item.

123
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,040
Gil Tae Mi?

124
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,500
How can a servant-like person recognize Gil Tae Mi as well?

125
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,640
How much did he push himself around?

126
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,460
Then, Gil Seon Mi?

127
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:13,480
I'll keep this short. Hand over the package.

128
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:21,220
No. You can't take this as long as I'm breathing.

129
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,380
Don't put your life on the line for nothing and just hand it over.

130
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,580
It's not even your anyway. At most, that is your master's possession, right?

131
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,550
It's not mine.

132
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,550
It is the same as my life.

133
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,540
This child's eyes...

134
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,480
Are you really throwing your life away?

135
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,030
Gil Tae Mi?

136
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,900
Brother!

137
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,310
Get away from my sister.

138
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,380
Sister?

139
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,200
Then, this girl is Yeong Hyang's daughter?

140
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,600
It's Gil Seon Mi, Gil Tae Mi's twin.

141
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,320
The legendary master who disappeared.

142
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,700
Legend or whatever. I think you're making a huge mistake right now.

143
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,680
If that woman gets hurt, there are an enormous number of people who will come running putting their lives on the line.

144
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,380
So you're Boon Yi and you're alive.

145
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,560
If you lay even a finger on Boon Yi...

146
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,040
Go.

147
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,960
I'll see you again.

148
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,880
Wait!

149
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,790
Don't be impatient.

150
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,980
If you live your life wielding a sword, we'll see each other again.

151
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:41,900
Or you can chase after me while leaving that child who put her life on the line for that important parcel.

152
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Do whatever you want.

153
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,330
I'm meeting you again after a long time, Monk.

154
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:08,210
It's the first time after 1366 when we had an internal faction struggle with that person.

155
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,630
Is that person in good health?

156
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,110
He's probably not in a good mood.

157
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,550
I wasn't able to secure the item.

158
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:22,410
So is that person after that item?
(Jeok Ryeong: Bi Guk Temple's Head Monk)

159
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,170
If not, why else would I step forward?

160
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,650
That person thinks differently than us about Lee Seong Gye.

161
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,580
I will stay here for now and watch over the progress.

162
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,720
Yes. I understand.

163
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,060
Do you know a woman called Boon Yi from Ga Byeol Cho?

164
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,250
Boon Yi?

165
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,520
I'm not sure. It's my first time hearing that name.

166
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,040
Should I try to find out?

167
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,700
No, it's fine.

168
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,010
Good.

169
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,090
We found it after Boon Yi treated it as more important than her life.

170
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,490
I know your heart more than anyone else. I will never forget it.
(Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon)

171
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,310
Thank you.

172
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,060
Now, Woo Jae and I will write an appeal so you guys have a rest.

173
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,540
But Teacher,

174
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,940
I met Ha Ryun in that place.

175
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:34,800
Ho Jeong? So it was Ho Jeong who sent the thief to Jo Joon's house.

176
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,010
Ho Jeong also knows what this is.

177
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,700
Yes. He knew about it.

178
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,100
We have to quickly start before Ho Jeong writes up another plan.

179
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,500
Tell Nam Eun to figure out the direction that side is going for.

180
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,400
Yes.

181
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,550
What? You lost it?

182
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,780
You talked so big but how were you handling things?

183
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,650
We were one step late. I'm sorry.

184
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,790
This, this!

185
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,820
What are we going to do? If the confiscating of lands get written up and exposed,

186
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,680
I will become penniless.

187
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,550
We can't be tricked like this.

188
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,490
Of course.

189
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,440
I will not let it end like this.

190
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,740
What about a different plan?

191
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,810
I have it.

192
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,990
What is it?

193
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:28,010
My next plan is Teacher Lee Saek.

194
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,720
What? An impeachment regarding the land appropriations?
 (Mostly land taken from the people by the Gwon Moon Sae Jok)

195
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,690
Yes. That's right.

196
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,770
Lee Seong Gye will impeach the land appropriations of the Gwon Moon Sae Jok.

197
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,840
But why are you telling me that?
(Lee Saek)

198
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,780
If this goes on, it's only a matter of time before Jo Min Soo and the many Gwon Moon Sae Jeok members will be kicked out of the Do Dang.

199
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,200
You have to protect those people, Teacher.

200
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,740
What?

201
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,150
Illegally seizing and taking away other people's land,

202
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,390
is a crime that needs to be punished.

203
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,480
How can I protect something like that?

204
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,540
Because we need to stop Lee Seong Gye and Sam Bong's next move.

205
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,880
Next move?

206
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,360
It's land division.

207
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,450
Didn't I tell you?

208
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,350
He's trying to change the country's system. That is dividing land equally and giving them to the people.

209
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,500
He is trying to get rid of land ownership.

210
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,490
That does not make sense.

211
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,700
In order to do that, the land possession information, population numbers,

212
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,960
land area, land quality, land classification, and even land forms...

213
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,880
He has to figure out all of those.

214
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,300
Jo Joon. Jo Joon has achieved that great feat.

215
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,400
Teacher you might be safe from the land expropriation,

216
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,560
but more than half of the Sadaebu who follow you

217
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,710
will not be free from the problem.

218
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,290
In order to enact the Land Distribution Law in the future, they are trying to

219
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,140
take out the ones who will be against it.

220
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,400
Jo Min Soo and the Gwon Moon Sae Jok.

221
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,110
When half of our Sadaebu leave the Do Dang,

222
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:17,240
you and the remaining upright Sadaebu alone

223
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,810
cannot stop Lee Seong Gye's forces.

224
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,370
Teacher.

225
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,180
For the greater cause,

226
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,080
you need to protect Jo Min Soo.

227
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,380
He's already gone to write the appeal.

228
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,530
Yes.

229
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:46,080
Since we brought the documents safely, he left in a hurry to write the appeal.

230
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,570
Now the Land System that we dreamed of will come true.

231
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,970
Everything won't be resolved immediately,

232
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,150
but if the impeachment appeal gets approved tomorrow,

233
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:00,210
we will be able to retrieve all the stolen lands from the Gwon Moon Sae Jok.

234
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,320
Yes, tomorrow
(Yeon Hee)

235
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,780
the land appropriation crime that seemed like a customary thing will be punished.

236
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,160
Now, we are finally setting out on the first step.

237
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,170
You must be really happy.

238
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,230
Are you really that happy about destroying the land ownership?

239
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,750
Yes.

240
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,000
It just makes me keep smiling.

241
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,720
Maybe my dream is really going to come true.

242
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,650
A dream?

243
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,970
Getting back our lands and going back to our home with my brother.

244
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,090
You shouldn't leave out Yeon Hee who comes from the same place as you guys.

245
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,690
She is giving you looks.

246
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,640
Bang Ji, Yeon Hee and you should all go together.

247
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,290
Pardon?

248
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,740
The problem regarding the land appropriation really needs to be solved.

249
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,370
Please give me a chance.

250
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,520
I will figure it out.

251
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,080
Right now, isn't it more important to stop Lee Seong Gye's actions?

252
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,510
Teacher, it's not a mere coincidence that the 'Eighteen sons become the king' rumor started.

253
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,790
Someone purposefully making up that song is a different problem than

254
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,080
that song spreading so widely.

255
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,670
You need to be on guard against Lee Seong Gye.

256
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:43,530
Sam Bong... Why are you making me protect them?

257
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:50,310
Do I need to once again endure these wolves in order to stop a tiger?

258
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,930
What are you currently saying?

259
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,210
Teacher Lee Saek and Jo Min Soo have had a secret gathering.

260
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,620
They probably agreed to reject the appeal that Teacher is going to make.

261
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,860
Ho Jeong has made a move so quickly.

262
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:11,800
You can just think of it as a friendly baduk match between an old sunbae and hoobae.

263
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,430
Ha Ryun, so you really want to have a match with me?

264
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,800
What should we do?

265
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,460
If the Sadaebu who follow Teacher Lee Saek oppose it,

266
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,070
we'll be inferior in numbers and the appeal won't go through.

267
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,910
If Ha Ryun has made the two completely opposite groups join forces,

268
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,530
then I'll just to go in between and separate the two.

269
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,740
Is there a way?

270
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,750
Did you listen to Teacher Lee Saek?

271
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,230
Yes, we listened.

272
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,050
We have to join forces and stop Jo Joon's proposal.

273
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,640
You two have done some land appropriating as well, right?

274
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,590
Watch what you're saying.

275
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,420
Even if we did,

276
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,910
it probably won't even come close to a tenth of yours.

277
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,990
In any case, today let's join our forces and show the power of the majority.

278
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,260
Of course!

279
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,160
Mencius once said,

280
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,840
"Benevolent politics start from correcting the boundaries of the lands."

281
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,940
Recently, vicious people, without exception, have taken the common people's lands away,

282
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,990
so there are five, six or more owners of a tract of land.

283
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,050
People ended up having to pay taxes more than ten times in a year.

284
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,210
So we remonstrate to break the land ownership system,

285
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,540
and redistribute the taxed lands.

286
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,150
Before that,

287
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,230
there is something we have to take care of.

288
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,840
Before we break the land ownership,

289
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,460
we have to reveal the corrupted people that took over lands illegally,

290
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,780
and decide on what's right and what's wrong.

291
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,590
The reason the land ownership is so messed up is because this country has been attacked by foreign forces for so long.

292
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:19,280
Yes. Since we used all of our resources for war, and gathered men to protect the country,

293
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,480
things have happened in this way.

294
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,600
Yes. That is why I'm saying to decide on what's right and what's wrong.

295
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,190
But if we are to decide on what's right and what's wrong,

296
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,050
then we have to investigate each and every land of ours.

297
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,420
Of course. It'll take years.

298
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,640
This isn't something that can be done from one man's research.

299
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,790
The country!

300
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,740
The country has to do it publicly.

301
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,660
Yes, of course.

302
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:55,380
Then you are agreeing on investigating the lands.

303
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,760
Those are not the opinions of the Do Dang members,

304
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,690
but saying that since the country's current land problems aren't something that can be fixed right away,

305
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,840
by gradually...

306
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,370
Yes, gradually.

307
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,490
We have to take care of it gradually.

308
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,750
The ones with over ten-million square meters squared of appropriated land.

309
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,490
How about we investigate them first?

310
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,660
If it's ten-million square meters

311
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,560
then it doesn't affect me.

312
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,630
Ten-million square meters...

313
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,870
Then it will just be they who

314
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,740
are affected and they can't say anything about it.

315
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,850
Sam Bong, you bastard.

316
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,390
You've completely destroyed the alliance with the ten-million square meters cutoff line.

317
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,840
Mok Eun (Lee Saek's nickname) isn't going to turn his back on us, is he?

318
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,250
We've been completely fooled by that bastard Sam Bong!

319
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,870
We are the only ones who have been cut off!

320
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,140
Sunbaenim.

321
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,290
What do I do?

322
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,210
Jeong Do Jeon... This Jeong Do Jeon has destroyed my plan to falsely claim their capability.

323
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:47,110
And now Teacher Lee Saek doesn't have the justification to join forces with them.

324
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:53,270
Damn it. These idiot Gwon Moon Sae Jok taking up ten million meters squared of land.

325
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:57,960
Then does that mean you can't get a government position this time?
(Lee Sook Bun)

326
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,620
No... We should think about next step.

327
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,940
A tactician must never stop thinking.

328
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,830
A tactician dies if he stops using his brain.

329
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,390
Colleague...

330
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,730
That's right.
(Jung Mong Joo)

331
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:33,470
- Your plan to divide them has worked.
- I sent the appeal without discussing it with you first.

332
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,610
Forgive me.

333
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,620
Ho Jeong was trying plot a scheme, so I had to do it secretly.

334
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,310
Do you think I'm like this because you did it secretly?

335
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,210
Are you really going to make Teacher your enemy?

336
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,740
Teacher started it first.

337
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,640
Teacher secretly allied with Jo Min Soo and enthroned His Majesty.

338
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,240
But you and Teacher,

339
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,960
do you really have to be in a conflict like this?

340
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,740
The ones I'm in conflict with are the Gwon Moon Sae Jok.

341
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,200
And it is Teacher who chose the Gwon Moon Sae Jok.

342
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,260
Like that one time.

343
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,560
Sam Bong!

344
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,010
General Lee Bang Shil, General Jong Se Hoon,

345
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,220
and our teacher, General Kim Duk Bae.

346
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,910
The three generals of the army got framed for treason,

347
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,830
and when the innocent children died in the midst of it for no reason,

348
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,390
you and I asked the heavens, brought it up to His Majesty,

349
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,800
and asked our Teacher Mok Eun to remonstrate it.

350
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,990
That's right.

351
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,590
The heavens ignored it,

352
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,640
His Majesty executed the three generals of the army, and Teacher Mok Eun

353
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,440
stood on the side of His Majesty and stayed silent.

354
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,450
That time... Teacher gave us a response.

355
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,700
He said, "There is no justice in history,

356
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,940
and that the inevitability in politics is bigger than the greatness in truth."

357
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,610
Yes, as a Confucian scholar, I

358
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,360
am still wandering between the two things.

359
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,730
I cannot agree to that.

360
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,120
Isn't it the same for you?

361
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,950
No, I cannot agree to it either. But Teacher is also just human.

362
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:32,270
Can't you just see him as another human that couldn't fight history face to face?

363
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,430
What's so important about me accepting it or not?

364
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:43,520
Teacher is already going his own way.

365
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,920
Aigoo, aigoo.

366
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,060
How on earth did this happen?

367
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,910
Aren't they just trying kick the Gwon Moon Sae Jok out of the Do Dang?

368
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,080
Yes. This must not continue anymore.

369
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,630
That's right. We have to at least have a countermeasure.

370
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,650
I have arranged to meet Lord Lee Saek tonight.

371
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:12,360
He's not going to approve Lee Seong Gye's doings, so don't worry too much.

372
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,680
Teacher, you have to make a decision now. What are you going to do?

373
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,800
Are you going with those people or not?

374
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,810
Since the cut off is ten-million square meters, most of us Sadaebu are unaffected.

375
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,420
Teacher, forgive me for saying this.

376
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:33,150
Protecting the people with ten-million square meters of appropriated land...

377
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,860
We don't have the justification for it.

378
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,850
Yes.

379
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,490
This is definitely Sam Bong's plan to separate us.

380
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,870
Do I really have no choice?

381
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:51,300
But, Sam Bong, aren't you supposed to consult with Po Eun now?

382
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,150
Shouldn't we go together?

383
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,520
Yes, of course. I will do that.

384
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,970
Teacher.

385
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,050
Don't you have thoughts of doing this with Teacher Po Eun?

386
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,580
Why do you ask?

387
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,400
Why is it that you have never told Teacher Po Eun about the work we are doing?

388
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,360
Because I really want to do it with him.

389
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,430
Pardon?

390
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:41,180
Among the most important positions in our work, one is for Brother Po Eun.

391
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,160
When and how I should ask him if he wants to do it together,

392
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,920
I have thought about it many times, but...

393
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,130
Then, what is it?

394
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,690
Honestly, I am a bit scared.

395
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,440
Scared?

396
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,100
If I get rejected,

397
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,460
the work we are doing will face a crisis.

398
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,120
Unni.

399
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,740
Hm?

400
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:29,450
Ajussi wanted me to tell you to watch Jo Min Soo's side more closely than usual.

401
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,420
Alright.

402
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,470
Unni.

403
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,250
I'm sorry about yesterday.

404
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:45,250
I didn't mean it as leaving you behind when the time comes for us to go back to our village.

405
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,040
You know that, right?

406
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,710
I... Is it possible for me to go too?

407
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:04,450
When that day comes, I...

408
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,120
You think I can go together with you?

409
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,940
Unni.

410
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:21,480
If it's possible... If I can...

411
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,300
Of course. Let's go together.

412
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,510
We must go together, got it?

413
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,280
What kind of training is that?

414
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,370
It's a training to control an object with the sword.

415
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,750
How come you know so much?

416
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,640
I have seen Bang Ji Orabi do his training many times.

417
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,390
But does that... Does it work?

418
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:17,100
He says it does work. But he doesn't know too much about it yet.

419
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,760
Moo Hyul. Aren't you supposed to be doing the same training?

420
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,660
There is no way that will work.

421
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,620
The best swordsman is doing it so there's probably a reason to it.

422
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:36,820
I'm really busy with perfecting the last move of the 24 moves of the Twin Dragons of the East, Grandma!

423
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,130
You're busy? Well, you have to at least do something

424
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:45,070
so work hard on that Twin Dragons of the East.

425
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,100
Brother!

426
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,490
Unni Yeon Hee asked me if she can go with us too.

427
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,680
What are you talking about?

428
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,110
Unni Yeon Hee said that if the day comes when we finish this work,

429
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,030
will it be okay for her to come back to our hometown with us.

430
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,600
Lee Bang Ji

431
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,220
You like that too, don't you?

432
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,490
Now that I look at you, you and Lady Yeon Hee like each other.

433
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,070
So you're in a relationship where you both like each other and stuff.

434
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,870
- No!
- No?

435
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,660
Forget that. Just clean up the bowls.

436
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,210
Why are you doing this to me?

437
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,030
What are you talking about?

438
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:01,590
If the area of the land is 10-million square meters, then there is no way that can be fair.

439
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,990
That's a crime.

440
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,770
So?

441
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:10,030
I cannot work with you anymore.

442
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,450
There are actions that I've taken and things I've said as a Sadaebu,

443
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,310
but you're telling me to go against Jo Joon's plan.

444
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,250
And so?

445
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,590
Leave Do Dang on your own accord.

446
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:33,010
If you do that, then I will discuss the land problems with General Lee and make it more advantageous to you.

447
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,210
Trust me and step back now.

448
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,190
That is everything I wanted to tell you.

449
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,670
Let's go.

450
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,270
Yes.

451
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,470
You know...

452
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,110
I didn't know that Lee Saek would be like that.

453
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,690
We can't just stay like this.

454
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,230
If we don't stay still...

455
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,250
Go to Lee Saek even now—

456
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,290
The problem is Lee Seong Gye!

457
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,810
It's not Teacher Lee Saek.

458
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,090
Do you still have something left to say?

459
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,790
Yes.

460
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,790
Yes. Gather the troops.

461
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,250
What? Troops?

462
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,350
Are you telling us to create a coup or something?

463
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:54,410
I'm telling you make it appear to be so.

464
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,490
Lee Seong Gye and Jeong Do Jeon are very aware of what the people think.

465
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:05,210
The thing that they are planning won't work if the people won't follow them.

466
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,870
It hasn't been long since they got rid of the Do Dang Triumvirate.

467
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:15,750
Also, the blood spilled on the Royal Court after you pulled back the troops hasn't dried yet.

468
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:23,230
They can't say it out loud but the people are cursing at Lee Seong Gye's back for attacking General Choi Yeong.

469
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:28,730
But another battle with the comrade of the army withdrawal.

470
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,270
Lee Seong Gye won't be able to do it no matter what.

471
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,830
So just pretend to be preparing the troops.

472
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,410
I have never pretended in my whole life.

473
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,730
If I said I'll do it, I really do it.

474
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,490
Yes, yes. Up until now, you must have.

475
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,230
But please try it this time.

476
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:00,250
Then, those people will surely negotiate with you

477
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,500
and extend their hand.

478
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,220
Guys!

479
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,570
Yes, sir?

480
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,580
Send the men right away.

481
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,760
Tell my troops in each region to come to the capital.

482
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,830
Are you talking about all the soldiers?

483
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,130
They have to arrive at the outside of Gaegyeong by sulshi (7pm-9pm) three days from now.

484
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,120
You must do all this secretly.

485
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,620
Yes, I understand.

486
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,350
Each of you go to your designated regions and bring 500 soldiers

487
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:03,850
to Gaegyeong Jangpyeong Gate, Tanhyun Gate, Tongduck Gate. It's the lord's orders.

488
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,290
Yes.

489
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,890
Give us some drinks and snacks.

490
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,010
We're here.

491
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,810
Aunt!! Aunt.

492
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,330
Get us some drinks and snacks.

493
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,360
Please forgive me.

494
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,220
Let's go.

495
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,150
That...

496
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,350
You must treat me well... kiddo.

497
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,290
Here.

498
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,800
Oh, isn't that Miss Yeon Hee?

499
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,310
Who?

500
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,910
Bang Ji's lover.

501
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,530
Miss—

502
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,790
Miss!

503
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,560
Miss, are you alright?

504
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,930
Oh! Bang Ji!

505
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,050
What happened?

506
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,430
Just a few moments ago she suddenly collapsed.

507
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,130
Miss, are you alright?

508
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,880
Yes, I just lost conscious for a bit.

509
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,960
Are you okay?

510
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,670
Um, I'll be going on my way...

511
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,810
Please take care.

512
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,600
Aren't you overdoing it? Why would you faint when you're fine?

513
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,240
It's nothing.

514
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,400
I'll be going on my way now. I have things to report to Bon Won.

515
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,220
Yeon Hee.

516
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,790
I heard from Boon Yi.

517
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,770
If everything turns out great,

518
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,980
we'll go to our village together--

519
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,330
I never said that.

520
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,470
Also, it won't happen.

521
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,240
I'm leaving.

522
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:52,350
There's been a problem. Jo Min Soo ordered the troops from each territory to gather.

523
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,250
Things aren't looking too good.

524
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,000
Isn't he trying to create a coup d'etat since he's pushed into a corner?

525
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,350
We have to tell the Ga Byeol Cho and—

526
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,480
No.

527
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,610
What do you mean?

528
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,570
We can't have a war at this time.

529
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,040
What if they do something first?

530
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,410
I'm going to meet the General right now.

531
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,360
Aish...

532
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:26,920
I... I wasn't copying you. I was wondering if I can do it or not...

533
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,710
Moo Hyul.

534
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,610
Want to have some drinks?

535
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,430
Drinks?

536
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,110
Bang Ji. Ddang Sae.

537
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,420
Aigoo, this guy can't drink at all.

538
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:48,050
You were chugging it down, so I thought you could hold your alcohol.

539
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,930
If you asked me to have some drinks, then you should be keeping me company.

540
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:56,270
This, what is this?

541
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,040
Hey!

542
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,330
Bang Ji!

543
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,090
Give me some water.

544
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,100
What? Water?

545
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,570
Alright.

546
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,350
Why did it have to be today?

547
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:52,450
No... Why did I

548
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,470
have the thought about going back today?

549
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,730
Like an idiot, why did I...

550
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,450
Even though I'm no longer weak...

551
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,650
How could I faint from seeing that man.

552
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,390
I...

553
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,250
didn't even know who he was.

554
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,980
Because he was wearing a satgat (traditional bamboo hat),

555
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,520
I couldn't see his face.

556
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,080
But

557
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,020
I ended up seeing his face.

558
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,570
After that day,

559
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:01,530
I couldn't remember his face even if I tried.

560
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:08,350
But I remembered in an instant.

561
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,470
Also,

562
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:21,750
the place in which that horrible incident happened...

563
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,310
I remembered that wheat field.

564
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,640
Ddang Sae.

565
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,640
I...

566
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,380
I thought I forgot about it.

567
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,660
But...

568
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:05,150
The man who was wearing a satgat (traditional bamboo hat).

569
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,400
How can this happen? How?

570
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,870
General Jo Min Soo gathered the commanders of the Left Army,

571
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:30,490
and ordered to gather up soldiers from each territory.

572
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:36,770
Since Teacher Lee Saek turned his back on him, he must've thought he was in a bind.

573
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,950
He's saying it's all in or nothing.

574
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,610
Since he saw what happened to Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi, he must feel very desperate.

575
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,980
Even if we wi—

576
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,190
This,

577
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,210
This isn't right.

578
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:53,350
Yes. Even if we gain the support of every person in Goryeo, we can't determine its success or failure.

579
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,730
If a war breaks out, we will lose the favor of the people.

580
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:01,070
But if we stop the reform now—

581
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,770
We are not stopping it. We are just slowing one step.

582
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,030
Even if we put down the coup, we have to calm the people.

583
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,550
And to continue the reform again, we will be behind at least ten steps.

584
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,750
I will try to negotiate with General Jo for now.

585
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,670
Yes.

586
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:26,410
We should have been more thoughtful regarding the reform, but I guess we were too impatient.

587
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:33,970
Then give us time to clean up our land problem.

588
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:37,650
Yes, I will do so.

589
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,890
I like that.

590
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,030
I will withdraw the order on the soldiers.

591
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,630
You've thought well.

592
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,910
I'll leave then.

593
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:57,050
General Lee. If we think about it, up until a while ago, we were comrades of the withdrawing army, going through the troubles together.

594
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,790
We shouldn't be doing this.

595
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,130
Yes, that is so.

596
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,070
How about dinner together?

597
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:10,290
Come to Dohwajun with all the commanders that suffered at Wihwa Island.

598
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:13,410
I will hold a banquet as an apology.

599
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,490
A banquet?

600
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,790
Did you have a good talk?

601
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:25,410
We've cleared the misunderstanding too.

602
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,570
That's a relief.

603
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:31,710
I've told the prime minister here, but I'm planning to hold a banquet tonight.

604
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,830
I would like for you to be there too.

605
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:39,390
Oh, is that so? I'll check to see if I can make the time.

606
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,130
Yes, then...

607
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:47,810
A banquet?

608
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:51,630
He told me to come to Dohwajun tonight.

609
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,910
I'm withdrawing the command to gather up the soldiers.

610
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,110
Yes, sir. I will do that.

611
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:11,090
And prepare a banquet.

612
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:13,910
A banquet?

613
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:20,390
Lee Seong Gye and his people will come to the banquet tonight, one that they won't leave alive.

614
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,650
Prepare that for me.

615
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,750
A banquet you say?

616
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:31,250
I guess he must have been embarrassed.

617
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:36,510
Since it's turned out like this, I'm going to go empty out the Dohwajun's alcohol storage.

618
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:41,750
I've checked for sure that Jo Min Soo's soldiers coming up have gone back.

619
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:47,310
A banquet... I guess that Jo Min Soo guy was impetuous.

620
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:50,810
He hated that kind of thing, saying that it's not his taste.

621
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,450
That was probably Ha Ryun's suggestion.

622
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:59,230
Since we've decided to forgive each other, make sure to attend and show your sincerity.

623
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,530
I won't go along.

624
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:06,370
I'm going to comfort the heartbroken people. Please give out some drinks.

625
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,850
This isn't running away, but a retreat.

626
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:14,550
Retreat is also a very important military tactic.

627
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,870
Yes, father.

628
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:20,610
Dohwajun? We are going to Dohwajun?

629
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,230
Guys he said Dohwajun! He said Dohwajun!

630
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,390
Yes, prepare for tonight—

631
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:30,710
Seriously!! Why should we drink together with them? Huh?!

632
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,030
Do you think I've no one to drink with? Do you want to drink with me?!

633
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,950
Hey!

634
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:38,070
I mean seriously! Comrades of the withdrawing army, my ass.

635
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,810
All he did was stab our general in the back as soon as we got here.

636
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,310
You can't think of such things when you go there.

637
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:48,530
It's something that was hard for the general to decide for our cause.

638
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,350
If, tonight, any one of you causes a commotion,

639
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:57,230
or starts a fight drunk, I will not let you go easily. Do you understand?

640
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:57,830
Sure.

641
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,470
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

642
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:03,390
- Yes.
- Yes, I understand.

643
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:09,150
Why are you throwing that away?

644
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:10,670
Aigoo...
-Aigoo!!

645
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,090
Ah... Dohwajun...

646
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,070
Do you like it? Like it? Seriously!!

647
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:28,090
Yes I like it. I mean it's Dohwajun!

648
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,090
You will go too right?

649
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,310
Why would I go there?

650
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:36,870
You don't even have anything to do.

651
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,570
You go to Dohwajun like what Moo Hyul said.

652
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:42,930
Are you going as well?

653
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:48,590
I am not going, but I just have a weird feeling.

654
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:54,210
I think I will be relieved if you are there. So go.

655
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,110
I understand.

656
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:21,690
You are here? Gerenal Jo is waiting for you inside. Please go in.

657
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:31,090
This is a banquet. Please leave those dangerous weapons out here.

658
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,530
Ah... Sure.

659
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,410
Welcome, General.

660
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:24,810
Thank you for such a warm welcome.

661
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:32,110
It's such a nice day, so I've told my family and people of Dohwajun to all gather and have a drink.

662
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,450
Take care of the people that came together.

663
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,790
Yes, sir.

664
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,810
Please enter.

665
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,390
Please have a seat.

666
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,990
Thank you.

667
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,670
Alright.

668
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,010
Six Flying Dragons
Preview

669
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:20,150
For the forgiveness of the comrades of the withdrawing army's mistakes,

670
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:23,350
and for the great Goryeo's future, let's all have a drink!

671
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:25,390
The signal is when I break my cup.

672
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:27,230
You cannot make any mistakes.

673
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,630
There was this young girl that I had my eyes on.

674
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,150
She was all crying and--

675
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,210
Right now take Bang Ji and go back to Ga Byeol Cho.

676
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:38,290
Lee Seong Gye and I can't exist together anyway.

677
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,350
So I have to strike first.

678
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,710
Jo Min Soo, you bastard!
