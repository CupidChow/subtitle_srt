00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,960
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,400
How is this...

3
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,220
It's my Hyung-nim.

4
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,560
Is that so?

5
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,120
I am the owner of Saryang Group of Haejoo.

6
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,950
Jeong Do Jeon. Why is this person here?

7
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,290
Are you members of Nameless?

8
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,930
Episode 40

9
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,410
Isn't that Owner Cho Young? Why is she in a place like this?

10
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,280
Secretly follow her. You must not lose her. Do you understand?

11
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,840
Yes.

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,450
Did he perhaps come here knowing of our identity?

13
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,810
No. It couldn't be. He would have brought soldiers otherwise.

14
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,270
Why are you looking at me like that?

15
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,750
Yook San: Nameless member

16
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,270
It's nothing. Just that you're the owner of Saryang Group

17
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,200
and you look really remarkable.

18
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,190
Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon

19
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:47,640
You also don't look like someone who is in the business industry.

20
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,480
Yes. That's right.

21
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,050
Actually, I have no experience in business, but

22
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,490
this time, I'm thinking of putting together the family fortune and trying it,

23
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,610
so I've been asking around here and there.

24
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,420
So I have something to ask you, considering that you're from Haejoo.

25
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,680
Is that so?

26
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,880
If this person is Nameless, then was this a trap from the beginning?

27
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,950
Why did you really come here, Jeong Do Jeon?

28
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,340
Then, that man is Lee Bang Ji.

29
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,960
Yeon Hyang's son.

30
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,850
Yes. What is it that you want to know?

31
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,850
Yes. About Mount Guwol in Haejoo...

32
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,190
It's already late so how about staying for the night?

33
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,040
The baekjaju (a kind of alcoholic drink) here tastes really good.

34
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,780
There's no way of knowing how many people there are. For Bon Won's safety, we have to get out of here for now.

35
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:26,930
I appreciate the offer but time is also wealth for a businessman. I have things to do.

36
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,020
Is that so? I enjoyed talking to you today.

37
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,090
Well, then.

38
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,280
Come.

39
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,040
It's clearly Nameless' seal.

40
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,530
That merchant is either Nameless or is connected to Nameless.

41
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,800
If he's a Nameless, don't you think they would know about you secretly meeting a Yeojin tribe chief?

42
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,580
Who?

43
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,450
It was Jeong Do Jeon.

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,070
He is Bonghwagun Jeong Do Jeon?

45
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,290
Why would Sam Bong meet with Mo Hen Pa?

46
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,350
It seem that you even got it stamped.

47
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,760
He received a document from Mo Hen Pa. It was in a red envelope.

48
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:39,120
Then, the most powerful man in this country had a secret agreement with Mo Hen Pa.

49
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,840
Perhaps this person is...

50
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,520
If my guess is right, that document...

51
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
What is it?

52
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,380
- You.
- Yes, Teacher.

53
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,090
- That guy Seo Ko is here right?
- Yes.

54
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,560
Take him and chase after Sam Bong. There should be a red envelope.

55
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,180
There will be Lee Bang Ji, so make sure avoid hastily starting a fight. Do you understand?

56
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,090
I understand.

57
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,850
Is that true?

58
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,820
Yes. It was Owner Cho Young. I got someone to follow her.

59
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,650
Then, it's confirmed that this merchant group is a part of Nameless.

60
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,040
I can't tell how many are stationed there. Let's get out of here first.

61
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,330
I will go to the Kanggye government office. Let's go.

62
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,400
Let's go.

63
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,600
Kanggye Government Office

64
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,790
What brings an important person like you to this lowly place?

65
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,840
Immediately send soldiers to Mansang Merchants (a group that primarily deals in trade with China)

66
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,240
and arrest everyone there.

67
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,220
Pardon? Why all of a sudden?

68
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,060
Arrest them and immediately report back to me. We'll talk again then.

69
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,630
Yes.

70
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,660
You, immediately go back to Gaegyeong and deliver this to Yeon Hee.

71
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,520
Please let His Highness know through Her Highness.

72
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,440
Yes.

73
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,230
Also, let them know about the situation here and you must secretly follow Cho Young's whereabouts.

74
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,730
Yes. I understand.

75
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,760
You got Boon Yi's member to follow Lord Sam Bong without telling me?

76
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,710
Yes. Boon Yi still hasn't decided

77
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,330
but until then, she needs to keep on working.

78
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,900
That is not the problem.

79
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:45,770
The problem is you moved the organization without telling me.

80
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,760
There shouldn't be anything in this household that I don't know about.

81
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,840
Your Highness.

82
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,360
I guess I shouldn't have come here today.

83
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,300
I guess the day I go is the market day (Korean idiom/proverb for bad timing). Sorry.

84
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,650
But, you know,

85
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,150
this is not the time for the two of you to fight.

86
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,080
Breaking up in front of the enemy is a shortcut to defeat.

87
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,950
It's not that.

88
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,150
Bang Won, are you there?

89
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,790
Hyung-nim.

90
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,830
You're here? I will bring tea.

91
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,060
Yes, Sister-in-law.

92
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,400
Who is this?

93
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,640
I am Ha Ryun.

94
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,620
Ah! Ho Jeong!

95
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,110
Teacher Mok Eun's rag.

96
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,150
Rag...

97
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:56,470
Don't take his words to heart. He's like that to me too.

98
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,250
Bang Won, I went to the palace and talked to Father.

99
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,360
I earnestly asked him to forgive you now.

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,620
Father has also gotten old.
(Lee Bang Gan - Prince Hwae An, 4th son)

101
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:21,430
He said that he will sleep on it for a day and told you to come tomorrow.

102
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,870
Me?

103
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,530
Prince Hwae An quickly brought him.

104
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,130
How could he dare take his time when you had sent orders for him.

105
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,170
What have you been doing these days?

106
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,270
I've been reading books and passing time talking to my older brothers.

107
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:00,650
Is it true that you have a connection with Nameless?

108
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,080
Father, what are you saying?

109
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,290
Your Highness, that's impossible.

110
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,190
Why aren't you saying anything?

111
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,460
Did Bonghwagun (Jeong Do Jeon) say that to you?

112
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,170
Why are you talking about him here? Aren't you supposed to answer my question?

113
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:34,970
Father... How can I communicate with those rebellious people?

114
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,680
There's nothing like that.

115
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,460
So what did he say?

116
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:48,240
He asked me if I will accept any punishment if I'm connected to Nameless.

117
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,600
So I said yes and came here.

118
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,760
Is Sam Bong trying alienate you?

119
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,220
I'm not sure.

120
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,480
Do you not have other news regarding Sam Bong?

121
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,400
Sam Bong met with a Yeojin tribe Chief called Mo Hen Pa at the border.

122
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,940
He went to the border as a border affairs official,

123
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,160
so it's possible for him to meet with a Yeojin tribe chief.

124
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,640
Yes. That's right.

125
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,780
Military force is not the only factor to stabilizing the frontier, but

126
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,000
why did he secretly meet him disguised as the owner of a merchant group?

127
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Disguised?

128
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,300
Do you think he's plotting something?

129
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,620
Sam Bong, what are you going to do?

130
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,500
Are you really going to do it?

131
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,760
What do you mean?

132
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,900
What I heard at the Yeojin tribe barracks.

133
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,950
Liaodong... Will you really...

134
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,490
There's nothing set in stone.

135
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,520
I can follow through but it's also possible to fail.

136
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,240
I don't understand.

137
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,220
The chaos and retreat from Wihwa Island is because of that.

138
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,210
It was the original plan I've had as I dreamed of this great work.

139
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,850
If we end up doing it, it will be done after a thorough review and will be closely prepared.

140
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,390
Then, when are you thinking of doing it?

141
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't know when the heavens will let me.

142
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,070
But the Ming's country that took over, and our new country have both just started.

143
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:38,160
Our first relations will have a great effect on the hundreds of years to come.

144
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,050
We have to prepare everything.

145
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,780
But a variable that I cannot estimate is Nameless.

146
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,540
I've sent soldiers to the Mansang Merchants so let's wait for now.

147
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,850
Pardon? It was Sam Bong?

148
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,960
That's right.

149
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,830
Then, did he target this place...

150
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:06,410
It doesn't seem like he came here knowing about our identity, but

151
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,790
something is ominous.

152
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,600
Why did he secretly meet with Mo Hen Pa?

153
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,650
Teacher. This...

154
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,800
Did Sam Bong enter this room?

155
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,120
I met him here.

156
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,870
Sam Bong found out.

157
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,910
This place is now dangerous.

158
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,240
Where is the warrior of the Cheonji branch?

159
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,090
I ordered him to steal Sam Bong's document but...

160
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,250
It's not the time to stay here like this.

161
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,810
We have to make haste. We need to get out of here.

162
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,780
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,900
That woman just got robbed.

164
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,660
What do you mean robbed?

165
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,750
You'll know if you look closely. It's something that I was really good at back in the day.

166
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,760
Aigoo, you punk!

167
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,940
Is pick pocketing something to brag about? You must be proud!

168
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,370
Wait!

169
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,010
Give it to me. I'll cut your head off right away.

170
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,270
That envelope... It's the one we saw at the merchant's, right?

171
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,210
Give it to me.

172
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,880
Pardon? What are you saying?

173
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,020
I will not ask you twice. Hurry!

174
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,330
It's not something that you should take.

175
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,730
Ah, I'm sorry.

176
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,490
Oh! I think I dropped it on my way here.

177
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,310
It's not here.

178
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,630
Our base is in danger.

179
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,970
Darn...

180
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,080
Who stole it?

181
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,070
Sorry. I don't know.

182
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,850
I have to report the situation to Mugeuk.

183
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,210
What should I do?

184
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,820
Go to Byeokrando and wait for an order.

185
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,500
Yes. I understand.

186
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,250
Let's go.

187
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,540
What? Nobody was there?

188
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,740
No.

189
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,400
Not only was no one there, the whole merchant place seemed to have disappeared.

190
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,760
I understand. You may leave.

191
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,300
It means that Nameless has found out that you met with the Yeojin tribe.

192
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,430
My Lord, I apologize.

193
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,230
The envelope you gave me was stolen.

194
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,810
What does that mean?

195
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,460
What are you saying? It was stolen?

196
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,920
Was it Nameless?

197
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm not sure if it was Nameless, but

198
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,240
when I followed the boy who stole it, he was already dead

199
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,380
and the envelope was missing.

200
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,040
What a failure.

201
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,740
I'll have to go to Gaegyeong.

202
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,950
This is too much!

203
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,120
What's wrong? Please calm down.

204
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,500
Lord Sam Bong did something wrong.

205
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,310
Look here.

206
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,830
How can he leave such an important task

207
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,970
to Hwa Sa Dan without letting the investigation bureau know?

208
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,410
It was Owner Yeon Hee. She's been helping with Lord Sam Bong's work for a long time.

209
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,950
She's also the person who knows about his work more than anyone else.

210
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,880
It's the job of the royal court anyway,

211
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,350
not Hwa Sa Dan's!

212
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,950
Also, the meritorious contributions and the crown prince's installation were

213
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:22,000
decided by His Highness and Lord Sam Bong without Lord Jo Joon knowing.

214
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,870
Is this still okay?

215
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,740
Ah, the wood...

216
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,120
Shin Jeok and Lord Nam Eun?

217
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,870
Yes.

218
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,540
Saying that Lord Sam Bong worked with Owner Yeon Hee without saying anything,

219
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,900
he was complaining to Lord Nam Eun.

220
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,500
If Lee Shin Jeok is acting like that, do you think others would just stay still?

221
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,510
It means Lord Sam Bong's actions have greatly changed.

222
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,410
It seems that he's doing something important by himself.

223
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,590
Something important...

224
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,520
A person like Sam Bong didn't consult the royal court and

225
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,910
without Shin Jeok knowing, he's plotting something.

226
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,630
What could it be?

227
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,160
I'm not sure.

228
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,800
Whatever it is, it must be something secretive and dangerous enough cause an internal conflict.

229
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,870
What? Nameless?

230
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,230
Mansang Merchants in Kanggye

231
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,010
That seems to be one of Nameless's operations.

232
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,350
Cho Young was in that place.

233
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,230
Then, it is possible that the document went into Nameless' hands.

234
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,760
If Owner Cho Young was there...

235
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,880
Yes. One of our spies is following her.

236
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,080
I told Cho Young to go to Byeokrando and wait for now.

237
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,440
Where is that document?

238
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,000
It seems that an unknown side has taken it.

239
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,030
The problem is when that document goes into someone else's hand,

240
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,260
imagine if it went to Nameless.

241
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,770
It's just matter of time until it reaches Prince Jeong An.

242
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,630
What about the preparation of Myo Jak Dan?

243
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,960
It's almost ready.

244
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,460
We can use it whenever we need it.

245
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,250
For now, tell Cho Young to head to Ming's country and make contact with Jin Dae In.

246
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,510
Ming's country?

247
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,590
Why, of all a sudden?

248
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,300
If Jeong Do Jeon met with Mo Hen Pa, then don't you think

249
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,060
there is a chance that we'll have to plan something in Ming's country?

250
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,860
Yes, Mugeuk.

251
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,420
But the document that Jeong Do Jeon received from Mo Hen Pa,

252
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,900
could it really have been stolen by thieves?

253
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,440
If that's not the case...

254
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,710
Ajusshi.

255
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,120
You, you...

256
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,230
What is this cart?

257
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,220
Ajusshi what's wrong?

258
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,580
That is...

259
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,820
What happened?

260
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,720
I'm asking you what happened?

261
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,250
Seon Dol...

262
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,360
I just told you to tail them. When did I tell you to steal that?

263
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,390
I mean what could I have done when he suddenly went for it?

264
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,670
That kid

265
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,760
did it to receive compliments from leader Boon Yi.

266
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,280
Our poor Seon Dol...

267
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,390
Aigoo, what are we going to do...

268
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,010
Don't worry. I'll do well.

269
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,270
After I return, my wage will increase too.

270
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,180
Who could have taken it?

271
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,800
I don't know.

272
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,810
I heard he was about sixteen or seventeen years old.

273
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,830
Are you saying you put Boon Yi's organization members on Sam Bong's tail?

274
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:29,250
Could it be one of Boon Yi's organization members, perhaps?

275
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,190
In the Western district,

276
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,080
I said we should cultivate the wasteland.

277
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,080
In the end,

278
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,130
we got caught and all of it was taken.

279
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,500
If I hadn't said to cultivate the wasteland

280
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,920
Un Nyeon

281
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,350
might not have died.

282
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,600
What are you saying?

283
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,660
Are you... The reason Seon Dol died—

284
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,330
Are you thinking it's your fault?

285
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,040
Back then,

286
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,330
when I would receive land by myself

287
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,690
I was thinking of going back home.

288
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,450
I wasn't able to think straight.

289
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,420
So I just allowed Seon Dol to go.

290
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,920
If it had been like usual,

291
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,680
I wouldn't have sent such a young kid.

292
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,720
No. Boon Yi. Don't say stuff like that.

293
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,070
Stop saying stupid things.

294
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,420
Ajusshi.

295
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,740
Should we all

296
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,750
just stop together now?

297
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,140
I want to stop. Yeah.

298
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,210
Everyone thinks so too.

299
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,670
It's a bit scary now.

300
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:18,860
Even if we tell them to be friends again, they're not going to listen.

301
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,400
Still,

302
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,190
I think I'm going to try it.

303
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,230
Before someone dies again.

304
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,100
Please call Boon Yi.

305
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,910
Actually, Boon Yi just asked to see you in the cave of Mount Janam.

306
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,070
It seems like she has made a decision.

307
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,920
Is that so?

308
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,190
It's not important what her decision is.

309
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,290
You have to hold on to Boon Yi no matter what.

310
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,800
Boon Yi and her messenger organization

311
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,430
can be used effectively for us during a critical moment.

312
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,060
Also during that critical moment

313
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,060
Lord Sam Bong and Yeon Hee

314
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,160
can be made to hesitate and waver by her, even if it's just a little bit.

315
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,070
So no matter what—

316
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,320
I will do as I see fit.

317
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,430
I apologize.

318
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,660
You two aren't someone that someone like me can bring out here.

319
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,820
I have done something rude.

320
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,440
But I did it because I was that desperate,

321
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,390
so please forgive me and listen to what I have to say.

322
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,800
Prince Jeong An told me that as long as the heart beats,

323
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,060
you can't just do nothing, so he told me to make a choice.

324
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,960
Just why are you talking about that in this place?

325
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,240
And Lord Sam Bong said that in order for the country to be a place where the people can live in comfort,

326
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,520
all of the princes' powers have to be taken away.

327
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,330
It's not something that you should talk about.

328
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,120
I apologize, Lord.

329
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,890
But,

330
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,360
from what I think, now is the time to bring it up

331
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,320
and also the place to do it.

332
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:28,810
I know what you went through in this cave

333
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,240
because I heard from Yeon Hee.

334
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,580
After I heard that story, I cried a lot too.

335
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,150
I heard that you started the great cause because of those children.

336
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,350
What is it that you are trying to say?

337
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:50,050
Those children in the cave waited and hoped for the Red Turbans to go away,

338
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,650
but when the Red Turbans actually retreated,

339
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,130
they were faced with such tragedy.

340
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,230
There was kid named Seon Dol.

341
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,500
Yes, there was.

342
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,160
That kid, more than anyone,

343
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,620
also wanted the new country to be opened.

344
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,450
But

345
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,170
as soon as the new country opened

346
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,980
he died horribly.

347
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,610
He was only seventeen.

348
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,210
It happened while tailing you.

349
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:46,230
And I heard that a while ago, Yeon Hee's person was murdered too.

350
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,540
It happened while tailing Prince Jeong An.

351
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,730
I just can't understand it with my lacking head.

352
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,350
Just why do we have to be like this?

353
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,040
I ask of you earnestly.

354
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,940
Moo Hyul, my brother, and me.

355
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:15,580
And the countless number of people who fought for you two with their lives.

356
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,820
If you two fight, please don't stomp on those people

357
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,190
and let them live.

358
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,970
Boon Yi.

359
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:33,420
What happened to Seon Dol is very regrettable.

360
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,610
Not only that

361
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,790
everything is regrettable.

362
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,600
But...

363
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,310
It seems that times where pleas for sympathy will work have all passed.

364
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,590
As for myself,

365
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,510
and probably His Highness too,

366
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,850
we each have to go forward with what we believe in.

367
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,660
You

368
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,750
trying to get us to reconcile

369
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,760
called us here.

370
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,850
So foolish.

371
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,690
Then we'll quit.

372
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,680
All of our organization.

373
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,580
Now we

374
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,590
will no long do either of your tasks.

375
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:36,590
You said that you can give only me some amount of land.

376
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,070
But I can't just ignore my members.

377
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,870
And without doing this work, there is no way that all of our members can live and eat.

378
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,560
So

379
00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:00,350
you two please find a way for us to live and eat.

380
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,020
For making the new country,

381
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,030
didn't we contribute even a little bit?

382
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,700
It's not that only the meritorious contributors did everything.

383
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,170
It's alright even if it's not very rich.

384
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,550
It's alright even if it's a wasteland.

385
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,340
Waiting for the equal land division that we have no idea when or if it will ever happen,

386
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,860
we can't no long provide support for the fight you two are having.

387
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,200
Please give us land that we can live and eat on.

388
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,680
No.

389
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,710
I definitely told you

390
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,150
if you leave me by your own decision,

391
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,240
that will be the end and I will respect your decision.

392
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,480
But that is all.

393
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,410
There is nothing more than that.

394
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:55,630
If it's your entire organization, it will be a few hundred people.

395
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:59,720
This country is ruled by law, ordinance, and system.

396
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,450
Without a fair and just reason,

397
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,530
we can't just freely give out that much of land.

398
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,080
This country's land is no longer under personal ownership.

399
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,890
Unlike Goryeo, land can't be bought or sold.

400
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,980
Okay. I understand.

401
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,930
Then now

402
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,320
my plea is over.

403
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,450
What?

404
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,880
Starting now,

405
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,110
I am thinking of making a deal.

406
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,840
This red envelope. You know what this is, right?

407
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,620
How is that..?

408
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,380
Is that it?

409
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,950
I knew it would be Boon Yi's organization.

410
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,850
But what is that white envelope?

411
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,910
And this

412
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,720
is a record of when and who Prince Jeong An met.

413
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,760
Are you saying you put a tail on me all this time?

414
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,660
Boon Yi, you?

415
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,600
These two envelopes will probably a very dangerous weapon for you two.

416
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,370
Please forgive my rudeness.

417
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,000
But

418
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,800
we have to live.

419
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,560
For us common people, staying alive is the only path.

420
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,680
So I will sell these

421
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,960
and in return give us a way to live.

422
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:00,880
I will have to have a talk with Prince Jeong An.

423
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,240
You three step outside.

424
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,440
I beg you.

425
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,540
What are you going to do with Boon Yi's items?

426
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,990
Are you going to buy them?

427
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,540
I won't be able to give her land,

428
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,950
but I think I will be able to give them another way to live.

429
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,970
Just what is that red envelope

430
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,040
that you are trying to come up with another way for them to live?

431
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:12,390
It is something you will find out in the near future.

432
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:19,590
Anyhow, Boon Yi's organization will end up leaving you.

433
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,620
Will you agree to it?

434
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,590
Yes, do that.

435
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,400
Let's do that.

436
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,430
Then--

437
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,900
Do you think that I won't be able to do well if I'm in charge?

438
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,600
This country.

439
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,320
Or

440
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,350
is it that you hate

441
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,480
the king being outstanding?

442
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,070
I am trying to make a country that is not controlled this and that way solely by an outstanding king.

443
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,400
So is that why you took over all the personnel authority, military authority and everything else?

444
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,080
Since this is the early period of founding a country, I am only doing that temporarily.

445
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,720
Also

446
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,270
the royal family

447
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,430
can't ever participate in politics.

448
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,450
You know about the Five Rules of the King.

449
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,620
Yes. I heard.

450
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,290
So

451
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,000
is that why you turned your back?

452
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,800
Since I found out there was no place for me from the beginning

453
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,840
what else would I do?

454
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:40,280
But when Prince Jin An did that to Lord Han Goo Young

455
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,060
you also thought of Prince Jeong An as the crown prince.

456
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,730
I did.

457
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,880
Just like I thought of Po Eun as this country's prime minister,

458
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,080
I thought of Prince Jeong An as this country's crown prince.

459
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,360
But

460
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,210
both of them

461
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,410
ended on top of the Seonji Bridge.

462
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:13,210
So you are probably not going to stop.

463
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,650
No.

464
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,270
If I'm alive,

465
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,600
I have to do something.

466
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,210
I will also strengthen my resolve.

467
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,510
So that Your Highness can throw away that greed

468
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,550
I will try my best

469
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,470
to end it quickly.

470
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,510
That doing so is good for each other,

471
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,650
Your Highness taught me that,

472
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:54,030
that night at Seonji Bridge.

473
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:03,970
Since you put it like that, it has taken some of the burden off my shoulders.

474
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,090
I was worried that like the time with Lord Po Eun,

475
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,700
you were going to say you'll try to persuade me

476
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,960
till the day you die.

477
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,000
How did it go?

478
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,320
Have you made the decision?

479
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,620
I will do as you wish.

480
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,180
But it won't be land for cultivation.

481
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,930
All of your organization can live together,

482
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,310
can utilize your skills,

483
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,630
and it does not go against fair and just reasons since it helps the country.

484
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,550
Where is that place?

485
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,100
It's Ban Village.
(Place where servants who assisted Seonggyungwan scholars used to live)

486
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,550
Ban Village?

487
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:03,520
Isn't Ban Village right next to Seonggyungwan?

488
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,770
It's a place that assists the scholars and teachers with everything.

489
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,180
But after Po Eun died,

490
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:15,660
it became empty after many scholars and servants left.

491
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,570
You go and take up its space. The people that used to be there are servants, but

492
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:25,000
you guys don't need to be servants.

493
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,430
I'm moved to tears by your gratitude.

494
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,070
I had thought to follow your decision, even if you didn't forgive my rudeness,

495
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:36,660
and decided to take my life.

496
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:51,610
I'm sorry and thank you, Lord.

497
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:00,250
Thank you Your Highness.

498
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,080
Thank you very much.

499
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:33,020
In truth, this letter--

500
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,870
Throw it away

501
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:43,400
Don't ever fool around with something fake like that. That was close.

502
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,640
♫ Even if I throw it away, sometimes even when I throw myself away  ♫

503
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,900
I...

504
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,560
♫ You are on my side ♫

505
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,130
Even though you knew it was fake, why did you...
♫ Because I was afraid I will be a burden ♫

506
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,820
Well...
♫ When I try to push you away ♫

507
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,780
Though I'm living with a beast's heart
♫ You become the light in the sky  ♫

508
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,960
perhaps...
♫ And rise up ♫

509
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:31,610
Perhaps because I remembered that I used to be a person,

510
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,050
for a moment
♫ Many times ♫

511
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,190
I wanted to act like a person.
♫ I recognize you ♫

512
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,950
How did you know?
♫ Because of you ♫

513
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,120
You are not good at fooling me.
♫ I can live on ♫

514
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,650
Just like I can't fool you.
♫ Your voice ♫

515
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,300
I'll be going.
♫  I follow breathlessly ♫

516
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,940
I...
♫ Even if I try to push you away a thousand times ♫

517
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,800
That bug...
♫ I am pulled towards you ♫

518
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,730
We talked about that bug once.

519
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:03,990
That bug—

520
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,190
You mean, did I swallow it?

521
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:11,030
I don't know who swallowed who, but

522
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,850
if I can only stay alive by swallowing it,

523
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,990
then I will swallow it.

524
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:23,230
You too. If you can only live by swallowing something,

525
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:26,420
whatever that is, swallow it.

526
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:30,950
Swallow it and stay alive.

527
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,380
That's good.

528
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:47,260
We found the secret agreement document and Boon Yi agreed to do that.

529
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,620
Are you feeling better now?

530
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:57,460
If at least our Boon Yi can be away from this place of nonstop misfortune,

531
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,640
then it is a good thing.

532
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,400
Aigoo. This is so pitiful.

533
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,230
So pitiful.

534
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:29,650
Seon Dol. I'm sorry.

535
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:37,450
Why is it that I can't learn anything

536
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,710
without getting hurt?

537
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,480
So that Your Highness can throw away that greed

538
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,780
I will try my best to quickly end it.

539
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,900
Yes, I too will try my best.

540
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,240
Aren't you Fourth rank Official of Investigation Bureau, Lee Shin Jeok?

541
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,320
Yes, Your Highness.

542
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,460
What brings you here?

543
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,240
Could I have a talk with you?

544
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,900
I've found out the whereabouts of Cho Young.

545
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,820
She is staying at a merchant inn in Byeokrando

546
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,300
and she is going to board on a ship going to the Ming's country.

547
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,420
The Ming's country?

548
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,360
Yes.

549
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,920
We can send soldiers before then to arrest her.

550
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,840
Since I found out that there was no place for me from the beginning,

551
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,260
what should I do?

552
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,020
What happened with Myo Jak Dan?

553
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,480
Then, today...?

554
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,040
Would it be possible?

555
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,200
Yes. I'll prepare for it.

556
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:10,550
Selecting the meritorious contributors and the farmer and manufacturer event did not go correctly.

557
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:16,110
It seems like you have a lot of complaints about being a second class meritorious contributor.

558
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,110
You know that's not what I'm trying to say.

559
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:23,290
Don't you know Lord Sam Bong has changed a lot after founding the country?

560
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,360
He changed after Teacher Po Eun passed away like that.

561
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,660
So he also has resentment towards you.

562
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:42,600
Official. We are not really close enough to have a talk like this in the middle of the night.

563
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:48,650
Get to the point.

564
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,350
I want to serve you.

565
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,740
Saying that Lord Sam Bong is only working with Hwa Sa Dan Yeon Hee without discussing it with him,

566
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,220
he was complaining to Lord Nam Eun.

567
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:06,580
Lee Shin Jeok seemed to have a different attitude towards the Doomeundong incident.

568
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,910
Did Lord Sam Bong tell you to do that?

569
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:22,510
To try to find out my intentions by telling me you'll serve me?

570
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,910
Are you thinking that I'm a spy?

571
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:28,650
Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.

572
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:34,350
Whether you are honestly going to serve me, or whether you are trying to infiltrate as a spy,

573
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,000
there's no sincerity.

574
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,110
What?

575
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,960
Just because of something like that,

576
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,740
you are going to abandon Elder Sam Bong, who you've served with your life, and

577
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,760
serve me instead?

578
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,720
How am I going to believe that?

579
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,790
Whichever it is, try to persuade me better.

580
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,720
What is it?

581
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,740
Someone came and asked to give you this letter.

582
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,700
To me?

583
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,750
Do you not have any more?

584
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,420
Can you not think of anything else to say to persuade me?

585
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,450
Then please take your leave,

586
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,010
since you failed at whichever one you were trying to do.

587
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,680
Are you going to leave?

588
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,560
You're right.

589
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,560
I'm not abandoning Elder Sam Bong just for that reason.

590
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,340
Then what?

591
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:03,350
Lord Sam Bong, with Yeojin tribe leader Mo Hen Pa

592
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,040
made a secret agreement of some kind.

593
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,260
He is talking about that red envelope.

594
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,690
A secret agreement?

595
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,830
What kind of secret agreement did they make?

596
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:30,190
I'm embarrassed to say this, but I don't know anything.

597
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:33,570
Because he does everything with Yeon Hee!

598
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:39,250
Whatever the secret agreement is,

599
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:43,590
this will have an immense effect on diplomatic matters with the Ming.

600
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:48,370
He is independently doing something that should be done according to the public opinion of the court.

601
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:55,220
If there was a secret agreement, couldn't it have something to do with Liaodong?

602
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,820
Your Highness. Right now Lord Sam Bong has the same power as Lee In Gyeom

603
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,680
and Choi Yeong put together.

604
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,370
The check and balance that was discussed for the new country

605
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,840
is long gone.

606
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,650
So

607
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:28,250
you are going to support me to keep Sam Bong in check?

608
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,400
The country that I wanted to make

609
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,290
wasn't this kind of country.

610
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,190
I'm going to put my effort after that.

611
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:41,150
Also under Lord Sam Bong

612
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:44,090
I am useless.

613
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:48,490
I want to make myself worthy.

614
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:50,330
Your Highness.

615
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,660
Your Highness, a palanquin arrived

616
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,880
a person is asking to see you.

617
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,440
Who is it?

618
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,340
The person isn't coming out of the palanquin, so I can't tell.

619
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,910
Why did you send for me so urgently?

620
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:38,430
What are you talking about? I sent for you?

621
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,060
You didn't?

622
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,960
Didn't you send this letter to Byeokrando?

623
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,670
This is an urgent matter. Before you leave for the Ming's country, I need to see you.

624
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:59,460
This is regarding Jeong Do Jeon, so make haste to come here.

625
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:06,040
This is definitely Your Highness's handwriting.

626
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,360
Is it not?

627
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:15,440
Then... Perhaps

628
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,330
In order to write something in someone else's handwriting,

629
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:26,100
first you have to collect that person's handwriting.

630
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,960
Thousands or even ten thousands of that person's handwriting. You have to collect them all

631
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,060
and practice character by character.

632
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,640
An organization that can invest that kind of manpower and time,

633
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,350
Bi Guk Temple and Hwa Sa Dan.

634
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:42,170
In order to raise someone who can write exactly the same,

635
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,740
you need at least three years.

636
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:50,160
This is... The people that you raised within Hwa Sa Dan,

637
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,730
the forgers.

638
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,850
Myo Jak Dan.

639
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,570
Yeon Hee, you wench.

640
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,330
I am collecting Prince Jeong An's writing dating back to when he was in Seonggyungwan.

641
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:34,410
Everyone in Myo Jak Dan is each taking one character to practice.

642
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:39,030
I don't know about long complicated sentences, but we should be able to do short simple ones pretty soon.

643
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:43,030
Cho Young had made something very interesting.

644
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:46,650
I think we've fallen into a trap.

645
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,930
You have to quickly get out of here.

646
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,890
Same for you, Official.

647
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,690
Long time no see.

648
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:38,930
You wench. You used Myo Jak Dan?

649
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:47,820
Did you really ally with the Nameless?

650
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:58,640
Also why are you... I did hear that you recently had a lot of complaints.

651
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:06,020
In order to stop me, did you create this scheme?

652
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:10,520
Scheme? Are you talking about the forged handwriting?

653
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,900
Cho Young received Your Highness's letter

654
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,500
and urgently came in the middle of the night. That is a fact, isn't it?

655
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:38,510
Do you think you can bring me down with this?

656
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:44,630
Because I don't think so, I am going to prepare even more thoroughly from now on.

657
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,090
What are you all doing?

658
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,920
Arrest him right away.

659
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,240
Six Flying Dragons

660
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,240
Prince Jeong An conspired with Nameless?

661
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,780
Is there a sure evidence?

662
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,190
I will take all evil roles.

663
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,650
Please do not worry.

664
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:55,410
We might be able to catch all the Wang family, Nameless, and Prince Jeong An because of this incident.

665
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:58,240
Take Bang Ji with you and start the Nameless arrest operation.

666
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,470
Mugeuk, this place has been exposed.

667
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:03,740
I will proceed with it myself.

668
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,740
Mom.

669
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,180
Kill me now.
