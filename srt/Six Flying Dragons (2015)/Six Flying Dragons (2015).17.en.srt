1
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,640
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,480
Let's pretend like today's humiliation did not happen

3
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,620
and is the thing that will continue to lead Haedong Gapjok's successful history.

4
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,140
Do you want to take your last chance?

5
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,270
How come there is no news? We are already ready.

6
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,530
Not a single one of them will think that they signed because they were threatened.

7
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,970
I have to report this to Hong In Bang as soon as possible.

8
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,200
I have to quickly notify this to Hwa Sa Dan.

9
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,830
Hong In Bang, for you it will be your last morning.

10
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,050
They definitely fabricated the treason conspiracy.

11
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,650
You think I do not know that? You think I don't have a strong belief in you guys?

12
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,750
Then why are you hesitating?

13
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,290
You have to arrest Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

14
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,810
However, Hong In Bang already has evidence that Jo Ban committed the conspiracy.

15
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,860
He has also gained Haedong Gapjok's support.

16
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,830
I have no words.

17
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,450
If we arrest the officers of this country

18
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,070
without His Majesty's order then we become one of the treason groups.

19
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,620
On top of that, Hong In Bang now

20
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,760
has the support of Haedong Gapjok.

21
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,950
What... What if

22
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,190
Haedong Gapjok supports us?

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,520
That is not possible even if you are the in-law of Min Jae.

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,990
What if it's possible?

25
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,680
They, what if Haedong Gapjok

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,470
gathers thepower to stop Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi and support me instead?

27
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,760
Then what will you do?

28
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,840
If something like that happens

29
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,600
I will personally consult with His Highness and, at all cost, receive his answers.

30
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,610
How did it go?

31
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,250
It's done, all of the Haedong Gapjok have signed.

32
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,890
Sam Bong- Jeong Do Jeon

33
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,290
Yes, Hong In Bang. Now it's over.

34
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,240
Bang Won, this time I learned from you.

35
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,250
What... What are you saying?

36
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,060
I said our Hwa Sa Dan's fate lies in the blink of an eye.

37
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,620
You have to decide right now.

38
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,490
There isn't much time left for Hong In Bang. Hong In Bang will be done.

39
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,530
All of Haedong Gapjok turned their backs on Hong In Bang

40
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,730
and chose General Lee.

41
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,430
What? Lee Bang Won showed up?

42
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,040
On top of that, he received all the signatures of the Haedong Gapjok?

43
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,350
Yes, so you have to quickly relay this to Hong In Bang.

44
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,550
You go quickly and inform Hong In Bang.

45
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,350
Yes, I got it.

46
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,250
One second.

47
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,420
What is it?

48
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,130
For a mintue...

49
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,270
Let me think for a moment.

50
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,070
How did it go?

51
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,320
I got it.

52
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,340
What did you get?

53
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,310
A letter calling for the impeachment of Hong In Bang signed by all the members of Haedong Gapjok.

54
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,440
Are you guys outside? Get ready.

55
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,390
I will go to the palace this instant.

56
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,920
Did you get all the soldiers ready?

57
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
At 5-7 when Haedong Gapjok brings in their signed letter, I am going to enter the palace.

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,260
But since we do not know how they will act

60
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,960
all of you be armed and ready.

61
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,130
Yes.

62
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,900
Let's go.

63
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:12,140
Jeong Do Jeon, Lee Sung Gye, at least eat your breakfast well.

64
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,180
Today it is your last day.

65
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,570
Lee Bang Won went with the signed letter calling for Hong In Bang's impeachment?

66
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,410
Then we have to have in mind that His Majesty's answer will most likely be given.

67
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,970
Then Choi Young and Lee Seong Gye will attack Hong In Bang and Hong In Bang will fight back. There will be a war.

68
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,040
Choi Young and Lee Seong Gye are good at combat but this is Gaegyeong.

69
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,830
If Lee In Gyeom supports Hong In Bang

70
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,950
Lee Seong Gye cannot defeat their soldiers.

71
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,950
On top of that, Hong In Bang is in charge of the prison and of arresting criminals right now.

72
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,440
Yes, it's Hong In Bang. Hong In Bang is going to win.

73
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,210
What is it again? There is no time.

74
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,180
However,

75
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,820
if Hong In Bang cannot crush Lee Seong Gye from the start.

76
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,530
The power will sway towards Lee Seong Gye who has his majesty's letter.

77
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,050
The fight can be postponed, but in the end it will end of with the defeat of Hong In Bang.

78
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,850
Then is it General Lee?

79
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,330
But if General Lee and Choi get control of politics,

80
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,590
Bi Guk Sa will be in danger.

81
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,720
Even if we help them out right now, by their nature, do you think they will let us go?

82
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,670
There is no one that does not know that we helped Hong In Bang for a long time.

83
00:07:52,580 --> 00:08:00,450
This is why an information seller should not have helped out one side too much.

84
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,330
Ah, decide quickly.

85
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,880
Okay.

86
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,000
We are going to Hong In Bang.

87
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,010
Myoshi(5-7) has already passed, so how come the signed letter has not come yet?

88
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,400
Perhaps, those Haedong Gapjok aren't thinking about something else, right?

89
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,620
No. That is not possible.

90
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,770
That is...

91
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,050
That is the problem, the charge of the police bureau.

92
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,650
If there is a war on Gaegyeong, the one in charge of the police will win eventually.

93
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,220
Even if Hong In Bang has that power, that is move by the order of His Majesty.

94
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,960
That is not how it works.

95
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:59,530
If Hong In Bang catches Lee Seong Gye first, the king's command can change once again.

96
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,750
We are going to the court the instant we receive His Majesty's answer.

97
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,940
Our target is Hong In Bang, Gil Tae Mi,

98
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,550
Lee In Gyeom. It's those three.

99
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,780
Is His Majesty awake?

100
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,030
Yes.

101
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,900
Then notify him.

102
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,480
I got a message from the palace, and

103
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,630
right now General Choi has entered the King's room.

104
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,280
General Choi is meeting His Majesty in these early hours?

105
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,900
Elder, you have a guest.

106
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,700
Looks like the signed letter is finally here.

107
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,580
There is a big problem!

108
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,520
Why are you here? A big problem?

109
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,960
Lee Bang Won

110
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,430
showed up the moment Haedong Gapjok were signing the letter you gave them.

111
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,580
Then, Lee Bang Won changed their minds and made them sign a new letter.

112
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,410
A new letter?

113
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,890
It's a letter calling for the impeachment of you and Gil Tae Mi.

114
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,940
Then, Choi Young is meeting His Majesty with that letter?

115
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,130
It is not the time for you to be here.

116
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,760
Quickly get your soldiers and attack Lee Seong Gye first, this instant.

117
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,410
It won't be too late to make a justification after that.

118
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,910
Let's go.

119
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,940
General.

120
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,100
What happened?

121
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,960
I got the documents from His Highness.

122
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,180
Let General Lee Seong Gye know. I will go to the investigation office

123
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,700
and send out an arrest warrant for Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

124
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,290
Yes, I understand.

125
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,650
You guys, follow me.

126
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,400
Yes.

127
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,370
What? What are you saying?

128
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,250
Elder Man Ho, what did you just say?

129
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,850
Lee Seong Gye is behind Jo Ban's conspiracy case.

130
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,330
However, as we're closing in on him, Lee Seong Gye is starting a rebellion.

131
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:33,420
If you don't arrest Lee Seong Gye right away, there will be war in the palace.

132
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,840
What are you standing around for? Arm the whole investigation office.

133
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,680
We're going to Lee Seong Gye's house.

134
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,900
Yes.

135
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,100
Investigation Office

136
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,880
Hurry and let Leader Boon Yi know.

137
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,430
Yes.

138
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,920
Is nobody here?

139
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,870
Yes, General.

140
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,600
What happened? Where did everyone go?

141
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,790
He said that General Lee Seong Gye is revolting.

142
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,620
What? What are you saying?

143
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,280
Well, that... Elder Minister Hong In Bang said it was like that

144
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,200
and he took all the investigation office's soldiers with him.

145
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,980
Damn... We're one step late.

146
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,850
This rat-like bastard.

147
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:46,350
According to the King's orders, Traitor Lee Seong Gye, accept your punishment!
Lee Seong Gye's House

148
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,680
Break in!

149
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,480
Yes!

150
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,380
What are you all doing? Immediately go inside and ransack the place!

151
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,310
Drag out the traitor Lee Seong Gye and his family members!

152
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,260
Yes!

153
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,240
Aigoo. Aigoo.

154
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,760
I thought that our life was finally blossoming after coming to the house of a high-ranking person,
(Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's Grandmother)

155
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,810
but what is this?

156
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,360
Usually, Japanese pirates go into the people's houses
(Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master)

157
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,450
and political enemies go into high-ranking people's houses, Noonim.

158
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,780
Watch carefully.

159
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,080
Nothing strange happened?

160
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,240
Dongsaeng, I don't think anyone saw us. If they come here, what should we...

161
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,090
This rotten bastard! Only saving himself.

162
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,200
Dongsaeng! Let's go together!

163
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,170
There's no one here. We didn't see even a single ant.

164
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,580
What happened here?

165
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,470
Could it be...

166
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,100
Gil Tae Mi's House

167
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,200
We got the documents from His Highness and we are here to arrest traitor Gil Tae Mi.

168
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,680
If you resist, you will be breaking the national law.

169
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,190
Bastards, can you not put down your swords?
(Lee Ji Ran)

170
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,160
If you don't, I'll send your heads flying.

171
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,480
Damn it.
(Gil Tae Mi)

172
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,590
Did we get tricked by this Lee Seong Gye bastard?

173
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,410
This means that In-law has failed.

174
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,950
Fine. I'll just kill everyone.

175
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,160
Ah... In-law!

176
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,380
In-law will be in danger.

177
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,260
The important thing is catching Gil Tae Mi by using overwhelming military power.

178
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,290
Just using the military force will do nothing to the enemy's skills.

179
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,180
Is he that strong?

180
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:45,270
In the battle of Heungwangsa, he fought the rebellion army by himself and exterminated 70 people.

181
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,070
If Gil Tae Mi escapes and goes to Pyeong Taek,

182
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,920
he will assemble the soldiers there. A civil war will arise.

183
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,010
Gil Tae Mi must immediately be caught.

184
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,890
I need to catch Gil Tae Mi.
[Moo Hyul]

185
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,560
I will defeat Gil Tae Mi, for Young Master...

186
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,630
Are you not going to clear the way?

187
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,190
Let's go in.

188
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,910
What?

189
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,020
Lee Seong Gye's Ga Byeol Cho attacked Minister Gil Tae Mi's house.

190
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,430
Damn it!

191
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:38,460
We're one step late. What happened to In-law?

192
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,070
There's still no way of knowing.

193
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,620
What should we do about this?

194
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,040
Go to where I told you to and make preparations.

195
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,590
Ah, yes. I understand.

196
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,940
Shouldn't we go and save Minister Gil Tae Mi?

197
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,960
Minister Hong! Tell us what to do.

198
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,590
Please stay quiet!

199
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,420
I'm thinking!

200
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,280
In-law will be safe.

201
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,020
He's not someone who will easily be defeated.

202
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,670
So...

203
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,680
We're going to a different place now.

204
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,010
In the end, Lee Seong Gye's going for His Highness.

205
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,120
We will advance to the palace and protect His Highness.

206
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,510
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

207
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,420
Yes.

208
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,740
What? We're going to the palace?

209
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,000
Ga Byeol Cho Squads 1 and 2 will come with me now and will go to find Gil Tae Mi!

210
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,140
Here. Squads 3 and 4, follow me!

211
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,920
Yes!

212
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,340
Squads 5 and 6 follow me and go find traitor Gil Tae Mi!

213
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,110
Yes!

214
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,570
Is that true?

215
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:58,870
Yes! Lee Seong Gye's Ga Byeol Cho has surrounded Minister Gil Tae Mi's house.

216
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,930
Just what is that wench Choi Young doing?
(Lee In Gyeom)

217
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:11,460
Is that wench already having different thoughts?

218
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,930
Immediately

219
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:20,920
bring General Jo Min Soo, Elder Lee Do Soo, and Elder Jo Sang Heon over.

220
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,240
This is urgent so bring them here secretly.

221
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,100
I understand.

222
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,510
Gil Tae Mi is not here!

223
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,410
Here either.

224
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,200
Not here either.

225
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,560
Didn't we get a message that he is definitely inside the house?

226
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,680
Did the earth eat him or the sky drink him? How can he not be here?

227
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,690
General? Come here!

228
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,890
What is this?

229
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,350
Looks like Gil Tae Mi escaped.

230
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,420
Damn, those guys are lucky. I should have come after I killed them all.

231
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,290
Well, I can kill them later.

232
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,490
I will spread out the soldiers and look for Gil Tae Mi.

233
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,650
That is not possible.

234
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,130
Why is it not possible?

235
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,630
If we scatter the soldiers here it's only 10 men.

236
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,390
That is just the right number for Gil Tae Mi to kill instantly.

237
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,650
That is why we gathered all the soldiers and tried to capture Gil Tae Mi.

238
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,080
Things went wrong.

239
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,370
Things are not going well even from our first plan...

240
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,430
General proceed with your plan and get control of Lee In Gyeom and his soldiers.

241
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,780
We will look for Gil Tae Mi with our messengers.

242
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,580
What about Hong In Bang? He is probably roaming around with the soldiers.

243
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,180
Won't it be better to fight with them first?

244
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,960
You can trust on General Choi with those guys.

245
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,740
Lee

246
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,050
So Lee In Gyeom will continue to stay in Do Hwa Jeon right?

247
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,500
Only his servant went in and out, Lee In Gyeom definitely did not come out.

248
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,510
Did you check precisely to see if he went out disguised or in a palanquin ?

249
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,720
Aigo, how can I go check easily when leader Boon Yi

250
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,420
is commanding us this fiercely.

251
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,700
Leader Boon Yi...

252
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,830
Leader Boon Yi! Leader Boon Yi!

253
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,300
Ahjuhsshi, what about Hong In Bang? Where is Hong In Bang going right now?

254
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,820
Hong In Bang took the bureau soldiers and

255
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,850
passed through Sunjookgyo and is going towards Gwando.

256
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,960
It seemed like they were going to the palace!

257
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,300
The palace?

258
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,010
Leader Boon Yi!

259
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,370
If it's the palace, I think General Choi will take care of that.

260
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,800
While doing this he probably informed the palace guards from the start.

261
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,500
Hong

262
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,570
Woah, when did you make a place like this?

263
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,700
What are these people? They aren't the people I know

264
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,780
Ahjuhsshi, what about Gil Tae M? Did you catch him?

265
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:06,150
We lost him. From this point on we have to use all our messengers to find him.

266
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,050
Give me his portrait.

267
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,400
Group 1 and 3 work the south side

268
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,700
and give this to Hong Duk Moon's group 5.

269
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,620
Tell them not to approach Gil Tae Mi when they find him but instead to inform us right away.

270
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,810
Did you guys get it? Quickly, go quickly.

271
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,850
Don't worry, let's go.

272
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,960
We will go out and look for him as well.

273
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,920
Do that. But your fight with him is not as important as it is to capture him.

274
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,260
Do not approach him with the mind of defeating him.

275
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,210
If you find Gil Tae Mi, you have to catch him with numerous amount of soldiers.

276
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,970
Yes, of course.

277
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,650
Let's go!

278
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,070
Where is Hong In Bang?

279
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,930
He passed Sunjookgyo and is going towards Gwando right now.

280
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,170
It seems like he is going to the palace.

281
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,190
Then that is better.

282
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,490
General Choi probably told them to protect the palace.

283
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,900
Having Hong In Bang go to Dohajun and meet with Lee In Gyeom is a bigger threat.

284
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,310
Why are you here like this?

285
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,750
That is what I mean. Everyone is doing something right now.

286
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,870
Because there is something I definitely have to see,

287
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:36,670
I have to see Hong In Bang being arrested and taken away.

288
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,010
I am waiting for that.

289
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,300
But, where did Chansungsa Han Gu Young go?

290
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,650
He said he has to go somewhere for a moment and left.

291
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,750
- That bastard already...
- You rascal! Hong In Bang!-

292
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,500
It's misfortune on top of misfortune. Choi Young, what do I do now?

293
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,820
Police, arrest that man this instant!

294
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,740
General, what are you saying?

295
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:38,600
General are you also being fooled by that fabricated letter?Lee Seong Gye has caused treason.

296
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,710
No matter how convincing you sound, the tables have been turned already!

297
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,300
Give up and obediently be arrested.

298
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,920
Choi Young you bastard. You are one of Lee Seong Gye's side!

299
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,800
How can someone who receives His Majesty's affection and has received

300
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,420
the most grace from Goyero do this?

301
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,340
What are you guys doing? Arrest that old traitor!

302
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,340
This is His Majesty's document.

303
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:15,140
It is His Majesty's royal command to arrest the two traitors Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi!

304
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:22,890
That is not true! That is a fake document! Arrest Choi Young!

305
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:28,010
If you guys go against the royal command you will also become traitors.

306
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,880
What are you guys doing? Arrest Hong In Bang!

307
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,590
If you guys cannot do it, I'll do it.

308
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,350
You cannot General! It's dangerous!

309
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,050
I said arrest that traitor!

310
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,670
Did you all decide to become traitors?

311
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,860
I, Chulwon Bowongoon Ahnsa Gongsin.
(His position and title)

312
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:06,660
officer of Goryeo and also General Choi Young

313
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,900
will arrest the traitor right now.

314
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,060
What are you guys doing! Arrest that man this instant!

315
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:08,770
Oh, dammit.

316
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,620
In-law!

317
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,730
Look at you.

318
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:40,390
You know what will happen if I wield my sword here...

319
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,480
Do you want to kill all your subordinates? Huh?

320
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,770
Step aside.

321
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,060
I only have you in-law. Let's quickly get out of Gaegyeong.

322
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,040
Likewise, you have a will to do something.

323
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,510
What happened?

324
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,180
Even before my meal, that guy brought all his soldiers and broke down my house and

325
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,520
took all my soldiers, so I couldn't even eat breakfast.

326
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,530
How are you so carefree?

327
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,160
I became one of the officers of a country from a countryman in Pyung Taek.

328
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,960
I don't have regrets even if it ends like this.

329
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,140
Well, I did everything I wanted to do.

330
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,370
Ah, I'm not giving up or anything like that.

331
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:48,870
Of course not. We can't surrender like this. Dae Geun has prepared a boat at the coast of the Pyeong Cheong river.

332
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,490
Leave Gaegyeong from there and go to Pyeong Taek.

333
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,380
In-law, you can hurry and do that.

334
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,470
What will you do?

335
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,290
I have to kill Lee Seong Gye before I go.

336
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,690
Is that possible right now? Do you know where he is?

337
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:08,230
Cho Young will probably know. She'll have spies all over Gaegyeong to gather information.

338
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,370
We arranged to meet at Bi Yeon Gak. You know, that place where they train young girls they've captured to be spies.

339
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,740
In-law, don't do that and let's just go to the bank of Pyeong Cheong river together—

340
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,050
Do you not trust me?

341
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,020
I'm the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms, Gil Tae Mi!

342
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,190
Let's meet at Pyeong Taek.

343
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,720
I wish you luck.

344
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:43,230
In-law! I've had so much fun since I met you.

345
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:49,660
I had a life that was only about being Elder's cleaning rag forever... I feel sorry to you, In-law,

346
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,590
but people thought you were under me.

347
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,950
Fine. Let's go, Gil Tae Mi.

348
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,570
- You lost Hong In Bang?
- General Choi Yeong has dominated the investigation office,

349
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,090
but in the process of transferring Hong In Bang, Gil Tae Mi appeared.
(Lee Shin Jeok)

350
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,000
How can it go so wrong?

351
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,670
- Where did you say it happened?
- In an alley in Jeong Seung-dong.

352
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,200
Where would Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi go?

353
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,970
They will surely leave Gaegyeong.

354
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:46,000
There is a possibility of them escaping using a disguise, but there are officers and Ga Byeol Cho soldiers stationed at every gate in Gaegyeong.

355
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,360
So they will not think of going out through the gate.

356
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,240
River... They will use a boat.

357
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,060
Shouldn't we send all the soldiers to the ferry?

358
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:02,110
It wouldn't be a ferry. If they ride a boat, it will be from the river bank.
(Boon Yi)

359
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:08,290
If they don't use a ferry and will use the river bank instead, how will we know which river they will go to?

360
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,480
If they want to secretly ride a boat and get out of Gaegyeong, they will use a smuggling boat.
(Lee Bang Ji)

361
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,760
It's something that Gaegyeong panhandlers are in charge of. There will be someone who will help them.

362
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:33,040
So you want me to find out which smuggling boats will leave today, right?
(Gab Boon)

363
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,240
But why?

364
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,490
To catch Hong In Bang.

365
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,800
Ah, is that so? I will find it out right away!

366
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:53,970
Brother, you look good. It's nice.

367
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,220
Hap Ha, please save us. There's no hope with Hong In Bang. What should we do now?
(Woo Hak Joo)

368
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:15,080
Why did you come to me to ask that? My reputation is also hanging at the moment.

369
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,650
Hap Ha. Why are you being like this?

370
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,990
If Choi Yeong gets a hold of power,

371
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:28,120
he will do an extensive purge of Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi's people.

372
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:35,540
I know that you didn't do such atrocious things...

373
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,870
Yes, yes.

374
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,650
Ah...

375
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:47,880
Since Hong In Bang was in control of the Do Dang, there will be a lot to ponder upon from now on.

376
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,950
Hap Ha. Please tell us a way to survive.

377
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,590
You want to live?

378
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,630
Of course! Of course! So to us, like this...

379
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:08,490
Then what are you doing here right now?

380
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:13,680
Before Hong In Bang gets caught, aren't you supposed to write an appeal for impeachment?

381
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,280
Hap Ha! Thank you.

382
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,300
We will send an appeal for impeachment right away. Thank you.

383
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,940
Isn't it good that Hap Ha got overthrown? You have avoided the sudden downpour.

384
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:41,910
From now on, listen to what I'm saying.

385
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:52,780
If Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi are overthrown, the Do Dang will be dominated by Choi Yeong and Lee Seong Gye.

386
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,720
Everything is hanging on the direction of those two people's power struggle.

387
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,550
If Lee Seong Gye wins, we will really be failures.

388
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,820
So you guys remain in the Do Dang

389
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:17,710
and put all your strength into General Choi Yeong's side.

390
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,480
General Jo.

391
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,620
Your role will be important now.

392
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:35,450
You are on our side but you have also earned General Choi Yeong's trust.

393
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:41,890
After this, gain more trust and be General Choi Yeong's right hand

394
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,080
and secretly hide yourself like that.

395
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:51,960
I will do that so don't worry. Also, according to what you said,

396
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,600
I bribed one of Hong In Bang's servants. And if luck is on my side, I will be able to catch Hong In Bang as well.
(Jo Min Soo)

397
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,330
Hap Ha. Hap Ha!

398
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,330
It seems like someone's here.

399
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,390
Came here? Who?

400
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:15,750
All of you, go back to where you came from.

401
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,460
Make a way.

402
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,250
Put your swords down.

403
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:13,430
Why are you here? Have you caught Gil Tae Mi and Hong In Bang?

404
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,260
Immediately come out and accept your punishment!

405
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,650
Why would I?

406
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:29,780
I got pushed to retirement by your allied people, Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

407
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,760
I don't have any association with the fabrication of Jo Ban's conspiracy case.

408
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,110
Did I steal Jo Ban's land?

409
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:48,760
Those are all Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi's doings.

410
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,480
You committed the crime of raising Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

411
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,830
Land ownership ledger

412
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,760
You ordered Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

413
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,720
Those are the land deeds that you've been illegally taking from the people all this time.

414
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,800
Can you still say that you are not associated with any of those two's crimes?

415
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,230
If we interrogated you at the investigation office for six hours your crimes would be overflowing.

416
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:30,820
Then get the royal documents.

417
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,910
I am Gwangpyeong Buwongeon Lee In Gyeom.
(Lee In Gyeom's title)

418
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:41,860
I am the King's father-in-law and, until recently, I have held the highest position in this country after the King.

419
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:50,170
So get the royal documents immediately. You don't have the right to judge me, General.

420
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:58,340
I'm saying that only the King has that right.

421
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:11,300
Every soldier, servant, steward, and minister in Do Hwa Jeon...

422
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,990
I will arrest them all.

423
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:19,370
Yes, except one servant and you.

424
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,410
Have a good life by yourself in this empty Do Hwa Jeon.

425
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,930
Arrest everyone and transfer them to the investigation office. Also,

426
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,890
from today onward, Lee In Gyeom will be under house arrest.

427
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,210
Watch him carefully!

428
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,000
Yes!

429
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,330
I found it out!

430
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:50,550
I have finally found out where Hong In Bang is going!

431
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,610
The panhandlers have found it. The panhandlers did!

432
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,340
Where is it?

433
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,850
There's only one smuggling boat today.

434
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,860
It's in downstream of the Pyeong Cheong river on Oecheon-ri.

435
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,060
Young Gyu, let's go!

436
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,810
Yes, Young Master!

437
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,770
Elder Bon Won!

438
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,110
I have successfully persuaded the owner.

439
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,440
Hwa Sa Dan has abandoned Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

440
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,680
You worked hard.

441
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,450
The owner is meeting with General Choi Yeong right now.

442
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,320
So does Cho Young know where Gil Tae Mi is?

443
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,250
There was contact from Gil Tae Mi's side first and they have agreed to meet.

444
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,580
Where is that place?

445
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,150
Bi Yeon Gak.

446
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,170
Good. Contact everyone.

447
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,420
Bi Yeon Gak

448
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,780
Welcome.

449
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,800
The owner will come soon. Please go inside.

450
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,370
Ah, do you have anything to eat? I'm starving.

451
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:58,410
This bastard Lee Seong Gye attacked my house before my meal.

452
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,230
I think that breakfast is very important!

453
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,630
Yes. I will give it to you inside.

454
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,970
Fine.

455
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,770
Elder Minister!

456
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,700
Is that you, Elder Minister?

457
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,880
Dae Geun, we don't have time.

458
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,440
Let's hurry and get out of here.

459
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,280
It's here!

460
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,310
Traitor Hong In Bang is here!

461
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,140
Arrest Hong In Bang!

462
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,200
You bastard. How dare you!

463
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,550
Arrest Hong In Bang! Arrest him!

464
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,550
He's here!

465
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,750
Hurry and start it!

466
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,890
Where are you going in such a hurry?

467
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,200
Teacher.

468
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,930
How did you...

469
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,630
Didn't I say so before?

470
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:27,630
I will meet you on this road again and I will have you punished.

471
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,800
It's Hong In Bang! Arrest Hong In Bang!

472
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,950
Aigoo... This and this. The colors are breathtaking.

473
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,890
But why is Cho Young not coming? Where is the food?

474
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,280
Look here! Didn't I tell you to bring me something to eat?

475
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,860
Traitor Gil Tae Mi, throw away your weapon and accept the royal order!

476
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,040
Cho Young, this wench... She betrayed me?

477
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,500
It's the end for you, Traitor Gil Tae Mi! Give up and surrender!

478
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,920
Can we really do this?

479
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,330
Weren't we ordered to just surround the place and be on stand by until the forces are all assembled?

480
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,980
We need to earn merits from here.

481
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,610
If we don't want to get purged while watching over Hong In Bang's group, we need to catch Gil Tae Mi.

482
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,020
Still, it's Gil Tae Mi!

483
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,730
Shut up! Isn't Gil Tae Mi also human?

484
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,370
Everyone, we're charging into the main building.

485
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,120
Yes.

486
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,020
Is that guy doing his make up right now?

487
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,380
Just wait. If my eye gets messed up, all of you will die.

488
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,060
Well, I'll be killing you either way.

489
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,770
What?

490
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:40,050
What are you doing? Catch the traitor!

491
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:53,300
Okay. I will get out of here and gather the troops in Pyeong Taek.

492
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,040
I can do it.

493
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,800
Why?

494
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,060
Because I am Gil Tae Mi.

495
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,880
Okay... Should I get started?

496
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,550
What?

497
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:32,000
The soldiers went into the Bi Yeon Gak where Gil Tae Mi is?

498
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,840
There's no way of knowing the details of the situation but some of the troops have entered the Bi Yeon Gak.

499
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,970
There are not enough troops gathered in Bi Yeon Gak.

500
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,600
Time-wise, it will be impossible.

501
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,830
Why did they ignore the order to be on stand by and have gone in first?

502
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,150
I have immediately mobilized soldiers to head towards Bi Yeon Gak.

503
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,920
I will personally go too.

504
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,730
Gil Tae Mi is in Bi Yeon Gak, right? I will go too.

505
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,960
You must never act rashly.

506
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,210
Yes, I understand.

507
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,680
Ah. I'm hungry.

508
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,440
This is why a man needs to eat his breakfast.

509
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,380
You said that we are the same, right?

510
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,050
But now, I know. I am different from you.

511
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,310
I

512
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,010
didn't get fooled by the dirty bug whispering inside of me.

513
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,550
Don't be too sure yet

514
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,810
because you're not sure when that bug will stop whispering.

515
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,930
Until when?

516
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,520
When you surrendered by yourself because you couldn't bear the torture?

517
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,600
Or when you couldn't accept that you surrendered

518
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,700
and started to blame the world for it?

519
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,590
No, when you come to know yourself.

520
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,120
I

521
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,170
know myself now.

522
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,390
I...

523
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,620
It's not because I couldn't stand myself being powerless

524
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:41,220
but because I couldn't stand myself being without dreams and excitement.

525
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,420
What Sam Bong said must have given you excitement.

526
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,930
What to do about bureaucracy, what to do about land ownership,

527
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:53,630
what do we need to do for fair taxes, how can we reform this country...

528
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,430
I was like that too.

529
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,770
What Sam Bong said made my heart race as well.

530
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:07,330
But you know, think well about

531
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,070
whether the thing that makes your heart race is the country that Sam Bong wishes to make

532
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:17,810
or your greed to have that country.

533
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,180
You don't know about it now

534
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,430
but you'll come to understand. At that moment,

535
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:32,960
the bug inside of you will start whispering.

536
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,780
Until the end, you're still pathetic.

537
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,570
But I

538
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:50,000
will not be afraid of evil people like you anymore.

539
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,550
Good bye, Hong In Bang...

540
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,550
Teacher.

541
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:25,250
Your choice was right. It was Lee Seong Gye.

542
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:31,990
But Lee family of Jeon Joo still has a long way to go.
(Min Je: Haedong Gapjok's Head, nicknamed Eo Eun)

543
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,120
Yes. Still.

544
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,020
Min Da Kyung: Future Queen Wongyeong

545
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,940
But...

546
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,930
Then, what are you going to offer me?

547
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:46,500
My family's biggest secret.

548
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:53,490
The dynasty will change. The Lee family will own the country.

549
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:58,170
But... What?

550
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:01,690
Nothing.

551
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:08,530
Gil Tae Mi did not get out of Gaegyeong.

552
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:09,620
Be on the move!

553
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,210
Yes!

554
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:38,490
After I killed Hong Ryun, I said I will not eat at a place like this anymore.

555
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:41,530
As expected, everything tastes good when you're hungry.

556
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:44,450
What could it be to taste this good?

557
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:21,210
It seems that when you look at me, you see a traitor of Goryeo or a corrupt official,

558
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,040
but that's really a misunderstanding.

559
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,350
Do you know how much I love this country?

560
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,010
There's no one in Goryeo who loves it more than I do.

561
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:43,190
There's no other choice but to love it. Why?

562
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:48,950
This country makes me really happy.

563
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,940
But what is this? You're not here to catch me, right?

564
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,180
If you're going to catch me, you need to bring at least 100 more soldiers.

565
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,700
You would need a wire screen or something to do so.

566
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:29,650
So don't die in vain and just move.

567
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,890
Also, if you're thinking of catching me, you should have attacked me before I ate.

568
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:38,370
I'm now totally lively.

569
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:40,150
What to do?

570
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:51,030
Damn it! We're late. Where did Gil Tae Mi go?

571
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,790
Let's go there for now.

572
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,930
Everyone has been dispersed and is looking for Gil Tae Mi.

573
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,270
If you find him, don't approach him. Blow your whistle instead.

574
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,020
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

575
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,630
Let's go!

576
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,580
That's why I told you to hurry and move.

577
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,710
It's that side!

578
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,430
We must wait until the military forces arrive.

579
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,670
We can't catch Gil Tae Mi with just us.

580
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:15,010
We need to make time until the other soldiers come here.

581
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:22,900
Traitor Gil Tae Mi! Hong In Bang has already been arrested. Kneel before the King's orders.

582
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,040
Make way.

583
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,730
Don't die a meaningless death.

584
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:34,310
You bastard! You won't be able to get out of here!

585
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:42,370
Gil Tae Mi. It's Gil Tae Mi!

586
00:55:54,590 --> 00:56:04,630
Everyone, listen up. From now on, whoever runs into me first will die for sure.

587
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,630
Of course, I can kill all of you but

588
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:12,770
I'm busy, so the first one to run to me,

589
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:16,870
I will surely kill that guy before I go.

590
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:24,940
Why are they still not here? Hurry... Hurry...

591
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,180
Gil Tae Mi! You can never get out of here!

592
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:39,060
Just make way for me. Let's stop killing. I took so many lives today.

593
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:43,380
An honorable person like me shouldn't be doing that, right?

594
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:48,340
You traitor bastard! Lee In Gyeom's cleaning rag!

595
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Nobody! Nobody can say that to me.

596
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,140
Why? Because I am not Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom's cleaning rag. I've never cleaned up for him before.

597
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,470
If anybody says that,

598
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,830
I will cut off his head this instant.

599
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:22,800
It's now. I have to say that now. "Lee In Gyeom's cleaning rag!" I have to say that!

600
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,020
Then, I will move forward.

601
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:30,670
Okay, I will count to three.

602
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,750
If you don't open up the way by the count of three,

603
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,200
I will kill everyone.

604
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,860
One!

605
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,260
I have to scream it now. Lee In Gyeom's cleaning rag.

606
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,900
Two!

607
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:59,310
- Ra—
- Hey!

608
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,870
Lee In Gyeom's cleaning rag!

609
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:10,810
Could it be...

610
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,190
You didn't say that to me, right?

611
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:21,470
It is true that you've been cleaning up for Lee In Gyeom your whole life.

612
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,810
What?

613
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:26,210
Damn it. He stole it.

614
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:31,600
Where are you going? You can't just go like that.

615
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,440
It's you!

616
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:40,780
Drop your title as the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms here!

617
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:48,120
Leave, Gil Tae Mi!

618
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,900
Okay, okay. I can't just go with you still alive.

619
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,880
Six Flying Dragons

620
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,530
Congratulations on becoming the best swordsman in the Three Kingdoms.

621
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:26,510
You're all grown up, Hong In Bang.

622
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,910
There's a bug living inside a person's heart.

623
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,820
- What if that bug eats me up?
- I will kill it.

624
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,780
It's that person's fate.

625
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,640
Even if it wasn't me, this country is hopeless.

626
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,680
You get jealous of each other, get bitter, wish for victory,

627
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,850
Just what are you saying?

628
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,910
It's a country where you can't go with General Choi Yeong.

629
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:49,600
Lee Seong Gye!
