00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,660
Episode 32

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,640
What's wrong?

4
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,910
Why are you being like that? Did something happen?

5
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,060
Boon.

6
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,870
Speak.

7
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:14,460
Now... I'm done playing now.

8
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:25,050
I don't think I can have fun with you like this anymore.

9
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,250
Boon Yi

10
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,770
Excuse me.

11
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,820
I tried asking Cho Young about your mother.

12
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,620
What did she say?

13
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:07,650
If Yeon Hyang is your mother, it seems that Cho Young knows her.

14
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,210
So just wait a little bit more.

15
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,520
If my words go through, there will be a reply from there.

16
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,740
I will make sure to keep my promise. It's the same for the land problem

17
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,950
and I will surely find your mother.

18
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:37,450
But why did you do it?

19
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,650
What?

20
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,450
Why are you suddenly bringing out talks about your promises?

21
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:49,100
Also, we can't play any more. What do you mean by that?

22
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,190
Why? Do you want to play some more? It's too bad we can't play anymore, right?

23
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,790
That's not what I'm talking about.

24
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,180
Something happened, right?

25
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,860
- Boon.
- Go ahead and speak.

26
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,010
Say my name.

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm asking you to say my name.

28
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,750
- Bang Won.
- One more time.

29
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,030
Bang Won. Lee Bang Won.

30
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,540
That's good.

31
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,250
What was that?

32
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,410
- Boon.
- Yes?

33
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,910
Don't call me by my name from now on.

34
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,070
Don't use informal speech either.

35
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,250
Now. Now...

36
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,280
I get it.

37
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,000
I understand. (formal)

38
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,740
If you call my name...

39
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:25,060
I think it will be hard on me. I think I'll feel weak.

40
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,800
If you use informal speech to me...

41
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,840
You don't have to tell me the reason.

42
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,960
It doesn't matter to me.

43
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:53,680
If the plan works out, you'll be part of the royal family. Of course, I'd have to use respectful words.

44
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:04,230
Letting me speak informally is something I am grateful for. It's also something that I didn't deserve.

45
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:11,330
I really liked it. You were really like my friend.

46
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,370
People enjoying life.

47
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:27,250
So that the people will feel happiness in their lives every day,

48
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,770
become an amazing royal and please practice good politics.

49
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,730
♫ I recognized you a few times. Because of you, ♫

50
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,300
♫ I am alive. ♫

51
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,800
♫ I restlessly follow your voice. ♫

52
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,820
♫ Even if you push me out a thousand times, I go to you.  ♫

53
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,250
♫ I shine in your eyes. ♫

54
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,990
There's no place for me?

55
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,300
No. All of this will be my place.

56
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,290
Now... I'm done playing now.

57
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,000
Are you Young Master Lee Bang Won?

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,600
Who are you?

59
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,500
I heard from Hwa Sa Dan's elder owner.

60
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,300
Nameless.

61
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:32,970
We are curious about you and you probably feel the same.

62
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,890
Let's have a talk.

63
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,290
Will you come with me?

64
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:40,190
I came because you wanted to talk about the things we are curious about each other. But this feels like a civil service exam.

65
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,230
Are you trying to see if I am someone who is capable of sitting on the throne?

66
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:53,840
The elders only want to confirm if Cho Young was telling the truth.

67
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,360
So they've come in person... Are they trying get more information about the land reform from me?

68
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,250
Who is your leader?

69
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,250
That person didn't come.

70
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,770
What? Jeong Ya personally went to meet Lee Bang Won?

71
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,510
Yes.

72
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,270
Who accompanied her?

73
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,860
I think she was accompanied by the woman who was always with her.

74
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,190
- Do you know where they went?
- Yes.

75
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,520
Show me the way.

76
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:34,700
According to Cho Young's words, you were angered because of Jeong Do Jeon's plan to give the prime minister complete control.

77
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,160
Why were you angered?

78
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,720
I already told Cho Young everything about that. I don't have anything more to say.

79
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:56,020
Do you not like the king's Five Rules that much?

80
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,980
Why are you curious about that?

81
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:10,980
We're judging whether or not the king's Five Rules are enough of a reason for you to make the decision to abandon Sam Bong.

82
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,760
You probably made that judgement before coming here. Why else would you show yourselves in front of me?

83
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:26,490
I already told you that I will not be used and abandoned like Hong Ryun.

84
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:35,160
Aren't you also supposed to give me answers to things I'm curious about?

85
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,770
So the two of you are bodyguards.

86
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,980
So you're the highest person here.

87
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:12,240
What about asking and answering three things we want to know about each other?

88
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,680
If not, I'll just go. What are you going to do?

89
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,920
I will do that.

90
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,490
Then, I will ask a question first.

91
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,150
What is this organization's goal?

92
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:45,290
Stability. Until this country becomes stable, we're managing it.

93
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,880
You put a person like Lee In Gyeom in a high position

94
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,820
and made the country into this pitiful state and you're saying it's for stability?

95
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,930
That's right.

96
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:03,190
After Lee In Gyeom stepped down, how many political upheavals happened?

97
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:11,350
Two kings have abdicated and there has been bloodshed between men of power.

98
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,850
I roughly understand what stability you are talking about.

99
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,990
Though it's pretty pathetic.

100
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,850
I will ask a question.

101
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,290
What are the king's Five Rules?

102
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,950
Why are they curious about the king's Five Rules?

103
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,260
Lee Bang Won couldn't have talked about that, right?

104
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,360
Who are you?

105
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,810
Where are the children of this house?

106
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,710
They went to Gaegyeong looking for their mom.

107
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,310
At that time, the children disappeared

108
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,860
and you were in a tight situation to be going around Gaegyeong looking for the children. Don't you know?

109
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,670
We were all at war with the factions.

110
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,730
It's probably not that. You're not someone who can be that hard on Yeon Hyang.

111
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,090
Isn't your heart different from other people's?

112
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,220
Of course, I also cannot understand

113
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,260
how she could have married and had kids with such a country guy.

114
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:36,580
Fifth Rule: The royal family cannot participate in politics.

115
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:44,280
That's all five. Don't you think it's enough reason for me to not continue with Sam Bong?

116
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:53,680
Now, I will ask. When did your organization start?

117
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,100
It's during the Silla Dynasty.

118
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,140
Under Queen Seon Duk's rule,

119
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,600
it started with a person called Yeom Jong.

120
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,080
Yeom Jong? The traitor who was with Bidam, Yeom Jong?

121
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,600
I will ask you.

122
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,750
Regarding the national system of the king asking the high priest for advice when making important decisions for the country's future,

123
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,490
what are you going to do?

124
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,170
I will get rid of it, of course.

125
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,710
How can such a system exist in a country of Sadaebu?

126
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,160
I will ask my last question now.

127
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,940
In your Nameless organization,

128
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,440
is there a person called Yeon Hyang?

129
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,030
Aren't you going to answer?

130
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,540
That's...

131
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,380
There is.

132
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,060
We will also ask our last question.

133
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,870
Why are you looking for Yeon Hyang?

134
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,280
Her son and daughter are looking for their mother.

135
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,610
Did they already meet? Could he have already...

136
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,950
He must not say it yet. Not yet.

137
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,210
Why are you in such a hurry?

138
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,100
Where is she?

139
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,200
Tell me where she is!

140
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,940
Gil Seon Mi! How can you do such a thing?

141
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,900
Did Lee Bang Won say something?
(Gil Seon Mi)

142
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,620
I will not be used and abandoned like Hong Ryun.

143
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,360
They definitely guarded the servant woman.

144
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,530
Just why? Damn it.

145
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,040
I will explain. Where is she?

146
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,400
What? They're alive? The children are alive?

147
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,700
Master Gil told me to keep it a secret, but it's something that will be exposed anyway.

148
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,120
Gil Seon Mi, this man...

149
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,320
From the beginning, you did something irrational.

150
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,170
What do you want to say?

151
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:02,630
"Let's disguise it as if the opposing faction murdered Yeon Hyang's kids."

152
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,620
That's how Yeon Hyang changed her mind and joined our organization.

153
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,140
It was a plan that you would think of.

154
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,720
Where are the children?

155
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,620
They're with Lee Bang Won.

156
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,880
There's a high possibility that they're in the Ga Byeol Cho.

157
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,350
Yeon Hyang also has a pitiful fate.

158
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,840
Yeon Hyang and I grew up here together as war orphans.

159
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:41,870
Here, we ate, studied, trained, and were raised as Mugeuk candidates together.

160
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,490
I wasn't able to become a Mugeuk but Yeon Hyang

161
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,300
became that person, Mugeuk.

162
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,100
Gil Seon Mi is meeting Mugeuk.

163
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,960
What... are you doing? To a servant...

164
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:15,620
Gil Seon Mi, I have a lot of things to hear from you.

165
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,780
She's Mugeuk. Keep your manners.

166
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,900
Bi Guk Temple's Jeok Ryeong is meeting Mugeuk.

167
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,670
In 1375, pressed by the opposing faction, we were near destruction.

168
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:47,620
At that time, you told me that the opposing faction killed my children.

169
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,080
If I hadn't said that, you would have probably run off to the Western district

170
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,060
and we would've been annihilated.

171
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,100
Did you receive orders from Yook San?

172
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,500
You probably did.

173
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,420
Yook San, you are going to have to pay the price.

174
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,130
Getting into another war among ourselves

175
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,910
is something that must not happen now.

176
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,730
Where are my children?

177
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,090
They are somewhere very close.

178
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,510
Where are they?

179
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,340
Lee Bang Ji.

180
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:41,960
The best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms, Lee Bang Ji, is your son.

181
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,440
Boon Yi is at the Ga Byeol Cho.

182
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,460
For the assassination of Lee Seong Gye, I told you to trick the best swordsman.

183
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,920
But...

184
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,760
That's right.

185
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,490
Even when you knew that...

186
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,010
Do you think it's just that?

187
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:12,140
What do you think I told Lee Bang Ji to lure him away?

188
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:19,140
If he wanted to meet his mother, I told him to come to Yeoamjeong.

189
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,140
That's what I said.

190
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,460
Continue.

191
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,880
All of this misfortune

192
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,630
started when you betrayed the organization,

193
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:43,950
abandoned me, and ran off to the Western district.

194
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,870
That's right.

195
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,620
Continue to rattle on.

196
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:57,660
The reason why abandoned His Majesty and joined this organization was you. Don't you know that?

197
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,820
Keep it a secret from Yook San.

198
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,520
How can there be such dismay? Gil Seon Mi

199
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,370
How are we going to endure this once Muguek finds out?

200
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:09,100
I personally met Lee Bang Won today.

201
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,660
Sam Bong's country is dangerous.

202
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:26,020
Lee Bang Won having different thoughts from Sam Bong looked sincere to me.

203
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,450
Did she not hear about her children?

204
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:35,540
Whether we're going to use Lee Bang Won as a sword, like Hong Ryun,

205
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:41,760
or to use him as poison, like Lee In Gyeom, we still need to think about that.

206
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,050
- Teacher Yook San.
- Yes?

207
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:54,040
You will be in charge of everything regarding Lee Bang Won.

208
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,140
You will have to find out more thoroughly about the plans of Sam Bong.

209
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,080
Giving me the authority? Looks like she did not hear about it.

210
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,970
Teacher, Muguek is giving you an order.

211
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,650
Yes. I will follow your orders.

212
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,080
As you all know, everything is a mess.

213
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:32,920
Like this we were found out by others, gathered together, and comrades that should have not known about each other now do.This is miserable.

214
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,260
Land survey.

215
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,280
I will go and give a report tomorrow.

216
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,020
Where is Cho Young? I need to personally meet her.

217
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,710
- You can't meet her now.
- Why?

218
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,240
- I released her.
- What?

219
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,800
Nameless came to me.

220
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,170
Did you talk about our mom?

221
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,150
Yes. I did ask,

222
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,550
but they all just looked shocked at the mention of your mother.

223
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:22,870
From my perspective, I do not think you can separate the matter of things between your mother and Nameless.

224
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,110
It must be frustrating but wait a little bit more.

225
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,710
Do you think that our mother is deeply connected to Nameless?

226
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:41,070
I don't know yet. If that is true, there's probably a reason for it.

227
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:17,890
That's right, Gil Seon Mi. So you didn't tell her.

228
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:24,690
If Yeon Hyang attacks me now, it will be another war. How can you not know about that?

229
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,080
Right. Did you find out anything about the one who killed Baek Geun Soo?

230
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,180
Yes, that night the one that killed Baek Geun Soo and the assassins next to the king, was not Jung Eun Gwang.

231
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,510
From what I heard from the police bureau, at about that time he was already dead.

232
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,660
Then? Are you saying the king knows martial arts?

233
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,220
If not, did his servant do it?

234
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,940
It was definitely Goksan's swordsmanship.

235
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,870
Was there any message from the servant we put next to the king?

236
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:04,850
Yes. I heard that there's a woman who is a contact between His Majesty and Po Eun.

237
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,250
Right.

238
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,480
They say she's someone he treasured when the king was at his house.
(Jeok Ryong)

239
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,940
It seems like the king trusts her a lot and gave her that duty.

240
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,890
This is the antidote.

241
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,060
If it was that woman from back then...

242
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:33,590
If we catch her and make her speak, we will probably be able to find out the plans of the king and Po Eun.

243
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,740
Capture her.

244
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,990
- You met Nameless?
- Yes. Those people came to me.

245
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,400
It's going according to your plan as expected. What did you talk about?

246
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,630
Their organization's goal is this country's stability.

247
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,890
What? Stability?

248
00:26:52,890 --> 00:27:00,850
Yes. Also, it started during Silla Dynasty with a person called Yeom Jong.

249
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,490
Yeom Jong?

250
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,850
I understand. I will look into it too. Was there anything else?

251
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,600
No.

252
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,330
It is indeed strange that those people wanted to know about the Five Rules, but...

253
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,810
It was our first meeting so I think they did it to have a look at me.

254
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,130
Did they believe you?

255
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,700
Yes. Since I'm even training soldiers, they will believe me.

256
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,870
We have to have a hold of the truth. The truth.

257
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,290
Yes. I understand.

258
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,050
- Bang Won.
- Yes, Teacher.

259
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:42,090
If you want to fool your enemy, you'd have to fool those around you including yourself.

260
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,700
However, after fooling yourself too long...

261
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,360
Does he know something?

262
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,100
you can also become the fake self you're portraying. Be careful.

263
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,680
Yes.

264
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,160
- You there!
- Yes!

265
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,050
What is that movement? Why can't you do it?

266
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,170
Put all your heart to it and like this "heung"!

267
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,800
Don't we just have to pretend to raise soldiers.

268
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,080
I think he's trying too hard.

269
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,460
No. Young Master told us to work hard. Since we are doing it, we should try hard.

270
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,800
Moo Hyul!

271
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,830
Yes? Me?

272
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,450
There will be a example from an already-trained warrior.

273
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:04,240
Show them. Fifth move of the Twin Dragons of the East!

274
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,880
The pit of the stomach, you have to hit in the pit of the stomach, the pit of the stomach. "Heung!"

275
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,200
The side, do you understand?

276
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,290
We have to do the land survey again.

277
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:25,090
- Do it again?
- We already knew that the officers that are under the Gunmoon Saejok from each part of the lands were interfering with the land survey.

278
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,810
That is not the only problem. Even while doing the land survey,

279
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,680
the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok secretly hoard an enormous amount of land by donating it to the temples.

280
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,030
Yes. We cannot do it like this.

281
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,940
Then, are you saying that we should delay the land reform now?

282
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,220
If the land survey continues in this way, there are only 60 mangyul.

283
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,350
If we take out some for the country for this and that, then there are only 17 mangyul left for the people.

284
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,950
The land that will be divided among the people is absolutely lacking.

285
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,430
After retreat from the Wihwa Island, I've already

286
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:03,160
promised the people that I will return the lands that were stolen from them.

287
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,620
But what is my image right now?

288
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:16,200
I killed Choi Yeong, attacked Jo Min Soo and the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok and made King Woo and King Ja kill themselves.

289
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:23,780
I am a person in power who even sent Lee Saek, who the people honored as a scholar, into exile. That is my image right now.

290
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,880
But now you're telling me to do the land survey again?

291
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,440
What will happen to the promise I made to the people?

292
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,540
Yes. We have to think of the public opinion now more than anything.

293
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,190
The people's sentiment does not look good after we just sent lord Mok Eun into exile.
(Mok Eun- Lee Saek's name)

294
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,360
We have to continue even if it's lacking.

295
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,880
It is not that we do not know that.

296
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:52,100
But if we do not equally divide the land to the people, the people will highly disappointed.

297
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,270
Sam Bong, how come you're not saying anything?

298
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:00,180
It's a really difficult problem.

299
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:04,220
If we proceed right away, it won't be an equal division of land.

300
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,300
But the taxes will lower to ten percent, and

301
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,110
- it will be a big help to the people.
- Of course.

302
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,070
Let's enforce it right away.

303
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,310
But if we continue the land survey this clumsily,

304
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,730
the dream we had of really wanting to equally divide the land and give it to the people...

305
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,580
That promise won't exist.

306
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,140
We can just do it again in the future.

307
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,950
When, in the future?
(Jo Joon)

308
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,710
Equal division of land is done by looking ahead for a hundred years.

309
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,400
Do you think we can change the equal division of land every five or ten years?

310
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,970
What should we do?

311
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:44,040
In every part of the land, all of our men were involved with and interfered with the land survey.

312
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,340
The land survey wasn't properly done.

313
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,410
But, will they still do it?

314
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,500
Jeong Do Jeon.

315
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,530
Is it because of your mother?

316
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,690
Why do you look like you have a lot of problems?

317
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,970
Well,

318
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,580
the way I see it, I think you have more problems.

319
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,700
Is it because of the land survey?

320
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,630
I cannot decided whether I have to

321
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,450
continue with the survey we have right now

322
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,370
or wait endlessly until we have enough survey results.

323
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,540
When you are in a sword fight.

324
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,500
how do you judge between when to attack and when to defend?

325
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,620
For a swordsmen like me, we have to judge in a split second.

326
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,320
How do you choose?

327
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,260
It's not important what choice you make.

328
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,080
What's important is to believe in that choice.

329
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,170
The trust that
(Lee Bang Ji)

330
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,980
my attack and my defense will work, no matter what.

331
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,970
But what if you were wrong to trust it?

332
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,460
You die for sure.

333
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,960
Wow.

334
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,880
For me, whatever happens, now I just wish something would happen.

335
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,980
Still, if they do it now,

336
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,760
the people won't be getting more land.

337
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,590
Is that so?

338
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,180
Hey, Gab Boon,

339
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,080
you also heard about that rumor going around the market about the general, right?

340
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,220
What rumor?

341
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,660
No, well, it's not anything special.
(Myo Sang-Myuhyul's grandmother)

342
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,280
It's okay. You can say it comfortably.

343
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,320
Well, what was it again? About the general,

344
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,680
that if he retreated from Wihwa Island

345
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,130
just to become the king.

346
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,010
Only the dead General Choi Yeong is pitiful.

347
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,780
They say things like this.

348
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,990
Not everyone thinks like that.

349
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,550
Just the servants of the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok.
(Gab Boon)

350
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,930
Yes, that's right. Most of the people

351
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:18,030
think that things are so much better than before.

352
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,510
Did you come? My husband just now went out.

353
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,560
- Yes.
- Should I bring him?

354
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:39,780
If it's like this, the equal land distribution that we were doing can't be enforced.

355
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:43,580
Not all the people will get to share land.

356
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,070
Have you talked to your organization members?

357
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:52,510
Our members ask me every time they see me.

358
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,950
When are they going to own their land

359
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,350
and when can they go back to their hometowns.

360
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,080
We are not accustomed to

361
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,910
looking at the future.

362
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,260
It's because the people who are here today

363
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,370
might not be here tomorrow.

364
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,040
Even if it's not an equal land distribution,

365
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,370
they will probably be happy with just that.

366
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,560
But if we lose this chance,

367
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,250
we might not be able to do the equal land distribution again.

368
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,750
The people who got their lands stolen

369
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,630
will get their lands back but the equal divisions of land

370
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,910
might end by just lowering the taxes.

371
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,680
If our members hear that,

372
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,130
they will probably say this:

373
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,680
"Please don't let it end."

374
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,910
"Please give us land too."

375
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,180
It's not easy to do.

376
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,930
Yes, but

377
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,370
you do not just do easy things, right?

378
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,150
You will do something.

379
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,730
You will not look away and you will not forget about the people.

380
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,460
Then you will at least do something.

381
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,110
Then what should I do? Should I just die like this?

382
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,060
I have to at least do something to live.

383
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,890
As long as I'm alive. Is that what you're saying?

384
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,640
Yes. I believe in you.

385
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,480
We'll proceed with the land reform like this.

386
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,310
- Brother!
- Then do you mean to give up on the equal divisions of land?

387
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,710
We're not giving up on it. We will keep on preparing it.

388
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,710
I ordered Lee Shin Jeok to secretly do something.

389
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,680
It's been a while since Lee Shin Jeok was away. What was he doing?

390
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,390
I will talk to you separately.

391
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,380
Please allow us to move forward.

392
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,880
I have to.

393
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,910
Go ahead.

394
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,310
- Brother!
- Please trust me.

395
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,260
For now, we'll have to step forward.

396
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,570
There is a big problem in the market.

397
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:31,170
♫ Going away! Our general is going away!

398
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:37,070
♫ General Choi Yeong is pitiful.

399
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:42,170
♫ General Choi Yeong is pitiful.

400
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,690
♫ Because we are vexed...

401
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,490
We can't just stay still

402
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:50,390
while our land is taken.

403
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,390
We have to disrupt public opinion and stop Sam Bong.

404
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,000
Jeong Do Jeon. That man,

405
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,370
his teacher, our teacher.

406
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,590
He put him in a cell.

407
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,110
How can he do that to his teacher?

408
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,760
How can an educated person be like that?

409
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,790
Because of that person,

410
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,350
I went into exile and just got back.

411
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,130
Something like that was done to me

412
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,180
by someone I was close to for my entire life.

413
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,210
The plan that Jeong Do Jeon is working on right now

414
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,710
is just for him to gain power.

415
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:42,230
By using General Lee Seong Gye,

416
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,400
he's trying to get ahold of power! That's what it is!

417
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,350
How can a reform from such an immoral and evil man

418
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,880
be a proper reform?

419
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,100
He attacked his own teacher

420
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,890
and threw out his own friends for his reform.

421
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,590
In the end, he will ruin the country.

422
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,160
Did you not see the Gaegyeong market street just now?

423
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,420
How many days have they marching been for?

424
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,490
Is that all? Because of Lord Lee Saek's impeachment,

425
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:23,390
even the Sadaebu resent me.
(King Gong Yang, Goryeo's last king)

426
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,310
But Your Highness,

427
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,760
from this reform

428
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,510
the people will be in rich and

429
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,330
the public opinion will be taken care of.

430
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,700
Look at the public opinion now.

431
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,430
Who are the people on the streets blaming?

432
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:44,220
- Your Highness.
- I am tired.

433
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,640
Let's stop here.

434
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:14,290
Go and tell Po Eun everything that you heard.

435
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,790
Your Highness.

436
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,220
You look very worn out.

437
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,040
Please gain strength.
(Cheok Sa Gwang)

438
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:30,150
Everything will go according to Your Highness' plan.

439
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,870
Are you going to Lord Po Eun's house?

440
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,980
Who are you?

441
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,140
We have something to ask you so come with us.

442
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,760
Why are you doing this?

443
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,470
Hey!

444
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,710
What are you doing?

445
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:27,530
Don't bother us and just go on your way. We're just fixing a misunderstanding.

446
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,690
Let go of her hand before you talk.

447
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:34,100
What are you doing disturbing a woman this late at night?

448
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,680
Get rid of him.

449
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,520
T-T-That guy. He's Moo Hyul from Do Hwa Jeon.

450
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,530
Ya Cha?

451
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,360
Let's go.

452
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,410
Thank you, Warrior-nim.

453
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,770
It's nothing.

454
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,830
It's been chaotic these days. It's dangerous at night, Lady.

455
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:32,330
Where are you going?

456
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,990
I will take you there.

457
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,200
You don't have to.

458
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,980
It's okay. I will accompany you there.
(Moo Hyul)

459
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,380
You really don't have to.

460
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:50,260
My grandmother said that I should always protect women and children.

461
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,380
You dance?

462
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,890
Yes. I also play musical instruments.

463
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,540
Wow. You're a person of many talents.

464
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,650
I don't even know any of those.

465
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,780
Ah, among my friends, there's one who sings really well.

466
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,370
So it's not like I'm completely clueless when it comes to music.

467
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:26,110
Seeing you earlier, it seems that you're quite skilled in martial arts.

468
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:30,230
I almost got hurt there. Thank you.

469
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,680
Where do you stay?

470
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,960
I'm from Ga Byeol Cho.

471
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,920
Ah, Ga Byeol Cho.

472
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,350
By any chance, can I watch you dance?

473
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,040
I haven't seen one like that before.

474
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,110
I don't know if I will have a chance to show you but if there is, I will.

475
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,470
I will go now.

476
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,390
Ah, yes.

477
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,170
Take care.

478
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,370
Yes, Warrior-nim.

479
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,650
Why did you follow me?

480
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,160
Your senses are good.

481
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,580
You shouldn't have sent that warrior away.

482
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,740
We're not here to harm you.

483
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:50,920
Just come with us for a bit and answer our questions. Let's go quietly.

484
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,180
I will not go with you.

485
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,970
Then, we have no choice. Get her.

486
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,580
What is that? Just what is it?

487
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:02,480
This woman is not my match.

488
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,020
Are you Nameless?

489
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,280
If not...

490
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,040
Well, it doesn't matter.

491
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,500
Don't do this ever again.

492
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:27,540
Don't bother His Highness or Lord Po Eun.

493
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,380
What?

494
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,930
That way of speaking that doesn't suit her...

495
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:36,290
If you do this again, at that time, it won't be the back of the sword

496
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,120
but the blade.

497
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,620
The servant that survived wasn't someone who does martial arts.

498
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,150
He was not?

499
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:58,500
Yes. I hired a warrior and confirmed it.

500
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,040
Then, what is it?

501
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,420
Wang Yo couldn't have done it.

502
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,280
Was there another person?

503
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,020
It was that woman.

504
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:19,240
I think that woman killed the assassins and Baek Geun Soo.

505
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,580
The woman Wang Yo was going to marry?

506
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,700
I lost.

507
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,730
No, I was no match to her.

508
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:29,930
What?

509
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,590
What are you saying?

510
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,370
That woman was using amazing swordsmanship.

511
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:41,000
Then, that woman killed the assassins and Baek Geun Soo?

512
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,620
Didn't you say it was Goksan swordsmanship?

513
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,890
Perhaps that woman...

514
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,680
Cheok Sa Gwang?

515
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,860
While the market is this disordered, how can we go ahead with such a big event for a country, and

516
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:02,360
he said isn't it the right thing and to set it aside for now.

517
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,230
Did he say to tell me that?

518
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,220
Yes, My Lord.

519
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:13,330
If the king is also against it, like this, it will be hard for us to continue on as we wished.

520
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:19,830
Sam Bong, what are you thinking? What are you going to do?

521
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:28,560
Many places in the market are in chaos.

522
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,270
I know.

523
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,540
It is their last revilement. Do not be hindered by it.

524
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,820
If it were you, what would you do?

525
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:40,790
In the end, it will be done.

526
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,230
Land reform.

527
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,420
Yes.

528
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,570
It will not stop here.

529
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,500
Our goal is to end it at a reasonable reform.

530
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,830
What are you going to do with Yook San?

531
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,690
I'm thinking about it.

532
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,430
Right now, Jeong Do Jeon.

533
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:15,060
We met a really absurd opponent.

534
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,890
I don't know.

535
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,340
You don't know?

536
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:23,560
This uproar will disappear in a bit anyway.

537
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:31,540
But after this time passes, these same steps we were late by, we won't know how many steps it will take in the future.

538
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,350
Why are you laughing?

539
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,460
You have really become an adult now.

540
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,250
What?

541
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,730
What are you saying all of a sudden?

542
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:51,750
Saying that you don't know is very adult-like.

543
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,550
Is that so?

544
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,300
The moment I ask you a question,

545
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:05,070
if it were the insufficient and hot tempered old you, and not you right now, I was able to imagine right away what you would have done in this situation.

546
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:14,260
Meanwhile with your absurd actions that put others in shock several times,

547
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:20,420
you did not care what happened before or after, or look ahead because of your childish short judgement. What did you do?

548
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:25,990
At that time, you did something that you could never turn back.

549
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,620
Let's go to Pandosa.

550
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,290
Do you mean Pandosa?

551
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,780
Tell all your message people to gather up at Pandosa as well.

552
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,750
I will have the Pandosa door open.

553
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,960
Everyone, go in.

554
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,500
Can we really go into a place like that?

555
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,040
Then let's go in quickly.

556
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:20,000
The front mountain looks that way and

557
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,460
- also the back mountain looks...
- Aigo!

558
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,970
Our phoenix, General Choi Yeong, who has saved our country Goryeo many times.

559
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:34,020
- Aigoo!
- How could you die?

560
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,620
Aigoo!

561
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:41,210
Everyone look here. Something happened.

562
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,500
Hey there!

563
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,870
Hurry up and come.

564
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:48,260
- Where are you going?
- Let's go together.

565
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:56,220
Jeong Do Jeon. That man, for these past years...

566
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,250
Something big happened at Ganhan gate.

567
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:54,060
I am Jeong Do Jeon.

568
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:05,840
I, Jeong Do Jeon, impeached my teacher, colleagues, and seniors and sent them into exile.

569
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,520
It was all because of this.

570
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,630
Everything in here are Goryeo's land deeds.

571
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,600
In other words, these are

572
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,980
the lists of land that was taken away from the people and

573
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,160
the lists of land you guys have to get back.

574
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,780
Just because of some words written on these land deeds.

575
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,380
You guys have lost the land you worked hard for, for years, and

576
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,760
you were out of your hometowns and are wondering around in an unfamiliar place.

577
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,310
Now, in here,

578
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:47,760
there are documents of land deeds the country has harshly taken away from the people through huge taxes.

579
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,300
Also in Do Hwa Jeon, there's this much new data from the land survey.

580
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,660
It is 60,000 mangyul of land information. Of course that is not everything, but.

581
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,860
we came all the way here after difficulties.

582
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:04,670
With the land survey information as the base, and an informed plan for equal division of land,

583
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,770
we can get back most of the land that was taken away from you and

584
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:12,270
you'll only have to pay 10% in taxes.

585
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,960
Perhaps, this is...

586
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,810
But, as you have seen in the market,

587
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:31,920
the people who took and exploited the land have brought up complicated political logic and are going against it.

588
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:36,580
Just what is that person trying to do?

589
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:41,030
Politics. What is politics?

590
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:48,130
Politics might look complicated but it's actually simple.

591
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:52,390
Politics. Politics.

592
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:56,610
Politics is sharing and distribution.

593
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:00,810
The problem of politics, in the end, is who do we gather from and give to?

594
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,990
Who do we take away from and who do we fill up?

595
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:10,370
You guys! Who have you taken away from and whose greed have you filled up?

596
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,130
I, Jeong Do Jeon,

597
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,320
will practice politics from now on.

598
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:10,410
This country's land is a rotten land that has been exploited and cheated for the past 500 years.

599
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,670
How can everyone divide a rotten land?

600
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:18,270
Don't you guys think it is the right thing to set it on fire and do a slash-and-burn field?

601
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:23,670
- Slash-and-burn?
(an agricultural technique that requires cutting and burning plants to create fields)

602
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:24,670
What?

603
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,410
What is that person saying right now?

604
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,120
Set it on fire!

605
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,770
Burn them all!

606
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:47,700
Burn it! Burn it!

607
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,460
This is what you cannot turn back from.

608
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,440
If all these land deeds are burned,

609
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,060
there's no other choice but to divide and distribute the land.

610
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,040
Land.

611
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:14,210
Who's going to burn this? I'm a Sadaebu so I haven't done slash-and-burn.

612
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:22,000
What about someone who has done slash-and-burn step up and do it?

613
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:30,930
It's also good for someone who has done slash-and-burn to do it but it's about setting something on fire.

614
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:35,370
Don't you think someone who has set something on fire before can do it well?

615
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:46,310
I have set something on fire. When I got chased out of my village's land,

616
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:49,900
the land was stolen but the house was mine.

617
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:54,780
I don't have any way to make a living.

618
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:59,960
So I just set everything on fire and came here.

619
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:04,680
I also have done that, I'm someone who has burned some hay stacks.

620
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,740
Let's all burn it!

621
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,860
No! What are you doing, Jeong Do Jeon?

622
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:34,700
You bastard! Don't do it! No! Put out the fire!

623
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,120
No. This. What is this...

624
00:58:54,270 --> 00:59:01,290
Now, this country's land will be reborn!

625
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:18,360
In September 1390, Goryeo's land deeds were set on fire in Gaegyeong and the fire did not die down for many days.

626
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:30,530
He was able to do it.

627
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,370
You are amazing.

628
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:40,040
But I will make you step down and rest soon.

629
00:59:53,940 --> 01:00:00,940
That man... That man...

630
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,920
I still like him. Damn it.

631
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,880
Six Flying Dragons

632
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,240
Ajussi said that it won't end here.

633
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,110
This person...

634
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,440
Isn't he really trying to change the entire world?

635
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,760
Now he will be a direct threat to us as well.

636
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,260
Mom, are you being threatened? Brother can save you.

637
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,730
Nameless is me. Don't try to look for me anymore.

638
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:58,380
We need to help Po Eun.

639
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:03,400
We need to kill Lee Seong Gye. Sam Bong will get the backlash from this.
