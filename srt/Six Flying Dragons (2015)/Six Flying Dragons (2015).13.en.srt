00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,630
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,890
Aren't you supposed to get rid of a troublemaker while he's still young?

3
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,650
This is what being young is.

4
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,650
I will get a hold of such thoughts of yours.

5
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,550
From now on, call me your teacher.

6
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,120
I heard that a really famous storyteller lives here.

7
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,590
If you came here looking for a storyteller, then you did the right thing.

8
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,280
Please wait.

9
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,530
Brother! We have a customer!

10
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,170
Brothers! Brothers, brothers!

11
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,960
Gil Tae Mi is here.

12
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,080
Aigoo!

13
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,980
You who were looking for a storyteller so early in the morning,

14
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,630
who could you be? I am,

15
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:59,140
the one who sings, the one who dances!

16
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,640
the one who does masked performances!

17
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,670
The one who leaves you breathless, I'm the storyteller!

18
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,600
Really?

19
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,870
Yes. That is right.

20
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,810
Can you please take off that mask?

21
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,940
Yes? Why are you being like that?

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,860
If I tell you to take it off, just do it

23
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,820
if you don't want to die.

24
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,510
Ah, seriously...

25
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,200
Aigoo, I'm going to perform soon though...

26
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,600
Was it not?

27
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
I'm not sure.

28
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,160
It's not. It's not.

29
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,710
You can't even avoid that one?

30
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,750
Anyway, it's not you.

31
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,540
Find that stone piece and use it for treatment.

32
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,930
That is an expensive jade.

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,350
Do you want one more?

34
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,370
If that person is the storyteller, do you think he would reveal himself as that?

35
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,340
Then, where are we going to find that person?

36
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,500
The guys saw that person's face.

37
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,060
I've split them up to every place in Gaegyeong, so please just wait.

38
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,180
There's a problem at the Do Dang right now.

39
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,490
Problem? What problem?

40
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,610
The man called Yak San is alive.

41
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,210
What?

42
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,520
General Lee Seong Gye brought Yak San to the Do Dang...

43
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,290
Really?

44
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,250
Something really bad happened to Hap Ha.

45
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,020
Ah, I didn't get to see that funny thing.

46
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,980
Make sure to find that person.

47
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,660
Don't kill him and make sure to bring him to me.

48
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,010
Should I give you a jade?

49
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,580
No. If what that person Yak San is saying is true,

50
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,260
the charges against General Lee Seong Gye are groundless.

51
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,890
Also, if there is someone who plotted this, we have to catch that person.
(Choi Yeong)

52
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,970
Of course. That person dared to slander General Lee Seong Gye

53
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,200
and planned to cause problems for Goryeo's Do Dang. That person must be punished for those crimes.
(Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo)

54
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,700
Teacher!

55
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,810
Thank you for saving me.

56
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,780
Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon

57
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,880
Lee Bang Won

58
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,360
For accepting me as your disciple,

59
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,710
thank you.

60
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,840
So

61
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,950
please accept this disciple's first question.

62
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,270
With your right method that doesn't use the ways of the current troubled times,

63
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,260
can you win the fight against those people?

64
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,520
Can you chase those people out?

65
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,580
The people I have seen,

66
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,700
more than a person who is right,

67
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,320
they like a person who wins.

68
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,270
My father.

69
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,890
They like my father not because he's upright

70
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,840
but because he wins. He wins every fight.

71
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,440
That kind of person

72
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,240
has finally jumped into the world of politics.

73
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,510
You have to win.

74
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,160
If you don't win,

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,740
the people will immediately abandon my father.

76
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,080
You have to win.

77
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,170
You surely have to win and—

78
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,890
I will win.

79
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,670
I will win.

80
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,640
Man to man,

81
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,430
can you promise me that?

82
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,640
Man to man, can you promise me that?

83
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,500
I promise.

84
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,680
Could you be...

85
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,670
the child from back then?

86
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,970
Yes.

87
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,150
That's right, Teacher.

88
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,770
So that's why Boon Yi so earnestly asked that you be saved?

89
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,450
You met when you were young.

90
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,040
What do you mean by that?

91
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,000
She knew me from when we were young?

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,990
You didn't know?

93
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,600
Bang Won will be released today so come to Jin To Jae Hill

94
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,930
His body won't be in good shape. Please come and take good care of him.

95
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,510
Because you have saved me three times now.

96
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,340
Three times?

97
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,560
I only saved her twice.

98
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,250
Then the first time I saved her was...

99
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's go.

100
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,710
Then what do I do?

101
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,260
Your father has to have power.

102
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,170
Boon Yi was that child?

103
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,800
Are you okay? Can you walk?

104
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,950
Hey, are you okay? Should I carry you on my back?

105
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,010
Hey, this won't do. Let's hurry and go.

106
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Please be careful! Be careful!

107
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,150
He just came out of the investigation office.

108
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,790
Aigoo... Just stay still.

109
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,230
Ah, really. Those bastards.

110
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,120
Pull your knee up.

111
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,790
That's right.

112
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,560
Ajussi!

113
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,850
How could you just thoughtlessly do it?

114
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,550
Are you going to be responsible if he dies during treatment?

115
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,080
Seriously...

116
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,050
That's why I told you so many times to do it gently...

117
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,620
What kind of a young person could be such a crybaby?

118
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,700
Ah, it hurts.

119
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,280
He said it hurts.

120
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,370
Put it like this. That's right.

121
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,420
Are you okay?

122
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,610
Hey, why are you not saying anything and just smiling like that?
(Boon Yi)

123
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,490
You're in your right mind, right?

124
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:27,610
No? Hey, what's your name? Tell me! What about my name?

125
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,470
Lee Bang Won, say it. What's your name?

126
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,160
Hey... Let's hurry and go.

127
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,470
Why didn't you tell me

128
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:56,620
that you were that child I went to Do Hwa Jeon with.
(Do Hwa Jeon: Lee In Gyeom's house)

129
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,440
Never mind. There's no use in that.

130
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,690
From the time you set fire to the government office,

131
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,810
when you took my top off,

132
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:20,320
when you ran and avoided me at the inn,

133
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,450
I knew it.

134
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,150
"It's her."

135
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,850
"That girl is mine."

136
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,260
♫ I recognized you many times  ♫

137
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,190
♫ Thanks to you, I am alive  ♫

138
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,720
♫ Without a doubt, I recognized your voice  ♫

139
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,630
♫ Even when you ask me a thousand times, I think it's you  ♫

140
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:02,330
♫ The one who made me live and breathe, it's you  ♫

141
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,490
Hurry and put it on.

142
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,330
Hurry and put it on.

143
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,600
Hey. At times like this, just...

144
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,330
I don't think that I'm yours.

145
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,250
What is this? Why am I like this?

146
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,530
Why did I suddenly think of Brother?

147
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,490
My heart was racing and I was happy.

148
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,770
I feel like I'm only betraying Brother.

149
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,280
What to do? What do I do?

150
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,480
Aigoo. You also know how to be shy.

151
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,980
I don't have any feelings for you.

152
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,890
It's been a long time since I decided not to feel anything for other people.

153
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,130
I can't give my affections to anyone. Receiving them is burdensome so I don't like it.

154
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,680
In this good for nothing world, what of love and affection?

155
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,210
Because you saved me, I'm just thankful.

156
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,580
You and I share the same will and we're comrades with the same goal—

157
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,860
That's right. Right, comrades.

158
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,480
Ajussi is the same. We are all comrades going on the same path.

159
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,460
That's a more important relationship than family.

160
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:33,070
So, are you rejecting me right now?

161
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,350
Yes.

162
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,480
Me, Lee Bang Won?

163
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,280
Now that I thought about it,

164
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,820
I don't like that you're Lee Bang Won.

165
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,180
Boon Yi, Sa Wol, Chil Woo...

166
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,330
We are people who don't even have surnames. You're a nobleman.

167
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,840
Love for a person like you...

168
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,810
If I get tangled with something like that, I'll just have to live a hard life and be punished.

169
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,240
I can clearly see it in front of me.

170
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,000
The record of the Hwa Sa Dan girl's face and specialties have already come out of Yak San's mouth.

171
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,240
If we keep on digging, your name will surely come out too.
(Hong In Bang)

172
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,280
What do you want me to do?

173
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,900
Lee In Gyeom

174
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,580
It's about time for me to me rest.

175
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,920
I need to be positioned in one of the highest offices

176
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,620
including the investigation office.

177
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,980
Well that, do as you please.

178
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,500
Then, I will be responsible of this case and cover it up.

179
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,830
Do a good job.

180
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,440
Please send him my congratulations.

181
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,950
To whom?

182
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:25,190
Do you think this victory belongs to you?

183
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:29,940
My congratulations is for the victor who planned this.

184
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,210
Congratulate that person for me.

185
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,280
What is it that you're talking about...

186
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,150
What did you do this time? Did you even do anything?

187
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:47,790
You are just a pawn on the chess board.

188
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,850
Yeong Mun Ha Shi Joong?

189
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:57,020
Yes, you will be in charge of it. It was decided like that.

190
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,340
Is Lord Lee In Gyeom really stepping down?

191
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,140
It was hard for him to reject it.

192
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,100
You were here?

193
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,560
I talked to His Highness

194
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,550
and handed in my resignation.

195
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,090
The two of you can talk.

196
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,280
Why did you do that? Why did you do such an irrational thing?

197
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,860
In Go or Chess,

198
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,710
when you start a game, predicting your opponent's move and thinking of a counterattack, you become absorbed in it.

199
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:59,130
As you become absorbed in it, you cling to it more.

200
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,900
After doing that for a while,

201
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,800
how this match started, who's match it is,

202
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,710
it is a situation where you forget those things. That's when you'd feel flustered.

203
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,860
Who are you playing that game with?

204
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:25,800
General. From here on, your duty is very important.

205
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:34,190
Watch over Lee Seong Gye.

206
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:40,920
Carefully look at the shadow behind Lee Seong Gye.

207
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,370
The evil doings of Hong In Bang have surpassed those of Lee In Gyeom.

208
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,830
He has taken control of the government so he'll be worse.
(Nam Eun)

209
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,060
Until when are you going to be allied with that person?

210
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,010
It's inevitable that I ally myself with Hong In Bang to move on to the next step.

211
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,410
Yes, I know.

212
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,040
But don't you think that Hong In Bang could also strike us first?

213
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,260
It's better to shed less blood.

214
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,600
You'll understand my words later on.

215
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,500
General! We've done a big thing by joining hands.

216
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,020
Our alliance is only up to here.

217
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,890
General Choi Yeong said that he'll remove you from the Do Dang, right?
(Lee Seong Gye)

218
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,590
To avoid that, you decided to offer up half your assets.

219
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,780
So?

220
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,790
But now that you've avoided that danger and even gotten a higher position,

221
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:42,120
I think I've done everything regarding the approval of the An Byeon Book.

222
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,680
Yes. You did that.

223
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,480
But from here on, you'll have to fight me.

224
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,720
Will it work?

225
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,700
The Ga Byeol Cho and I have never avoided any fight.
(Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army)

226
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Is that so?

227
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,710
Also, I've never lost.

228
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,690
What?

229
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,810
Are you saying that you've parted ways with Hong In Bang?

230
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,960
That's what I said.

231
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,310
What did Lee Seong Gye do? Did he break the alliance?

232
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,980
It worked out better this way.

233
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,660
What do you mean, better?

234
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:37,410
Since we've accomplished the deed by being allied with Lee Seong Gye, now it's time to pick at his share.

235
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:42,470
Because he broke the alliance himself, we got rid of some cumbersome work.

236
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,800
We now have an advantage in the Do Dang.
(Woo Hak Joo)

237
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,680
So what do we need Lee Seong Gye for?

238
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,140
Yes. Since General Choi Yeong has become the Yeong Mun Ha Shi Joong,

239
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,750
we have ten people on our side.

240
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,440
The decisions of the Do Dang will be made by us.

241
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,740
I can't do it with Hong In Bang.

242
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,880
Now, Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi have the majority of the Do Dang.

243
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,170
So our plan is to restrain those people

244
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,730
through our alliance with Hong In Bang, while establishing a new power...

245
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:24,090
Am I not telling you that I'm rejecting that plan right now?

246
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,210
Don't you know where my power comes from?

247
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,490
Also, what do people see when they look at me, Lee Seong Gye?

248
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,290
I do understand what you're saying, but...

249
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,750
As a person who knows that, how can you put me with Hong In Bang?

250
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,690
How can you make me create an alliance with that person and make me weak?

251
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,680
This is my will.

252
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,290
I'm asking for a different plan.

253
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,120
This person's greed is really enormous.

254
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,960
He doesn't listen to muddied words and to protect his honor,

255
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,710
he has chosen this path.

256
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:14,460
Why are you not answering? Do you not have a plan now?

257
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,080
It's not that. I will offer a new plan.

258
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,730
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

259
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,580
Bang Won!

260
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,570
Young Master! Young Master!

261
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,640
Young Master!

262
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,670
Are you okay? I went to the investigation office and they said you already left. Where did you go?

263
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,720
I was really upset that something like that happened while I wasn't around.

264
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,100
This bastard. If the investigation office hadn't taken you, I would have killed you.
(Lee Ji Ran)

265
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,970
I heard about it, Hyung-nim. For me, you did all sorts of things and used your power.

266
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:58,260
If that happens again, I won't care of you live or die.
(Lee Bang Woo)

267
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,270
Yes, Hyung-nim.

268
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,060
Father.

269
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,480
I was wrong.

270
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,760
No matter what punishment you give me...

271
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,600
I know that what you said is right.

272
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,160
Father!

273
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:51,420
That's right. To you, I'm probably a great father.

274
00:24:52,360 --> 00:25:00,530
That great father surrendered to an evil person and lowered his head.

275
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,370
To think that you saw that image when you were young,

276
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,650
how did you live all this time?

277
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,920
Don't be like that. I was wrong.

278
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,100
You were so proud of me.

279
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,590
I will become a father you will be proud of again.

280
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,810
I won't lower my head to evil and I won't hold on to something dirty.

281
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:53,050
I will become a father who's proud and confident.

282
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,480
I will do my best to be like that again.

283
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,890
I will definitely work hard.

284
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:04,510
Father, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

285
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:09,880
It was because of his son? Being aloof wasn't because of his greed?

286
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,360
Does it mean that he broke the alliance with Hong In Bang because he wants to be a proud father?

287
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:23,340
I wasn't going to eavesdrop. I'm sorry.

288
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,970
Actually, I was also eavesdropping.

289
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,280
To protect the people in my care,

290
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,470
I will save Bang Won. And not only him.

291
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,300
To protect my people, I have to go into politics.

292
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,250
I need to enter the Do Dang.

293
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,660
I will become a father who you can be proud of again.

294
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:59,460
Fence, family, father, honor...

295
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,880
Now, little by little,

296
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,230
I'm starting to know Lee Seong Gye, the king of the country I will establish.

297
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:11,660
But I don't think it will be easy.

298
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,530
The path in front of me will be exhausting.

299
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,840
You said you don't have feelings for me but you're feeding me medicine?

300
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,590
How can a man be so twisted. Shove it in! You have to eat so you can recuperate quickly.

301
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,160
You should also be a good son to the general from now on.

302
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,620
What are you saying all of a sudden?

303
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,300
You eavesdropped, right?

304
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,000
Yes.

305
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,010
Ajussi eavesdropped with me.

306
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,540
It's a smoothly working organization, whether it's the leader or the member.

307
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,360
- I envy you.
- For what?

308
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,540
"So a family is like that."

309
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,820
I thought, "So that's what a parent and child relationship is like."

310
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,840
How was your family?

311
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:43,730
My father died after being dragged into the battlefield when I was three.

312
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,620
Mother

313
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,080
is probably dead since she's been missing.

314
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,910
Don't look at me like that. There are probably a lot of people in Goryeo like me.

315
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:06,790
Even among the people gathered in Ham Joo, there will be a lot of people with the same story as mine.

316
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,160
This country is like that.

317
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,490
So I met Ajussi and listened to his words...

318
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,440
What about your brother?

319
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,770
You have the brother you were with in Gaegyeong.

320
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,300
What happened to that brother?

321
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:30,270
You should have died! You should've died together, stupid!

322
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,170
He died.

323
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:42,120
He probably died because I told him to die.

324
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,620
Are you okay?

325
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,460
He's not a person who can endure this troubled times anyway.

326
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,830
He's softhearted, weak, and has a lot of fear.

327
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,480
He was like that. My brother Ddang Sae.

328
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,940
Brother, why are you like that these days?

329
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,480
Gil Tae Mi came here. We have to leave.

330
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,590
Why are you just staring blankly every day?

331
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,980
Maybe I got defeated by Gil Tae Mi.

332
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,710
You didn't lose. You just didn't win.

333
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,200
After competing with him a few times, I understood. I'm lacking, by a little bit.

334
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,510
Even with as little as that, a warrior can die.
(Ddang Sae: Future Lee Bang )

335
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,280
So? You're being like this because you lost to Gil Tae Mi?

336
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,370
Every day, you don't eat and just sit here looking at the far away mountain. You must be kidding.

337
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,900
You met that person, Unni Yeon Hee, right?

338
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,970
Do you think I wouldn't know when you started to act like that?

339
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,300
It started when we got a request to spread that rumor regarding Hong In Bang.

340
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,640
You came back with your eyes swollen as if someone made you cry.

341
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,470
Let's go far away for now. Okay?

342
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,660
Why did you come see me?

343
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,820
The actions of the Bi Guk Temple monks are quite urgent.

344
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,970
What are they doing?

345
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,650
I don't know about that but a while ago, they started investigating a storyteller.

346
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,870
What could it be for Gil Tae Mi to do it himself?

347
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,010
Yeon Hee

348
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,720
I'd like it if you leave.

349
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,230
I'm really living happily.

350
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,940
But

351
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,590
after you appeared, I, who was living life well, have been having a hard time.

352
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,680
I'd like it if I don't see you.

353
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:09,390
I have no choice but to be harsh. I'm selfish. I've become that kind of person.

354
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,810
It makes life easier.

355
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:19,950
Even if you go to a different place, you'll do well as a storyteller.

356
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,960
That's why

357
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,730
please,

358
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,310
leave this Gaegyeong.

359
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,150
I beg of you.

360
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,510
You should have died.

361
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,460
You should have died together, you fool!

362
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:19,590
Just like always. You just have to do it like always.

363
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,990
If you don't, you'll just break down. Don't be like that.

364
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:38,320
You... are really brave.

365
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,660
Even when something like that happened, you were brave, bright, and glowing.

366
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,610
You're so cool.

367
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,710
Among the people I've met, you are the best.

368
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,040
I'm not brave. I'm not bright or glowing. I'm not cool.

369
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,210
I'm just doing everything to live.

370
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,610
So please get yourself together.

371
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,270
Does it seem like I'm joking?

372
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,760
If you're not joking, then you must be immature.

373
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,260
Immature?

374
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,020
Right.

375
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,190
What can a noble like you and I do?

376
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,880
You calculate the national law.

377
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,970
What can a noble like you and I do according to the law?

378
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,790
Ah, concubine? I won't be like that.

379
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,830
That's not what I'm saying.

380
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,630
In the end, you'd be saying that.

381
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,540
Later, even if I will say that,

382
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,100
right now, I want to be a family to you.

383
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,030
I want to be your lover and to you.

384
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,990
I want to be a special person.

385
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,490
Answer me.

386
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,010
Answer me. Do you like me or not?

387
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
I told you to answer.

388
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,390
I don't like it.

389
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,180
You really don't like it?

390
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,620
No. I don't like it.

391
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,650
I will not make something like a family.

392
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,720
Receiving love from someone

393
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,030
is being to shameless to my brother.

394
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:12,760
- Ah! I asked you to let me meet the minister.
- Don't be like that and just fall in line.
(Hong In Bang's house)

395
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,710
Stand in line!

396
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,640
Excuse me. I'm Kim Dae San from Sa Cheon.

397
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,370
What government office do you want?
(Lee Kwang: Hong In Bang's servant)

398
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,240
In-law! As I opened my eyes, the world has totally changed, with the two of us at the center.

399
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,160
But where did In-law go?

400
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,540
Then, how will you block the Yuan envoy?

401
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:00,470
The more they try to confine you, the more you keep moving and living. Do you understand?

402
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,870
I don't know. Everything was ordered by Jeong Mong Joo

403
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:19,860
No matter how much the world mocks me for abandoning my belief, in the end, I won.

404
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:25,980
I, Hong In Bang, own this Goryeo.

405
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,500
I brought him with me.

406
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:40,160
Congratulations.

407
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,950
You know that what happened during the year of 1375 wasn't our intention, right?

408
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,100
Yes, yes.

409
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,200
We only received orders and did our jobs.

410
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,370
Yes.

411
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,580
Yes. You know, right?

412
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,670
I was wrong.

413
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,770
Save me. Please save me.

414
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:08,030
In 1375, how could the torture you did to me be your own intention?

415
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,590
You were just following orders.

416
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,610
Elder, thank you.

417
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,870
Thank you very much.

418
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:21,390
I understand you, who can only do as ordered.

419
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,090
No.

420
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,420
You should also understand me.

421
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,880
Why is he not coming?

422
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,040
Elder Minister Hong In Bang is here.

423
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,640
In-law!

424
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,820
Aigoo, here.

425
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,830
Okay! Everyone, raise up your glasses

426
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:22,600
When you came to our group and offered your hand,

427
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:30,290
I didn't know that you were this great. But looking at you now. You're not just the head of one group

428
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:35,270
but the person who will become the head of this great Goryeo.

429
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,280
Why are you like this? The Prime Minister is here.

430
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,570
No, no. I also agree. If not for you, do you think I would be in this place?

431
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:49,980
Okay, for Elder Hong In Bang who has become Minister,

432
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,670
let's all drink to that!

433
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,490
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

434
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,490
Congratulations!

435
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,120
The general will stay in Gaegyeong now.
(Gaegyeong was Ga Byeol Cho training camp)

436
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,650
So starting tomorrow, Gagegyeong Ga Byeol Cho's training will be reinforced.

437
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,140
Especially all the newcomers. Get yourselves ready with strong hearts.

438
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,940
Yes!

439
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,830
Especially, Moo Hyul!

440
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,560
Yes!

441
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,070
Although you came in as Bang Won's bodyguard,

442
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:36,010
according to the order of the Ga Byeol Cho, you will learn from the beginning under Young Gyu.

443
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,470
What? B-but I...

444
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,980
This kid, really. That, that...

445
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,110
Yes, for sure.
(Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's grandmother)

446
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,250
Wherever you go, you have to start from the very bottom.

447
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,400
That's the way to succeed and gain world recognition.

448
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,470
Training starts tomorrow at the hour of Myo (5-7 o'clock).

449
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,510
- Keep that in mind.
- Yes!

450
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,470
Hey, look here!

451
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,880
Look...Look here.

452
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:20,410
The three of you are from Ham Joo so you probably haven't heard of my fame.
(Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master)

453
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,060
I...

454
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,840
Hey, what are you doing right now?

455
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,000
What are you doing?!!

456
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,660
As the author of this martial arts book,
Twenty-Four Moves of the Twin Dragons of the East...

457
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,900
Ah! I'm not a martial arts learner but my body has a knack for teaching...

458
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:49,530
How can someone who can't even avoid that do martial arts?
(Lee Bang Gwa)

459
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:54,400
Tricks don't work in the Ga Byeol Cho so do the training from dawn tomorrow.

460
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,940
Yes.

461
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,420
What do you mean learn again from the beginning?

462
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,490
It's probably because they don't know me,

463
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:14,220
Eh? You're laughing? Are you mocking me?

464
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,330
This is really about my blood and tears.

465
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,490
I wasn't mocking you.

466
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,920
It's just that you must like it, warrior-man.

467
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,990
Like? What's there to like?

468
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:30,970
Don't worry. You'll come to understand it when you start training anyway.

469
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,520
Then I've to go somewhere.

470
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,790
Excuse me, but where do you go every day?

471
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,210
Just going to buy taffy.

472
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,940
Taffy...

473
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,650
What? The alliance is broken?

474
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,520
The general wants individual power.

475
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,380
So I'm going to change the plan.

476
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,650
Hong In Bang has become the leader of the majority of the Do Dang now.
(Lee Shin Jeok)

477
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:12,050
We won't be able to do anything in the Do Dang.

478
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:17,350
It's also something that I want but how are you going to stop Hong In Bang's faction?

479
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:20,120
Is that how you see it?

480
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,580
Hong In Bang has already made a fatal mistake.

481
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,500
If his alliance with the general wasn't broken, it wouldn't have really mattered.

482
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,040
But since the alliance has been broken, his mistake has become fatal.

483
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,420
What mistake are you referring to?

484
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:39,670
Attacking Lee In Gyeom. That's the biggest mistake in his life.

485
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,880
That. Why?

486
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,400
You'll see soon. Okay. There things that we've to do.

487
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,470
A different force is coming in.

488
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,620
What do you mean?

489
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,360
Haedong Gapjok?

490
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,130
You're in control of the whole Do Dang and it's our world now.

491
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,240
What do you lack that you would extend your hand to those people of Haedong Gapjok?
(prestigious families who had been high-ranking officials, married royal family members and had political authority)

492
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,040
If we will also have the support of the Haedong Gapjok,

493
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,700
I can see everything completely leaning towards us.

494
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,080
Then, Hap Ha's other people will also

495
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,030
step down by themselves.

496
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,460
Also, the Haedong Gapjok don't participate in the Do Dang themselves.

497
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:30,510
I am not hoping for a big profit. I just want security.

498
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,390
That's why I don't like them.

499
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:37,030
They don't even do anything yet they act almighty.

500
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:42,280
Because they're like that, do you think they're not interested in politics? Right now, because Hap Ha fell out of power,

501
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,920
they're probably making a fuss.

502
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,280
We have all gathered.

503
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:06,500
Min Je: Head of the Haedong Gapjok, nicknamed Eo Eun

504
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,520
It's still the same.

505
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,670
You personally spread the soil with your hands.

506
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:18,350
At this time of the year, the water comes up so the cabbages are sweet. Have some wrap.

507
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:24,390
Teacher... Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom has fallen out of power.

508
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,530
In the end, Hong In Bang did it.
(Jo Ban)

509
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:31,210
He even got the minister position.

510
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:39,510
Stop that and say something, Teacher.

511
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,580
I've only heard of Lee In Gyeom falling out of power just now, so what do I know?

512
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,180
I don't have an insight like Teacher Yuk San.

513
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:55,210
But the genius is at your house, right?

514
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,220
That's Teacher Eo Eun's daughter, right?

515
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:06,450
That's right. Let's go to my house and ask.

516
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,550
I think Hong In Bang has made a mistake, Father.

517
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:16,130
My daughter really has a lot of interest in politics.

518
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,760
So, what mistake did Hong In Bang make?

519
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,320
He attacked Lee In Gyeom.

520
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,770
That. Why is it a mistake?

521
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,030
Because Hong In Bang took off his armor himself.

522
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,860
Armor, you say?

523
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:35,290
General Choi Yeong has always been antsy about not knocking out Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

524
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,190
But why do you think he can't do it?

525
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,740
That's because Lee In Gyeom has been blocking it.
(Min Da Kyung: Future Queen Won Kyung)

526
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,540
Since he attacked Lee In Gyeom himself, he took off his own armor.

527
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,090
Why? isn't it right?

528
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:57,050
Aigoo. My daughter is better than Teacher Yuk San.

529
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,920
Look into Min Je and Yuk San.

530
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,850
If you say Min Je and Yuk San, do you mean the Heads of Haedong Gapjok?

531
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:08,100
Are you thinking of involving yourself with the Haedong Gapjok?

532
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,180
That's right.

533
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,910
Those people not only don't bother with politics,

534
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:18,750
but they also don't have good connections with the members of the Do Dang. It wouldn't be easy.

535
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,540
Why? Do you think I can't do it?

536
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,400
I don't mean that.

537
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,890
Because the Haedong Gapjok supported Lee In Gyeom,

538
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,080
this Hong In Bang cannot get their support?

539
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,960
Why? Because I wasn't from the leading political faction?

540
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,000
I didn't really mean that.

541
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,170
If not, is it because I betrayed the Sadaebu?

542
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,200
No.

543
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,570
Those people follow the trend so they will probably support you, Minister.

544
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,450
What he needs to gain at this point is the people's hearts.

545
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,930
Well, I've seen a few of them.

546
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:17,880
The powerful people who have risen to the top have changed.

547
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,700
Hong In Bang, it could be you in the near future.

548
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,080
He has appeared!

549
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,580
The storyteller! That man has appeared.

550
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,930
- Where is he?
- At the Nam Dae Ga Marketplace.

551
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:41,490
You must capture him alive. You know his skills, right?

552
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,790
Prepare to paralyze him.

553
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,000
They said that Dong Rae Market is really good.

554
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,450
With your skills, we can make it big there right away.

555
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,220
Let's go all the way to Tam Ra.

556
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,540
Okay, let's do that.

557
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,770
- What's wrong?
- Just walk.

558
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,020
What is it?

559
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,650
There are about 20 of them. They are after me.

560
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:23,020
What should we do? There are too many people, they will know you if you fight.

561
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,930
Let's go into an alley.

562
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,560
Now!

563
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,460
Get him!

564
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,060
He's with a girl.

565
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,450
They can't be far away, go look for them.

566
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,450
It will be hard to lose them if I don't fight.

567
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,260
It's a paralyzing drug.

568
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,660
You'll get paralyzed.

569
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,000
It will take six hours for it to subside.

570
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,860
Until then, we can't fight.

571
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:03,480
What should we do? We will get caught.

572
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,630
Brother, let's do this.

573
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,220
Hwa Sa Dan is right in front.

574
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,070
Those people who are following us seem like Bi Guk Temple monks.

575
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,620
We must go there no matter what.

576
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:19,760
Those Bi Guk Temple monks can't go into Hwa Sa Dan.

577
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,600
They have a really bad relationship.

578
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,600
Go hide there until you recover.

579
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,690
You...

580
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,790
I'll buy more time.

581
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,100
What are you going to do?

582
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,200
You know me, my talent.

583
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,090
I'm leaving.

584
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:51,790
Excuse me, come with me.

585
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,420
There!

586
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,110
There!

587
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,010
What is it?

588
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,380
The person we are chasing came in here.

589
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,610
So?

590
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,980
Are you going to search here?

591
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,300
No...

592
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,660
Well, if you allow us

593
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,000
I was thinking of trying.

594
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,500
Get lost.

595
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:58,020
Why does it have to be that wench?

596
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,700
Lord Lee In Gyeom has lost his power and stepped down.

597
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,150
After eight years, the person of power in the Do Dang has changed again.

598
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,120
At a time like this, our information

599
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,910
can be dealt out more expensively than ever.

600
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,630
After Lee In Gyeom stepped down, the status of the people assigned to you,

601
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:52,770
and what they think about Hong In Bang dominating the Do Dang...
(Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan Owner)

602
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,520
Secretly investigate everything and report back.

603
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,980
Yes!

604
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,920
Ja Il Saek, stay.

605
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,780
Ja Il Saek?

606
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,700
That Ja Il Saek?

607
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,160
Yeon Hee.

608
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,120
Yes.

609
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,620
Yeon Hee. Yeon Hee?

610
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,930
Did you find more about Jeong Do Jeon?

611
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,430
He has become Lee Seong Gye's tactician.

612
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,830
It seems that he played a part in Lee In Gyeom stepping down.

613
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,590
Why are you looking at me like that?

614
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:33,980
When did you learn about that information?

615
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,240
How come you're reporting now?!!!

616
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,630
Did you not know that Yak San was alive?

617
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,310
No, not at all.

618
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,940
I didn't have enough time to deeply look into it.

619
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,460
If we found it about it few days ago, then

620
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,720
we lost a big customer in Lee In Gyeom.

621
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,200
I'm sorry.

622
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,860
Fine. What is their next goal

623
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,660
and how was their alliance with Hong In Bang was broken?

624
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,500
Find out.

625
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,970
I'll do that.

626
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,830
Yeon Hee.

627
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,210
You're a Hwa Sa Dan spy.

628
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,690
So it was you. Ja Il Saek.

629
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:29,160
I came thinking I might ask for food.

630
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,240
You're going around without eating?

631
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,170
It's the same now as back then.

632
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,210
Please bring in food and alcohol.

633
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,250
Yes, sir.

634
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,540
Okay, have a seat.

635
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,860
Yes.

636
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,000
Why, you?

637
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,060
How are you...

638
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,980
You...

639
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,690
Are you a spy assigned to Jeong Do Jeon?

640
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,180
Why would you?

641
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,990
Are you living doing that dangerous thing?

642
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,290
Why have you been swept into this chaos?

643
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,230
What happened?

644
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:31,210
Brother said he will help out.

645
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,080
It turned out well.

646
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:37,380
I've sent Yak San away to a salesman in another country.

647
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,050
It's probably a good thing for him.

648
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,570
Okay, let's do that.

649
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,810
Did you not know that Yak San was alive?

650
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,760
No, not at all.

651
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,370
I didn't have enough time to look deeper into it.

652
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,840
So, it was you.

653
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,130
A double spy.

654
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,730
You didn't leave yet?

655
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,580
Don't come looking for me this late at night.

656
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,840
I don't know how you found out.

657
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,320
Ja Il Saek.

658
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,610
The legendary spy.

659
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,940
Rumored to be ruthlessness.

660
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,080
Ja Il Saek.

661
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,260
It was you?

662
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,780
Is this living happily?

663
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,340
And a double spy at that.

664
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:13,140
A double spy who could be killed by either side at any time.

665
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,170
Yeon Hee.

666
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,900
Why would you? Just why would you

667
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,290
do this scary and dangerous job?

668
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,180
Tell me.

669
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,430
Why?

670
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,990
What about you?

671
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:34,860
Even when I'm working as a storyteller...

672
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,560
Gga Chi.

673
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,120
Dok Sa.

674
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,530
The Viper.

675
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,800
Killing Baek Yoon,

676
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,680
stirring up all of this country's political power and the Do Dang,

677
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,970
as an assassin.

678
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:03,590
I don't think that's something you can say to me.
