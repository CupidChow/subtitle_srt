00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,830
Episode 22
General, everyone is safe.

3
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,970
What about Bang Won?

4
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,770
This is a letter from Young Master Bang Won.

5
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,230
I will try to support your attempt to stop a bloodshed tragedy with what little power I have.

6
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,150
So you have to surely succeed.

7
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,640
Of course, I have to succeed.

8
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,350
I have to win.

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,610
What did you say?

10
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,850
All of Lee Seong Gye's family members have escaped?

11
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,070
Yes, Your Highness.

12
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,810
Isn't General Ahn's first troop guarding the Dowhajun? Then how could they...?
(Choi Yeong)

13
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,730
The thing is, there was a secret passageway in Dowhajun.

14
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,460
So they used that passageway to secretly escape.

15
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,410
How could you take care of it like that?
(King Woo, 32nd King of Goryeo)

16
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,750
How could we not know of this secret passage that they knew about?

17
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,650
Your Majesty.

18
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,850
Looking at the petition that they have sent, this problem can be resolved by just holding me responsible.

19
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,590
Please expel me and preserve your safety and national authority.

20
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,850
If you are not here, then there will be no safety for me. Don't you know that?

21
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,950
So right now, put up notices all over the country that they are the rebel troops,

22
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,730
and recruit soldiers. Give out all the riches,

23
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,950
and gather up people to fight. Do you understand, General?

24
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:14,010
Yes, Your Majesty! I will serve you with my life!

25
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,250
We have to find out where they are going to attack. We have fewer men than they.

26
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,710
We need to keep our men together.

27
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,290
Lee Seong Gye's army is at the north gate.

28
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,870
General, Sun-ui Gate is under attack right now, and the leader is General Jo Min Soo.

29
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,090
The one Lee Seong Gye is heading is the leading group.

30
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,010
If Jo Min Soo is at Sun-ui Gate then Lee Seong Gye will definitely attack Soong-in Gate.

31
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,650
But Sun-ui Gate is too close to the palace.

32
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,510
If that is breached, the king's residence is very close by.

33
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,330
For now, we are going to Sun-ui Gate that is close to the palace.

34
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,730
We will annihilate Jo Min Soo's army and reduce the rebel's army by half.

35
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,450
So tell everyone to gather at Sun-ui Gate.

36
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,130
Yes.

37
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,850
It's the King's decree that the retreating soldiers are all traitors.

38
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:13,150
Also, to those of you who volunteer to be the king's soldiers we will give silver coins, and

39
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,690
for each of the rebel generals, there is a bounty of 100 yang.

40
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,850
What's happening?

41
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,450
I brought it.

42
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,700
Boon Yi

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,940
General Choi is recruiting right now.

44
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,200
What?

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,540
Recruiting?

46
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,080
All the group leaders here, tell all your members to agree to the recruiting.

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,720
What?

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,780
You mean become General Choi's soldiers?

49
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,880
Don't we have to support General Lee?

50
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,700
That's right.

51
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,580
Ah, if Leader Boon Yi said so just do it. What's with all talking.

52
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,680
Gosh, shut your mouths and just listen what Leader Boon Yi is saying.

53
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,420
Yes, this is a fight that General Lee is going to win anyway.

54
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:35,680
But there is no reason to shed blood among us weak soldiers.

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,100
Therefore, at the least we have to win with the least fighting and without losing anyone.

56
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,900
What she said is right.

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:50,120
So, all of you stay as General Choi's soldiers, and when I give you the signal,

58
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,920
then you guys have to do just as I say.

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,160
Do you understand?

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,520
Oh, Yes!

61
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,020
I'm Pal Young.

62
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,640
Huh? What is this?

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,260
It's the Ga Byeol Cho.

64
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,280
Ga Byeol Cho? Isn't this the horn the

65
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,000
Ga Byeol Cho that blows just before a fight?

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,360
We can hear it from everywhere?

67
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,380
Gaegyeong is completely surrounded!

68
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,140
It is! Oh my, oh my...

69
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,360
Oh my!

70
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,920
As I decided on retreating, it would be a lie if I said that I did not think about

71
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,480
a new king in the country you mentioned.

72
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,380
But, no matter how small a fight is, I have seen so many forced sacrifices

73
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,060
throughout my life.

74
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,440
But, a foundation?

75
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,160
Constructing?

76
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes, General. I'm also not trying to think too fast.

77
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,300
The determination to not betray the people even if it means sacrificing your family.

78
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,880
I know how hard it was

79
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,180
to come to that one decision.

80
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,380
Just as you said, if I had overthrown General Choi from the start,

81
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,500
this kind of disaster would have not happened...

82
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,400
Just as you wish,

83
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,160
The people and nobles will shake to this sound.

84
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,700
Also Bang Won and the messengers will

85
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,660
be very busy trying to stop this bloodshed tragedy.

86
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,180
It's a very easy thing.

87
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,120
What kind of request is it?

88
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,480
Tell your cousin to just stay alive.

89
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,800
Isn't he a military officer in the 2nd division 6th group?

90
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,460
And isn't your distant cousin a general?

91
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,980
I'm saying to try to persuade them to save their soldiers from the bloodshed, and themselves as well.

92
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,120
Are you saying to take their soldiers out from General Choi?

93
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,320
Yes.

94
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,940
To step out from the army?

95
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,840
It is an earnest request from Sam Bong.

96
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,560
I'm saying to persuade all your people who are military officers.

97
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,620
Won't that decision also be their own choice?

98
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:18,520
It is also your choice to stop the bloodshed.

99
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,420
What do you mean?

100
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,960
As you were being victorious over at the Sun-ui Gate...

101
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,620
Forget everything and get to the point!

102
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,840
Among the four gate's defense soldiers there are runaways.

103
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,380
General! General!

104
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,820
General! At Soong-in Gate... Soong-in Gate...

105
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,860
Speak quickly!

106
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,980
General Min, who was guarding Soong-in Gate, has disappeared.

107
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,400
That's not only thing. Eighty percent of General Ahn's soldiers in the south mountains

108
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,860
have scattered, General!

109
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:58,400
Then does that mean there are only two or three thousand soldiers who can fight if we take out the injured ones from Sun-ui Gate?

110
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,460
I'll have to protect His Majesty. You guys gather all the remaining soldiers and come to the palace.

111
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,520
Yes.

112
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,260
It's done! That's enough!

113
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,780
All the soldiers at Soong-in Gate have left.

114
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,930
It's the lanterns!

115
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,550
The time is now!

116
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,790
Older brother, the lanterns are up!

117
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,290
Charge toward Soong-in gate!

118
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,850
Charge!

119
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,730
Go!

120
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,720
The Soong-in Gate is open!

121
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,080
♫ What's the difference between a sword ♫

122
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,710
♫ and the politics that distinguishes life and death? ♫

123
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,970
♫ Nameless bird in the sky ♫

124
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,860
♫ Why do you cry so sorrowfully? ♫

135
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,260
His Highness, His Highness... I need to protect His Highness.

136
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,080
His Highness... I need to protect His Highness!

137
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Where is His Highness?

138
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,860
He went to the flower garden.

139
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,880
Your Highness, I deserve to die for failing my duties

140
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,280
but I will protect Your Highness until the end.

141
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,370
So escape from the palace with me and...

142
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,860
Let's stop.

143
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,870
Because you lot told me to become the king, I did.

144
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:49,650
Also, because you lot told me to play around, I indulged myself in various pleasures.

145
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,670
but now that you told me to try politics,

146
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,630
I did as you told me again.

147
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,950
But I

148
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,330
couldn't do anything in the end.

149
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,560
What kind of humiliation is this?

150
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,430
Your Highness.

151
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,290
You have always compared me to the previous king

152
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,190
but there's one thing that I think I am better than King Gong Min.

153
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:34,000
I will not abandon the palace.

154
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,820
I will not run.

155
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,790
What did I do wrong?

156
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,350
Don't say things like I violated the military or something and tell me the truth.

157
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:42,190
You, a person without an ounce of selfishness, has got a hold of power.

158
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,440
Because you don't have an ounce of selfishness,

159
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,240
you never allowed any of the people wish and desire.

160
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,500
You pushed them to suffer in the war.

161
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:05,080
Also, you cannot break this country's governing that is rotten even to it's roots.

162
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,850
Although you knew about what Lee In Gyeom did, you still couldn't expel him.

163
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:17,860
Even when you knew about the evil doings of Gwon Moon Saejok, you started politics through it.

164
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,280
Despite your distinct integrity,

165
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,640
you cannot break this corruption.

166
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,910
Do you think that you can break it?

167
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,800
The moment you gain a will to break it, you will need power

168
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,950
and a bigger army.

169
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,840
Once you have more power, you would need to take the people's lands

170
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,300
and once you become like that, at one point,

171
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,860
there will be another Shin Don, another Hong In Bang, and another Choi Chung Heon!

172
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,440
See it for yourself.

173
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,100
There won't be such a thing.

174
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,030
I will ask you one favor so that I can leave in peace.

175
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,910
Please protect His Highness. Please protect this country's court.

176
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,130
Why are you not answering?

177
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,790
I will protect this country's people.

178
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,360
What do you mean?

179
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,710
Take him.

180
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:37,410
Lee Seong Gye! What are you thinking right now?

181
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,390
Lee Seong Gye!

182
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,900
Lee Seong Gye!

183
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,680
Aigoo, Moo Hyul!

184
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,890
-Aigoo, I'm so proud. I'm so proud of you, Moo Hyul!
-I'm so proud!

185
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,520
Please go in. I'll be back soon.

186
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,830
Okay, okay, okay.

187
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,100
Aigoo, I'm so proud, Moo Hyul!

188
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,440
Father!

189
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,900
Long live General Lee Seong Gye! Long live!

190
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,050
Hey! This person. Long live is only said to the King!

191
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,550
If someone hears you, you'll be in trouble.

192
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,170
Is there a different King?

193
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,620
To me, the King is General Lee who saved my son's life,

194
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,450
No he is the king!

195
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,390
Long live General Lee Seong Gye! Long live General Lee Seong Gye!

196
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,020
General!

197
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,620
Congratulations on your success.

198
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,900
Father-in-law, the whole nation is rejoicing.
[Min Da Kyung: Future Queen Wongyeong]

199
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,700
The whole market is filled with the sound of people cheering your name.

200
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,040
Yes. I also cheered with all I have!

201
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,770
Also, thank you so much for bringing my children safely back with you.

202
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,750
I also cheered! Long live General Lee Seong Gye!

203
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,970
Long live! Long live!

204
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,600
You have done well. You did well.

205
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,510
There is nothing I did.

206
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,070
No, you did well.
(Lee Ji Ran)

207
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,620
Bang Won you secretly communicated in Dosung.

208
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,830
And if you had not taken out the other army,

209
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,350
then there would have been a lot more blood lost in the palace.

210
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,090
Boon Yi was amazing.

211
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,420
When we were in siege warfare she directed the messengers perfectly.

212
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,310
Please compliment her.

213
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,200
I have to go out to finish things, so

214
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,000
my dear, give out good liquor to

215
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,930
Boon Yi's people and to Ga Byeol Cho.

216
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,080
Yes, I understand General.

217
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,560
Everyone, you all did well last night.

218
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,050
I have got some liquor.

219
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,450
Above all things, since none of us got hurt,

220
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,060
I'm really happy about that and it is a relief.

221
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:16,600
Oh isn't that all because of Leader Boon Yi?

222
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,560
Is your body okay?

223
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,980
Yea, I'm fine.

224
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,610
Are you that happy?

225
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,650
Do you like Sam Bong's new world that much and

226
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,740
is it that acute?

227
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,160
Older brother.

228
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,600
I have a dream.

229
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,680
Dream?

230
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,520
But in the country ajussi is trying to make,

231
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,470
that dream can come true.

232
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,560
How?

233
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,020
I went inside Sam Bong's cave

234
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,370
and secretly looked into what kind of country

235
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,740
he is trying to create.

236
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,350
But...

237
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,110
It seemed like it could really happen.

238
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,500
What is your dream?

239
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,690
It is...

240
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,060
I'll tell you that later.

241
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,510
If I say it earlier there might be a bad omen.

242
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,100
♫ Just that one name ♫

243
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,730
♫ I am unable to speak it, so in my heart  ♫

244
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,740
♫ I bury it ♫

245
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:00,100
♫ Because you rise up in me ♫

246
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:06,520
♫ Because I can't hold you any longer ♫

247
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,680
Older brother, I have a dream.
♫ Just that which looks like you ♫

248
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:20,710
♫ Just that tear flows ♫

249
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,870
You did well yesterday.
♫ Because it's stained in my breath ♫

250
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,830
You too.
♫ Because it's engraved in my body ♫

251
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,860
I'll go.
♫ The more I forget, the more painful it is ♫

252
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:41,600
♫ In my heart that's been frozen ♫

253
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,610
♫ Time of you flows ♫

254
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,430
Dream...

255
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,460
Did you say you wanted to see me?

256
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,300
I never suspected your loyalty.

257
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,040
There were many collisions between many things,

258
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,640
But I also have never suspected your loyalty.

259
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,650
Yes, but...

260
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,650
Jeong Do Jeon is different from us.

261
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,570
What is different?

262
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,530
To that man, Sam Bong, there is the impurity of treason, and

263
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,870
there is always the poor behavior of going overboard on things.

264
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,000
Have you ever thought of him leading Lee Seong Gye to treason?

265
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,360
Treason? Be careful with your words.

266
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,820
If going against the loyal creed and taking down His Majesty is not a treason, what is?

267
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,890
Even with Queen Tae Ho's opposition,

268
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,600
They made a man a king even when they weren't sure if he was the previous king's son.

269
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,820
Lee In Gyeom, who did whatever he wanted to do with this country, that is treason.

270
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,410
And you who helped him will have to face the consequences.

271
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,950
Po Eun.

272
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,900
What will you do if Sam Bong and Lee Seong Gye do not stop even after dealing with His Majesty?

273
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,300
The backbiting has gone too far, General.

274
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,020
Those things will not happen.

275
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,660
I will not just let that happen.

276
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,230
At the left court, it will be General Jo Min Soo.

277
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,760
At the right it will be General Lee Seong Gye.

278
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,110
Is there any opposition?

279
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,560
Also General Lee,

280
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,370
at Sung Guoon ambassador Yoonsojoong, division,

281
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,880
has recommended Jeong Do Jeon and,

282
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,790
and requests the position of inspector general to be made.

283
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,860
You haven't chosen who will be in that position?

284
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:14,900
No. Give us some time on that matter.

285
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,710
I understand.

286
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,860
For the men we recommended on our side...

287
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,060
I agree with every one.

288
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,510
Then let's hand this plan to Her Highness,

289
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,550
and we will receive her confirmation in three days.

290
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:35,440
Now isn't the problem the position of king?

291
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,300
The king's seventh son.

292
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,290
What do you think about Jung Chang?

293
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,800
King Jung Chang?
(Jung Chang later become King Gong Yang)

294
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,890
Rather it's his personality or morals, he is a good person in many ways.

295
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,740
Well this is a very important matter,

296
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,750
so let's talk about this again when

297
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,490
we get Her Highness' answer.

298
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,220
Jung Chang?

299
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,340
Yes, he is not an affable person and receives trust from many groups.

300
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,060
It seems like General Jo's side won't object either.

301
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,910
Yes, we can say he is a man who benefits both sides.

302
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,150
But from General Jo's side they make requests like Sam Sa, and Sunli Sa,
(positions in control of harvest, and money)

303
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,150
all the economic positions. I have agreed, but

304
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,380
is that okay?

305
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,350
Right now, rather then fighting with them over such matters,

306
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,840
we have to take a position that can allow reformation,

307
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,160
and we have to help the people.

308
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,450
The reformation. Is that what you were talking about a long time ago?

309
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,820
Yes, since we finally have the power to start,

310
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,060
we have to kick in with the reformation.

311
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:55,140
Then, is that really scary scholar coming to Gaegyeong?

312
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,220
Yes, for the past several years, he roamed around everywhere

313
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,100
and only studied one thing. He is a talent among talents.

314
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,890
Then why didn't you bring him from the start?

315
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,360
We have not come to a mutual understanding.

316
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,510
But, it has to be that man

317
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,680
in order to succeed in the reformation...

318
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,190
We Sadaebu also have to gather our strength

319
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,820
and start the reformation.

320
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,610
So Teacher, please be the center of it.

321
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,320
Is that why we all met today?

322
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,380
Yes.

323
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,520
There is no reason for us to avoid other groups now,

324
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,100
or to avoid Sam Bong because of his status.

325
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,400
We did not avoid Sam Bong.
(Lee Saek, one of best three scholars with Jeong Mong Ju, and Gil Jae.)

326
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,520
Sam Bong avoided us.

327
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,430
That is not true. You have misunderstandings, Teacher.

328
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,870
Right now we Sadaebu

329
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,810
have to gather our strength.

330
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,880
Do Eun and Huh Jung, who went on exile for objecting

331
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,950
the conquest of Yo Dong, will also come back. With this chance

332
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,010
we have to start our plan of reformation.

333
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,230
Reform?

334
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,370
Yes, this is the chance.

335
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,110
I'll inform everyone.

336
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,430
Uh, what about... Did the returned generals

337
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,700
decide on the next king?

338
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,030
Isn't that something Her Highness has to decide upon?

339
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,400
That is how it should be but Her Highness, in the end,

340
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,450
will stamp the request with the royal seal with the man

341
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,290
the returned generals have chosen.

342
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,710
I heard that the returned generals are thinking of Jung Chang.

343
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,210
Jung Chang...

344
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,840
He is someone to trust in.

345
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,180
You. Sing the song you were singing in the market street.

346
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,150
What are you doing right now?

347
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,500
Listen to it first, Teacher.

348
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,550
Start!

349
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:50,340
♫ Since the eighteen offspring became the king  ♫

350
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,900
♫ A reign of peace is prospering

351
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,160
♫ My dear husband, when are you coming back from the North?

352
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,820
♫ Let's go on a picnic with a flower in our mouth

353
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,460
十八子 Eighteen sons and daughters (offsrping).

354
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:14,190
The eighteen offspring become the king?

355
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,220
The Lee family is going to become the king?
(李 Lee)

356
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,500
It is shipaljaquiwangsul.
(translated - means the prophecy of the eighteen offspring becoming the next king. )

357
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,420
You, where did you hear this song?

358
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,080
The kids in the market street are singing it.

359
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,120
If it is Lee who came from the north, who will that be?

360
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,080
It means Lee Seong Gye is going to become the king.

361
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,220
What? The eighteen offspring is the next king?

362
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:52,680
Yes. Doesn't that mean the Lee family is going to become the king?

363
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,640
Why is a prophecy like that going around when we have to choose the next king?

364
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,050
Well, if you look at history, whenever a Lee family gained power something like this popped up.

365
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,480
What do you mean about a Lee family in power?

366
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,060
We have General Jo right here like this.

367
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,100
When we were marching everyone cheered for Lee Seong Gye.

368
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,640
Now that I think about it, maybe that is why nonsense like that is going around.

369
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,280
Nonsense?

370
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,180
It's just that at the meeting,

371
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,680
when we were talking about the next king, Lee Seong Gye went rampage

372
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,800
and threw the brush water bowl at General Jo...

373
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,690
Ehem! Their rank status is clear.

374
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,530
How can General Jo be humiliated by Lee Seong Gye who is of a lower rank?

375
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:46,360
That's it. The servants were talking nonsense so I punished them.

376
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,170
Good.

377
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:52,720
But, it does seems like Lee Seong Gye is incredible.

378
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,160
The people are believing those words because it is something that is believable.

379
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,610
Is that so?

380
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,770
♫ Since the eighteen offspring became the king

381
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,280

♫ My dear husband, when are you coming back from the North?

383
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:19,320
♫ Let's go on a picnic with a flower in our mouth

384
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,550
What song is that?

385
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,550
It's spreading in the market street right now, that our general is becoming the king.

386
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,780
The general is becoming the king this time, right?

387
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,200
You rascal! What are you talking about?!

388
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,100
Oh, it's not?

389
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,330
You cannot say something like that so easily.

390
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,350
Yes.

391
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:42,430
But, isn't fortune following General Lee?

392
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:47,270
One said the people's will is the will of heaven. The people are wanting General Lee.

393
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,150
So, don't be too mad at him.

394
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,280
Yeah. Our general is becoming the king...

395
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,740
What are you talking about?

396
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,530
A weird song is spreading in the market.

397
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:10,750
They said it's a song that starts like, "The eighteen offspring are becoming the king."

398
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:16,350
Eighteen offspring... This is the prophecy of the Lee family becoming the king.

399
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,620
The lyrics are a little different but it's something that happened before.

400
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:25,210
But elder Bon Won, the popular sentiment is following General Lee.

401
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,200
Then why are you getting so mad?

402
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,740
The prophecy of Lee family becoming the king is not a prophecy that represents the popular sentiment.

403
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,920
Think about the outcome of the Lee families that were involved in that prophecy.

404
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:41,440
Lee Lui Bang, Lee Ja Gyeum, Lee Lui Min... They all faced a terrible ending for being rebels.

405
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,000
Yes, there was no man in power who survived when they were in involved in that prophecy.

406
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,180
The timing is too good.

407
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,100
Now all influential groups will look at General Lee as their cautious target.

408
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,080
Someone definitely spread it with an intention.

409
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,100
They are already looking for the person who started it.

410
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,740
Who is it? Which group...

411
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,250
Perhaps?

412
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,190
Who did you hear it from?

413
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,570
Some man said he will give us

414
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,610
taffy if we learn that song, Mal Seok told me.

415
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,100
Where is Mal Seok?

416
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,900
At the end of the street, the house with the persimmon tree.

417
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,040
Thanks.

418
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,010
Hey, didn't I tell you to rest a little bit?

419
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,970
The doctor also told you to rest for few days.

420
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,970
For people like us, if we eat a lot and move around we get better quickly.

421
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,970
Oh gosh...

422
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,370
They said it's older brother Kang Po.

423
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,280
Kang Po did?

424
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,570
Yea, he said he got a request to do a show about something like a king came down from the north and stuff.

425
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,510
It seemed like he got a good amount of silver as well.

426
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,450
Let's go.

427
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,550
♫ Since the eighteen offspring became the king.

428
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:08,790
♫ A reign of peace is prospering

429
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,910
♫ My dear husband, when are you coming back from the North?

430
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,200
♫ Let's go on a picnic with a flower in our mouth

431
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,200
♫ My dear husband, when are you coming back from the North?

432
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,300
♫ Let's go on a picnic with a flower in our mouth. ♫

433
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,240
I asked, with what mind did you retreat?

434
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,700
What was it?

435
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,130
It was because I did not want to betray.

436
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:41,610
In my life betrayal is something that can never happen.

437
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:47,340
But, it can be a betrayal of General Choi.

438
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,030
Isn't that it?

439
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,910
Is it because of that silly song that is going around at the market?

440
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,330
Answer my question.

441
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,590
It was during the Oon Bong battle.

442
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:10,150
I once saved a traitor who was pretending to be a Japanese pirate.

443
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:16,620
But that guy at Oui Ha Island said that this is a betrayal.

444
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:24,580
A betrayal against the 100,000 parents who entrusted their 50,000 sons to this country and me.

445
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:31,040
You mean between the people and General Choi, you chose the people?

446
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,760
Between the royal creed and the people, you mean you chose the people?

447
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,920
Then, if it were you what would you have done?

448
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,620
For a normal person like me, I just hope that a hard decision like that won't happen.

449
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,930
It's the same for me as well. Something like that should not happen again.

450
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,810
I will assist you

451
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,700
by your side so nothing like that will happen again.

452
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,610
What do you think about it?

453
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,990
Teacher Po Eun, you would?

454
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:14,900
If you are with us, for us it would be like gaining the heaven and earth.

455
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,270
Will you really do that?

456
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,050
I will give my best.

457
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:31,190
I will definitely protect you from a dangerous and rebellious

458
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,880
decision that might happen later on.

459
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,830
Where did you get all these?

460
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,500
You are Mal Seok, right?

461
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,310
We are not trying to take this away from you.

462
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,530
So tell us. Who gave you this?

463
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:58,260
A man said if I gather the kids

464
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,570
and spread this song he will give me more taffy.

465
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,870
So I just did as he told me to do.

466
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,900
Who is that man?

467
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,420
He just looked like a merchant.

468
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:18,610
Oh, he had a burn mark over here.

469
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:28,860
If you do that play, you might become a traitor.

470
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,830
A traitor?

471
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:34,250
Why would that make me one? Why?

472
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,660
Who requested this?

473
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,360
Well... He just seemed like a merchant.

474
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,700
Do you know where he is?

475
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,810
They said they found out. There was a merchant who told the kids he would give taffies if they spread the song.

476
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,060
- A merchant?
- Yes.

477
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,230
I told them to draw his appearance.

478
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,650
We definitely have to catch that man and find out who made him do that.

479
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,070
Yes.

480
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:59,910
If I'm right, this might become a chance.

481
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:05,230
All the men in power who were involved in the prophecy became traitors and died.

482
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,550
For Father, at this point, it won't benefit him to be involved in that.

483
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,600
Ah, who can it be?

484
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,950
Is it General Jo Min Soo? If not, that guy, Lee Saek?

485
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:22,060
Also if that's not it, it might be someone between those two groups.

486
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:27,980
Well the idea is the problem. It's something anyone can do.

487
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:34,260
You now know too much.

488
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,560
I'm a little worried.

489
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,500
Why are you worried?

490
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,050
I can't know things?

491
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,720
No. No.

492
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,400
You are really someone too good to be wasted in many ways.

493
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,950
In many ways.

494
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,460
Why are you worried? Tell me.

495
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,070
No, I'm not worried.

496
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,160
What? You said you were worried a moment ago.

497
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,540
One second.

498
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,940
Don't change the subject.

499
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,570
I'm not changing the subject.

500
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,560
Do you hear it?

501
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,220
♫ My dear husband, when are you coming back from the North?

502

503
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,180
When the sun rises we rake the fields

504
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,160
- and when it sets, we go home.
- It ended.

505
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,230

512
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:41,640
Come down.There is something I have to ask you.

513
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Oh why are you like this, I did not do anything.

514
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,490
Then why did you run away?

515
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,470
You suddenly came after me so I ran!

516
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,390
I get it, so just come down for a moment.

517
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,040
Come down? Why would I come down?!

518
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:03,280
That song. Why are you spreading that song?

519
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,760
I'm not going to tell you.

520
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,070
If you feel it's unfair then come up!

521
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,960
Ah, that stings.

522
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:28,810
What is your reason for spreading that song?

523
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,940
This could be a big crime. Do you know that?

524
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,680
What? A crime?

525
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:40,800
Aigo, please save me. I also did this by request.

526
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,060
What request?

527
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:49,150
Yes, I'm a merchant that goes around from market to market.

528
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,550
Then some guy said he will give me silvers if I spread this market-to-market, so

529
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,730
that is why I did it.

530
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,460
Who is the one that made you do it?

531
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,400
The name I also do not know.

532
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,420
Someone with an aura... He was a very elderly man.

533
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:09,070
Oh, that man also gave me a silver like this.

534
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,670
Baekmae Hwa!

535
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,980
What is this?

536
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,580
It is a silver, named baekmae hwa, that the Lee In Gyeom family uses.

537
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,590
Where did you meet the man?

538
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,560
It's not Gaegyeong, right?

539
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,600
N, it's not Gaegyeong...

540
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,950
It should be Gyungsanbu. Is it Gyungsanbu?

541
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,210
Yes that's correct.

542
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,100
I got the request five days ago at Gyungsanbu.

543
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,630
Lee In Gyeom, that man....

544
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,460
Listen carefully.

545
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,490
Since you put someone else as the king and sang a song that puts down the king,

546
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,960
you will be treated as a criminal.

547
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,040
What?

548
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,910
But, if you help us

549
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,040
I'll give you wealth.

550
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,610
Wealth?

551
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,390
Oh, if you give me wealth then...

552
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,190
Would you be able to testify?

553
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,250
Then the Lee family of Junjoo

554
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,010
will save your life.

555
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:20,340
Oh, if you give me a lot of wealth

556
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,870
do not worry about that testimony.

557
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,150
That merchant has confessed.

558
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,770
For spreading that song

559
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,090
he received this.

560
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:38,330
Isn't this baekmaehwa that is used in the Lee In Gyeom family?

561
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:40,220
So it's Lee In Gyeom.

562
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,990
Yes, it's Lee In Gyeom. Lee In Gyeom, that guy, even when he is exiled

563
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,890
he is secretly planning things.

564
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,740
From the start he did seem like he was a person that wouldn't back down that easily.

565
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,640
That is why a lot of Sadaebu people, and other's of the same mind,

566
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,990
wanted Lee In Gyeom to receive the death penalty.

567
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,610
Teacher... Are you going to let Lee In Gyeom go like this?

568
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,240
The merchant said he will confess anything if we give him wealth.

569
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,680
Do you think you can arrest Lee In Gyeom?

570
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,940
The reason would be for making commotion in the court by spreading the prophecy

571
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,620
and alienating the returned generals.

572
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,770
You go to Gyungsanbu with the soldiers and find evidence

573
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,730
and arrest Lee In Gyueom right away.

574
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,710
Yes.

575
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,920
I'll go as well.

576
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:31,620
There is something I have to resolve with Lee In Gyeom for the last time.

577
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,410
The Lee family is becoming the king (prophecy)...

578
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,670
Lee Seong Gye is not a person to do that.

579
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,880
However, Jeong Do Jeon...

580
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:48,150
I do not know what he is thinking.

581
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,150
My lord.

582
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:57,060
There is a message. They said it's from Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom.

583
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,960
From Gwangpyung Buwungoon (his position)?

584
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:17,280
Nonetheless, the public sentiment has completely gone over to Lee Seong Gye.

585
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,860
Lee Seong Gye even has Haedong Gapjok as his in-law.

586
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,310
Is is okay for Jung Chang,

587
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,860
who Lee Seong Gye recommended to be a king, like this?

588
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:35,110
My lord, some man brought a message.

589
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,570
What do you mean by some man?

590
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:40,360
He just said to send it to you quickly.

591
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,550
Oh, General Jo?

592
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,220
Why are you here?

593
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,540
I came here after receiving Lee In Gyeom's message.

594
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,390
Yes, I also came right after I got the message.

595
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,250
Anyway, let's go inside

596
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,870
Let's do that.

597
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,790
Your Highness.

598
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:32,730
Why are you here Your Highness?

599
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,620
After receiving Gwang Pyung Goon's (Lee In Gyeom) letter

600
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,620
I came here quickly and secretly at this late hour.

601
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Perhaps, is that how both of you guys came as well?

602
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,840
That is right Your Highness.

603
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,820
This is a strange thing.

604
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,260
I did not see the man Lee In Gyeom sent

605
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,060
but only found this here.

606
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,780
木克日

607
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,430
This is?

608
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,110
The sun puts the tree in huge pain?

609
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,250
What does this mean?

610
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,880
This is a word ligature (when two or more two or more letters are joined as a single glyph).

611
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,020
It's a secret code.

612
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,170
Then can you solve it?

613
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,460
This is probably...

614
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:26,440
Chang

615
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,510
Guk

616
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:33,850
Lee

617
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:38,460
Chang Guk Lee?

618
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,160
Change wins over Lee?

619
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,850
Perhaps?

620
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:54,240
When did say we are meeting Her Highness and giving her our opinions?

621
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,990
It is five days from now, but there is a strange rumor

622
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:59,800
so It seems like we have to move the date up.

623
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,640
Are you talking about that prophecy rumor?

624
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,960
Is that really what Lee In Gyeom spread?

625
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,340
From what we have found out so far, it seems like it.

626
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,920
I have sent Nam Eun to Gyungsanbu.

627
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,940
If it is Lee In Gyeom,

628
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,730
this time he won't be able to escape.

629
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,590
Only if that happens...

630
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:23,570
Under no circumstance can we drag things out any longer.

631
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,520
Before they think of something else,

632
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,000
we have to send in a document, today, declaring Jung Chang as the new king

633
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,950
and get the confirmation.

634
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,280
I got it.

635
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,850
The Left Shi Joong has gone to receive Her Highness's royal decree.

636
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:45,090
As soon as the Left Shi Joong returns, we'll begin the Do Dang meeting.

637
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:09,330
Her Highness' royal decree has been received.

638
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,990
I will relay the decree to the Do Dang members.

639
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,420
"To the members of Do Dang, who are the highest ranking officials in the great Goryeo, and also the foundation of the government,

640
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,620
I send you the will of the royal family."

641
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,400
Lee In Gyeom's residence in Gyeongsanboo

642
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,900
This is where Lee In Gyeom is in exile?

643
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,030
How can this be the criminal's place of exile?

644
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:53,630
To think the who committed evil deeds all his life has been sitting here comfortably, planning a conspiracy instead of repenting his sins.

645
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,990
Now that will be over too.

646
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:00,750
Come here! Come here!

647
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,950
What is it?

648
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,640
I have come from the police office in Gaegyeong.

649
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,380
This is criminal Lee In Gyeom's place of exile, yes?

650
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,860
Yes, that is so.

651
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,100
Make a path!

652
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,990
Criminal Lee In Gyeom come out at once and receive the criminal's rope!

653
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,110
What are you saying?

654
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,710
What do you mean? Did you not hear?

655
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:35,960
Criminal Lee In Gyeom—

656
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,790
He passed away fifteen days ago.

657
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:40,810
How can he obey the order?

658
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,710
What?

659
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,630
"Fortunately, the misguided Choi Yeong has been expelled,

660
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:52,210
and the king is reflecting on his mistakes and is abdicating the throne of his own accord."

661
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,290
"Isn't this the result of the court's goodwill."

662
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:05,670
"Therefore, the continuation of the great Goryeo, and the restoration of the business of the common people, and the government

663
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,300
will be carried by Crown Prince Chang"

664
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:17,780
"His responsibilities will be ever so great."

665
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,250
W-What?

666
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,530
What are you saying right now?

667
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:27,150
Didn't you say you will pass the Do Dang members' thoughts along to Her Highness after five days? Then why...?

668
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,780
What are you doing?

669
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,830
The Left Shi Joong is reading Her Highness's decree on her behalf.

670
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,290
How can you be so disrespectful?

671
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:41,330
They've already agreed on it in secret?

672
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:46,750
What a failure this is. How can it be Crown Prince Chang?

673
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,890
Jo Min Soo, you rascal...

674
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:04,110
She also has ordered that the coronation take place on the last day of next month.

675
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:16,670
Did you say fifteen days ago?

676
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,080
Yes.

677
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,310
Fifteen days ago, Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom passed away,

678
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:24,530
and we even had his funeral.

679
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:33,110
I received the request in Gyeongsanboo five days ago.

680
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:38,960
He definitely said he received the request five days ago, but Lee In Gyeom was already dead fifteen days ago?

681
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,210
How is it that you didn't report it to the Do Dang?

682
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,130
I was going to,

683
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:49,010
but some scholar begged us to keep quiet about it for a while.

684
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,930
What? High treason?

685
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:59,390
P-P-Please spare my life. I only did it because of a request.

686
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:07,560
His hand... His hand wasn't that of a traveling merchant.

687
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,500
Some scholar? Who is he?

688
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,200
I'm not sure...

689
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,950
He seemed like he was some relative.

690
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,030
Speak clearly!

691
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:24,340
Was there perhaps a burn on his wrist?

692
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,890
Ah, yes. There was.

693
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:02,590
Well, that is... I heard that during the meeting with the leaders of the army,

694
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,170
while discussing about the next defense, Lee Seong Gye suddenly flew into a rage,

695
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:10,450
and threw an ink pot right at you, General Jo...

696
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:21,060
I've done as you said, but can we, the Gwon Moon Sae Jok, really stand up again?

697
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:28,130
Reign of peace

698
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:32,110
I did as you told me to, and now they are coming here to catch you ajussi.

699
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:35,410
Yes, good job!

700
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,470
Here's a yeot (taffy)!

701
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,420
Now, go!

702
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,830
Okay, let's begin the song again!

703
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:45,470
♫ Since the eighteen offspring became the king

704
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:56,290
Tonight at haeshi (9pm-11pm), I wish to meet at Heung Gook Temple secretly.

705
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,010
Lee In Gyeom

706
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:14,110
You have to make sure to deliver each secretly.

707
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:37,850
'Chang', 'Geuk', 'Lee'

708
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,410
'Chang' wins over 'Lee'?

709
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,380
Could it be?

710
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:46,180
We have to put Crown Prince Chang on the throne and keep Lee Seong Gye in check.

711
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,580
We've all heard the "eighteen sons become the king", haven't we?

712
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:03,050
Have we been played? Have we already been played?

713
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:13,350
Yes, you have been played, colleague Sam Bong.

714
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,420
It's him.

715
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,720
What do you mean?

716
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:25,900
That traveling merchant didn't do by request. He is the one that is behind all this.

717
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:32,050
You were probably chasing after the dead Lee In Gyeom, so of course you have been played.

718
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:39,100
You've been played by Ha Ryeun.
(Ha Ryeun, a schemer who later puts Lee Bang Won on the throne)

719
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,770
Six Flying Dragons
Preview

720
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:16,820
How is Sam Bong dangerous?

721
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,980
To someone who has nothing but a hammer, everything in the world looks like nail to him.

722
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,680
Sam Bong's hammer, the land system!

723
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,040
Why do you not reveal to the world the incredible research you've done?

724
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,180
It's something that's not going to happen! It's something that's never going to happen!

725
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,520
There's a group that's trying to take Teacher Jo Joon's research. We have to bring it here safely.

726
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,380
Taking the Gwon Moon Sae Jok's lands and distributing it equally among the country's common people.

727
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,180
Wasn't that your dream?

728
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:42,260
If you are really being sincere, then why don't you try kneeling?
