00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,910
I am Lee Bang Won.
Episode 42

3
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,850
Who are you?

4
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,390
I am Ju Che (Zhu Di)!

5
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,330
Ju Che (Zhu Di)...

6
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,230
What did he say his name was?

7
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,620
He said he's called Ju Che.

8
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,670
Ju Che?
(Ju Che (Zhu Di): Later 3rd Ming Emperor Yeong Rak Emperor, also Yongle Emperor)

9
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,450
Who the hell is Ju Che?

10
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,890
He's the fourth son of Zhu Yuanzhang and was appointed king of Yuan areas.

11
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,010
Your Highness, what's going on?

12
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,110
This kid asked me if I wanted to die.

13
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,720
Cut one of his arms first!

14
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,700
Moo Hyul, no! Stop it! That person is the king.

15
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,260
I don't know about that.

16
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,240
King or not, if I stab him, the sword would still go in.

17
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,420
Teacher Ha Ryun, please translate Moo Hyul's words.

18
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,870
Why are you doing this, Your Highness?

19
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,130
Translate it!

20
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,830
I understood it.

21
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,810
So you know our language.

22
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,170
I do.

23
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,170
Then, I will tell you myself.

24
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,570
That ignorant guy who doesn't even know how to write his own name

25
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,690
obviously doesn't know who the king is.

26
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,450
If I tell him to cut you down, he will do so.

27
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:40,790
Moo Hyul, count to ten in your head then you can cut him if you want.

28
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,430
Yes, Your Highness.

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,700
This guy is totally a crazy bastard.

30
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,240
Because of you, all of us are going to die.

31
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,930
Beat him up.

32
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,710
Because he put a sword to my neck, that guy will die.

33
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,330
Your Highness.

34
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,810
Since he risked his life to protect his lord's life,

35
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,140
I will return the corpse.

36
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,140
We were not the first ones who were disrespectful.

37
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,270
We are Joseon's envoy group who came to answer the emperor's summons.

38
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:25,090
But you arrested us in Liaodong fortress without any explanation

39
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:32,990
and Your Highness hid your identity and insulted us.

40
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,850
His country

41
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,190
and his master is in danger while being insulted,

42
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,710
how can a bodyguard just stay still?

43
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,050
That's right.

44
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,850
Tell his family

45
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,130
that he died a loyal death.

46
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,010
He was a good subordinate for a barbarian.

47
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,520
"Only the wise can deal with those who have more than they."

48
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,230
"Only the kind-hearted can work with those who have less than they."

49
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:09,440
Only a good person can serve a small country despite his great country."

50
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:17,000
Only a wise person can take a small country and serve a great country.

51
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:26,880
Therefore, the great country has to act with kindness and virtue

52
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,000
so that the small country can serve with courtesy.

53
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:38,170
Virtue and courtesy are exchangeable.

54
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:48,890
But since you did not treat us with virtue,

55
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,750
our rudeness was caused by you.

56
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:06,710
Mencius. Book of King Yang Hye, third chapter of the last volume.

57
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,390
I also like Mencius. There are some things to nitpick but he's an interesting person.

58
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,430
How did you know our language?

59
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:24,680
Manchurian, Mongolian, Timurid, Tartar, Goryeo language. I can speak them all.

60
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,350
My Father is His Majesty the Emperor.

61
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,310
Do you know how many of his royal concubines are Goryeo women?

62
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,910
My nursemaid was also from Goryeo.

63
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,390
It's not Goryeo anymore.

64
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,870
It's Joseon, Your Highness.

65
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,790
That's right. A new country was created, right?

66
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,610
Your Highness,

67
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:02,710
please spare my bodyguard's life.

68
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,520
That man cannot live whatever he does.

69
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,010
Since a sword was put on my neck,

70
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,360
I will also kill all of my bodyguards. They have to take responsibility.

71
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,000
So how would I be able to spare just his life?

72
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,500
Whatever you say—

73
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,490
Yes, that's right.

74
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,600
You must kill all of them. Of course.

75
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,430
Then, please let him die while fighting.

76
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,100
Are you saying that you're confident?

77
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,640
It's not because I'm confident.

78
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,970
That man's dream as a warrior...

79
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,710
He came to me with just that dream alone.

80
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,870
Even if he dies, it shouldn't be like this.

81
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:19,300
Let him die fighting as a warrior, Your Highness.

82
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,680
This will be interesting.

83
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,110
Moo Hyul...

84
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,300
It's alright.

85
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,680
You tried to protect me

86
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,100
but I don't have the power to protect you.

87
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,480
The only thing that I can do

88
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,640
is give you an opportunity to fight.

89
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,070
You mean...

90
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,390
Staying alive is your part.

91
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,850
That is all I need.

92
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,060
That is all....

93
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,130
Let's stay alive.

94
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,160
I'll live

95
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,530
only if you live.

96
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,220
The 25th move of The Twin Dragons of the East. Moo Hyul.

97
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,210
The 25th move that I developed while watching Bang Ji copying Cheok Sa Gwang

98
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,620
You've practiced it a lot all this time.

99
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,790
Although it's not that good to try it out in a real match

100
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,780
I believe it's definitely going to work.

101
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,680
Don't be afraid.

102
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,590
I'm not afraid.

103
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,700
Since I can fight

104
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,670
I feel rather at peace.

105
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,300
Right. That's right.

106
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,340
Peace within tension.

107
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,010
The best condition.

108
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,450
You... You can beat anyone.

109
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,400
You can do it. I believe in you.

110
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,560
But, Teacher.

111
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,120
Yes, what?

112
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,930
If something goes wrong, my grandmother—

113
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,340
No!

114
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,360
I... I can't take responsibility.

115
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,410
Stay alive and take responsibility yourself.

116
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,930
Twin Dragons of the East!

117
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:10,100
Twin Dragons of the East!

118
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,630
Twin Dragons of the East!

119
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:18,670
Twin Dragons of the East!

120
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,910
Twin Dragons of the East!

121
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,580
Moo Hyul.

122
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,330
Don't be afraid. You can't be afraid.

123
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,330
Don't be afraid.

124
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,540
Take a deep breath.

125
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,000
Think about a still lake.

126
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,910
You are water. It's so calm and still.

127
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,390
It's so calm and still.

128
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,920
Teacher.

129
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,720
It seems like you are more nervous than I am.

130
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,150
Oh, right.

131
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,840
Start!

132
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,450
Moo Hyul! Dodge!

133
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,340
Step one of the 25th move!

134
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,450
Moo Hyul! Dodge!

135
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,820
Don't rush! Dodge!

136
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,500
Avoid and attack. Avoid and hit once!

137
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,530
Stop!

138
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,490
Stop!

139
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,080
Moo Hyul, stop!

140
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,200
It is your victory.

141
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,910
Tell me your wish.

142
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,950
Because of what I did today,

143
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,880
I heard that

144
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,870
your guards may die.

145
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,200
Please spare

146
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,200
their lives.

147
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,500
Why?

148
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,770
There's a connection

149
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,850
among people who protect others.

150
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,820
They will want to protect again

151
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,340
and

152
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,980
they will protect even better.

153
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,920
This man is telling me to forgive you all.

154
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,560
I will!

155
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,350
The benevolence of the king is great!

156
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,890
As even the 5th prince has such a talented guard,

157
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,650
Joseon is indeed a dangerous country.

158
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,830
And so, I can't let you pass.

159
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,330
Go back.

160
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,870
Your Majesty.

161
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,810
I have never let one of your envoys pass.

162
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,690
But we have received orders to come from the Emperor.

163
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,660
That is your circumstance.

164
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,240
Namgyeong: Ming's capital in the beginning

165
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,150
Did you see it?

166
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,890
The maps in the barracks.

167
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,370
Maps?

168
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,350
Ju Che (Zhu Di) is saying that there is a war brewing between Yeojin (Jurchen) and Joseon,

169
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,790
and he even came all the way here to train soldiers.

170
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,710
But...

171
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,260
All of his maps are maps of the Central Plain.

172
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,800
Do you know what they are?

173
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,330
You do, right?

174
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,640
In what state are Mainland's internal affairs right now?

175
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,960
We have to pass. Let's make a bet.

176
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,100
Why do you keep

177
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,880
on creating a tense relationship with Joseon?

178
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,700
What?

179
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,820
Your Highness

180
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,330
fabricated a case that never existed

181
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,850
and kept nitpicking at it.

182
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,530
You sent a fake report to the emperor.

183
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,840
You bastard!

184
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,560
How dare you speak such imprecations!

185
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,130
Why do you think

186
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,160
that I lied about something like that?

187
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,990
Because you want to steal

188
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,900
the throne from your nephew.

189
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,140
Continue.

190
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,480
The next in throne will be

191
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,150
the emperor's eldest grandson, your young nephew.

192
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,440
His Majesty the Emperor will obviously

193
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,270
be anxious of Your Highness' power.

194
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,540
So...

195
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,300
Didn't you do it

196
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,850
because you were scared of the emperor's suspicions?

197
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,400
Just what are you saying?

198
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:00,820
Because of the unstable political tension between Joseon and Yeojin (Jurchen), you have no interest in the imperial throne.

199
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,610
Even just protecting this place is too much.

200
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,550
Aren't you trying to present yourself this way to the emperor?

201
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,650
So?

202
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,820
Your Highness

203
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,940
reported to the emperor that Joseon is dangerous.

204
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,840
His Majesty the Emperor

205
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,070
will be coming up with an uncompromising policy for Joseon.

206
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,220
The result of that

207
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,310
can really be war.

208
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,350
Is that what you want?

209
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,900
A cornered mouse

210
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,720
can do nothing but bite the cat.

211
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,970
But that is not

212
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,450
what you wanted, right?

213
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,860
Who says that I don't want that?

214
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,040
Then,

215
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,930
in this headquarters that was made for defense against Joseon and Yeojin (Jurchen),

216
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,440
why is it that there are only maps of the central plain?

217
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,460
Isn't it that your great ambition

218
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,300
is pointed towards Namgyeong (Nanjing) in the central plain?

219
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,110
Namgyeong (Nanjing): Ming's capital in the beginning

220
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,030
What is it that you want to say?

221
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,340
On the day that you head towards the central plain,

222
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,690
you probably don't want a hostile relationship with Joseon

223
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,850
to be an obstacle.

224
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,170
The enemy, with no path for retreat,

225
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,750
has no choice but to be desperate.

226
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,980
In military tactics,

227
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,340
it is said to fight the enemy only after giving them a path to retreat.

228
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,200
So in order to make sure Joseon doesn't think of starting a war,

229
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,290
create a way out.

230
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,980
Is that it?

231
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,740
Yes. That's right.

232
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,420
So that the hardliners in Joseon who are in favor of a war do not gain power,

233
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,040
I'm telling you that you should take hold of a good hand.

234
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,980
A good hand?

235
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,520
It's

236
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,430
me. I, Lee Bang Won.

237
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,820
To make sure that Joseon doesn't fight back in desperation,

238
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,070
through me

239
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,020
please open a way out.

240
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,510
Please let us

241
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,950
pass through Liaodong.

242
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,490
You are really

243
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,260
wise

244
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,820
and bold.

245
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,090
But

246
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,860
you're also arrogant and foolish!

247
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,640
Don't you know that you could die because of what you said?

248
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,400
You can also be found dead

249
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,280
all of a sudden tomorrow.

250
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,970
I

251
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,860
bet I won't be.

252
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,920
Today, you

253
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,530
either die

254
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,690
or live.

255
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,390
What happened?

256
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,350
It seems that we'll either die...

257
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,530
Pardon?

258
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,660
or pass through Liaodong.

259
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,400
That is true.

260
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,120
What a smart person I'm serving...

261
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,530
Tell His Highness that I want to see him.

262
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,840
Untie him.

263
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,420
You must be surprised.

264
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,160
There's still something shocking left though.

265
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,660
Come in.

266
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,530
I heard that you know each other.

267
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,880
Your Highness, it's amazing that we meet here.

268
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,030
How could you...

269
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:22,130
As I was pondering whether I should kill you or make you a way out,

270
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,560
I found out a lot about you.

271
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,130
She's the leader of a group that's also famous in the Mainland.

272
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,490
I saw her when she brought Goryeo women

273
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,500
to the imperial family.

274
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,910
Have a seat.

275
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,400
You're more amazing than I thought.

276
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,850
I didn't do anything.

277
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,720
I just

278
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,980
shared with His Majesty the things I knew about you.

279
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,250
Your situation in Joseon

280
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,320
is also the same as mine.

281
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,520
You got it stolen by the youngest child, right?

282
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,330
So,

283
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,610
have you made your decision?

284
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,510
Fine.

285
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,850
For my way out,

286
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,600
I'll use you.

287
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,100
Also, I personally will

288
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,160
write a letter to His Highness the Emperor.

289
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,860
Your Highness, I am extremely grateful.

290
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,120
But I have a condition.

291
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,750
What is it?

292
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,500
Your bodyguard, Moo Hyul.

293
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,500
Give him to me.

294
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,300
His Highness

295
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,970
wants you.

296
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,390
So I decided to give you away.

297
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,980
Pardon?

298
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,330
How could Your Highness...

299
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,850
On our way back from Namgyeong (Nanjing), we have to pass through here again.

300
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,650
At that time, I will risk my life and take you back.

301
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,090
But

302
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,520
you must not stay here wasting your time.

303
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,730
Fight and fight some more and learn here.

304
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,080
Your Highness.

305
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,170
Ju Che's bodyguards

306
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,550
are quite skilled, you say?

307
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,730
Ah, yes. Especially that one short guy is really amazing.

308
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,910
An expert knows other experts.

309
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,210
Earlier, he came to me and asked about Twin Dragons of the East and stuff.

310
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,880
That one short guy...

311
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:53,600
Master Hong, stay here as well and watch over Moo Hyul.

312
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,340
Can I do that?

313
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,750
I don't know what it's like in Goryeo's time

314
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,280
but the best swordsman in the new country, Joseon,

315
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,410
has to be this guy, Moo Hyul.

316
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,880
Can you do it?

317
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,250
The warriors here,

318
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,810
I will completely defeat them all.

319
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,410
Lee Seong Gye eventually

320
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,340
ordered your execution.

321
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,470
Tomorrow,

322
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,030
an officer will come here.

323
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,190
I

324
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,700
put a dot in the character for Wang

325
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,730
and changed my last name to Oak.

326
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,550
You will also go, right?

327
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,360
If I say that I want to live,

328
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,050
she will have to keep fighting

329
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,190
and will die in the end.

330
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,800
Your Highness, come eat.

331
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,220
It was cooked deliciously.

332
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,200
If you're going to the market, I have a favor to ask.

333
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,050
Please bring me that.

334
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,370
Sure.

335
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,410
Then, please eat while I'm away.

336
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,790
I will make you a really good dinner.

337
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,400
Yoon Rang.

338
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,110
Thank you.

339
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,510
You were keeping something for His Highness, right?

340
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,860
Yes.

341
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,280
It's this.

342
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,780
Isn't this a letter?

343
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,160
Yes.

344
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,860
Please read it.

345
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,690
Meeting the beautiful you...

346
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:24,090
Before I became king, I spent time as if in a dream.

347
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,900
My farewell to you really

348
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,770
hurts, but

349
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,860
Rang,

350
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,320
even if it's just you, you have to live.

351
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,480
Prince Jeong Chan, Wang Yo acted against the law

352
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,280
and many people have left you due to your incapability to manage the country,

353
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,530
so you were dethroned by the heavens. Also,

354
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:13,980
since the heavens have changed, for the stability of the country and safety of the royal family,

355
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,560
Receive your punishment.

356
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,840
Rang, like that time when you said you'll fight by my side,

357
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,720
I would have told you to run away.

358
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,640
But

359
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,040
in any case, I am

360
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,440
the last king of Goryeo which was passed down through the Wang family for 500 years.

361
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,560
In the end of the last king,

362
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,320
he shouldn't run, right?

363
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:58,140
If you go to the paper goods shop in Daerim Marketplace at Gaegyeong, Mr. Oak will be there.

364
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,890
I already told them so you can stay there.

365
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:08,840
You must not have bad thoughts

366
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,490
like ending your own life.

367
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,470
Go find your life now.

368
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,040
You have to do that for me to also

369
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,110
comfortably rest in the afterlife.

370
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,860
Hanyang (after transfer of capital)

371
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,810
It's a petition for impeachment.

372
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,610
Leave out Lord Hong Ak Joon.

373
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,820
Pardon?

374
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,490
He is a close member to Lord Sam Bong.

375
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,840
There will be promotions soon, in the Office of Inspector General.

376
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,560
If you do that, I will put in a good word to him for you.

377
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,650
Yes. I will do so.

378
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,310
Go out the back door.

379
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,630
Pardon? The back door?

380
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,660
What is the inspector general?

381
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,510
While inspecting the officials' corruption and illegal activities,

382
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,940
even if there was a royal command, if you think of it as the right thing to do

383
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,890
you must be prepared to exchange your life for that righteousness.

384
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:47,460
But you can't even withstand my authority, so you just succumb to it?

385
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,640
Also, all of you

386
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,040
are the first ever government officials of the new country Joseon.

387
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,990
The principles and discipline you guys set will have an effect for hundreds of years to come.

388
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,410
If we are not able to set those things right,

389
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,040
this country's officials will also be like Goryeo's officials,

390
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,420
who were vampires that sucked the blood out of the people.

391
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,700
Are you going to be like that?

392
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,520
Will it really be that kind of country again?

393
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,820
You became like this while trying to stop His Majesty from seeing the king's historical record?

394
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,460
I'm sorry, Lord.

395
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,570
I will make you

396
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,810
a rank 3 official.

397
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,140
Pardon?

398
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,090
If you're not this much prepared, all of you can resign.

399
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,520
Even if you have to wear a diaper to withstand it,

400
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,640
the Office of Historical Records

401
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,160
has to record every little detail of the king's words and actions.

402
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,490
Yes, yes.

403
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,750
It's said that the king is only afraid of the writer of the historical records.

404
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,020
the historical records, that you guys write with your lives,

405
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,810
will become the discipline of the future generations. Do not ever forget that.

406
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,610
Yes, my Lord.

407
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,850
Leader.

408
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,030
We're back.

409
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:26,510
Today is the first day of students in Seonggyeonggwan. Do you all know that?

410
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,600
Of course.

411
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,320
We helped with washing up and organization and also checked attendance.

412
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,200
We have also checked on where they would stay after classes.

413
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,690
You've worked hard.

414
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,030
Then, eat your meal and I will see you later.

415
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,280
Yes, Leader.

416
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,400
Banchon (Village assisting Seonggyungwan scholars)

417
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,130
Hello.

418
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,370
The preparations are going well, right?

419
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,490
You're not experiencing any difficulties, right?

420
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,830
The civil service examination is coming up. You are going to have to prepare ahead of time

421
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,670
Yes, leader.

422
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,280
To be honest, as we are commoners,

423
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,320
- to be working with people who used to be slaves in Gaegyeong—
- Gab Boon

424
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:52,800
We are all just Banchon people. Keep that in mind.

425
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,830
I understand, Boon Yi. I mean, Leader.

426
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,960
Ajussi.

427
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,720
Hello.

428
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,980
Is the work alright?

429
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,620
It has been worth the wait to come. I like it.

430
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:25,200
Oh my. Your handiwork is amazing. Look at that, Leader.

431
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,450
You merchandised with brushes before this, right?

432
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:32,770
Maeng Soon, you shouldn't ask such questions here.

433
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:36,600
This tongue. I forgot

434
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,700
But, I don't see your younger sibling again.

435
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,370
Yes. My younger sibling is inside doing needlework.

436
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,290
I see.

437
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,210
You're here.

438
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,890
You always seem to eat your lunch here.

439
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,640
No matter where I go, there's no place better than our grandmother's.

440
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,630
But you seem to be doing well too.

441
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,660
Is that so?

442
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,660
There is nothing much going on, right?

443
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,980
Of course not. Why would I have anything going on?

444
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:27,360
But, Leader. Have you received any news about the prince who went to Ming?

445
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:34,210
No, I haven't heard anything either.

446
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,120
Lord Sam Bong is coming. Ask him for me.

447
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,440
Are you on the way to Seonggyungwan?

448
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,580
Yes. I see you're doing inspection.

449
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,420
I heard that all you do is work all day and all night.

450
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,310
It's a blessing.

451
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,810
I...

452
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:08,020
Has there been news about the prince who went to Ming?

453
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,150
Not yet.

454
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,680
Do not worry too much. He is a talented person.

455
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,700
Yes, yes.

456
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,980
You're alive, right? Right, Bang Won?

457
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:45,020
Seonggyungwan

458
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,990
It's tonight. Are you all prepared?

459
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,960
Yes. We will all gather at Jeongryunam tonight.

460
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,340
We're taking the first step today so I'm really filled with emotions.

461
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:05,530
At last, we are finally having our first gathering. My heart is very eager, but everything is going so slowly.

462
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,130
They say that starting means you're halfway there, my Lord.

463
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,770
This is our doctrine. Can you copy these?

464
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,320
Yes. I understand.

465
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,440
You told me everything that happened and things that you heard today, right?

466
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,220
Yes. I've told you everything, Leader.

467
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,260
Yes. Then, you can forget everything now.

468
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,720
Forget everything you told me about.

469
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,130
So are you well now after having used the bathroom?

470
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,210
Give it back.

471
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,150
What are you saying?

472
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:38,020
The thing that you stole from Seonggyungwan.

473
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:42,760
What are you talking about? I'm doing a night shift, so I was checking on the lights in Seonggyungwan.

474
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,560
I guess words won't work on you.

475
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,360
Brother!

476
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,810
I see you're in the middle of a conversation.

477
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:14,010
Everyone, you can go out and tend to your jobs.

478
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,020
Yes.

479
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,220
Baek Jin was caught?

480
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:33,560
It seems that he went into Seonggyungwan and stole a document. He's currently being held in Banchon.

481
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,520
The investigation bureau has gone too, it seems.

482
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,220
What was the document he stole?

483
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,710
He infiltrated Banchon because Sam Bong has been frequently going to Seonggyungwan.

484
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,700
It's probably something related to Sam Bong.

485
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:10,600
This place, Banchon, has the shrine of Moon Seong Gong and the Daeseong Shrine.

486
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:16,150
You know that the royal forces are not allowed in unless it's a royal command.

487
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,480
Isn't the criminal inside Banchon?

488
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,620
We have already caught a suspicious person.

489
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,860
Is that so? Then hurry and hand him over to us.

490
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,850
When we caught him, we realized that he's from Banchon.

491
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:35,500
As long as it's not the royal command, as the leader, I have the right to deal with it.

492
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,190
You can only arrest him, after I expel him.

493
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,930
So?

494
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:48,790
He's being interrogated so please wait for a bit.

495
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,580
You wench! Do you think we will just wait here?

496
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:08,560
If you come in here, to His Majesty and Lord Sam Bong who declared this country will only be ruled with laws and ordinances,

497
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,810
you will become troublesome.

498
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:31,710
Ajusshi, did you assault the senior scholar, Lord Park Chan Hyun,

499
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,370
and steal a document?

500
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:38,380
Leader. Why would I do that? I never did that.

501
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,480
Then why did you run?

502
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,390
This man followed me so how can I not run?

503
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:48,530
No, Boon Yi. That's a lie. I'm sure it's him.

504
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,050
Can I look through your clothes?

505
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,580
Of course. Go ahead.

506
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,770
Brother. If he was hiding something, he wouldn't let me check.

507
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:12,480
Instead of his clothes, I want to look at his body for a tattoo that we know of.

508
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,820
What kind of suspicions do you have?

509
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:30,420
From here on, I am asking you as your leader who has power over your life and death.

510
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:37,690
If you lie about what I'm asking you,

511
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:41,830
you will be kicked out of Banchon and all of us will forget you.

512
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,950
You will become a dead person to us.

513
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:52,670
Are you a part of Nameless?

514
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,450
Hold him.

515
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,150
Leader! Leader!

516
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,610
Leader!

517
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,160
All of you, take cover!

518
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,260
Really... Do you think you can fight me with that?

519
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,700
Why did you appear again? No, you Nameless.

520
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,560
What are you planning by entering Banchon?

521
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:02,860
It's not just Banchon. We are everywhere.

522
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,020
Are you okay?

523
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,610
He threw beef jerky?

524
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:41,290
Beef jerky? Huh?

525
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,710
That person is clearly Gil Seon Mi.

526
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,260
Nameless has appeared again.

527
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,780
In Banchon, at that.

528
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,460
Excuse me, Leader!

529
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,560
See me for a bit.

530
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,320
This was found by coincidence.

531
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,140
Is that so?

532
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,590
So it was this.

533
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:29,630
A man was hiding it at a pharmacy and he was suspicious.

534
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:34,130
Thank you. There was quite an uproar today because of this.

535
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:39,370
Do you think the royal forces will come here because of this?

536
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:45,810
No. It won't happen unless it's a royal command.

537
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:51,510
But why don't you go outside?

538
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:54,210
Do you feel uncomfortable with people?

539
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,360
No. I'll go out more often.

540
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,070
Yes. Please do so.

541
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,130
I'll take my leave.

542
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:11,070
Take care, Leader.

543
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:22,200
Lady, the royal forces can't go in here

544
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,100
so we came here as a last resort. But if you don't like it—

545
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:31,310
No. This is the best place.

546
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:37,310
The late king left these children in my care.

547
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,420
You don't have to feel responsible.

548
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,980
They're that person's children.

549
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,660
I'm doing it because I like it.

550
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,810
Jeongryunam?

551
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:18,050
Bon Won is here.
Jeongryunam

552
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,220
You did well on coming.

553
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,000
It is a pleasure to meet you and I am overwhelmed.

554
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,040
About 2300 years ago, after the Zhou dynasty,

555
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,920
a true Confucian country that practices land reform and equal land division,

556
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,520
it's already been a few years since that country, Joseon, has been founded.

557
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:09,400
This is hard. Your shoulders.

558
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,800
Though you have a large build,

559
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:14,830
As light as a butterfly.

560
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:20,350
- Master Hong!
- Why? Master Hong is here.

561
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:25,140
Your country's prince.

562
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,320
What about the prince?

563
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,190
The prince

564
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,300
came back alive.

565
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:40,220
What? He's here?

566
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,720
Moo Hyul!

567
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,950
You heard that, right?

568
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,310
He came back alive?

569
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,330
Moo Hyul!

570
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:21,920
But this big tree called Joseon's roots

571
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,980
is still weak and pitiful.

572
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,240
The scholars, officials, and Sadaebu.

573
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,380
We who are here

574
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:37,980
must become this country's healthy and strong roots.

575
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:47,700
We must become this tree called Joseon's roots among roots for a thousand years.

576
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,640
Hidden but alive.

577
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:57,860
Can't be seen, but breathes life itto the tree, the leaves, and the flowers.

578
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:04,560
The hidden root that extends deep and hard in the earth called history.

579
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:12,360
We are this land's Milbon (hidden root)!

580
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,230
Milbon?

581
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:24,700
Milbon guides the king.

582
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,480
Milbon corrects the king.

583
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:34,920
Milbon takes care of the people who are in the lowest place in this land.

584
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,660
Milbon thinks preciously of the people. Milbon respects the people.

585
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,620
Milbon keeps the people safe. Milbon raises the people.

586
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:53,620
Milbon only has to be and can't ever be different than the following two things.

587
00:58:55,730 --> 00:59:01,220
It's Minbon (the people are the basis and the roots).

588
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,520
It's Minbon!

589
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:14,740
Minbon.

590
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:20,190
The people... The people...

591
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,590
are the roots.

592
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,280
Jeong Do Jeon
Milbon's first Bon Won (original root)

593
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,150
Six Flying Dragons

594
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,260
You came back alive. You are really lucky.

595
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,170
It's the royal command to arrest the envoy group.

596
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,670
Transfer them? Just why?

597
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,350
Lord Sam Bong is surely planning something again.

598
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,290
I haven't yet made my vicious move.

599
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:01,630
Take my vicious move.
