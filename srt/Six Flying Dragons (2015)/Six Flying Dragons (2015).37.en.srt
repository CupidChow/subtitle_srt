Episode 37

3
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:55,090
From the beginning... From the start of this great cause,

4
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,570
I didn't have any place in it, did I?

5
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,070
That's right. From the start, there was no place for you in this great cause,

6
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,150
but you eventually made one for yourself.

7
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:30,290
Killing Po Eun. That will become your place.

8
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,530
What about Lord Po Eun? What happened to him?

9
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,210
Lord Po Eun died.

10
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,450
Then, what about His Highness?

11
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,390
He's probably not in a good situation.

12
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,110
Is he alive?

13
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,910
He is probably alive.

14
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,430
He will soon step down from the throne.

15
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,610
That went well.

16
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,150
Why didn't you kill me?

17
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,830
You didn't kill me either.

18
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,870
Last time at Byeokrando and at the market,

19
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,030
you were more than capable of killing me.

20
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,730
Why do you live wielding a sword?

21
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,610
I want to protect the people I love.

22
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,690
I want to protect my dream.

23
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,630
I am the same. The person I love,

24
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,290
dream...

25
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:56,430
Are you going to avenge Lord Po Eun?

26
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,030
I won't avenge.

27
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:10,850
My dream is to go back to the time before His Highness went up to the throne.

28
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:19,030
If it's not for Lord Po Eun, he probably wouldn't have taken the throne, right?

29
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,530
Just living a quiet life with His Highness,

30
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,950
it's only that.

31
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:40,890
If nobody hurts him, I won't fight anyone.

32
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,030
Lady!

33
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,970
Now, Po Eun's head will be hung in the market,

34
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,530
and it must be officially announced that he's a traitor.

35
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,630
Sam Bong.

36
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,890
I tried to change the country through the support of the people,

37
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,330
but the people's hearts, that we barely got a hold of through the land reform,

38
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,630
are now impossible to get back again due to Po Eun's death.

39
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,450
But to hang Po Eun's head—

40
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,970
What use is there to try turning back something that is irreversible?

41
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,850
We have to quickly and strongly proceed with this.

42
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,530
Dethroning the current king and as well as founding a new country.

43
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,750
Do you all understand?

44
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,750
Po Eun left like that and I don't even know if Yoon Rang is still alive.

45
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,970
This is the end.

46
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,490
Your Highness! Jo Joon, Nam Eun, and Jeong Do Jeon are entering.

47
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,790
Let them in.

48
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:08,930
Your Highness, Po Eun Jeong Mong Joo used sly tricks to falsely charge people with crimes, and

49
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:16,150
he planned a conspiracy and received Your Highness' royal command to execute innocent people.

50
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,450
The reason why General Lee Seong Gye's fifth son, Lee Bang Won, attacked Jeong Mong Joo

51
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,090
was to stop a conspiracy.

52
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,310
So please hang Jeong Mong Joo's head in the commons

53
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,710
and give us the decree that denounces him as a traitor.

54
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,810
Please give us the command.

55
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,950
Your grace is immeasurable.

56
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,550
When are you going to take the royal seal?

57
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,570
There's an order for everything so please wait.

58
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,150
I didn't want to become the king.

59
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,530
Arrest all those people who are putting up false posters.

60
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,350
Yes!

61
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,150
Move aside!

62
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,090
His Highness has ordered for Traitor Jeong Mong Joo to be hanged.

63
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,550
Those who will go against it

64
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,610
will also be treated as traitors and will be killed.

65
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,610
Do you understand?

66
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,550
I can become even stronger.

67
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,630
Bang Ji's movements have changed.

68
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,310
He's following the Goksan swordsmanship.

69
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,190
Ah. Goksan swordsmanship.

70
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,470
That's right. It's that.

71
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,150
What are you doing here? Elder Sam Bong told everyone to gather.

72
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,350
I think it's because of what Young Master Bang Won did.

73
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,350
The market is going crazy wanting to execute Young Master Bang Won.

74
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,250
Then, are they telling him to just sit down and die? They're too much.

75
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,350
They're waiting so hurry and go.

76
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,830
Master Hong, what are you doing? Hurry. Moo Hyul, go.

77
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,570
Let's not drag time now. We have to make haste.

78
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,530
Yeon Hee, you have to spread rumors among the Sadaebu through Hwa Sa Dan.

79
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,890
Please speak.

80
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,290
After the General heard about Po Eun's death from Bang Won,

81
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,250
he threw an inkstone at Bang Won and cracked his head.

82
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,110
You said that wound came from your older brother, right?

83
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,050
Spread a rumor that it was done by the General.

84
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,750
Say that after doing that, the General cried for three days and nights.

85
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,970
The whole family was unable to sleep because of the General's sorrowful wailing. Do you understand?

86
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,350
Yes. I understand.

87
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,190
Boon Yi, you should also spread it through the market organization.

88
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,210
Emphasize that it was solely done by Lee Bang Won.

89
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,980
What do you mean?

90
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,080
We will now establish the new country.

91
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,160
Bang Won has be to excluded from this process.

92
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,130
The General, who will be leading the new country,

93
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:35,170
has to be innocent of kiling Po Eun. It needs to be justified like that.

94
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,180
I don't really know much, but wasn't it done so that we can live?

95
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,120
He did it to survive. Isn't that justification?

96
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,820
If we could do it using strength, then we could've just seized the palace on the day we attacked Jo Min Soo.

97
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,520
Until now, even though it took time,

98
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,830
we put in so much effort in order to persuade, to debate and to embrace.

99
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,640
But...

100
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,190
It has all become nothing now.

101
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:19,790
Even if it pains the heart, the new country was started with the sword.

102
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,330
Bang Won has to take responsibility for this in his own way and

103
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,080
we have to proceed and endure it in our own way.

104
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,700
But Elder—

105
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,090
Bang Won, you understand, right?

106
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,680
Yes. Of course.

107
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,140
That doesn't make sense!

108
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,950
It's right though. I was the one who killed Po Eun.

109
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,590
I mean, did you kill him to gain fame and money?

110
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,370
Did you kill him to succeed?

111
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,210
Teacher Sam Bong didn't say to spread the rumor that, in order to gain fame and money,

112
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:59,310
I killed Teacher Po Eun. It wasn't worded like this.

113
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,770
I independently killed Po Eun.

114
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:19,150
I, Lee Bang Won, killed Goryeo's last remaining loyalist, Jeong Mong Joo.

115
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,770
It is not connected in any way to General Lee Seong Gye.

116
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:29,290
He said to spread it like this. There is nothing wrong with it.

117
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,100
Still, Young Master...

118
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,000
If I have to take responsibility for this, then let it be.

119
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,500
That's what makes me different from Sam Bong and Father. I will not avoid it.

120
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,770
I'm okay. You don't have to worry.

121
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,920
I heard about it.

122
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,280
A scandal and disgrace like that, you can just ignore it.

123
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,080
Just think of the future.

124
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,520
I am thinking of doing so.

125
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:47,380
Boon, look into who put up posters asking for me to be executed.

126
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,240
What?

127
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,440
What will you do? You must not.

128
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,060
Yes, Young Master. You have to be careful.

129
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,140
I was just asking you to look into it.

130
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:07,700
From now on, I have to know who my enemies are.

131
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,380
Young Master, how long has it been?

132
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,530
Young Gyu, I heard that you used your hand this time.
(Lee Bang Gan: Lee Seong Gye's fourth son)

133
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,170
Pardon?

134
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,830
Jeong Mong Joo.

135
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,420
Ah, yes.

136
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,710
You did well. Good job!

137
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,340
When you were hitting his head, it felt good, right?

138
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,040
Ah, yes.

139
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,410
Where is Bang Won?

140
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:48,470
What is this? Does this make sense?

141
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,700
How can Po Eun's end be like this?

142
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:04,640
Yes, Teacher. How, under the heavens, can something like this happen?

143
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,020
If you do that in a place like this, everyone will misunderstand.

144
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,880
You bastard!

145
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:18,150
Do you think you will be safe after doing this to Po Eun?

146
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,330
I don't think I will be safe.

147
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,650
Also, I've never wished for a safe life.

148
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,460
You will face a more merciless fate than Po Eun.

149
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,840
Your end will be more horrendous than Po Eun's.

150
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,870
Yes. It might be that way

151
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,280
but you won't see it, Teacher.

152
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,300
You don't have much time left.

153
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,660
Tell the person who is writing the impeachment list to include Woo Hak Joo.

154
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,060
Woo Hak Joo is already on it.

155
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,560
Yesterday, you told me to add Lee Jung Hak, Ho Hong Soo, Lee Sung In, Kim Jin Yang, and Woo Hak Joo.

156
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,600
Is that so? Then there are 56 people.

157
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,100
They cannot be allowed to stay in Gaegyeong before the coronation--

158
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,140
It must not happen.

159
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,530
Are you okay? What's the matter?

160
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,600
It's nothing. I'm okay.

161
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,660
Do you think you'll be able to eat your meal?

162
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,510
I have to eat. Even through gritted teeth, I have to eat.

163
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,320
He's probably having a hard time even if he acts like he's not.

164
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,100
Go ahead.

165
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,310
Please give us rice porridge here.

166
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,310
Yes. Go inside.

167
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,560
Let's go in.

168
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,150
I'm fine.

169
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,910
Okay.

170
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,370
Elder Sam Bong.

171
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,030
It's been a while.

172
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,010
Yeon Hyang! The little court lady!

173
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:06,500
Just like how you are not just a young scholar anymore, I am no longer a little court lady.

174
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,230
Just what happened?

175
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,730
You have changed a lot.

176
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,850
What's going on?

177
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,730
Are you... Nameless?

178
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,670
That's right.

179
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,540
Do you know that your children are looking for you? Outside... Your child is outside.

180
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,620
I know. Please don't call him.

181
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,840
How?

182
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,560
I came here today to only talk to you.

183
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,500
Calm down. We only came for a talk

184
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,240
with your elder.

185
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,180
Who?

186
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,360
Our side's Elder.

187
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,020
You became faster.

188
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,490
It must be great to be young. You're developing like this.

189
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,280
If you do anything to Elder...

190
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,070
I won't, so relax.

191
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,610
If you fight me here,

192
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,370
it might get even more dangerous. I'm not the only one you will be fighting.

193
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,590
What was that sound from outside?

194
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,450
It seems like my bodyguard said hi.

195
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,960
Nothing will happen.

196
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,470
I guess the new country will be revealed soon.

197
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,330
Are you against it?

198
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,650
No.

199
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,810
Then why are you blocking us?

200
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,910
We weren't, in the beginning.

201
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,950
When we heard about your plan, we were excited and cheered you on.

202
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,530
We even tried to help, before we found out about that truth.

203
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,610
Are you talking about the land reform?

204
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,170
The equal land division, the land distribution.

205
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,950
Whatever the name, in the end the problem is the land reform.

206
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,730
Didn't you already burn the land registers?

207
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,310
Stop the process and forget about equally sharing lands, Elder.

208
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,010
Your organization must have a lot of land.

209
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,710
So you probably suffered some losses from it.

210
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:42,590
Since there are a lot of people, a few of them have a lot of land, but the majority do not.

211
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,290
Then why?

212
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,710
It's because of principle.

213
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:54,470
A person chases after work, and the generation chases after the person. That is our principle.

214
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,470
But the new country denies this great desire.

215
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,910
You say that it's great?

216
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:06,890
The land reform fundamentally seals people off from any desire to have more land.

217
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:12,190
That desire has brought Goryeo to this state. That personal land ownership.

218
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,170
And so you are going to proceed with the land reform?

219
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,090
Equally distributing land for every person,

220
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,190
and not being able to increase this amount a little bit. This is what the land distribution does.

221
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,550
Since no one is able to increase their land by even a little bit,

222
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,890
no one will ever have their land taken by even a little bit.

223
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,590
We are the ones who first created the concept of personal land ownership.

224
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,870
A few hundred years ago, when it seemed only right that land belonged solely to king and country,

225
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,750
we cultivated the wasteland and created the system of personal land ownership.

226
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,990
And?

227
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,690
As a result of the people's desire to have their own land,

228
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,170
they crazily ran to the wasteland and dug.

229
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,050
After that the farmlands grew rapidly,

230
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,470
and the Three Kingdoms became more prosperous than ever before.

231
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,870
Desire paved a way and achieved prosperity.

232
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:10,050
And what happened to that prosperity? Who are the ones that became prosperous?

233
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,230
In the end, more than 70% of the country's land was taken by the Gwon Moon Sae Jok.

234
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,350
The people didn't even have the land to place a single nail, so they were kicked out from their homes

235
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,550
and slowly died away from starvation or slavery.

236
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,750
So is it really great? The desire for all this?

237
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,030
A person perseveres through many hardships in order to expand their work.

238
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:38,010
As a result, in the past the world advanced and could have gone forward.

239
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,970
The world from now on will be different.

240
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,630
In the place of the desire to chase after work,

241
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,390
Neo-Confucianist ideals will take precedent.

242
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,910
A country where every person becomes a wise man.

243
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,790
Therefore, a country will be made where no one groans for having theirs taken,

244
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,630
and no one takes another's in order to fill his own belly.

245
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,250
It seems you aren't going to give up.

246
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,450
Of course. From the trade and commerce on the outside to the marketplace on the inside,

247
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,550
this desire will be controlled and managed by the nation so that

248
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:16,870
the poison from desire will never cause us to hurt each other.

249
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,950
I have heard you well.

250
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:32,070
Then although we don't have much power,

251
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,410
we will use what little we have to stop you.

252
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,230
It looks like they are done. I hope the talk went well.

253
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,310
See you again.

254
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,610
What happened? Are you alright?

255
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,930
Gil Seon Mi was outside.

256
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:17,330
We will use what little we have to stop you.

257
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,710
Yes. Nameless was here.

258
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,490
I will try to be more careful in guarding you from now on.

259
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,250
Bang Ji.

260
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,330
Your mother is Nameless's—

261
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,270
Boon Yi told me she met our mother.

262
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:42,930
She said that Mom told us that she abandoned us and to forget her stop looking for her.

263
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,370
So I'm going to forget her too.

264
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:51,950
♫ Cry, cry, bird ♫

265
00:25:54,010 --> 00:26:00,530
♫ Sleep and wake up, bird ♫

266
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:10,490
♫ I, who am more sorrowful than you,  ♫

267
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,970
What happened?

268
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,930
It's war now.

269
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,330
Keep a good watch on Lee Bang Won.

270
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,970
I understand.

271
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:28,550
Look for the missing Cheok Sa Gwang as well.

272
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,750
What's the use of looking at it. I can't even read anyway.

273
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,750
How did it go?

274
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,550
We got it.

275
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,190
Okay. Now let's change the heavens.

276
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,230
Of course. Starting with the heavens,

277
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,330
the earth and humans will all begin anew.

278
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,490
Yes. Today has finally come. You worked hard.

279
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,130
Our work has only just begun. Let's begin.

280
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,770
Yes.

281
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,450
Prince Jeong Chang, Yo. By acting against the law and putting the state in confusion,

282
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:39,930
he has betrayed many people and deserted his relatives. Due to his inability to maintain the country,

283
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,570
he is henceforth dethroned by the heavens.

284
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:51,510
It is the wish of all the countless numbers of people.

285
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,830
Please become the father of all the people.

286
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,850
The country must go to a person of virtue

287
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,110
The throne cannot be vacant for too long.

288
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:13,530
Please rise to the throne and calm the people of this land.

289
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:20,330
♫ Is there any difference between politics and swords? ♫

290
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,750

Long live the King and Queen! Long live the King and Queen!

300
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,800
Long live the King and Queen!

301
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,590

306
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,390
The king was chased out.

307
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,630
The king, you say?

308
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,490
By the way, that Cheok Sa Gwang, or whatever, has been pretty quiet.

309
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,390
Everyone was so nervous thinking she would seek revenge.

310
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,570
Then again, what would she able to do by herself.

311
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,400
That seems so.

312
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,560
I won't seek revenge.

313
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:41,040
If nobody hurts him, I won't fight anyone.

314
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:47,600
I just want His Highness to live a quiet life.

315
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,260
What does Cheok Sa Gwang look like?

316
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,180
Does she look like some terrifying witch?

317
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,300
No. That's not the case.

318
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:28,070
As the Chief Officer of the Royal Guard, and the Chief Commander of the National Army, Nam Eun.

319
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:34,030
As the Chief Minister of State Affairs, and the Chief Commander of the Five Regional Armies, Jo Joon.

320
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:38,470
As the Second Minister of State Affairs, Lee Ji Ran. As the Junior Second Minister of State Affairs, Min Jae.

321
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:44,710
And as the Chief Minister of the Personnel Affairs, the Chief Minister of Finance,

322
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:52,470
the Chief Minister of Regional Administration, and the Second Minister of State Affairs, Jeong Do Jeon.

323
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:11,980
I am afraid of not being able to take responsibility with my lack of virtue.

324
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,080
But due to the people's wishes,

325
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,440
I have taken the crown by heaven's command.

326
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:29,640
From now on, I will find a way to make all the people's lives better no matter the circumstances.

327
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,380
Your grace is immeasurable.

328
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:48,610
I heard that there are a lot of empty positions because many officials have resigned.

329
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

330
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,390
It will already be very burdensome for you to take on all those positions, but

331
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,650
please fill them up, Sam Bong.

332
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:02,630
Yes. I will create the country's name, and organize the government.

333
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,270
When are you going to start the civil exams?

334
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,300
Out of your system to establish a new nation,

335
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,190
I really liked the idea of choosing all government officials through the civil exam.

336
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,790
Is that so?

337
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,330
Without the skills,

338
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,740
all the Gwon Moon Sae Jok and military officials that took positions through nepotism,

339
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,390
aren't we supposed to start all over again?

340
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,520
Your command is right in every way.

341
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,020
If it gets known that without caring about family backgrounds,

342
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,660
all people will be given the opportunity to obtain government positions fairly,

343
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,220
we can recover the public opinion. It will be a big help.

344
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,840
I will make haste to proceed.

346
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,350
The harvest being collected from the farm lands cannot go above 30 doos per 1 gyeol (units of measurement).

347
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,090
Try to calculate the tax revenue with that in mind.

348
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

349
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,220
The key point of the government reform lies in how we can control the officials' desires and raise interest of the public.

350
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,960
Do not ever forget that while you think of a system that has a clear distinction of different roles and authority.

351
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,110
Yes.

352
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,590
How is the civil exam coming along?

353
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,730
I've sent the message to the local government offices in every area.

354
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,160
Also, I've sent the message to Seonggyungwan, Daehaksa,

355
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,240
and all schools in every region.

356
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,340
That's right. Let more people know.

357
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,860
We have to make sure that as many people as possible can take the exam.

358
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,790
Also make sure to let people know about the new military exams.

359
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,890
Yes, please do not worry about it.

360
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,090
Are these it?

361
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,700
Yes. For now, I brought these.

362
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,640
Are these the historical records of Silla?

363
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,880
I got them from the Royal Library.

364
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,120
I will provide you with some people, so investigate these very confidentially.

365
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,220
Will we really find traces of Nameless from these?

366
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,720
Yeom Jong, who started the rebellion with Bi Dam,

367
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,760
was a very successful merchant at that time

368
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,600
who traded with not only Baekjae and Goguryeo, but also the Sui and the Tang.

369
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,300
And during his later years, he was deeply involved in politics as well.

370
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,680
There are probably traces left in history.

371
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,090
Also keep an eye on Yeon Hyang as well.

372
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,700
Yes, I understand.

373
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,140
- Oh, is this it?
- Ah, yes.

374
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,630
As you've instructed, by reviewing education, character,

375
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,520
acquaintances, reputation and so on, I am narrowing down the candidates.

376
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,820
They will be the supporting pillars of our new organization.

377
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,590
The important thing is the strong will to resist succumbing to any power,

378
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,310
and the integrity to resist corruption.

379
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,420
Yes.

380
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,400
I am closely reviewing by considering those points.

381
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,460
Also from now on, make sure to assist the Queen well.

382
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,200
The Queen?

383
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,400
I already told His Majesty.

384
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,980
And prepare Hwa Sa Dan to be ready to accompany her,

385
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,460
as well as being someone that she can talk to.

386
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,400
Someone that she can talk to...?

387
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,790
I understand. Please do not worry.

388
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,540
But Bon Won...

389
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,970
What are thinking of doing with your connection to Bang Won?

390
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,600
His soldiers have increased, and the marketplace messengers have expanded as well.

391
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,020
He is receiving funds from the Min family as well.

392
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,220
Furthermore, His Highness would not see Bang Won.

393
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:26,140
His Highness is someone much more upright than me.

394
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,040
That is why I am even more worried.

395
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,520
Do you think you could embrace it?

396
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:50,410
You are probably trying to say that you are still right even if you have to die.

397
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,510
It's your temperament of wanting to do things the way you want!

398
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:02,430
Killing Po Eun. That will be your place.

399
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:11,490
That's not bad.

400
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,190
Husband, Lord Ha Ryun is here.

401
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,100
Don't look at me like that.

402
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:31,060
I had a hard time thinking of how I should serve only one king since I am a Confucian scholar.

403
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,590
That's not it.

404
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:39,160
I'm surprised that Lord Sam Bong allowed you to take a government office.

405
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,090
Well that's because you stabbed Po Eun to death,

406
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:51,130
the officials all resigned and the positions were all empty.

407
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,110
Isn't it right?

408
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:05,410
And because of that incident, His Majesty hasn't yet forgiven you.

409
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,990
On the other hand, I heard that Lord Sam Bong's government offices grew to four positions

410
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:19,850
He got one more today so there are probably five.

411
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,170
Today as well?

412
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,030
Since he took over the Dodang, the legislative branch, and personnel affairs,

413
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,420
now if he takes over the military,

414
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,130
that will surely be Sam Bong's world.

415
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:38,270
He's put himself in the position that he was going to put Po Eun in.

416
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,280
It can't be.

417
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,490
Once the Sadaebu who resigned comes back, His Majesty will distribute the political power.

418
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,610
Well, everyone is thinking the same thing, but...

419
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,970
That will not happen.

420
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,550
What do you mean it won't happen?

421
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:02,810
I can read Teacher Sam Bong's thoughts.

422
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,370
What?

423
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:15,070
Of the scholars you told me to investigate, seven out of ten are missing.

424
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,790
What do you mean they are missing?

425
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,290
Even their families don't know where they are.

426
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,270
Isn't it just that they went back to their homelands?

427
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,330
They weren't in their homelands either.

428
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,450
Then where could those scholars have gone?

429
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,990
Those scholars?

430
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:32,050
They were the scholars who put up posters about executing His Highness Bang Won, right?

431
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:39,750
Yes. So I followed after them, and they were looking at these.

432
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:47,170
This is a map...

433
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,490
Tongsung Village...?

434
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,810
Is there one of our people out in Tongsung Village?

435
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:00,130
There's barely anyone living there, so there's nothing to report.

436
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:04,970
Doesn't it seem like there's going to be some kind of gathering?

437
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:09,630
Boss! The assembly of the inspector general officials just ended.

438
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,110
These are the names of the attendees.

439
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,710
Okay.

440
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,830
You can write pretty well now.

441
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,550
That's because you're teaching me well.

442
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:32,750
Please have a look at this, Your Highness.

443
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:42,890
The scholars who wanted to execute Your Highness have been passing this to each other every night.

444
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,130
Tongsong Village.

445
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,550
It's outside the palace but it's not that far.

446
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,970
Should I go there once?

447
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:58,770
I don't know why I'm so nervous about the scholars' examination.

448
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:03,030
Since you are like that, I feel the same.

449
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:08,730
It's the first civil examination of this new country, so it's normal to be excited.

450
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:15,110
It will all go well because Lord Sam Bong has prepared it while even skipping meals.

451
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:20,490
Yes, anyhow I wanted to meet and talk with you.

452
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,710
Please tell me your orders, Your Majesty.

453
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:30,390
I heard that you skip meals, don't even go home, and just work all the time.

454
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,210
You are now a person who is in charge of an important position in the country.

455
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,550
It's only natural for you to wear good clothes and live comfortably.

456
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,910
You should get out of that shabby house now too.

457
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:49,630
Being an official means that I'm eating food and wearing clothes made by others.

458
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,230
We must not be affluent.

459
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,550
Are you saying that to me?

460
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,370
I'm not living that affluently.

461
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,250
How can it be?

462
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,230
Okay, let's go.

463
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,170
From here, it's Tongsong village.

464
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,270
There's nothing much though.

465
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,690
Warrior-nim, what's wrong?

466
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:04,710
Your Highness, there's a small disturbance.

467
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,370
Yes. We'll resolve it soon, so please come back afterwards.

468
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,710
What happened for you to do this?

469
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:17,570
It's nothing, so if you will go back to the palace we will...

470
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:23,070
Your Highness! Your Highness!

471
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,650
Hey... Come and have a look from here.

472
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,950
Just what is that?

473
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,870
What is that?

474
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:12,130
That... on tree...

475
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,510
It's Gwaegwan.

476
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:17,030
What is that?

477
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:21,850
Taking their hats off and hanging them on a castle gate means that they are resigning.

478
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:27,150
This was done by people who are against this country.

479
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,950
Moo Hyul, go and chase them.

480
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,530
Yes!

481
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,710
First look into what's actually going on.

482
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:54,730
A number of scholars you were looking for are missing.

483
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,230
Missing?

484
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,110
Don't you think it's related to the civil examination?

485
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,470
They're gathered and living there?

486
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:03,750
Yes. We followed that scholar

487
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,550
and there's a big village in the mountain.

488
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:13,010
I think there are approximately 300-400 people there and more are coming.

489
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:18,550
The people who are against this country are gathered and living right in front of Gaegyeong.

490
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:25,650
Boon, go and tell everything to teacher Sam Bong.

491
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:31,830
I think it was done by the scholars who followed Teachers Mok Eun and Po Eun to reject the civil examination.

492
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,630
Do you think they've been threatened?

493
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:38,790
There was no need to threaten them since everyone's already in rage.

494
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,470
They must be determined to ruin this country's name and its legitimacy.

495
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,110
The missing scholars didn't go back to their hometowns either.

496
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,590
They could be gathered somewhere planning something.

497
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,950
What do you mean?

498
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:59,510
There's no way of knowing that, but such a large number of people has disappeared in such a short time.

499
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:02,110
Just what are they doing and where?

500
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,430
I found out where they are and what they are doing.

501
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:10,730
Where was it?

502
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:14,010
They're on Mount Gwangdeok, West of Gaegyeong.

503
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,230
What are they doing there?

504
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,930
They gathered and are building a village.

505
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,630
What are you saying? Say it in details

506
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,730
There was a map being passed around between the scholars, so we chased after them.

507
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:34,430
And when we went to Tongsung Village in Mount Gwangdeok,

508
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,270
everyone took off their traditional hats and scholar hoods,

509
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:40,650
and went to the village after donning straw hats.

510
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,690
Gwaegwan.

511
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:50,030
This is their demonstration that they do not approve the government and the king.

512
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,770
We can't just let this be.

513
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,990
We can only stay still.

514
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:58,030
It's not illegal so we can't reprimand them,

515
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:03,530
but such movements can be critical at a time like this.

516
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:08,790
When the news spreads, more people will join them, and as you saw at the civil exam,

517
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:12,890
we won't be able to tell what kind of group actions they will take.

518
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,290
What?

519
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:25,230
It's not even enough that no one turned up for the examination. Now they are gathered to live there?

520
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,850
Yes.

521
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:32,790
The people call it Doomundong.

522
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,270
Doomundong?

523
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,570
It must mean a village outside the gate.

524
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,930
I've never seen such bastards before!

525
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,770
We can't just leave them alone like that, right outside the capital.

526
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:48,750
Yes that is so. If they try to create some kind of conspiracy

527
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,450
there's no telling what might happen.

528
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,930
Let's send the troops.

529
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,210
I'm saying we should bring them all in.

530
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,450
For what crime?

531
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:04,490
What do you mean what crime? The crime for despising the royal family, and disturbing the country.

532
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:09,850
It's not like they caused a commotion, or sent petitions.

533
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:15,990
Since we even declared rule by law, system and ordinance,

534
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,910
it's not right for us to do that.

535
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:22,450
But if we leave them be, more people will gather in Doomundong.

536
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:26,820
That by itself will become a representation of denying the new dynasty.

537
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,940
Doomundong... Doomundong...

538
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:57,590
We are moved to tears with gratitude for giving everyone in our family a royal nickname.

539
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,690
What happened to Bang Woo and Bang Ui?

540
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:05,250
Bang Ui is still in Ham Joo while Bang Woo Hyung-nim is not feeling well

541
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,130
He is staying at Jebyeokdo.

542
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,490
Is he still like that?

543
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,600
I will make a visit to Hyung-nim.

544
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,330
Okay.

545
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,350
It's been a while, Bang Gan.

546
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,580
How was the situation in Ham Joo?

547
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:22,010
Yes. There's nothing wrong in Ham Joo.

548
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,760
The North is also quiet.

549
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:31,100
Okay. You have worked hard instead of your father and older brothers.

550
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,960
What hard work did I do when Father, you...

551
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:44,810
I heard that you are very concerned because the of civil exam incident and Doomundong.
(Lee Bang Gan - Prince Hwae Ahn, Lee Seong Gye's fourth son)

552
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,220
I've been in discussions with the Do Dang for days

553
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,590
but it's not an easy decision.

554
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,700
Those people who do not fear the heavens,
(Lee Bang Gwa - Prince Yeon Ahn, second son)

555
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,910
how could they just do that in front of the capital?

556
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,930
Because their respected teacher became like that,

557
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,380
they are probably saying they'll do something.

558
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:15,940
It's been a while.

559
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,170
Yes, Your Highness.

560
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:21,930
It seems that His Majesty is deeply worried about the problem with Doomundong.

561
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,310
Yes. Since they are people who should be the country's support,

562
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,130
he must be feeling great regret.

563
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,780
Is there something I can do to help?

564
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,060
Your Highness would?

565
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,470
Yes.

566
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:40,600
I don't mean anything else.

567
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,270
No matter how you look at it, my immature actions were the cause of it, so

568
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,480
I'm thinking of helping out.

569
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,920
I am very grateful that you would like to help out.

570
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,390
But why do you want to help?

571
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,580
I will persuade those people

572
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,740
to come back. What do you think?

573
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,140
I will persuade them.

574
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:10,440
You, who killed Po Eun, will persuade the scholars and officials who resigned?

575
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,840
Just what are you thinking?

576
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,640
How will you persuade them?

577
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,460
I will give it a try.

578
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,440
Can you really do it, Your Highness?

579
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,920
If I do my best with sincerity, wouldn't it lead to a good result?

580
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,840
Yes. Since you've decided to fix what you did yourself,

581
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,550
I think it would be good to step up and do it yourself.

582
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:41,830
At a time when a new country has just been established, a place like Doomundong must not exist.

583
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,090
Yes.

584
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:48,770
But I won't be able to persuade all of the hundreds of scholars who are there.

585
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,130
I will persuade those I can.

586
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:57,230
As for those who I cannot persuade, I will at least not let them stay at Doomundong.

587
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:01,950
If you can do that, it will be a big help to the nation.

588
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,510
Then, I beg of you.

589
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,970
What are you going to do?

590
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:21,160
The people who are in Doomundong think of you as an enemy.

591
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,460
How will you persuade those people?

592
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:29,640
With hard work and sincerity.

593
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,620
Husband.

594
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,890
Are you trying to change His Majesty's cold feelings towards you?

595
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:49,110
If the person who killed Po Eun can change those people's hearts,

596
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:51,650
this will become a symbolic event

597
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:54,670
But how?

598
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,990
Do you have a plan?

599
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:13,430
An intelligent Prince wouldn't be acting like this without a plan in mind.

600
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,180
Well since it seems like there will soon be a crown prince proclamation,

601
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,880
before that you'll have to calm His Majesty's heart, right?

602
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,240
It's western wind.

603
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:36,190
Bang Won will persuade them?

604
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:37,280
Yes.

605
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,590
If we can persuade them, nothing could be better than that.

606
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,380
Even if he can't, in showing his sincerity

607
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,630
there will be no harm.

608
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:52,530
Prince Jeong An (Lee Bang Won) already left for today so please wait.

609
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:59,210
We will be going to the West Gate of Doomundong so go to the East Gate.

610
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,460
Yes!

611
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,110
Let's go!

612
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,680
Since Prince Jeong An is not scared of difficult and complicated things,

613
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,580
it's worth expecting something from it.

614
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:20,480
Is he trying to gain merit to earn my forgiveness?

615
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,370
Do that. If you do...

616
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,010
You bastard!

617
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,020
Hey!

618
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,540
You killed Teacher Po Eun. What nerve do you have to come here?

619
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:48,920
We don't feel like listening to even a word of your excuse.

620
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,260
I don't make any excuses.

621
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,960
Then, why are you here?!

622
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,960
Set it on fire!

623
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:02,130
What? Set it on fire?

624
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:07,090
What was that? Didn't you say you'll persuade them?

625
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:10,750
I will persuade them when they come out.

626
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:16,250
There will be those who come out and those who'll be burned in the fire.

627
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:19,370
I will only take and persuade those who come out.

628
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,760
Your Highness!

629
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,710
This is my way and my place.

630
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:31,190
How would I rise up without touching this field of shit when it's a field of shit I've fallen in?

631
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:40,910
Father, and also teacher Sam Bong,

632
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:42,850
you'll see.

633
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,390
I will build power in my own way.

634
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:51,230
Even if I were to die and live again, I believe I'm right.

635
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:55,770
I might find my way by doing this.

636
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,510
What are you doing?!

637
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:01,150
Set it on fire! Right now!

638
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,480
Six Flying Dragons

639
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,790
You bastard! Do you not even fear the heavens?

640
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,740
They're still overflowing with strength.

641
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,800
Your Highness, Prince Jeong An has disappeared.

642
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,810
The rule of primogeniture has been broken!

643
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,440
Come in.

644
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,560
He has to become the king no matter what.

645
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,540
What about making Prince Ui An the Crown Prince?
(Prince Ui An: Lee Bang Seok)

646
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,650
Crown Prince. Crown Prince, you say?
