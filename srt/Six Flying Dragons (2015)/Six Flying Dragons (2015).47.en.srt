00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,230
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,870
Liaodong's center, Shimyang Fortress,

3
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,150
within 40 days,

4
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,030
will fall to our army.

5
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,430
Episode 47

6
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,790
It's a message from Ansan Governor Lee Sook Beon. The preparations are complete.

7
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,070
He is on standby near the queen's grave.

8
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,830
After all of these six incense sticks burn out, it will start.

9
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,610
Everything's ready. We will go.

10
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,270
I leave Lee Bang Ji to you.

11
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,570
I understand, Your Highness.

12
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,370
His Highness?

13
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,490
Yes. His Highness said that it's impossible for him to go on the expedition tomorrow.

14
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:57,210
His Highness said that the expedition can't be delayed again.

15
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,510
So His Highness told you to go first.

16
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,710
We're only moving to Pyeongyang tomorrow, so there isn't a lot to worry about.

17
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,770
He can just come to Pyeongyang once he gets better.

18
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,830
Yes, My Lord.

19
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,230
Brother! She's done with your clothes!

20
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,210
You're really lucky!

21
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,350
Lee Bang Ji

22
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,950
When I come back, at that time, will we be able to dream together?

23
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,330
Excuse me...

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,300
Wait here for a bit. Do you understand?

25
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,550
Yes, Owner.

26
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,590
Leader, what's wrong?

27
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,450
Nothing.

28
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,410
Okay.

29
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,430
Ddang Sae!

30
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,530
Why did you come again?

31
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,890
We'll think about the other things when you come back, but the present is also important.

32
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,910
I think it's better for you to wear it.

33
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,150
Make sure to come back alive.

34
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:55,350
♫ My breath gets cut off, it's carved in my body ♫

35
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,770
♫ The more I forget, the more it hurts ♫

36
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,810
♫ As if my frozen heart has stopped ♫

37
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,110
I'll make sure to survive and come back.

38
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:16,120
♫ The time that is you flows ♫

39
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,590
♫ Maybe that's why it won't work ♫

40
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,110
♫ I might not be able to see you ♫

41
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:35,460
♫ I can't say that one name ♫

42
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:43,130
♫ so I bury it in my heart ♫

43
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,510
Isn't that Grandma Myo Sang?

44
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,030
That's right.

45
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,150
Bang Won has started.
(Boon Yi: Banchon's Leader)

46
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,790
Leader. Leader, please save me.

47
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,950
Please save my Moo Hyul, Leader.

48
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,950
Is it today?

49
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,930
Is Prince Jeong An (Lee Bang Won) going to attack Elder Sam Bong?

50
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,710
I-I-It seems... It seems to be today.

51
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,230
They said it's today.

52
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,190
- Then, Bang Ji...
- Elder Bon Won is in danger.

53
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,890
Just this once. Please save us this once, Leader.

54
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,130
Your brother is okay.

55
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,850
He said that your brother will be lured somewhere else.

56
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,150
That's what our Moo Hyul said.

57
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,390
I'm also human. Do you think I would stay still if they said they would kill your brother?

58
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,890
If I stayed still, I wouldn't be human.

59
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,850
He said that they're only attacking Elder Sam Bong.

60
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,830
Boon, please save our Moo Hyul. Please save me.

61
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,910
Isn't Grandma Myo Sang helping Prince Jeong An?

62
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,390
Why is Banchon intervening in politics?

63
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,230
Brother Bang Ji might die.

64
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,610
That warrior is probably with Elder Sam Bong. He'll be in Seonghyeonbang today.

65
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,990
I'd have to go there.

66
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,310
Before all those incense sticks burn out, we have to lure Lee Bang Ji out.

67
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,970
Owner.

68
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,210
Owner, please escape.

69
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,150
What is this ominous feeling?

70
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,210
Sound of swords.

71
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,470
Bi Wol!

72
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,050
So I'm seeing the new Hwasadan owner like this.

73
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,630
So you came without us having to tell you about it.

74
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,190
Where is Yeon Hee?

75
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,110
She's not far from here.

76
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,630
She at that Boriam over there.

77
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,230
You should hurry and go there.

78
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,810
Don't you think that it will take you longer if you fight me?

79
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,650
Lord Ha Ryun is here.

80
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,890
You're here.

81
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,930
Yes, Your Highness.

82
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,710
I came with the Yanggwang-do troops.

83
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,610
I just handed it over to Sook Beon.

84
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,130
You've worked hard.

85
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,190
Your Highness.

86
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,830
What is this?

87
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,470
On August 26, 1398,

88
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,910
in order to conspire against the royal family, Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon

89
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,210
plotted treason.

90
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,910
Prince Jeong An knew about this in advance and raised the army.

91
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,290
What is this?

92
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,970
It will be the recorded history and what has happened until now.

93
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,810
Look at the next page.

94
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:34,770
Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon ran like a rat but got arrested.

95
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,450
In the end, in front of Prince Jeong An,

96
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,950
he went down on his knees and begged for his life.

97
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,650
Prince Jeong An reprimanded him and beheaded him.

98
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,590
Yes. That's the history that will happen starting now.

99
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,870
If this goes well, Teacher,

100
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,990
I really have to make you Father's compiler.

101
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,010
Your Highness, Bang Ji has left.

102
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,550
Okay. Let's start.

103
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,370
For smashing heads, this would be better.

104
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,590
Seonghyeonbang (Nam Eun's vacation house)

105
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,050
So you're here.

106
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,650
Looking back, it's really amazing.

107
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:21,150
At first it was just an absurd idea. But to think the day we go to conquer Liaodong is actually here.

108
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,550
We can't be sure yet.

109
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,590
If Ju Che (Zhu Di) doesn't advance southward, we'll have to give up on everything.

110
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,810
It will happen in the end.

111
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,630
The land reform, a change of dynasty, the disbanding of the private armies.

112
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,350
The many dreams you had have now become reality.

113
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,950
Anyway, we've come all the way here, one step at a time.

114
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,210
You...

115
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,990
Where is Bang Ji? Where is he?

116
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,210
What happened? What about Bang Ji?

117
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,670
Prince Jeong An has raised an army.

118
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,630
What?

119
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,570
What are you saying? Army?

120
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,530
What's that sound from outside?

121
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,150
Pardon? What sound?

122
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,330
There's nothing.

123
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,810
Park Po!

124
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,890
Yes, Your Highness! Deputy Commander, Park Po!

125
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,890
Moo Hyul!

126
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,600
Yes, Your Highness.

127
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
Warrior Moo Hyul!

128
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,090
Prince Jeong Ahn has launched an attack!

129
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,130
Defend here!

130
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,110
Bon Won!

131
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,390
It's the army. Hurry and escape.

132
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,190
What about Bang Ji?

133
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,030
I haven't seen Lee Bang Ji since earlier.

134
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,470
Bon Won! We have to escape for now.

135
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,170
Stop!

136
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,090
Ddang Sae!

137
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,630
Yeon Hee.

138
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:52,130
Lee Bang Ji, if you take one more step from that place,
(Jo Mal Saeng)

139
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,570
this woman will die.

140
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,990
You must not stay here. Hurry and go, Ddang Sae!

141
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,350
Don't move or she will die!

142
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,130
Don't you know?

143
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:40,690
They lured you out to attack Bon Won. So

144
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,910
hurry... Hurry and go!

145
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,770
Lee Bang Ji!

146
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,130
I also don't want to kill her.

147
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,590
You just have to stay here for a bit, please.

148
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,250
No!

149
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,390
Shim Hyo Saeng!

150
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,010
Shim Hyo Saeng

151
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,230
Jang Ji Hwa!

152
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,530
Jang Ji Hwa

153
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,750
Hey! Who is this bastard?

154
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,390
He's Lee Geun, Your Highness!

155
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,370
Bang Won! He said this is Lee Geun!

156
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,390
Lee Geun

157
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,670
Jeong Do Jeon, Nam Eun

158
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,010
No, Ddang Sae.

159
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,550
Elder Bon Won is in danger!

160
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:04,970
I swear to the heavens! If you move a step, I will slash her right away.

161
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:10,310
You can kill me but you won't be able to save this woman!

162
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,370
Yeon Hee.

163
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,230
Ddang Sae.

164
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,110
Yeon Hee.

165
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,570
You...

166
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,350
It's not your fault.

167
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,190
It's not because of you. It's not your fault.

168
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,130
It's just that the world is strange.

169
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,630
Remember.

170
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:21,870
This is not your fault.

171
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,830
Don't speak, Yeon Hee.

172
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,610
I...

173
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,130
It's not that

174
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,970
you couldn't protect me.

175
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,310
Go...

176
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,530
You can just

177
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,130
protect my dream.

178
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,690
Ddang Sae.

179
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,310
Elder Bon Won...

180
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,530
Go.

181
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,390
What happened to these?

182
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,490
Park Po, put soldiers on every alley leading to Sukjong Gate.

183
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,890
We must find Jeong Do Jeon and Nam Eun.
(Lee Bang Gan: Prince Hoe An, Lee Seong Gye's 4th son)

184
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,870
Do you understand?

185
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,850
Yes.

186
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,750
Send a message as soon as you find him.

187
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,910
Yes, Your Highness. Let's go.

188
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,430
Hyungnim.

189
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:47,190
For now, I'll go to the Head Military Office and join with Lee Sook Beon's troops.

190
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,390
Okay.

191
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,750
Let's go together.

192
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,250
Okay. Let's go.

193
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,290
Prince Jeong An has raised a rebellion.

194
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,770
Rebellion? What do you mean?

195
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,330
I will go to the military affairs office.

196
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,430
- What about Lord Sam Bong?
- I think that

197
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,150
the army has gone into Seonghyeonbang.
(Jeong Do Kwang: Jeong Do Jeon's younger brother)

198
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,590
That's what Gab Boon said when she came. Please look for Elder Bon Won.

199
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,350
I understand.

200
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,190
Prince Jeong An has raised the army.

201
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,230
But he never told me anything. What happened?

202
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,830
Did he find out that I'm a spy?
(Lee Shin Jeok)

203
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,910
You lost Sam Bong?

204
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,450
We have to find him. But first let us take over the Head Military Office.

205
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,110
- Start.
- Yes.

206
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,670
Okay! Everyone, let's go in!

207
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,690
Yes!

208
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,210
How come there's still no news?

209
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,370
The time has passed.

210
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,130
This won't do. The two of you must move first.

211
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,550
What if Sam Bong is still alive?

212
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,830
We don't have a choice.

213
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,390
Hurry and go to Lord Jo Joon.

214
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,410
Yes. Let's do that.

215
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,610
Okay. Let's go.

216
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,030
I will make sure to persuade Jo Joon.

217
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,050
What happened for you to do this?

218
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:25,670
It's not like something has to happen for me to visit you, Uncle.

219
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,330
Lee Ji Ran

220
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,770
Tomorrow is the expedition. Is that why you're feeling anxious?

221
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:49,790
Hyungnim, on the day of the revolt, you must not be stained with blood.

222
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,950
Stay with Uncle Ji Ran. A message will be sent.

223
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,950
The smell of blood is everywhere

224
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,410
tonight.
(Cheok Sa Gwang)

225
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,810
Slay anyone who resists!

226
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,850
Why did you come here this late at night?

227
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,550
I will just go in for a bit.

228
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,570
You can't come in at night.

229
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,590
Seonggyungwan

230
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,290
How can Prince Jeong An... How?

231
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,850
Will Bang Ji be okay?

232
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,470
There's no way of knowing right now.

233
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,630
But who do you think Bang Ji is? Don't worry.

234
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,730
Can you go to Hwa Sa Dan?

235
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,830
Hwa Sa Dan?

236
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,910
Check the situation in Hwa Sa Dan.

237
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,510
If Yeon Hee is there, tell her about the situation and my location.

238
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,050
Yes.

239
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,950
Prince Jeong An did what?

240
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,510
Be quiet! It will be a problem if he finds out that Elder Sam Bong is here.

241
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:47,190
Aigoo. This girl! Why did you involve yourself in this?

242
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,830
Unni. Unni Yeon Hee.

243
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:19,430
Just what happened here?

244
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:25,870
Could Unni be... Just where did Brother go?

245
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,770
Are you the ones who did this?

246
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:45,350
Who could this be? Aren't you the Leader of Banchon?

247
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,410
Why are you here?

248
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,150
What about Unni Yeon Hee? Where is she?

249
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,190
Yeon Hee? Who is Yeon Hee?

250
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,590
Ah! That person

251
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,330
did exist until a while ago.

252
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,990
But she's not in this world anymore.

253
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:21,190
What about my brother?

254
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,710
We lost Lee Bang Ji.

255
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,930
Go.

256
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,110
How can you just let her go?

257
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,550
To do anything to her... It's very complicated in various ways.

258
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,070
In various ways.

259
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,810
Warrior Lee Bang Ji.

260
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,250
What happened?

261
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,430
We've been attacked by Prince Jeong An.

262
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,570
What about Elder Sam Bong? Where is he?

263
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,990
I think he has escaped.

264
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,870
Hurry and save Elder.

265
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,590
We seized this place more easily than expected.
(Military Affairs Office)

266
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,490
We can't relax.

267
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,890
We still don't know Sam Bong's whereabouts.

268
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,300
What happened to the palace?

269
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,100
For now, Lee Sook Beon's army and my Yanggwang-do army have almost surrounded the palace.

270
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,800
But since we split up the troops in search for Sam Bong,

271
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,160
there's still no knowing what the result will be.

272
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,700
Also, even though His Majesty is ill,

273
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,470
if he recovers and comes out equipped with armor,

274
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,780
Everything will be for nothing.

275
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,800
So we have to quickly catch Sam Bong

276
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,940
and pressure the palace and receive a royal command.

277
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,490
Hyungnim, please command the troops at the palace with Sook Beon.

278
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,240
Okay. Leave the palace to me.

279
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,460
Let's go, Park Po.

280
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,090
Yes, Your Highness.

281
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,780
Your Highness, the military affairs office has been attacked.

282
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,240
Who attacked it?

283
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,680
Prince Jeong An.

284
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,300
What?

285
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,190
Sam Bong. Sam Bong.

286
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,410
No! My armor. Get me my armor!

287
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,530
Your Highness! Your Highness!

288
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,870
If Prince Jeong An equipped the troops with the armaments that he hid secretly, the number can't be that big.

289
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,730
Let's hurry and go to the palace—

290
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,070
Although Bang Won is reckless, he is also meticulous.

291
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,290
He wouldn't't have caused this with just a light troop.

292
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,250
There is definitely a government troop involved.

293
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,990
The government? Who?

294
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,690
Ha Ryun. Lee Sook Beon.

295
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,410
Lee Bang Won has chosen an amazing day.

296
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,490
Could the palace be surrounded as well?

297
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,830
Military affairs office then the palace. Isn't that the order?

298
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,810
He has probably sent people to persuade various officials.

299
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,510
What should we do?

300
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:57,290
The most important thing, to protect our great cause,

301
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,650
is your life and mine.

302
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,410
Yes. Without killing us, it would be hard to persuade anyone.

303
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,690
That's why Prince Jeong An is desperately looking for us.

304
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,900
Our side's sure strength is the military troops gathering tomorrow at mishi (1-3PM) at Sukjong Gate.

305
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,300
No matter what, you and I

306
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,000
must reach Sukjong Gate.

307
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,770
This here is Seonggyungwan and here is Banchon.

308
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:31,180
Here is Sukjong Gate. I will take this route to get out of Banchon,

309
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,040
so go to Sukjong Gate through Seonggyungwan's back door.

310
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,220
One of us needs to survive, no matter what, to command the army at Sukjong Gate.

311
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,700
Yes.

312
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,650
Okay.

313
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,020
Did you find Sam Bong?

314
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,980
We haven't found him yet.
(Park Po)

315
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,890
But Your Highness. Someone urgently wants to see you.

316
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:13,130
You... Why did you come here at this time of night?

317
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:19,730
Perhaps... Are you going to follow me now?

318
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:24,150
No. I didn't come to follow you.
(Woo Hak Joo)

319
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,750
Then, why?

320
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,790
I have something to tell you.

321
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,150
Did you come to sell me information?

322
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,190
Sam Bong

323
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,990
is in Seonggyungwan right now.

324
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,210
Then...

325
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,890
Wait!

326
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:48,090
Just why would you tell me that?

327
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,940
I abhor you, Your Highness.

328
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,390
But just for tonight I wish you luck.

329
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,960
Make sure to catch Sam Bong.

330
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,700
Then, I will go first.

331
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,980
Be careful. I'll see you in front of Sukjong Gate.

332
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,290
Please

333
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,010
be careful.

334
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,340
Seriously, you...

335
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,260
What do you believe in to follow me?

336
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,360
From the Jangpyeong Gate incident

337
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,640
in Seonggyungwan, I was just

338
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,950
a low scholar who was looked upon by others with contempt.

339
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,720
I don't have a particular reason.

340
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,210
It's just

341
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,400
because of your nickname during your time in Seonggyungwan.

342
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,360
Nickname? Did I have a nickname?

343
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:44,700
Your personality has always been like that so we couldn't say it in front of you.

344
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,920
Your nickname was Nutjob.

345
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,710
What?

346
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,340
You were the first-generation nutjob, and I was the second generation nutjob.

347
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,960
So,

348
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,350
I only thought that you were someone

349
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,330
who was like me.

350
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,040
This...

351
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,900
It was an honor to be able to follow you.

352
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,100
Thank you so much.

353
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,320
If we survive and see each other again at Sukjong Gate,

354
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,260
forget this conversation because it's embarrassing.

355
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,350
My Lord! There's a problem.

356
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,870
What happened?

357
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,740
Right now the army is in Banchon, in Seonggyungwan...

358
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,000
Banchon

359
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,600
The back door and the north door of Seonggyungwan Myeongryunjeon,

360
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:04,420
also the west door leading to Banchon and all routes to Daeseongjeon. Blockade them all!

361
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,550
Yes!

362
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,960
Let's go!

363
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,920
Let's go!

364
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,510
Jo Mal Saeng lost Lee Bang Ji.

365
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,950
Bang Ji is also on the move. If Bang Ji finds out that Sam Bong is here,

366
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:45,690
there's a higher chance he'll come through a smaller path rather than through here where there are troops.

367
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,940
You go and protect the Banchon West Gate. I will go somewhere else.
(Moo Hyul)

368
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,040
Yes! Let's go!

369
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,790
It's Seonggyungwan.

370
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,790
Sam Bong is in Seonggyungwan. Let's go there!

371
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,270
Yes!

372
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,940
Seonggyungwan

373
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,820
Are you going in?

374
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:26,560
There is Daeseongjeon inside, the shrine of Confucian scholars, isn't there?

375
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,220
Because of the situation we

376
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,020
entered Banchon carrying weapons, but

377
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:39,740
we can't go into the great shrine with weapons.

378
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,830
We don't even have the royal command.

379
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:48,040
My goodness, is there even a type of coup d'etat that's done after receiving a royal command?

380
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:55,210
Now! Everyone follow me and shout out!

381
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,030
You must need to shout out "Jeong Do Jeon, come out!"

382
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:04,490
What are we going to do if he escapes while we shout out?

383
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:11,610
Isn't that why we have soldiers in the back door as well?

384
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:16,090
We can just burst in and catch him.

385
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,810
Aren't we making history here right now?

386
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:32,650
Sam Bong has to escape like a running rat.

387
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,750
My Lord, just escape through the back door.

388
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,090
My Lord!

389
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:48,630
Though I've raised a great mountain, I am just short one basket of soil.

390
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,330
Pardon?

391
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:18,230
Traitor Jeong Do Jeon, come out!

392
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,870
Goodness! My Lord, they seem to be really coming.

393
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,910
Traitor Jeong Do Jeon, come out!

394
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,930
Traitor Jeong Do Jeon, come out!

395
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,950
Traitor Jeong Do Jeon, come out!

396
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,950
Prince Jeong An is probably outside, so give him this.

397
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,610
Pardon?

398
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:51,510
Traitor Jeong Do Jeon, come out!

399
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:55,650
Traitor Jeong Do Jeon, come out!

400
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,910
Traitor Jeong Do Jeon, come out!

401
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:11,190
Traitor Jeong Do Jeon, come out!

402
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,650
I'm in charge of Seonggyungwan, and a while ago,

403
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,670
he wanted this delivered to you.

404
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,950
He sent a letter.

405
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,370
Read it.

406
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,250
Should I really read it?

407
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,110
Read it.

408
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:06,450
"Be quiet. I'll be out right away."

409
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,890
Everyone, be quiet!

410
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:41,710
Teacher needs time.

411
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:01,270
Can you deliver this to my brother Do Kwang?

412
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:06,890
Yes. Don't worry. It's your order. Even if I risk my life,

413
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,570
I will surely deliver it.

414
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,630
Go out.

415
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,690
What's wrong?

416
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,610
Elder.

417
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:28,430
Pal Bong, my son who was killed by Hong In Bang's servants,

418
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:33,310
probably went to a good place instead of wandering the nether world, all thanks to you.

419
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:40,990
But because this is the only thing I can do for you,

420
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,590
I feel very sorry.

421
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:20,310
It seems that you have woken up. Go in and sleep.

422
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:30,090
Even if many things change tomorrow,

423
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:34,740
I hope that you don't change.

424
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,830
Yes, Teacher.

425
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,290
Teacher!

426
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,230
Teacher!

427
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,530
Teacher!

428
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,290
Teacher! Teacher!

429
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,270
Teacher!

430
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,950
Teacher! Teacher!

431
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:05,350
Seonggyungwan

432
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,330
Elder Sam Bong...

433
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,050
He's here, right?

434
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,650
Probably.

435
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,030
I have to go, Moo Hyul.

436
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,470
Move.

437
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,510
Bang Ji.

438
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:57,810
I am going to ask a favor from you for the first time.

439
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,990
Please go back.

440
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,150
He didn't escape.

441
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:27,090
Will you walk with me a bit?

442
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:31,110
Yes, Teacher.

443
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,730
Leader, where did you go?

444
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,650
Why?

445
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,230
There's a problem at Seonggyungwan right now!

446
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:23,550
Why didn't you escape? We were shouting so loud too.

447
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:27,170
I didn't have a reason to do so.

448
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:36,570
The country that the both of us want to make is actually the same,

449
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:42,010
so what's so important about whether I do it or you do it?

450
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:45,950
It's just that now my path has fallen off, so

451
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,910
I'm just backing off.

452
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:57,380
You know best about my ideas and plans

453
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,590
so you'll probably do well.

454
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,460
The Liaodong expedition,

455
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,780
I won't do it.

456
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:15,130
That is something that the survivor can decide on.

457
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:20,660
The living person can think about it himself

458
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,840
and lead the current age.

459
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,050
The deceased

460
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,620
shouldn't lead the current age.

461
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,840
I am very tired,

462
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,120
Bang Won.

463
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,370
Either I live mercilessly

464
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:39,030
or die mercilessly,

465
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:43,660
I just ended the same, Po Eun.

466
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:13,250
In that record from earlier

467
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,540
that says he ran away like a rat,

468
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,900
let's leave that out.

469
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:05,640
War must not be decided by the old people.

470
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,160
Because the ones who get killed are the young ones.

471
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,250
That man is the strongest.

472
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,710
New Joseon

473
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,840
This is not

474
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,250
Goryeo's map.

475
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,750
I am that person.

476
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:36,450
I am Jeong Do Jeon.

477
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,430
Let's defeat the three people of the Dodang

478
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,610
and create a new country.

479
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:47,550
Can you promise me, man-to-man?

480
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,700
I promise.

481
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,780
I will make the Saheonbu that always doubts.

482
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:01,140
I will make the Saganwon that always chastises. I will make Hongmoongwan that always talks and talks.

483
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:08,290
I will correct those thoughts of yours.

484
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:11,460
Call me Teacher from now on.

485
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,540
Jeong Do Jeon

486
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,570
Six Flying Dragons

487
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,610
It's the princes. Open the gate!

488
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,990
For Father to give up,

489
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,960
I should end it.

490
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,240
It's Nam Eun! One of Jeong Do Jeon's!

491
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,520
Take my life.

492
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,540
We did block Lee Bang Ji but we lost him.

493
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,510
We should be prepared. Do it like this.

494
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:36,970
Hyungnim, save me.

495
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,970
Even if you cry, you don't even have any sins to be forgiven.

496
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:43,970
Was it Bang Won? Was it Bang Won who did it?

497
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:49,640
You are even less than a mere dog or pig.

498
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:58,020
Six Flying Dragons
