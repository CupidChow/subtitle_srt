00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,820
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,140
If you get rid of Jeong Do Jeon, I will also get rid of Lee In Gyeom.

3
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,630
Please keep him by your side

4
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,680
and judge him by his talents and as a person.

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,200
Go with Jeong Do Jeon.

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,160
I will go with Lee In Gyeom.

7
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,180
Just enter the Do Dang instead of plotting schemes in the dark.

8
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,140
General! If you talk to me...

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,560
Episode 19

10
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,420
He said that he will get rid of Lee In Gyeom if I also get rid of you.

11
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,240
So what did you say?

12
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,600
I told him that the two of you cannot be compared.

13
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,260
I need to see General Choi Yeong right away.

14
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,130
Father. Gaegyeong Mother has returned from her parents' house.

15
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,990
Is that so?

16
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,900
Father!

17
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,300
Aigoo, right. How are you?

18
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,370
General Choi Yeong knew everything?

19
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,240
Please tell me in detail.

20
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
That is all.

21
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,400
Okay.
(Boon Yi)

22
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,800
You've worked hard, Brother.

23
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,360
Boon Yi.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,860
I...

25
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,070
I wish that you wouldn't get deeper into this work.
(Lee Bang Ji)

26
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,750
I need to see General Choi Yeong. Let's go to his house.

27
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,430
Let's go.

28
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,870
Excuse me. I saw, on my way here,

29
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,170
General Choi Yeong palanquin going to Hwa Sa Dan.

30
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,950
Did you do as I requested?

31
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,150
Yes.

32
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,800
We are not accepting any guests other than you today, General.
(Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan owner)

33
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,600
Please don't worry and go in.

34
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,640
I'm sorry. We are not accepting any guests today.

35
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,860
Isn't General Choi Yeong inside?

36
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,980
Yes. It was reserved a long time ago.

37
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,180
It appears to be really important so please make an appointment for another day.

38
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,430
Minister Choi Yeong is waiting. Please go in.

39
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,610
It was definitely a Mongol. He looked like a merchant.

40
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,860
Why would General Choi Yeong meet with a Mongol merchant?

41
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,970
The man beside him is a swordsman.

42
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,110
Swordsman?

43
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,510
The way he walks and how guarded he was with me say so.

44
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,490
That's what I felt. He's a swordsman of considerable level.

45
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,790
In the Hwa Sa Dan, where General Choi Yeong wouldn't let anyone enter,

46
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,190
he privately met with a Mongol merchant accompanied by a swordsman?

47
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,460
What?

48
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,820
Jeok Ryong gave the ledgers of his dealings with Hong In Bang to General Choi Yeong.

49
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,140
He probably learned about everything that happened all this time.

50
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,970
So?

51
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,190
It appears that General Choi Yeong criticized our General for it.

52
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,430
The arguments have become bigger.

53
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,940
What is going to happen now?

54
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,440
Now, it's impossible to avoid a battle with General Choi Yeong.
(Lee Bang Won)

55
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,700
I need to see Teacher.

56
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,780
This is Young Master's private space.
(Min Da Kyung: Future Queen Wongyeong)

57
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,540
How can a Ga Byeol Cho girl come and go in Young Master's private space whenever she wants?

58
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,380
How come you're not answering?

59
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,580
I'm sorry but this place is an official space to me.

60
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,770
Young Master Bang Won and I have the same goal and are working together.

61
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,520
I have heard that you also know about this.

62
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:32,150
Also, I heard from Young Master that you are objective and wise.

63
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,120
I think of you as a person who won't misunderstand useless things.

64
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,240
That's right. I didn't think of that. I apologize.

65
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,620
But using informal speech?

66
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,140
You dare speak to Young Master using informal speech.

67
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,200
Is that also official?

68
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,080
You have different status from Young Master and he is a man.

69
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,600
If you marry into a Sadaebu noble's family,

70
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,180
even if the two of you were close before, you still have to use formal speech.

71
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,780
What do you think?

72
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,710
Yes. I didn't think about that.

73
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,020
I will seriously think about it.

74
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,690
Then...

75
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:32,440
Lee In Gyeom has no crimes and his collected contributions to Goryeo are not small in number.

76
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:41,880
Also, how would his old body be able to endure severe punishment?

77
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,960
So he will be sent to exile in Gyeongsan

78
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,880
in order to correct his misbehavior.

79
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,930
Gyeongsan? Gyeongsan is Lee In Gyeom's hometown.

80
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,650
What kind of exile is this?

81
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,330
Then what about Lee In Gyeom's assets? Are you going to confiscate his assets?

82
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,090
There was no separate discussion about the assets.

83
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,990
So the lands that Lee In Gyeom took from the people all this time
(Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo)

84
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,610
will not be returned to them?

85
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,240
That's His Highness' will.

86
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,030
This must not happen!

87
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,480
The Do Dang should discuss this again

88
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,160
and send another petition to His Highness.

89
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,960
That's exactly it!

90
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,080
What crime do you all think those three people committed?

91
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,360
Their biggest crime was covering His Highness' eyes,

92
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,100
letting the Do Dang waver as much as they want, and discounting royal authority.

93
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,780
I, as the Prime Minister, am delivering His Highness' command right now,

94
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,440
but how can a royal command's prestige fall down to the ground like this?

95
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,560
If you challenge His Higness' will and defy all His orders,

96
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,180
you will be punished by law.

97
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,700
This will raise the royal authority again and raise Goryeo's dignity!

98
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,420
All of you, keep that in mind.

99
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,020
We are very pleased with Lord Lee In Gyeom's decision.

100
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,700
Yes. Since you were speaking loudly

101
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,910
they could not speak of that problem anymore.

102
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,890
The do dang already became the elder's.

103
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,320
From now on no matter which group we are part of

104
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,120
we will manage everything according to your will.

105
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,920
I! do not have a single intention to work with you guys.

106
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,800
You guys just have to follow my plans.

107
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,180
This is the reason why you guys are safe in the Do Dang. Do you understand?

108
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,720
You, what did just say? Do Dang is mine?

109
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,350
This Do Dang if only for His Highness!

110
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,620
If you say that ever again, you'll be the next one I will send to Hong In Bang, who was your leader.

111
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,080
You are not feeling well. Why

112
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,540
you are taking the Hamguh to Gyeong San?
(Hamguh: a wagon for criminals).

113
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,330
With the blessing from His Highness, I am going to my hometown in my old age.

114
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,890
Why would there be any smoldering grudge?

115
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,830
I was born as a boy and had Dohajun on my hands.

116
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,450
I did everything that can possibly be done.

117
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,200
Lee In Gyeom

118
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,340
Do you feel regret about not being able to kill me?

119
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,600
That is right.

120
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:11,040
Every time I see you, you remind me of the words scholar Jo once said.

121
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,260
That Chojujigah has a very bad fate.
(Chochugigah: a family that has betrayed it's owner)

122
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,800
You bastard. To whom are you saying something like eating dog shit?

123
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,540
You! Act like a sinner and go inside with your head down and your mouth shut.

124
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,550
Go. Rest your mind and body well.

125
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,810
You'll have to live long so that I can sentence you to your punishments again.

126
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:59,210
The answer to the question I had when I first entered the Dohajun,

127
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,510
I'm leaving without knowing that answer...

128
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,230
I am Eunuch Kim Nae Pyung.

129
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,330
There is a big problem in the palace right now.

130
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,660
What about the guy Kim Nae Pyung?

131
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,580
They said there is no man named that.

132
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,780
Who in the world could they be,

133
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,810
and for what reason did they help me?

134
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,950
The righteous general Choi has saved an old burglar because of his personal feelings.

135
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:08,670
Yes. Since the big burglar has escaped the net and we only caught Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi,

136
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,250
I am worried that the people's despair will rise even more.

137
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,630
General Choi talks about sovereignty but

138
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,050
how can sovereignty be set right when the people don't feel right.

139
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,290
On top of that, right now the King is...

140
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,780
You already know.

141
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,830
King U; Goryeo's 32nd ruler.

142
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,790
You...

143
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,490
You were off by a halftone again.

144
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,290
Your Majesty. No, that is not the case.

145
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,410
Then your saying I was wrong?

146
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,850
You are saying this country's king is wrong right now. Am I right?

147
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,460
Your Majesty. No...

148
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,840
Then are you saying you are wrong or am I wrong? Answer me.

149
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,380
Please spare me. Please spare me!

150
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,060
Please save me.

151
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,820
Please spare me. please spare me!

152
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,990
Please spare me!

153
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:58,540
No matter what, he is the king of Goryeo. I am going to awaken this country again with him.

154
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,070
- Your Majesty!
- Please spare me!

155
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,010
Please spare me!

156
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,570
Welcome, sir.

157
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,970
This wench who plays the instrument had her note wrong, so I was giving her a punishment.

158
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,590
Your Majesty, even if the musician made a mistake

159
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,610
it is too much to take a person's life for that.

160
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,290
You enjoy killing people so much, but then

161
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,470
why do you only stop me from doing that?

162
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:51,010
From what I heard, you killed more than thousand people that were part of Gil Tae Mi and Hong In Bang.

163
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,510
Please put away your sword.

164
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,100
Everyone step away by a hundred steps.

165
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,700
What are you guys doing? I just said go away!

166
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,890
Strengthening the sovereignty? What do you mean by that?

167
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,170
Giving more power to a king who has no interest in governing and is inadequate means that

168
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,810
Choi Young's power will solidify.

169
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,830
Furthermore, Choi Yeong, unlike Lee In Gyeom, won't care about the benefit of others,

170
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,790
so the government will only flow the way General Choi wants it to.

171
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,050
Then...

172
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,650
Goryeo has met a new type of czar

173
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,980
that it hasn't seen for years.

174
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,910
A new form of czar?

175
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,650
A czar with no greed.

176
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,420
A czar where the country has more priority more than his life or the lives of the people.

177
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:11,200
Therefore, a dangerous czar that can sacrifice anything for the country.

178
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
Excuse me.

179
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,550
There's something a bit strange going on.

180
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:24,650
During your reign, the Japanese pirates have attacked this country every ten days, and

181
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,400
with the continuous sickness and famine, people are dying. And

182
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,800
the Ming Dynasty, which is growing continuously every day,

183
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,120
is threatening us the same way.

184
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,520
Your Majesty, now you have to personally participate in governing.

185
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,840
Take care of everything and recover your sovereignty, Your Majesty.

186
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,600
Ah, yes.

187
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,300
If that is what you want, I'll do that. That won't be hard to do.

188
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,780
Your Majesty!

189
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,980
However, then

190
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,000
put in some money in naetangeum for me.
(Naetengeum-money in the personal possession of the king)

191
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,720
What do you mean about naetamgeum?

192
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,810
Didn't you take possession of Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi's money?

193
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,210
Take some of that and give it to me as naetamguem.

194
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,070
Their possessions were more than the royal family right?

195
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:24,230
Is this a country? This is why the sovereignty breaks down.

196
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,920
So, give me a little bit of that.

197
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,220
The royal family is not well off so those musician think of me as a laughing stock.

198
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,430
Why?

199
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,650
You are probably thinking, "King Gong Min's bloodline is definitely not like this."

200
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,920
"He's definitely Shin Don's child."

201
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,860
Isn't that what you think?

202
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,830
Why are you not answering?

203
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,080
"Your Highness! That is nonsense!"

204
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,090
"That is complete nonsense!"

205
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,730
"How can such difficult words come out of your mouth?"

206
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,450
Aren't you supposed to say this?

207
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't care from which bloodline you came from, Your Highness.

208
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,180
The only important thing to me is

209
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,910
the fact that you are the king of this country.

210
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,420
With Your Highness, I will surely

211
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,960
settle the past hundred years of disgraced history.
(time when the Yuan dynasty ruled and the King's authority dropped to the ground)

212
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,560
What is that?

213
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:40,150
At ten o'clock last night, a cart secretly came out of Hong In Bang's house.

214
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,040
Sam Jo from the Northern district saw it.

215
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,580
Isn't that the management place at Byeong Bu?

216
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,060
Did a thief get in?

217
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,350
Ah! It's not that.

218
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:55,170
The Byeong Bu soldiers handed the cart over to some people.

219
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,880
Deok Chil and I saw that. When we secretly saw it yesterday,

220
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,040
I came here to report to Leader Boon Yi

221
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,970
and our Deok Chil followed the cart

222
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,640
to where it's going.

223
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,620
But,

224
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,780
it has been two days

225
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,470
and Deok Chil hasn't come back yet.

226
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,080
Of all times, it was during curfew hours that a cart came out of Hong In Bang's house.

227
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,830
That cart was sent to someone

228
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,670
and the person who followed the cart went missing.

229
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,600
That's why some of our members have been looking for two days,

230
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,100
but it somehow feels strange.

231
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,390
What brings you here, my dear?

232
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,780
Gaegyeong Mother has come back.

233
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,130
Preparations have been done so let's go and give her our greetings.

234
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,070
I see.

235
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,780
I'll be back.

236
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,750
Bang Seok needed to recuperate some more, but
(Lee Bang Seok is Bang Won's youngest half brother.)

237
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,760
you had to hurriedly come here because of my message.

238
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,930
Not at all.
(Consort Kang: Lee Seong Gye's second wife)

239
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,150
If we make medicine out of walnuts, and he takes it long-term, he will get better soon.

240
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,090
At times like this, I need to be by your father's side.

241
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,090
Yes.

242
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,110
Since you know Gaegyeong better,

243
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,620
Please be supportive of my father.

244
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,220
Child. Do you know of Noble Gathering?

245
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,690
Yes. I haven't been to one but I have heard of it.

246
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,300
It's where noblewomen gather at Hwa Sa Dan to cultivate friendship.

247
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,420
Now that you have also become a part of the Lee Family of Jeon Joo,

248
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,640
you should go with me.

249
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,440
But I'm still not used to going into a place like Hwa Sa Dan—

250
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,110
The next meeting is on the fifth of next month.

251
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,810
Keep that in mind.

252
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,920
Ah... She can't win against her.

253
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,930
Do you know how strong Gaegyeong Madam is?

254
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,240
No, no, no.

255
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,950
Even if you say that, a woman's instinct is never wrong.

256
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,300
The way I see it,

257
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,450
Young Master Bang Won's wife is a lot stronger.
(Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's Grandmother)

258
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,850
What do you think, Master Hong?

259
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,770
This is a really strange place.

260
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,970
What's strange about it?

261
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,400
In this place, whether you're older or younger,

262
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,260
higher or lower position, man or woman, everyone's strong!

263
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,920
This is my first time in a place like this.

264
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,810
Even Boon Yi is strong!

265
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:58,430
At times like this, people like us should just...
(Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master)

266
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,820
The wisest thing to do is to quietly live and die.

267
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,990
Let's go.

268
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,450
Yes.

269
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,490
So the cart went from this side over in that direction.

270
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,540
Yes, it seems so.

271
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,200
This is neither the way to the palace nor the Byeong Bu storage.

272
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,950
Just where is it headed?

273
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,270
If we're going to find Deok Chil,

274
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,050
we must find that cart.

275
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,510
Does that make any sense?

276
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,160
"The whole region of Goryeo's Northern and Western sides are originally Mongol territory

277
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,940
and now that the Ming have pushed the Mongols out of the border,

278
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,480
It is only right for the Ming to have control over it."

279
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,160
Why is the Ming Emperor making unreasonable demands?

280
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,300
In the year 1356, since King Gong Min reclaimed it.

281
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,300
It has been our Goryeo's land for over 30 years.

282
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,760
Of course!

283
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,850
Many Goryeo citizens are occupying that land.

284
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,290
The Ming Emperor's command has already been sent.

285
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,990
So, about whether or not we will hand over the northern side to the Ming,

286
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,090
let's listen to your opinions.

287
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,190
Relinquish the land?

288
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:03,260
How much blood was spilled by our Goryeo to reclaim that land?

289
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,910
If the Ming provoke a war,

290
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,940
my Ga Byeol Cho, to the last man, will fight

291
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,830
and protect the Northeastern side.

292
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,920
However,

293
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,500
there's no way of knowing the Ming's real intentions.

294
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,500
At a time when there's a sudden change in the continent, there is a high possibility that the Ming

295
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,820
are the ones to mentioned it.

296
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,370
In conclusion, I think that we have to diplomatically solve this problem.

297
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,100
How is it that General Choi Yeong is responding to this issue like this?

298
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,560
Then with your position of being in charge send them a letter about it.

299
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,440
But...

300
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,770
Are you not going to do it, Prime Minister?

301
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:51,260
Minister Lee Seong Gye and I have an appointment to serve and go hunting with His Highness.

302
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,180
Hunting? Me?

303
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,710
Hunting at a time like this. Isn't this strange?

304
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,760
I haven't told you about it yet. Just know that and make preparations right away.

305
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,520
Hunting. At a time like this, Minister Choi Yeong is going to hunt.

306
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,360
I learned that a portion of the confiscated assets of Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi
(Yeon Hee)

307
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,460
have been transferred to the King's personal fund.

308
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,380
How... It's something that cannot happen unless Choi Yeong overlooks it.
(Nam Eun)

309
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,610
Didn't General Choi Yeong's daughter get married to His Highness recently?
(Lee Shin Jeok)

310
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,850
Can becoming a relative to the royal family really change a person like this?

311
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,900
No. If Choi Yeong has changed,

312
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,970
he will at least pretend to be in more of a rage.

313
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,300
Choi Yeong is hiding something right now.

314
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,820
Minister Choi Yeong is waiting. Please go in.

315
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,600
Our Deok Chil's corpse,

316
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,950
from all the way up there, was taken down here...

317
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,430
Oh my. We've been looking everywhere and he was found so far away here.

318
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,540
Do you remember

319
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,060
the face of the person dragging the cart?

320
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,410
Of course. Not only do I remember.

321
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,570
From the time our Deok Chil disappeared,

322
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:17,580
I kept on seeing it a hundred times a day.

323
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,700
Please take our ajussi to Father Geol Sang.

324
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,730
How long will it take to produce 30 copies of a facial composite?

325
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,620
It only took half a day before.

326
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,260
Sungmoon-dong, Jeongseung-dong, Seojae-dong, Namdae, and Shipja.

327
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,310
Also Tanhyeon Gate, Jangpae Gate, Hwibin Gate, and Seonui Gate.

328
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,960
Please gather and command every member of the group.

329
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,210
The time will be tonight at the hour of Sool (7:00-9:00).

330
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,890
Yes, I got it.

331
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,460
A few days ago, Minister Choi Yeong emptied the whole Hwa Sa Dan and met someone there.

332
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,270
Do you know anything about that?

333
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,590
The whole Hwa Sa Dan was emptied?

334
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,160
What kind of person did he meet?

335
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,650
There were two of them. One is a warrior of considerable level.

336
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,680
I got it.

337
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,150
Sir...

338
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,890
Deok Chil of North Group 3

339
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,070
has been found dead.

340
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,090
How is it that a cart was secretly dragged out during that time of the night?

341
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,300
Also, if the person who followed it got murdered...

342
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,640
The police are thoroughly guarding Hong In Bang's house.

343
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,060
It's something that cannot happen without Minister Choi Yeong's permission.

344
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,960
Even murder at that.

345
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,560
General Choi Yeong, just why...

346
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,000
We need to trace the people who have the cart.

347
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,660
Yes. We need to expose this case.

348
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,070
You will be in charge of that side. I have something to look into.

349
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,990
A few days ago, General Choi Yeong met someone in an empty Hwa Sa Dan?

350
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,690
Yes. He looks like a Mongol merchant but I don't know who he is.

351
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,850
Aren't you the one recording guest access at Hwa Sa Dan?

352
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,570
The owner personally did it on that day.

353
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,000
Why are you being like that?

354
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,560
Never mind.

355
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,440
Just go.

356
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,080
Boon Yi! Boon Yi!

357
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,600
Boon Yi..

358
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,150
Boon Yi, I'm sorry, but...

359
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,260
So this person killed our Deok Chil?

360
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,760
That's not yet confirmed. This person is only a clue.

361
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,000
We don't know who those people are or what their goal is, but

362
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,100
we are sure that they messed with our people.

363
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:50,070
We definitely have to catch and punish them. We also have to know the reason behind it.

364
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,430
Ah, how can we just thoughtlessly listen to your orders, Leader Boon Yi?

365
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:57,780
Even if we have to split our bodies into two, we will find them so don't worry.

366
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,920
Please take care of yourselves.

367
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,650
As soon as you find a clue, please contact Father Pal Bong.

368
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,950
- Yes, we will follow your orders.
- Yes, we will follow your orders!

369
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,320
- Let's go!
- Alright..

370
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,930
What the... You aren't going?

371
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,730
About Lady Boon Yi. She seems like a Ga Byeol Cho General.
(Moo Hyul)

372
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,130
The Llady directs them efficiently so those people follow her.

373
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,820
Those people, don't they all look like the lady's subordinates? Right?

374
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,920
Ah, Master...

375
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:52,140
When did those people from earlier start to call you Leader Boon Yi?

376
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,280
The people from the Western district originally called me Leader as a joke.

377
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,740
There were only three people gathered today who were from the Western district.

378
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,680
The other people just copied them for fun.

379
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,630
The people gathered today

380
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:15,250
are all Heads of the Gaegyeong branch. Under them are about 20 other people.

381
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,540
So I'm saying that you're commanding hundreds of people around Gaegyeong.

382
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,130
What do you mean I'm commanding them? They're all people I work with.

383
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,430
Why are you like that?

384
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,230
It's dangerous..

385
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,130
What?

386
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,550
Never mind.

387
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,950
You're cool. You're cool, Leader Boon Yi!

388
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,980
Oh, right.

389
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,930
- By the way..
- What?

390
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:52,180
The Lady has caught me talking to you in informal speech.

391
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,650
Should I serve you as a young master?

392
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,380
No. I would like it if you continue speaking informally.

393
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,040
Why? It doesn't matter to me.

394
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,580
After thinking about it,

395
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,610
I am speaking informally so that person is also speaking informally to me.

396
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:21,150
A person who is like that to me,

397
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:25,770
there's only you. Isn't it amazing?

398
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:31,210
But thinking about such a person disappearing,

399
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,870
I feel upset.

400
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,600
I understand.

401
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,590
I will do it when there's only the two of us then.

402
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,490
But now that I think about it, I also go around biting people.

403
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:56,030
But in the whole world, you're the only one who bit me back.

404
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:01,310
Hey, do I go around biting women here and there?

405
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,670
I also only have you.

406
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,390
That, that... It's not good.

407
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:17,060
It's not right. It's not right.

408
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:23,850
Just like Bi Guk Temple, Hwa Sa Dan also has a record of people going in and out of there and everything that happened on that day.

409
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:29,120
But on that day, the owner personally did the records.

410
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,050
Even the other spies didn't know about it?

411
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:37,670
The record would be hidden in the owner's room so we have no choice but to look at it.

412
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,890
Then, let's try to do this.

413
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:46,950
Choi Yeong told Lee Seong Gye to get rid of Jeong Do Jeon but he declined.

414
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:52,070
So there is now a gap between Lee Seong Gye and Choi Yeong.

415
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,770
Owner, Jeong Do Jeon is looking for you.

416
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,620
I must not be caught here.

417
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,040
Stay here for a bit and secretly get out.

418
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,360
I will keep Jeong Do Jeon here.

419
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,920
Sam Bong, you must feel very confident

420
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,660
to think that you have the best swordsman in the country as your bodyguard.

421
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,500
Yes. He's a bodyguard who's burdensome and not worthy of me.

422
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,220
Then, please have your conversation.

423
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:10,260
Once you get out of the room, walk ten steps to the left and owner's office will be there.

424
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,060
How's it going?

425
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,020
Still..

426
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,000
I came to strike a deal.

427
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,800
A deal?

428
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,880
Because Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi left like that, didn't Hwa Sa Dan lose big customers?

429
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,560
You probably know that I work under General Lee Seong Gye.

430
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,280
Is it okay for you to serve Minister Choi Yeong?

431
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,560
He's originally a stubborn person so will he correctly pay for the information?

432
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,280
It's something that I welcome! Does wealth have eyes?

433
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,620
Whether it is Elder Prime Minister Choi Yeong or Elder Minister Lee Seong Gye,

434
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,580
I don't discriminate against wealth.

435
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,310
That's the spirit.

436
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,870
Then, I will be requesting more help of you in the future.

437
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:15,990
Until Ddang Sae comes back to the room, you need to keep on talking to Owner.

438
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,310
Ah, also—

439
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:26,410
Leader, Chang Sun has come.

440
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,530
He wants to meet you.

441
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,430
I need to excuse myself for a few moments.

442
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:38,170
Ah, yes. I still have something to say so please make haste.

443
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,240
I found it!

444
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,920
Someone's coming.

445
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,240
- Hurry up.
- Nothing.

446
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,940
The person whom General Choi Yeong met on that day...

447
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,750
He's just listed as a person with no clear identity.

448
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,820
She's almost in front of the door.

449
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,340
I guess she already got out.

450
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,240
What are you two doing here?

451
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,880
That's what I want to ask.

452
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,240
Warrior-nim, it's a misunderstanding.

453
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,020
I was going to quietly get out with this wench

454
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,880
but it worked out well. Just why is this woman in Hwa Sa Dan?

455
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,020
What are you thinking of doing by making her approach Elder Sam Bong?

456
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,720
So my prediction was right.

457
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,520
You wench! So, as I expected, you were a spy sent by Hwa Sa Dan.

458
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,300
We found him! The man who was dragging the cart.

459
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,500
He is called Man Bok from a thug hideout close to North Marketplace.

460
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,440
Please help me.

461
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,740
Ah, please give me some too. Please!

462
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,350
Who is the guy called Man Bok here?

463
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,660
Why are you looking for Man Bok?

464
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,810
You don't have to know.

465
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,420
Where is Man Bok?

466
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,480
Are you a government agent?

467
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:43,050
If we tie him up and beat him to a pulp, he'll talk right away.

468
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,990
Guys!

469
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,440
You bastards are not qualified as thugs in the back alleys.

470
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,600
What are you saying?

471
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,160
I'm talking about the most important ability to survive in the back alleys.

472
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,050
The ability to recognize who's strong.

473
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,000
You guys don't have that...

474
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,020
Are you saying that you are strong?

475
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,440
Me?

476
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm just...

477
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,550
Hey, what are you doing?

478
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,140
Ah, yes.

479
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,210
Well..

480
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,110
Let's get this quickly over with.

481
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,430
Strike!

482
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,710
So, from the beginning, this is the reason why you came here?

483
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,120
It was partly that.

484
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,020
That woman's actions have been suspicious all this time,

485
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:02,160
and now that General Lee Seong Gye has become one of the top two powers, I thought we needed an information seller.

486
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,200
What do I need to do?

487
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,160
Don't you have nothing but information?

488
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:16,950
For this to end nicely, let's make a deal and hand over one bit of information.

489
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,120
What kind of information are you talking about?

490
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,300
On the first of this month, the doors to Hwa Sa Dan were all closed

491
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,340
and General Choi Yeong met someone in private, right?

492
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,680
Who is the person who met with General Choi Yeong?

493
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,290
I did catch the guy who was following us but I didn't do it to kill him.

494
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,820
It just happened...

495
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,670
I can kill you immediately here,

496
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:56,160
but if this person confesses just like that, it will end by being transferred to the investigation bureau.

497
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,130
Whether you live or die after going to the investigation bureau is out of my hands,

498
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,860
so you can hold on to your life for now.

499
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,390
Ah, yes. Yes. I will speak.

500
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,860
To whom did you give the cart you were dragging?

501
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,130
I really don't know who that person was.

502
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,510
What was inside the cart?

503
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:27,060
Everything, all of it, was gold.

504
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,940
Where did those people take the things transferred from the cart?

505
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,900
I also don't know anything about that.

506
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,820
Oh my, please spare me.

507
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,060
I really have no idea.

508
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,430
They just said that there was a deal that night.

509
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,180
Deal? What kind of deal?

510
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,750
I-I don't know...

511
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,700
What did the person who received the cart look like? Tell me in detail.

512
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,940
Yes. He was wearing a hat and a robe worn by monks.

513
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,140
So he's a monk?

514
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,150
I really don't know who that person is.

515
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:07,720
You emptied the whole Hwa Sa Dan for a person you don't even know?

516
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,910
It was an order from Minister Choi Yeong.

517
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,180
What did they talk about?

518
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,710
We also tried to listen to what they were talking about,

519
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:22,320
but they talked through writing so we don't know.

520
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,030
"I will not give away any information," was that it? Well, there's nothing I can do.

521
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,820
I will take that spy and will do as I see fit.

522
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,610
Wait.

523
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,010
One more thing...

524
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,540
On Minister Choi Yeong's way out,

525
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:49,430
he clearly answered in Mongol language, "On the 7th."

526
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,650
Besides that, there's nothing that I know.

527
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,850
On the 7th?

528
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:58,210
It will be hard to pay for this spy's life with just that...

529
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,340
I do know who connected Minister Choi Yeong to that Mongol merchant.

530
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,560
Who?

531
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,850
Clothes, monk robe... A bandana...

532
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,500
What else?

533
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:17,330
He looks like a monk but he has make up on his eyes.

534
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,660
Don't we know one person like that?

535
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,390
It was Jeok Ryong.

536
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,540
Bi Guk Temple's Jeok Ryong.

537
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,890
I don't have anything else that I know.

538
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,370
That was lacking but I will end it here.

539
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:43,210
I wish for good relationship with Hwa Sa Dan in the future.

540
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:46,710
Please use this woman as a contact in the future.

541
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,490
Let's go.

542
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,600
General Choi Yeong took Hong In Bang's assets and made a deal.

543
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,410
He even used Jeok Ryong.

544
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:59,620
Aren't we supposed to find out the details of the deal anyway?

545
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,940
If a cart was filled with gold, just how much would that be?

546
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,500
What does he need to buy to need that badly?

547
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,090
Whatever it is, wouldn't it be in Bi Guk Temple?

548
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,740
Why are you looking at me?

549
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,570
Ahh, we need to tell the General first.

550
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:27,150
Father went hunting with His Highness.

551
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,470
That's right. I don't think we should give them more time.

552
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,300
Let's hurry and go.

553
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,640
Ah, I don't think this will do.

554
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,580
As expected, you have great archery skills.

555
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,990
I'd only heard about it but it's amazing.

556
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,950
That's too much, Your Highness.

557
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:13,420
Since were talking about archery skills, there's no need to be humble. Who could dare deny you as an archer?

558
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,470
Okay, okay. Let's have some rest. We've been riding horses the whole day.

559
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,960
Yes. Let's go inside the barracks, Your Highness. It's getting cold.

560
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:30,680
Looking back to when I got caught, there were a lot of storage rooms.

561
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,470
Can we find which room they kept the things from Jeok Ryong's deal?

562
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,380
We can just rummage through storage rooms, one after the other.

563
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,440
If we're lucky, we can find it on the first try too.

564
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,050
That has never happened even once in my life.

565
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:47,360
Please don't worry. I am always lucky.

566
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:56,580
On the 7th. What could it mean?

567
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:02,040
Also, why would Choi Yeong meet a Mongol merchant through Jeok Ryong?

568
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,680
What is this?

569
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,710
I think we really found it on the first try.

570
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,940
What did I tell you?

571
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,810
Let's quickly open them.

572
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,040
Here.

573
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,050
Eh? This... What is this?

574
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,240
These are water buffalo horns.

575
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:45,230
Are these all water buffalo horns?

576
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,890
What are they used for?

577
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,860
Composite bows.

578
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,500
It's the best material for making composite bows. They are all imported.

579
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,650
Just why?

580
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,190
This is the item exchanged for gold during the trade, right?

581
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,670
This is where I was kept before but there was nothing like this back then.

582
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,600
Also...

583
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,470
There's not much dust so they came in recently.

584
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,480
Young Master. Now we know so let's quickly get out of here.

585
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,260
Quickly.

586
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,370
There are intruders in the storage!

587
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,160
Let's go!

588
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,510
Run!

589
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,980
There! Right there!

590
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,380
Stop!

591
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,810
Oh!

592
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,310
Well...

593
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:06,490
Wait. Who is this here?

594
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,650
Ga Byeol Cho's Confucian scholar.

595
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,200
There's also a familiar face.

596
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,280
It's great that we're meeting this way.

597
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,360
Yes, I know.

598
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,350
Put down your weapons. They're guests.

599
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,310
Guests?

600
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,630
As you know, I am an information seller. Aren't you here to buy information?

601
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,970
Didn't you come here to learn about something?

602
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:48,480
What is so urgent for you to infiltrate the Bi Guk Temple?

603
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,960
You even brought the rat-like spy girl who escaped last time.

604
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,570
A rat-like spy, you say...

605
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,970
Listen, Monk Jeok Ryong.

606
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:10,530
If you don't apologize immediately, and are not careful with your words in the future,

607
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:14,480
I will put the reputation of Ga Byeol Cho's 20,000 soldiers and the Lee Family of Jeon Joo on the line

608
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,930
and kill you.

609
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:21,350
I swear it on the name of my deceased mother.

610
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:29,390
Jeok Ryong: Bi Guk Temple's Head Monk

611
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:39,510
Lady. I sincerely offer you my apologies.

612
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:44,020
Yes, please be more careful in the future.

613
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,150
Can we continue talking?

614
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:01,540
You said you're selling information, right?

615
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:05,920
What information? We already know a lot.

616
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,290
You took out gold bars from the state, at General Choi Yeong's command,

617
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,500
and acquired water buffalo horns, right?

618
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:19,880
It was in the first storage room we entered among the many storage rooms in Bi Guk Temple. We were quite lucky.

619
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,130
It's not that you're lucky.

620
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,300
Whichever storage room you go into, it will be the same.

621
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:31,110
All the storage rooms are filled with that many water buffalo horns.

622
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:36,440
Why are you smuggling such a large amount?

623
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,090
I don't know. General Choi Yeong probably knows.

624
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:45,610
I thought you have become General Choi Yeong's person, so why are you telling me this?

625
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:50,510
That person never pays for things like this.

626
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:55,440
No such thing happens to me. So,

627
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,030
I am going to strike a deal with General Lee Seong Gye.

628
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:07,320
Should I say that the information I am giving you is a present for the first deal?

629
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:13,080
We are the ones who found out that you smuggled water buffalo horns on General Choi Yeong's orders.

630
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,590
It's not information you gave us.

631
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,940
Ah... The present I will give you is different.

632
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:27,630
General Choi Yeong secretly met a Mongol merchant in this place.

633
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:33,580
There was charcoal and paper here. They talked through writing with that.

634
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:39,520
I think they did that so that I wouldn't be able to eavesdrop.

635
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,270
So?

636
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:46,540
They took all the papers they used with them.

637
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:53,020
There were some traces left on the next paper from the charcoal being pressed on it.

638
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,910
The writing can be faintly seen on the last piece of paper.

639
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:12,800
There were only three characters.

640
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,100
What were they?

641
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:21,920
Yalu River.
(the river between China and the border)

642
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,990
I did as ordered by that person.

643
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,640
Yalu River?

644
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,130
Yes. He definitely said so.

645
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:52,960
The information that I acquired from Hwa Sa Dan is the 7th day.

646
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,730
Yalu River, on the 7th.

647
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,970
Isn't it some sort of an appointment?

648
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,100
Should I send someone there on that day?

649
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,670
On the 7th...

650
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:09,230
There were a lot of water buffalo horns there. They are used in arrows, right?

651
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:10,900
For what reason would they do that?

652
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,120
Isn't that just preparation for an invasion?

653
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,440
The Ming keep on going about something.

654
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,160
Still, it's too large an amount.

655
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,810
Yalu River...

656
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,220
No way!

657
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:28,390
Could it be? Teacher, you also mentioned it.

658
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:33,550
General Choi Yeong, who's supposed to be the most enraged about the Northern land problem, is not reacting.

659
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,080
Furthermore,

660
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,120
at a time when the Ming are provoking us, he is just calmly going on a hunt.

661
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,950
If our guess is right...

662
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,750
Sir, there's something strange going on.

663
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:57,100
Two months ago, at Yang Gwang and Gyo Ju's government offices,

664
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,080
there was a secret message for them to do a census for enlistment.

665
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,350
Not today but from two months ago.

666
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,990
Teacher... This!

667
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:23,230
Yalu River

668
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,260
You should speak now. You're taking too long.

669
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,770
Do you have something to tell me?

670
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,670
General Lee.

671
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:09,010
Yo Dong

672
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:19,170
It wasn't a Mongol merchant that he met.

673
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:24,090
It's definitely a high-ranking Mongol officer.

674
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,640
He's already contacted the enemy from the inside.

675
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,560
No way...

676
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,980
This is madness!

677
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,380
What? What are you talking about?

678
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:42,370
What are you talking about?

679
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:48,760
We have already told the Yuan dynasty about this. Our Goryeo army will be crossing the Yalu River.

680
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,810
We will conquer Liaodong.

681
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,460
Choi Yeong to Liaodong...

682
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:04,420
He's going to conquer Liaodong.

683
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,320
Six Flying Dragons

684
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,550
Just do what I say, General Lee.

685
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:29,070
Conquering Liaodong. It's impossible.

686
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:32,960
This is not the right time for a small country to be attacking a large one.

687
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,840
It's a revolution.

688
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,470
Are you going to be the King?

689
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:37,900
I, Lee Seong Gye!
