00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,030
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:53,540
The An Byeon Chaek has been approved.

3
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,500
Now, the base of revolution has been established.

4
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:05,330
Hong In Bang, in the end, your ambition has set fire to revolution.

5
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,410
Episode 10

6
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,040
Why are you like that?

7
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,840
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,580
Did something go wrong?

9
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,460
Boon...

10
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,440
Ah, hurry and speak up! How did it go?

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,800
The An Byeon Chaek...
(An Byeon Chaek: a strategy to stabilize the national defense of the Northeastern border)

12
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,260
has been approved!

13
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,770
Hey, what are you doing? People are staring.

14
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,390
Is that important now? When I'm this excited!

15
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,710
Did it really get passed?

16
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,010
Yes. Everything went well. Everything!

17
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,730
The An Byeon Chaek has been approved.

18
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,890
Now, the distribution of power in Gaegyeong will be greatly restructured.

19
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,290
The ones who made this amazing feat possible were us. We did it!

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,920
But that was forged. What are you going to do?

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,930
Hey, it's not the time to worry but the time to celebrate victory.

22
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,000
You... As a person lives life, this kind of moment doesn't come often.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,520
If you don't enjoy this kind of moment, you'll live a depressing life.

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,160
I don't want to live like that. No, I can't live like that.

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,820
Aigoo. Aigoo. Is that so?

26
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,700
Well, I'm like that too.

27
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,800
You bastard, you back stabbed me?

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,500
Back stabbed? Who is it that planned an assassination and is now getting mad at me and putting the blame on me?

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,940
Assassination? When did I try to kill you?
(Lee In Gyeom)

30
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,310
Not me, but my In-law. You sent an assassin last night!
(Gil Tae Mi)

31
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,210
Assassin?

32
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,670
What are you saying right now?

33
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,170
Forget it.

34
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,900
If it's not you, then it's probably General Choi Yeong.

35
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,140
No, what is this...

36
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,570
You bastard. Do you know what you have done?

37
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,850
Do you think that I don't want Lee Seong Gye to enter the Do Dang because I hate him?

38
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:13,030
Did it look like I was scared of my authority being in danger if Lee Seong Gye sides with Choi Yeong?

39
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,670
Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be that, right?

40
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,750
What kind of place is the Northeastern region?

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,430
It's a place that can decide what will happen to Goryeo.

42
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,870
To the down-to-earth guy from that Northeastern region,

43
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,210
you give him an autonomous region and if he advances to the center,

44
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:35,600
that man's strength will finally be out of our control, you stupid bastard!

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,430
If it was that important, then you shouldn't have sent an assassin.

46
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,950
I said that I never sent one!

47
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,700
General!

48
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,820
You knew about it, right, General? What exactly happened?
(Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo)

49
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,780
I voted in favor of the An Byeon Chaek so that it gets approved.
[Choi Yeong]

50
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,120
Wasn't it the same for you?

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,140
That wasn't the case though. How is it that those people

52
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,370
You can ask them that then. Why are you asking me?

53
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,330
Are you going to release Hong In Bang's servants?

54
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,490
Are you going to cover up what happened in the Western district?

55
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,930
For a strategy to work, it needs to follow a sequence.

56
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,520
I just followed the sequence.

57
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,590
Then what are you going to do after that?

58
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,490
He'll probably strike me afterwards.

59
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,830
That is not a strange thing. Isn't General Choi Yeong originally the best person for defense?
(Hong In Bang)

60
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,530
The thing I'm curious about isn't General Choi Yeong's thoughts

61
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,310
but yours.

62
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,770
Instead of offering your assets, you chose to get the An Byeon Chaek approved.

63
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,650
Your hidden agenda, that's what I'm curious of.

64
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,210
Could it be that you are thinking of getting General Lee Seong Gye on your side?

65
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,710
Are you thinking of that?

66
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,950
Just watch.

67
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,320
It's Bu Jeon Swae Jeon.
(Bu Jeon Swae Jeon: "Pick up a stone, hit the stone."

68
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,020
The world alleviation plan has really started now.

69
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,360
Hong In Bang is a stone you are holding in your hands, Elder Bon Won.

70
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,500
But why is your face like that?

71
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,860
Who could that warrior be?

72
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,200
Are you talking about the person that poured down Heaven's rain on us?

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,680
It's said that you can't predict where a Pok Doo will bounce to.
(Pok Doo Bul Ga Ji: it's not possible to predict where a bean will bounce to when it's being fried.)

74
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,380
When the Heaven's rain falls down next time, we don't know if we will be Sima Yi or Zhuge Liang.

75
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,280
Are you referring to that man as the Pok Doo?
(Pok Doo: fried bean)

76
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,990
In this situation that I perfectly created,

77
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,670
only that suspicious warrior is not included in my calculations.

78
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,530
In this moment, the most dangerous thing is an uncontrolled variable.

79
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,130
I will look into it.

80
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,300
You have to go to Ham Joo now.

81
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,620
I have to.

82
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,900
Now, I have to meet Lee Seong Gye and let him know about the whole plan. It's time to discuss the system of establishing a country.

83
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,660
Then, should I go to the cave in Ja Nam Mountain?

84
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,920
Yes.

85
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,580
Inside the cave, if you look through the bookshelf, there will be papers inside a wooden chest.

86
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,240
Please take all of it.

87
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,680
You! Did you lie to me or not?

88
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,350
What are you saying? How would I dare do that to you?
(Cho Young, Hwa Sa Dan's Owner)

89
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,200
To make Hong In Bang crawl back,

90
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,740
I said that I will bring in Lee Seong Gye.

91
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,290
Still, that bastard brought a gift

92
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,100
and even said that he will lower the taxes.

93
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,710
If he was thinking of being allied with Lee Seong Gye in the first place,

94
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,410
shouldn't he have used it as his advantage, when I said I was going to bring in Lee Seong Gye?

95
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:54,690
But he didn't do that. Instead, back stabbed me at the Do Dang today.

96
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,900
Also, what did the person you sent say last night?

97
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,080
Gil Tae Mi and Hong In Bang decided on offering half of their assets?

98
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,830
Yes, Hap Ha.

99
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,390
I personally heard that.

100
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,090
They surely decided on doing that.

101
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,260
But all of a sudden, an assassin came...

102
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,670
Wait, wait...

103
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,580
They already decided to offer half of their assets

104
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,920
and an assassin came in?

105
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,880
They misunderstood that I sent the assassin

106
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,060
and changed their mind?

107
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,280
This situation

108
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,250
was not planned by Hong In Bang.

109
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,910
Yes?

110
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,350
What did Gil Tae Mi say about the assassin?

111
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,770
When their swords met, he said this, "So what happened to Baek Yoon was your doing."

112
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,970
Like this, he speculated that he was the one who killed Baek Yoon.

113
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,270
In this palace, there is an influential force that I am not aware of.

114
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,660
There is someone controlling Hong In Bang.

115
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,840
A power in Gaegyeong that neither of us know about?

116
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,500
It must be the person who leads that assassin.

117
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,100
Gather all your information.

118
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,790
After the attack, Hong In Bang definitely met with someone.

119
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,570
Yes, Hap Ha.

120
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,350
Just who?

121
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,520
Wait...

122
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,290
Who will benefit the most from this happening?

123
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,140
Could it be...

124
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:06,250
Are you thinking of the same thing as me?

125
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,310
But it's not in Lee Seong Gye's nature to do this.

126
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,900
Lee Seong Gye...

127
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,010
What?

128
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,970
The An Byeon Chaek has been approved at the Do Dang.

129
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,350
If the An Byeon Chaek has been approved...

130
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,390
Teacher's Sam Bong's plan worked.

131
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,900
It's not because I don't trust you, Young Master.
(Moo Hyul)

132
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,980
Gyo Ui Bang Gwa said that "Buk Doo 2nd rank" or something doesn't exist...

133
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,160
Well, my position or my housing,

134
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,190
how will you provide it, if you break it down...

135
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,280
How many times did I tell you that is not the important thing, Warrior-nim?

136
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,690
No, it's not important. Ah, I'm really hungry.

137
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,370
Owner, please give me one more chicken. I'm hungry.

138
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,080
It's nice to enjoy life but you should stop now.
(Boon Yi)

139
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,450
Tell me. What are you going to do?

140
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,380
Father will not be able to withdraw the An Byeon Chaek.
[Lee Bang Won]

141
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,690
How did you know?

142
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,000
My father is General Lee Seong Gye.

143
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,310
But saying, "I wasn't able to control my own child so things became like this.

144
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,850
I will cancel the An Byeon Chaek." Do you think he will do it that way?

145
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,050
Then how can he govern the Ga Byeol Cho?
(Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army)

146
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,150
He'll probably be enraged but he will just keep it in.

147
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,390
Of course, I'll probably get something broken somewhere or get cut off from the family.

148
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,250
That, I can handle.

149
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,230
You're sure, right?

150
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,370
There's no way that the An Byeon Chaek will be withdrawn, right?

151
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,550
You're going to withdraw the An Byeon Chaek?

152
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,490
That's it. That is the Northeastern region's standpoint that will be presented at the Do Dang.

153
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,870
So you, immediately get the horse running to the Do Dang and let them know that.

154
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,630
What are you standing there for?

155
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,770
Father, if the An Byeon Chaek gets enforced, then the people coming into the Northeastern region,
[Lee Bang Gwa]

156
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,150
the families of the Ga Byeol Cho soldies who died,

157
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,510
even the dying people from the places our power couldn't reach,

158
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,970
we will be able to watch over them.

159
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,190
Is that everything? Ho Bal Do and his Yeojin tribe,
(Ho Bal Do: Yeojin tribe's Chief)

160
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,490
we can raise a military power that can push them north of Yalu River.

161
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,970
More than that,

162
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,770
the Goryeo you have been protecting, it will be Goryeo's defense that will stabilize.

163
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,310
Are you also thinking of not listening to your father's words?

164
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,430
I have the same thoughts as Bang Gwa.

165
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,230
If the An Byeon Chaek is enforced,
[Lee Ji Ran]

166
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,050
wouldn't you be the one who can do it best, Hyung-nim?

167
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:11,020
Are you going to waste the Northeast's tax revenue like those stealing bastards in the Do Dang?

168
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,100
I will use it.

169
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,520
In my entire life! For the first time, I will use them in vain.

170
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,360
When I said I'm not going to go into politics, did you think it was because I didn't know what politics is?

171
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,570
Politics is like that.

172
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,910
To get the An Byeon Chaek approved, whether it is Hong In Bang or Lee In Gyeom,

173
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,890
we got help from one of them.

174
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,270
Then, it becomes a situation where I joined hands with those people.

175
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,770
But I, Lee Seong Gye,

176
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,830
because of my son's arrogant behavior and the words of a scholar I somehow met,

177
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,310
do you think I will do that? I will never do it.

178
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:05,850
If I, Lee Seong Gye, didn't make up my mind to do something, I never act on it.

179
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:14,590
So Bang Gwa, get a horse running to the Do Dang and let them know that.

180
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:21,270
And Lee Shin Jeok, tell Jeong Do Jeon not to dream in vain.

181
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,730
- And Young Gyu.
- Yes.

182
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,760
Secretly tell Bang Woo to capture that bastard Bang Won and bring him here.

183
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,230
Yes.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,130
Why did they arrest me?
[Juk Ryong: Bi Guk Temple Head Monk]

185
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,610
How are things going?

186
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,010
Did I get caught for nothing?

187
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,550
Excuse me. What's going to happen to me?

188
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,190
Look here. Hey!

189
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,170
Is Monk Juk Ryong still not here?

190
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,010
Yes.

191
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,410
But where did you send Monk Juk Ryong?

192
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,870
Things went well so he'll be back soon. Is Sam bong inside?

193
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,290
He's in the Monk's room.

194
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,240
The two of you didn't have a good relationship, right?

195
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,490
Ah, well... kind of.

196
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,590
Well, how can I have a good relationship with someone?
(Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon)

197
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,920
In-law persuaded me so I voted in favor of the An Byeon Chaek

198
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,130
but what are we going to do?

199
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,720
I am going to leave for Ham Joo in a while.

200
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,790
When I get back, I will have the proof of my alliance with General Lee Seong Gye.

201
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,140
I'll be expecting it.

202
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,790
Then, this time, when you get back from Ham Joo,

203
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,000
I'll see you in Gaegyeong.

204
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,910
It's an access tile to Gaegyeong.

205
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,910
I cancelled the Gyeong Wi Jong Pyeon against you, Sam Bong.
(Gyeong Wi Jong Pyeon: order that prevents one who is exiled from going into Gaegyeong after release.)

206
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,940
This...

207
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,630
I'm a Su Shi Joong so something like this is not much.
 (Su Shi Joong: The highest ranking political figure in Goryeo - like a prime minister.)

208
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,710
I'm so happy I'm almost in tears.

209
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,870
I can now meet you more often.

210
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,600
That's right.

211
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,360
But Sam Bong, when you go into Gaegyeong, you should also be careful.

212
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,390
If not for me, we, including In-law, will be on our way to the underworld. You know that, right?

213
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,270
I was going to ask about that anyway.

214
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,130
Who do you think that assassin is?

215
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,850
You are familiar with all the distinguished warriors out there.

216
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,670
That's why it's driving me crazy too.

217
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,690
There's no way that a person of that skill just suddenly appeared.

218
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,040
A warrior is bound to be revealed during the process of building their skill.

219
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,300
So you also don't know about it?

220
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,600
It's obvious.

221
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,750
Don't you think that Hap Ha secretly trained him?

222
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:05,100
The Elder is secretly having different thoughts for when he abandons me.

223
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,900
That assassin is not under Lee In Gyeom.

224
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,600
He doesn't have any reason to do that to Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

225
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,120
Just who's authority is he under?

226
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,600
Hae Dong Gap Jok? Those people don't move for something like this.
(Hae Dong Gap Jok: a noble family of 10 generations during the Unified Silla Kingdom.)

227
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,280
Who exactly is giving him orders?

228
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,660
Elder Bon Won!

229
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,850
Regarding the Pok Doo you were talking about. That assassin.
(Pok Doo: fried bean)

230
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,040
I found out who's controlling him.

231
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,750
Who is it?

232
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,210
That... It's you, Elder Bon Won.

233
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,450
What are you saying?

234
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,900
Inside the cave in Ja Nam Mountain, this letter...

235
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,020
Sam Bong, I killed Baek Yoon according to your Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye.
(Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye: a plan to alleviate the world)

236
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,140
But this world is becoming worse.

237
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,740
Who exactly is this person?

238
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,850
You don't know?
(Yeon Hee)

239
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,880
How can a person you don't know be mad at you?

240
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,500
Also, how did he know about that place and the Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye Chaek?

241
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,770
I only talked about that plan to you and Hong In Bang.

242
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,100
Who exactly is he?

243
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,800
Did you go to Ham Joo and came back?

244
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,430
Hyung-nim, by any chance, did Bang Gwa Hyung or Young Gyu come here?

245
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,370
They are probably in Ham Joo. Why would they be here?
(Lee Bang Woo: Lee Bang Won's older brother)

246
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,970
What are you doing and not greeting him?

247
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,670
Ah!

248
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,140
I am Young Master Bang Won's 2nd rank Buk Doo bodyguard,

249
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,990
Moo Hyul.

250
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,900
- Buk Doo... what?
- Bodyguard.

251
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,770
I gave a position to him.

252
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,800
I saved Young Master's life not once, but twice,

253
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,670
I am warrior Moo Hyul.

254
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,390
- Is that true.
- Yes. It is true.

255
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,420
Also, this lady,

256
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,750
I, twice...

257
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,510
Did this lady also save you?

258
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,040
No.

259
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,940
She bit me twice. On my arm.

260
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,490
It would be great if you can arrange a place for them here at the military troop in Gaegyeong.

261
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,930
That person has an amazing innate strength.

262
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,450
I think it will be great if you can train him under you.

263
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,740
And this lady... Well, she'll do well with errands.

264
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,320
Ah, well. It's not a hard thing to do, but...

265
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,450
Excuse me. If you're going to do that, can my family also...

266
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,240
Family?

267
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,270
Ah, because I saved Young Master's life twice now,

268
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,110
I couldn't look after my family.

269
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,290
Hey, you also have family.

270
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,380
At the Western district.

271
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,410
Hyung-nim, she also has a family.

272
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:32,610
They are all persevering. They will work hard for their food.

273
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,900
Yes, hello. Yes, I'm part of the Ga Byeol Cho. Ga Byeol Cho!
(Ga Byeol Cho - living quarters)

274
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,130
We're staying here?

275
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,270
Hey, do you know how hard the training is here?

276
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,010
You don't even know that you're widely opening the door to hardship.

277
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,370
Hardship? That's something I always do. You said that food will be served on time?

278
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,400
Wow. Seriously, Goryeo is really about connection, wealth, fame, and family!

279
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,940
Among those, connections are the best.

280
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,010
How did you keep the family intact in the middle of that?

281
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,750
It's my grandmother's method of discipline.

282
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,320
Then, I will be back.

283
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,110
Thank you. For taking care of my village people.

284
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,870
It's just me returning the favor for you keeping my secret.

285
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,400
Let's go.

286
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,420
Where?

287
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,550
Where are we going?

288
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,350
Pick one.

289
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,150
Look here. Please choose a pair for her to wear.

290
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,160
If you brought your girlfriend here, the man should be choosing for her.

291
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,430
Is that so?

292
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:00,440
You choose and then put it on her, that's how you do it.

293
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,650
We're not in that kind of relationship to pick out shoes

294
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,090
Try them on.

295
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,910
Does it fit or not?

296
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, I'm not sure.

297
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,370
Give it here.

298
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,830
Is this a bit small?

299
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,800
Just because I was being nice to you!

300
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,080
It's strange!

301
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,810
It feels ticklish.

302
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,540
Is that a woman or a thug?

303
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:35,980
♫ Even during the times when I abandon myself ♫

304
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,610
♫ you are on my side ♫

305
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,920
It's strange... it's strange...

306
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,300
♫ I recognized you a few times
Thanks to you, I am alive ♫

307
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:56,500
♫ I restlessly follow your voice ♫

308
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,670
♫ Even if for a thousand times ♫

309
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,300
Do you like them?
♫ I pushed you down ♫

310
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,390
You like them?
♫ I get captivated ♫

311
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:09,250
♫ In your eyes, I am shining ♫

312
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,670
Where did Ajussi say he would be?

313
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,450
Didn't Hong In Bang release him from the Gyeong Wi Jong Pyeon?
(Gyeong Wi Jong Pyeon: order that prevents an exile from going into Gaegyeong after release)

314
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,720
What are you going to do when you meet Teacher Sam Bong?

315
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,590
I can't believe what your telling me.

316
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,870
How can you guarantee that General Lee Seong Gye will not withdraw the An Byeon Chaek?

317
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,880
So I have to hurry and report this to Ajussi.

318
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,150
I'm going to meet him first and tell him.

319
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,650
For something like this, the one who caused the problem has to say it.

320
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,290
That's your problem.

321
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,100
Hey...

322
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,070
To be honest I haven't met Sam Bong Teacher even once.

323
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,840
But this time, we made the plan succeed together.

324
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,750
This time I'm going to meet him and get scolded if he wants to scold me or complimented if he wants to compliment me

325
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,970
That's why the person he needs to discuss the next step with

326
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,070
is not you, but me.

327
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,310
I also have my duty as a member.

328
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm going to meet him first.

329
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,640
You don't even know where he is.

330
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,690
You, do you know something?

331
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:03,170
He's coming back to Gaegyeong after eight years.

332
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,810
I think I know where he would go.

333
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,010
Because of the one word you said, I bet my life,

334
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,700
but where are you?

335
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,740
The letter is gone.

336
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,190
Does that mean Sam Bong has finally come?

337
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,600
New Jo Seon

338
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,750
Finally! Finally we get to meet.

339
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,790
Okay

340
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,680
This is how men meet.

341
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,180
A historical meeting is like this.

342
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,350
Ddang Sae: Lee Bang Ji in the future

343
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,320
Just who is he?

344
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,260
That idiot.

345
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,380
Who are you?

346
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,690
I have waited for such a long time to meet you.

347
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,280
Me?

348
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,100
Yes.

349
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,730
Teacher.

350
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:26,060
A disciple I don't even know.

351
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,370
Then is the man behind me waiting to meet me as well?

352
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,970
What?

353
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,210
I've waited a long time.

354
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,960
Sam Bong.

355
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,190
You. You are...

356
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,180
You came as well!

357
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,210
Do you

358
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,620
know me?

359
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,310
Of course I do.

360
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,500
I know you very well

361
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,440
But I don't know you.

362
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,320
Who are you?

363
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,680
Well who are you?

364
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,160
The one who had his life stripped away because of you.

365
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,400
I don't know you. I've never seen you,

366
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,770
yet I scammed you?

367
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,690
Who are you?

368
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,780
I know both of you.

369
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,760
And very well at that.

370
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,000
Who are you?

371
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,340
Right, who are you?

372
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,710
I am

373
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,680
Lee Bang Won.

374
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,440
Lee Bang Won?

375
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,110
But after listening to the two of you speaking,

376
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,650
it appears that the swordsman didn't move according to your order.

377
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,290
To think this great cause was put into motion by tangling with the inevitable, as well as a coincidence.

378
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:13,450
This is like Heaven's "Un" and Land's "Myeong" meeting.
(Un: fortune, Myeong: order/God's will, Un Myeong: fate)

379
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,710
In each battlefield, he comes like the wind and defeats Japanese pirates,

380
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,430
The Viper.

381
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,470
How do you know?

382
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,100
The Viper?

383
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,780
I followed the Viper and found this cave.

384
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,900
I came to know your will.

385
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,200
You followed me?

386
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,650
The day that you killed Dae Sa Seong Baek Yoon,

387
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,890
I was there.

388
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,460
Also,

389
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,220
this letter.

390
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,940
I saw this and to find the owner of this room.

391
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,360
I went out to find the Viper.

392
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,290
Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye.
(Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye: a plan to make a fair and righteous world)

393
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,570
Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye?

394
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,430
How did you know about the Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye?

395
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,780
Does it matter how I knew about it?

396
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,360
The only important thing is,

397
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,350
I followed your plan but this country has become more chaotic.

398
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,550
This rotten Goryeo is far from ending.

399
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,530
It is getting more rotten and is collapsing.

400
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,560
Your plan

401
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,540
was wrong.

402
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,020
No.

403
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,910
I might not know what the Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye is,

404
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:55,270
but if it's a plan to smash this rotten Goryeo,

405
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,080
that is going well.

406
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,990
The day that you killed Baek Yoon, it was started.

407
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,560
And yesterday,

408
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,840
because of your attack on Hong In Bang, the An Byeon Chaek got approved.

409
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,020
The three of us created this situation.

410
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,250
Now Goryeo will

411
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,740
begin a new era.

412
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,140
New era?

413
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,400
What's a new era?

414
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,070
Faultless people who cultivated a wasteland getting killed?

415
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,920
Or taking lands from the people with the excuse of protecting them from Japanese pirates?

416
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,670
That.

417
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,420
is that the new era you are talking about?

418
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,380
It's a process that we have to go through.

419
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,130
For every great cause, hardship follows.

420
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,460
Cause...

421
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,490
Hardship...

422
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,460
Teacher, what you said was right.

423
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,560
You said that the thoughts of people in politics are of little value.

424
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,070
Look at the big picture? Don't look at the tree but the whole forest?

425
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,020
The wild grass that gets stepped on there

426
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,520
doesn't even have peace.

427
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,430
is it going well?

428
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,370
In that process that's going well,

429
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,210
how many people need to die?

430
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,230
How many more need to die for that damn Pyeong Jeong Ji Gye

431
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,070
to end Goryeo?

432
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,030
But,

433
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,140
"it's going well".

434
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,790
I started it?

435
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,270
It was my fault.

436
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,080
I

437
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,280
placed a bet on something I shouldn't have bet on.

438
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,850
Shouldn't you listen to my explanation as well?

439
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,250
I was going to do that, but

440
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,730
just now I realized,

441
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,940
even if I listen to what you are going to say,

442
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,940
there's no turning back.

443
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,440
We

444
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,880
will not see each other again.

445
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,660
We will meet again.

446
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,150
If I meet you again,

447
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,230
I might kill you then.

448
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,020
It's that person. The one who left a letter for Bon Won.

449
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,390
He will come back.

450
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,510
He trusted your plan and executed it.

451
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,460
Don't you think he's someone who has a lot of rage against this Goryeo?

452
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,370
Did you say you are Lee Bang Won?

453
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,820
Yes.

454
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,230
I,

455
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,900
General Lee Seong Gye's fifth son,

456
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,820
am Lee Bang Won.

457
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,200
No difference. No difference.

458
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,040
Ask the world...

459
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:25,360
When deciding life and death, between politics

460
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:31,100
and a sword, what difference is there.

461
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:37,930
♫ Nameless bird in the sky ♫

462
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:45,550
♫ why do you cry you mournfully? ♫

463
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:52,090
♫ The ground where the flower wilted ♫

464
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,600
♫ can't be found anyway ♫

465
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,440
Where did you go that you're only coming back now?

466
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,520
Don't smile! I'll fall for you.

467
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,650
I'm hungry.

468
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,380
Do you have rice?

469
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,490
You should know shame.

470
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,070
You're missing performances every day, so why are you talking about food?

471
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,120
We don't have rice.

472
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,620
Sorry.

473
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,440
From tomorrow, I won't skip and I'll do everything.

474
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,470
Give me some rice. I might die from hunger!

475
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,150
Whatever.

476
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,360
Give me some rice. I said I might die from hunger!

477
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,930
Give me some rice!

478
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,420
- I don't want to.
- I'm so hungry, I might die, Gab Boon!

479
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,010
I said I don't want to!

480
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,890
I'm going to die from hunger!

481
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,440
What exactly are you doing that you haven't eaten yet?

482
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,070
Please give me some alcohol!

483
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,050
Don't do that just to anyone!

484
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,940
- I'm dying if hunger.
- Go perform and earn money for food.

485
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,230
Aigoo.

486
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,350
You...

487
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,290
Ddang Sae, you...

488
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,660
You were that warrior?

489
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,570
You killed Baek Yoon,

490
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,310
attacked Hong In Bang...

491
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:07,160
Why? Just why would you?

492
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,530
Why? Why? Why did you get swept away?

493
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,490
Just why?

494
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,580
Whose son were you?

495
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,690
General Lee Seong Gye is my father.

496
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:28,400
When you chose Father back in Ham Joo,

497
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,920
I was also in that place.

498
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,790
You eavesdropped?

499
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,800
I'm sorry. But,

500
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:42,760
the first time I saw you, Teacher, was in the year of Eul Myo at Jangpyeong Gate.

501
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,010
So I went to Seonggyungwan.

502
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,120
But that place has already been filled with the people of the three high ministers of the Do Dang

503
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,640
and Sadaebu who have renounced their belief.

504
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,020
So in whatever I did, I climbed

505
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,080
and got stepped on.

506
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,030
I climbed again and got stepped on once more.

507
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,860
'I might also

508
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,980
change like this.'

509
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,360
That's when I found this place.

510
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,860
I have seen all of your thoughts.

511
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,250
My heart raced again.

512
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,220
I looked for you.

513
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,970
That wind brought me to Ham Joo,

514
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:41,070
and finally I got to meet you like this.

515
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,500
I want to do this with you. I want to serve you.

516
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,970
In this great and heart pounding placement of the foundation of the great cause, even just at the edge of it,

517
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,000
I would like to join you.

518
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,130
Please accept me.

519
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,030
It is disrespectful for human relationships to start this way.

520
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,230
Be careful of what you do

521
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,290
and don't come into this room without my permission.

522
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,220
I will keep it in mind.

523
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,570
I will be mindful.

524
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:19,340
But what you said about me not going into this room again,

525
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,370
please take it back.

526
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,120
I already,

527
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,700
according to your plan,

528
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,690
acted on it.

529
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,820
Acted on it?

530
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,710
What did you do?

531
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,290
My father would never

532
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:45,330
stamp something like the An Byeon Chaek.

533
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,190
What are you saying?

534
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,020
The An Byeon Chaek that General Lee Seong Gye stamped has already been approved by the Do Dang...

535
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,290
Father did not stamp that An Byeon Chaek.

536
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,090
I was the one who stamped it.

537
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,820
I used his stamp without him knowing

538
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,720
and gave it to Lee Shin Jeok.

539
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,800
That An Byeon Chaek got approved.

540
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,900
So there was a different Pok Doo.
(Pok Doo: fried bean, you can't predict where a bean will fly to while being fried)

541
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,200
If you waited for Father to stamp the An Byeon Chaek,

542
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,250
nothing would have happened.

543
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,880
The great cause wouldn't have moved even by one step.

544
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,400
Yes. I stamped it.

545
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,680
Because Father is a person who will only move if something starts to happen.

546
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,340
As for taking responsibility,

547
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,620
I am already prepared for that.

548
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,820
What taking responsibility are you talking about?

549
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,260
If the General didn't stamp it,

550
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,220
then we're still that far away from it.

551
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,030
I have to persuade him, have patience, and be on the same page.

552
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:00,000
Even if it's hard, the first step to this great cause is to build trust.

553
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,630
But what did you do?

554
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,550
In a chaotic country,

555
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,290
didn't you say that their is a way in this turbulent time?

556
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,070
It is Nan Se Ji Geom

557
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,110
Yoo Byeol.
(Nan Se Ji Geom Yoo Byeol: A different sword is used in turbulent times)

558
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:23,420
(Nan Se Ji Geom Yoo Byeol: A different sword is used in turbulent times)

559
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,440
Year of Shin Chook (1361).

560
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,250
When the Red Turbans invaded,

561
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,940
Gaegyeong was set on fire and suffered a fall.

562
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,150
At that time, there were four heroes who saved Gaegyeong.

563
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,010
Yes.

564
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:44,300
They were Generals Jeong Se Woon, An Woo, Kim Deuk Bae, Lee Bang Shil.

565
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,180
General Kim Deuk Bae

566
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,760
is your teacher, right?

567
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,780
But all four of those people died.

568
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,880
Did you know? During the time when Gaegyeong was re taken and the soldiers were singing a song of victory,

569
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,750
all four of them died.

570
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,310
I do know.

571
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,510
Why are you telling me that?

572
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:08,440
Generals An Woo, Kim Deuk Bae, and Lee Bang Shil

573
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,480
killed Commander-in-Chief General Jeong Se Woon after they won back Gaegyeong.

574
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,260
Then, those three Generals,

575
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,160
were beheaded for that sin

576
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,030
not even three days after Gaegyeong was taken back.

577
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,020
Do you know why?

578
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,200
It was because of one letter.

579
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:33,500
One letter that's not even great or long.

580
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,840
Privy council Kim Yong.

581
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,900
Because he was afraid that his power would be taken by those heroes,

582
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,060
he forged the King's name and sent a fake order against the three generals.

583
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,450
It happened because of that.

584
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:50,700
Are you saying that what I did is the same as what Kim Yong did?

585
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,670
Do you think that only four heroes died because of that letter?

586
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,790
Goryeo's politics also died. Why?

587
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,600
Subjects, the king. Everybody stopped trusting each other.

588
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,510
Even the king's name can be forged so what is still true in this world?

589
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,750
Because of that one letter,

590
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,100
that kind of world was made.

591
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,260
The result of that

592
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:14,930
is this Goryeo that we are both looking at.

593
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:18,210
A fake letter made Goryeo into this but

594
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,450
through my fake document, the An Byeon Chaek got approved

595
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,310
and the fire of the great cause has been lit.

596
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,770
Will lighting the fire of the great cause be the end of it?

597
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,990
The numerous plans that you have seen in this room,

598
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,670
a new country's establishment system.

599
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,030
Didn't you see the things that the General and I need to do together?

600
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,850
But you ruined it from the start.

601
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:46,670
Because of your careless actions, General Lee Seong Gye will not trust me now.

602
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,400
Father

603
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,300
already knew that it was I who did it without discussing it with anyone.

604
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,180
Then, he would think that I played along with you.

605
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,450
If it is you, would you trust someone who did that?

606
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,350
Also, what I need to gain is your father's, General Lee Seong Gye's, resolve.

607
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:09,070
His resolve to achieve the great cause together, that's what I need.

608
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,360
You

609
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:18,830
took away your father's purpose and resolve.

610
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,190
A chaotic world using a different sword?

611
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,320
There's a way in turbulent times?

612
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,000
There are three kinds of people in turbulent times.

613
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,160
The victim, the one who fights it,

614
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,940
and someone like you who goes along with it.

615
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,600
Anarchy's sword?

616
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,950
No. That is just a bug you are raising in your heart.

617
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,430
A person in politics usually raises a bug inside of him.

618
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,790
If you think that right now is a turbulent time,

619
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:55,090
that you have to survive in it, that there's nothing to do, it will probably be whispering softly.

620
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:59,210
But if you listen to what that bug says and follows it,

621
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,690
in the end, you will become a bug.

622
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,180
Those who go along with turbulent times make this world worse.

623
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,870
Even the government inferiors

624
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,750
who think that they need to survive during turbulent times,

625
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,840
will live stealing, killing, and spoiling.

626
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,200
How are you different from those people?

627
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,360
How is it that I...

628
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,810
How can you say that I am the same with those people?

629
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:28,920
Your father is not acting on it but you purposely forged his stamp.

630
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,820
You ridiculed the settlement between your father and I. How are you any different?

631
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,300
This place.

632
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,530
In this room,

633
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:48,020
you don't have a place.

634
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,050
It was this place.

635
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,560
My great cause that has to start in this room,

636
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,310
is not for going along with turbulent times

637
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:08,490
but for fighting them.

638
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,910
Leave.

639
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,550
I...

640
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,630
The thing I have committed,

641
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,480
please let me settle it.

642
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,920
That's what I have to do.

643
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,330
For you,

644
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,640
there's nothing more.

645
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,890
In this room,

646
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,800
you don't have a place.

647
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,360
I am General Lee Bang Shil!

648
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,240
You must be kidding! I am General An Woo!

649
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,040
I'm Kim Deuk Bae.

650
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,060
Look at this.

651
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,570
Ah, what is this?

652
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,270
You Red Turban bastard! Take my sword!

653
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,060
Why am I a Red Turban?

654
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,150
I will also be a Goryeo soldier.

655
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,920
Yours don't even have eyes, nose, and lips.

656
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,230
That's why you are a Red Turban.

657
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,210
I defeated a Red Turban!

658
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:24,220
Ajussi, why is it that mine don't have eyes, nose, and lips?

659
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,690
Ah, you guys, please be quiet!

660
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:30,830
You're really taking the life out of a person.

661
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:34,720
Ajussi, is it true that the Red Turbans were defeated?

662
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,980
That's right. The Goryeeo soldiers have completely defeated the Red Turbans

663
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,640
and won back this Goryeo.

664
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,760
Wow, then we can go home now?

665
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,370
Not yet.

666
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:50,150
We don't know where some of the Red Turbans are still hiding,

667
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:51,800
so we have to be the most careful now.

668
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,500
Yes.

669
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,720
You are the leader now, so you have to take care of the younger ones.

670
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,400
Really? I'm the leader?

671
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,110
That's right.

672
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,820
For now, endure with this.

673
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,840
I will go and check the situation outside.

674
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,990
You must not go out before I get back.

675
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,210
Do you understand?

676
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,310
Yes. We will never go out.

677
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,990
I will also make sure that the other children don't go out.

678
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,460
Okay.

679
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,470
I will be back.

680
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,800
Why are you crying again?

681
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,230
Because mine doesn't have eyes, nose, and lips

682
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:38,260
they say mine is a Red Turban.

683
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,660
When I come back, I will make eyes, nose, and lips for this.

684
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,140
Yours will be... ah!

685
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,720
I will makes you the highest position, General Jeong Se Woon.

686
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,120
Really?

687
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,280
Of course. It's true.

688
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,490
How is it that taking care of children is harder than looking after students of Seonggyungwan?

689
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,730
Ajussi.

690
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,920
Ah, what is it again?

691
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,480
You have to come back quickly.

692
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,220
We'll be waiting.

693
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,820
I know, I know.

694
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,650
What are you saying, Teacher?

695
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,320
To General Jeong Se Woon,

696
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,500
what did you do to him?

697
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,630
There was a royal order to kill General Jeong Se Yoon yesterday.
(Kim Deuk Bae)

698
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,430
So with Generals Lee Bang Shil and An Woo,

699
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:41,010
we killed General Jeong Se Woon yesterday.

700
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,310
Wasn't he the hero who won Gaegyeong back?

701
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,620
How can such a royal order...

702
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,700
I wanted to look into the royal order to know whether it was true,

703
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,260
but how can you check on a royal order?

704
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,670
Ah, this... This is impossible.

705
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,850
How can this be?

706
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,850
General Kim Deuk Bae, we arrest you for the crime of killing General Jeong Se Woon. It's the royal order.

707
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:12,840
What are you saying? I only received a royal order.

708
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,800
I clearly received documents signed by the King to kill General Jeong Se Woon.

709
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,410
- Hurry and arrest him!
- Yes!

710
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,150
You bastards! Don't touch me.

711
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,760
Take him!

712
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,980
You bastards, you bastards!

713
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,830
Why are you doing this? Why?

714
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:35,030
Please release me! The children might die. I need to go!

715
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:39,270
Please release me. I have to go. Please release me!

716
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,960
At the bottom of Ja Nam Mountain, there is a cave.

717
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,690
There are children I was taking care of there.

718
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:49,410
Please go and save the children.

719
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,750
I beg of you. Please.

720
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,590
They said that the bastard Kim Yong forged the royal order.

721
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:05,860
Because the four Generals are earning merits, he was afraid of his power being taken away from him.

722
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,600
No, no, no.

723
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:22,290
No, no. Those children nowadays don't listen.

724
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:26,900
Children these days... They don't listen to what adults say...

725
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,830
Those bad kids, really bad kids!

726
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:35,520
They probably went out of the cave. They porbably did.

727
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,590
No, no.

728
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:51,870
They were children who survived even during the rule of the Red Turbans.

729
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:55,810
It's nonsense. They would even fight with the higher ups.

730
00:52:55,810 --> 00:53:01,210
Impossible. No, no.

731
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,850
Why did you think of that again?

732
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:46,790
How can you talk about that terrible day?

733
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:51,790
In the end, Kim Yong achieved Heung Wang Sa incident and succeeded in assassinating the King.
(Heung Wang Sa incident: fortress invasion incident by Kim Yong to assassinate the king)

734
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,810
Please stop.

735
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:58,370
You couldn't forget what happened on that day and you won't leave this terrible cave.

736
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,810
This is where you started.

737
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:06,630
So you always carry that woodcarving soldier that you couldn't complete the eyes, nose, and lips on.

738
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,210
That will do.

739
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:14,310
From now on, don't let your past disturb your present.

740
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,530
Just think of getting out in the future.

741
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:26,650
If it's because of that Pok Doo,

742
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,510
I will make that person take responsibility.

743
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,190
He's someone who would do that.

744
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:36,850
That Pok Doo is not the problem.

745
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:42,090
Another serious Pok Doo exists.

746
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,760
What you said was right.

747
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,920
That night, after Hong In Bang's attack, he secretly met with someone.

748
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,200
Who was it?

749
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,680
It was Lee Bang Won.

750
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,600
Lee Bang Won? Who is that?

751
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,900
Lee Seong Gye's fifth son.

752
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,340
What?

753
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:09,220
Also, that night, he came from Ham Joo.

754
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,060
Hap Ha. There was a report that Ho Bal Do has invaded the North.

755
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,640
A serious Pok Doo? Who is that?

756
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:31,580
War. So Lee Seong Gye is tied to the battlefield.

757
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,850
Did you say Lee Bang Won?

758
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,190
Yes, Hap Ha.

759
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:41,360
Fifth son.

760
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,750
Could it be?

761
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:50,170
Ajussi, you are an evil person.

762
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,310
Do you know him?

763
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,560
Lee Bang Won...

764
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:12,680
But if you listen to what the bug says and follow it, then, in the end, you will become a bug.

765
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:18,000
People who go along with the turbulent times make the world even worse.

766
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,580
I know that I did wrong.

767
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:24,960
But... It's not the time to receive punishment,

768
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,460
it's the time to settle it. I will go to Ham Joo.

769
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:48,830
A person who goes along with turbulent times.

770
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,590
A person who fights it.

771
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,350
It's cool.

772
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:02,480
So cool.

773
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:10,390
That's right, Lee Bang Won. From here on, you will fight chaos.

774
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:18,450
It's Lee Bang Won. The Pok Doo that's hard to control, and is linked by blood to the person that I am going to serve as my lord.

775
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:21,610
According to military strategies,

776
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:24,690
if you want the commander to collapse,

777
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:28,830
then aim for his horse first.

778
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,650
Teacher Sam Bong.

779
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:49,290
My place in that cave, take good care of it.

780
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:52,290
I will definitely go to it.

781
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:55,290
A serious Pok Doo.

782
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:03,420
Lee Bang Won... Lee Bang Won.

783
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,160
Six Flying Dragons

784
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,620
-You there!
-On the charge that you secretly made an illegal deal with Dae Sa Sung, Hong In Bang, to pass the An Byeon Chaek.

785
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:34,860
The shadow behind Lee Seong Gye...
Try to react to this move.

786
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,410
A bug has also started to crawl into my mind

787
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:40,330
Let's kill him. Lee Bang Won.

788
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,040
Don't die.

789
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,200
What are you saying?

790
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,560
Lee In Gyeom has declared war.

791
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,790
What are you going to do?

792
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:49,400
I will turn the tables.
