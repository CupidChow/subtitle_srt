00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,630
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,640
Scholars, government officials, and Sadaebu. We, who are here,

3
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,500
need to be this country's healthy and strong roots.

4
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,110
We are this land's Milbon (hidden roots).

5
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,810
Milbon: Hidden roots

6
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,550
Milbon?

7
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:15,090
Milbon cannot ever be different from the following two things.

8
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,410
It's Minbon. The people are the foundation and roots.

9
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,160
Minbon. The people...

10
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,620
The people are the roots.

11
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,290
Moo Hyul!

12
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,790
Your Highness.

13
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,570
Episode 43

14
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,510
Liaodong field

15
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,710
I, Warrior Moo Hyul, accepted my lord's orders and lived each day as if it were a year.

16
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,310
Stand up.

17
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,740
You have changed.

18
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,300
You have also changed, Your Highness.

19
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,260
Let's go back to Gaegyeong.

20
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,700
It's not Gaegyeong now. It's Hanyang.

21
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,090
The capital has already been moved.

22
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,610
Right. Let's go to Hanyang.

23
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,980
To think that you came back alive, you have good luck.

24
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,450
Your Highness is the one who has good luck.

25
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:16,260
- Me?
- Because I came back alive, I will be a good hand for you.

26
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,570
Did it all go well with the Nanjing issue?

27
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,890
It went well. His Majesty the Emperor also liked Our Highness a lot.

28
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,970
Most people thought of His Highness as the Crown Prince

29
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,000
His Highness as the Crown Prince?

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,510
His Highness' appearance and way of speaking have always been good so they misunderstood.

31
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,560
Your Highness, about Moo Hyul.

32
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,490
Take him with you.

33
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,910
Why?

34
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,670
He doesn't dream of protecting this place. He's a crazy man.

35
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,910
I lost interest. Take him with you.

36
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:02,120
He's a bodyguard but his feelings are not directed to me so how can I keep him?

37
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,800
I will wish you the fortunes of war even from far away.

38
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,690
I will also wish you the fortunes of war.

39
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,050
Finally, Milbon has been formed.

40
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,500
Yes, Hyungnim.

41
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,360
Now that the Sadaebu's organization has been formed, the groundwork for system and talented people has been built.

42
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,620
Yes, yes.

43
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,050
Now no matter who becomes the King, they won't be able to change the country's system that easily.
(Shim Hyo Saeng - Crown Prince Lee Bang Seok's Father-in-law)

44
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,140
Now we have to put all our efforts into the military reform.

45
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,400
It's been delayed due to the movement of the capital, but we cannot push it back any further.

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,880
But you saw what happened during the first round of military reform.

47
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,010
The opposition from influential subjects who have soldiers is something to be reckoned with.

48
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,040
They consider having their soldiers taken away to be the same thing as dying.
(Jeong Do Gwang - Jeong Do Jeon's younger brother)

49
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,300
Yeon Hee, tell me about the information that came in today.

50
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,140
It's information that came from a Hwa Sa Dan spy I planted in Nanjing.

51
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,580
Prince Jeong An (Lee Bang Won) is on his way back.

52
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,180
Since he's already arrived at the Liaodong Fortress, he'll soon cross the border.

53
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,480
The military reform wasn't something that could be finished in a year or two anyway.

54
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,800
You've all worked hard so far, but all Milbon will have to strengthen their resolve.

55
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,440
Do you understand?

56
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,310
Yes.

57
00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:00,290
Milbon cannot ever be different than the following two things.

58
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,020
It's Minbon.

59
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,270
The people are the foundation and roots.

60
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,040
Minbon.

61
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,790
Boon Yi.

62
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,470
This is the one you're looking for, right?

63
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,540
Where did it come from?

64
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,750
A Banchon person saw it being hidden.

65
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,950
That's a relief.

66
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:34,340
Because of this, Nameless showed up again?

67
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,150
I don't know.

68
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,280
So those people still haven't given up.

69
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:50,240
If you want to protect Boon Yi's dream and the world she believes in, kill me now.

70
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,740
Then, Mom as well...

71
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,790
Mom is just another member of Nameless.

72
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,280
Bang Won is coming back.

73
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,470
When?

74
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,830
There was news that he arrived in Liaodong. He'll probably be here soon.

75
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,540
If I see him again, I bet I'd be happy and welcome him

76
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,090
but I'm a little scared.

77
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,850
Yes, I'm scared but

78
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,370
he's coming back alive.

79
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,320
Thank you.

80
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,010
What are you saying all of a sudden?

81
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,270
If it weren't for you who always believed in me and pressed matters

82
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,830
I probably wouldn't have gotten here. Thank you.

83
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,990
So I have a new dream.

84
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,840
What is it?

85
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,270
It's for you to not be involved in this work to find your life, like Boon Yi.

86
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,240
I don't like you sacrificing your whole life to this work.

87
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,190
I am also aware of Bang Ji's gazes toward you.

88
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,450
Right. Have you caught that person?

89
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,140
Yes.

90
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,630
That person is Nameless.

91
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,750
Nameless has reappeared.

92
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,220
You and Yeon Hee are Nameless' targets

93
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,130
so you must not go around without my protection.

94
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,910
Yes, Bon Won. You must have Bang Ji with you from here on.

95
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:47,440
Prince Jeong An is coming back and Nameless also resurfaced.

96
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,720
It's something that's already failed in Gaegyeong.

97
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,090
Yes. Are you saying you are going to do battle formation training again when it already failed in Gaegyeong?

98
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,360
We have failed so we have to do it again.

99
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,570
The military of one country has different signals, drums and horns, flags, and knowledge.

100
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,010
Does that make sense?

101
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,570
But if we do a large scale reformation in this type of current situation--

102
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,560
Yes!

103
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,370
The public sentiment will worsen due to anxiety about war.

104
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,330
It's not anxiety about war. It's preparing for it.

105
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,150
Right now, each soldier uses different formations and terminology.

106
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,120
If the military of a country cannot be standardized,

107
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,440
how can we establish a centralized system and strengthen national military power?

108
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,840
But why is Ga Byeol Cho called as such?
(Ga Byeol Cho - Lee Seong Gye's private army)

109
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,490
If His Highness is not leading it, then it won't be Ga Byeol Cho.

110
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,030
The only one who fully knows the advantages of that army is His Highness.

111
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,070
That is why Goryeo collapsed.

112
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,630
The Japanese pirates were becoming powerful on all sides, but there was no unified command system.

113
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,380
That is right.

114
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,150
Therefore, the military reform has to be achieved no matter what.

115
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,440
But!

116
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,450
Everyone, stop.

117
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,460
Bring it in!

118
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,230
Sam Bong, come closer.

119
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,390
Yes, Your Highness.

120
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:04,150
Sam Bong's thoughts and my thoughts are the same.

121
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,560
Since we cleansed away worn out spirits

122
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,770
and founded a new country,

123
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,950
all subjects

124
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,330
think of Sam Bong's orders as my own

125
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,230
and cooperate

126
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,290
with the training of the army.

127
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,560
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Highness!

128
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,950
Thank you for supporting the military reform.

129
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,190
It's something that has to be done.

130
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,790
But you must not have ulterior motives.

131
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,190
What do you mean?

132
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,550
I have seen a lot of politicians start to harbor ulterior motives

133
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:29,350
after getting a hold of military power.

134
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,830
Of course, something like that won't happen to you, right?

135
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,870
First, we'll hold a ceremony for the flag.

136
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,930
-Then...
- Right.

137
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,410
We'll discard the different military flags used by each army.

138
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,030
It's time to use the new Joseon's military flag.

139
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,250
Yes. I'll make preparations.

140
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,030
You must make sure no military officials or commanders are absent.

141
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,130
Do you understand?

142
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,230
- Yes.
- Yes.

143
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,130
See me for a bit.

144
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,160
At the same time we proceed with the military flag ceremony,

145
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,610
make preparations to arrest the military officials right away.

146
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,750
Pardon? What are you saying?

147
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,590
We are going to burn all the old flags, so put them over here.

148
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,210
The preparations are complete.

149
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,170
I understand.

150
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,340
The generals and commanders including Lee Moo, Minister of State Affairs, and Lee Soo Won, Great General,

151
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,780
did not attend.

152
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,680
How can they do this?

153
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,680
General Lee Ji Ran and the princes didn't come.

154
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
We are going to proceed with the flag ceremony.

155
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,510
My Lord.

156
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,320
Light the fire.

157
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,680
Yes.

158
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,190
The old military system used by the previous dynasty of Goryeo

159
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,890
will burn and disappear with these flags.

160
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,890
From now on, we will give impetus to the new military reform.

161
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,110
- Everything has been prepared, right?
- Yes, my Lord.

162
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,100
- Then, start it.
- Yes.

163
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,710
What are you doing?

164
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,960
The people under Your Highness's command, Chun Oh Jang,

165
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,470
Park Do Won, Lee Chan Sang and Jeong Choon Soo

166
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,910
are to be arrested for disobeying a military command

167
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,170
per the order of Chief Commander of Three Armies Jeong Do Jeon.

168
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,370
What?

169
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,320
You rascals. Do you think you'll be left unharmed after doing this?

170
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,620
Your Highness has also disobeyed the military command.

171
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,980
- What?
- What are you doing?

172
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,420
- Arrest them!
- Yes!

173
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,980
Does this make sense? All our guys were taken.

174
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,620
I told you to keep quiet and sit down.

175
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,880
Do you think I feel at ease?

176
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,680
My guys were all taken.

177
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,850
Isn't Father being too much?

178
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,910
What is the Ga Byeol Cho? Aren't they our soldiers?

179
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,150
How can he get rid of the soldiers?

180
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,710
He did it because he rose to the throne using private soldiers

181
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,980
Don't you know that?

182
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,780
Sook Jeong Gate

183
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,620
This is not a dream, right?

184
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,460
We didn't know how long it would take, when we left,

185
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,680
but we came back faster than we expected.

186
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,110
Sook Jeong Gate

187
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,620
Husband.

188
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,200
Wife, have you been well all this time?

189
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,930
Have you been well?

190
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,710
Have you been healthy, Father-in-law?

191
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:48,050
We are nothing to worry about. I'm worried about you who left for a faraway place.

192
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,980
But...

193
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,050
I'm sorry that I have to relay such a news as soon as you returned.

194
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,590
Did something happen?

195
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,140
Let's go.

196
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:36,190
You really came back alive.

197
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:56,370
His Highness has given me authority over this country's military power.

198
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,110
But the founding contributors, who should be the role models,

199
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,310
have disobeyed His Majesty's command and military command.

200
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,390
Do you not know shame?

201
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,640
General Jo!

202
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,970
Your Highness.

203
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,780
Your Highness, have you been well?

204
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,010
Congratulations for coming back alive.

205
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,740
Yes.

206
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,110
You're busy like always.

207
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,770
General Jo, look at you.

208
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,510
Are you in a lot of pain?

209
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,070
My body is okay

210
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,450
but my heart aches.

211
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,340
The Ming Emperor listened to His Highness's explanation

212
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,690
and said to resolve the misunderstandings

213
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:27,040
and release the restriction against envoy passage.

214
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,310
It's this.

215
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,030
I'm proud.

216
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,800
Prince Jeong An has really accomplished a big thing diplomatically.

217
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Yes.

218
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,380
You're being very generous, Your Highness.

219
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,790
It was done by the whole envoy group that went, so it's only a small result.

220
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,740
Prince Jeong An, you are being too humble.

221
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,790
That's right, Your Highness.

222
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:08,530
Because of Prince Jeong An's accomplishment, a foreign affairs problem has been solved.

223
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,430
Noonim!

224
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,190
Moo Hyul!

225
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,690
Aigoo! Moo Hyul!

226
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,660
Aigoo, Moo Hyul. Moo Hyul!

227
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,990
Grandmother, accept my bow.

228
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,580
Aigoo!

229
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:56,880
Are you really Moo Hyul? Our Moo Hyul?

230
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,400
Our Noonim must not have missed me.

231
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,450
I missed you.

232
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,690
Aigoo, Moo Hyul. Have you been eating? Are you okay?

233
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,360
You're not hurt anywhere?

234
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,580
On top of being okay,

235
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,010
he has become better. His shoulders and legs are strong.

236
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,690
Nothing bad happened, right?

237
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,890
Who do you think your grandmother is? Nothing's wrong.

238
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,720
I even settled here and took control of things.

239
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,780
It's a relief that you're looking good.

240
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,810
Aigoo. Oh my goodness.

241
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,380
Aigoo, my goodness.

242
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,920
Moo Hyul.

243
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,410
Military reform...

244
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:50,540
Yes. That could lead to dissolving the private army.

245
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:56,530
If that happens, it will really lead to something big that we can't be certain of.

246
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,110
So I've secretly hidden weapons and equipment.

247
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,720
Where?

248
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,090
In Banchon.

249
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,140
Banchon? Why in Banchon?

250
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:14,120
There's no place as safe as Banchon. The royal army can't go in and search.

251
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:23,260
Myo Sang said she wanted a tavern so I prepared it and used the house beside it as an underground storage.

252
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,480
Lord Jo Young Gyu is secretly managing it.

253
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,750
Banchon.

254
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,180
What are you always so earnestly writing?

255
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,720
I hope that this will never be used.

256
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,590
But why?

257
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:59,940
After coming here, I think this place is really dangerous.

258
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:09,260
Because the royal army can't go in without royal command, the government officials and scholars have their secret meetings here.

259
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:15,520
And people like us unwillingly hear this and that while doing their chores.

260
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,200
You said to forget all of those but why are you writing it all down?

261
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,980
In preparation, just in case. It can be our strength.

262
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:34,390
We left the dangerous work and came to Banchon because of the information left by Seon Dol.

263
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:42,080
Of course, I hope we won't have to use this.

264
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,370
Let's go now. Everyone's gathered, right?

265
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,450
At that time, Moo Hyul went to the king like that.

266
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,980
I don't know about you being a king or whatever. The sword will still go in.

267
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,410
So we were all going, "Oh my! What are we going to do?"

268
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,140
but then His Highness said, "Okay. Translate what Moo Hyul said."

269
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,060
Teacher Ho Jeong and I are thinking it shouldn't be translated.

270
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:14,490
No, it must not. But all of a sudden, the king came out.

271
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,080
"I understand."

272
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,050
He understood our language.

273
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:25,070
If you act up like that, I won't let you be.

274
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,400
But I really think that Orabi Moo Hyul has changed.

275
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,720
What?

276
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,270
Look! Look! Even his way of speaking is different. Same goes for his attitude.

277
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:39,750
That's right. Everyone changes when they age. They mature.

278
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,580
Of course, there are exceptions.

279
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,210
No one's listening.

280
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,810
You look good. I think you also became more dependable.

281
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,090
Is that so?

282
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,740
Hey.

283
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,430
I really can't get used to it.

284
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,300
Brother, I think we have to adapt fast.

285
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,380
I don't think he's acting all serious just for show.

286
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,080
I'll bring more food to eat.

287
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,150
Oh. Bring another bottle of liquor.

288
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,600
Yes.

289
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,550
It's here. Come in.

290
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,700
If you go in here, there will be another storage.

291
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,420
It's here.

292
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:08,510
Wow! How did you move all of this? Weapons can't be taken into Banchon.

293
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:15,150
During the time the capital was being moved and Banchon was being reestablished, I put everything here without anyone knowing.

294
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,460
Makes sense. There's no other place is as safe as Banchon.

295
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,250
- Does Boon Yi know?
- She doesn't.

296
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:28,740
If we tell her, Banchon will end and Boon Yi will be in danger.

297
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,960
This will be useful but if things go wrong,

298
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,350
we will also meet our end.

299
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,330
I heard you're doing well.

300
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,850
It was a hard-earned opportunity.

301
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,630
I am really happy that you're back.

302
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:20,080
Happy? I bet you're thinking that something bothersome has appeared.

303
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,880
I'm not, Your Highness.

304
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,760
Okay.

305
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,070
Here.

306
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,790
It was made by a famous person in Nanjing.

307
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,540
Thank you.

308
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:12,290
♫ I recognized you a few times
Thanks to you ♫

309
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,140
Give it here.
♫ I am alive ♫

310
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,550
♫ I restlessly follow your voice ♫

311
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:27,590
♫ Even if I push you a thousand times, I go to you ♫

312
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:34,780
♫ I am shining in your eyes ♫

313
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,640
I heard Banchon is strictly neutral.

314
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,450
Yes.

315
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:50,140
Neutrality. If you want to protect that, you know that you need power, right?

316
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,660
If you don't have power, you will suffer from both sides.

317
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:06,820
If you die doing that, neither side will even take care of your remains.

318
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,340
You know that, right?

319
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,330
I will keep it in mind.

320
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,920
I'm probably mistaken. There's no way she'd be here.

321
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:31,110
Master passed out from being drunk.

322
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:40,440
He's inside snoring. He's always said he doesn't get drunk...

323
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,010
What will happen to us now?

324
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,100
How would I know?

325
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,360
So have you bet everything on Prince Jeong An?

326
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,390
What about you?

327
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,080
Why do you want to protect Prince Jeong An?

328
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:13,100
There's no why. Small connections built up and made a road.

329
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,930
You just follow that road.

330
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,250
Lee Bang Ji

331
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,590
Someday,

332
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,890
will we end up fighting each other too?

333
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,350
A warrior I met in Liaodong said this.

334
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:45,120
A person who lives with a sword is different than a person who lives with an ink brush.

335
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,790
The person who lives with a sword shouldn't try to see more than two moves into the future.

336
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:57,960
Just one move into the future. You only have to see one move into the future.

337
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,650
That's why I'm going to do that.

338
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,830
I will just look at what's in front of me right now.

339
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,900
But you never could see more than two moves into the future.

340
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,900
Bastard.

341
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,180
I was trying to set the mood after all this time.

342
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,930
Hey.

343
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,180
Did I really change that much?

344
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,780
I missed you.

345
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,390
Good.

346
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,500
Translator Ha Ryun, accept your punishment!

347
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,270
Punishment? What crime did I commit?

348
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:08,720
You went to Ming's country and disturbed the nation's foundation and brought down the King's status.

349
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,100
When did I disturb the nation's foundation?

350
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,040
This person is doing it again.

351
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,810
I already got hit at the investigation office so what now? Want to hit me some more?

352
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:30,350
Did you forget to hit me somewhere yesterday or something?

353
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,470
We have no business with you.

354
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,200
Then, is it me?

355
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,310
What about him?

356
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,280
Receive the royal command to arrest the envoy group.

357
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,500
What are you doing? Arrest him!

358
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,620
Let's go.

359
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,080
Your Highness!

360
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,500
All of the people who were part of the envoy have been transferred to the Investigation Bureau.

361
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,090
Transferred? Why?

362
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:14,160
I don't know what's going on but I immediately came here in fear that something might happen to you too.

363
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,390
This was probably plotted by Lord Sam Bong again.

364
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,850
Just what happened? Why an arrest command all of a sudden?

365
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:28,480
Her Majesty met with Lord Lee Chan Soo from the envoy group.

366
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,830
Why Lord Lee Chan Soo?

367
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,010
Ha Ryun

368
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,000
Why do we have to be interrogated?

369
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,920
Shouldn't you at least tell us the reason?

370
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:59,620
Is it true that His Highness the prince called himself the Crown prince?c

371
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,450
I don't know anything.

372
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:10,360
I really don't know.

373
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,150
No... About that...

374
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,410
Speak the truth!

375
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,150
Punish them!

376
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,820
No! It's all a misunderstanding!

377
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:30,490
How dare Prince Jeong An say that he's the crown prince in Ming?

378
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,550
This is high treason.

379
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,100
Queen Shin Duk (Lee Seong Gye's second wife. Bang Beon and Bang Seok's mother)

380
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,730
Your Majesty, you have to arrest Prince Jeong An and question him.

381
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,520
But he just came back after achieving a great thing.

382
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,430
No matter how great the achievement, you can't just cover up high treason.

383
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,940
As a struggle for power, the Mings even send you a written order for appointment of personnel.

384
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,430
We don't know what kind of problems the Ming will make out of this when Prince Ui An rises to the throne in the future.

385
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,960
That is right.

386
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:12,340
If Prince Jeong An really lied about being the crown prince, something like this shouldn't happen.

387
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,630
Yes.

388
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:19,790
I will definitely investigate this and expose the truth.

389
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,710
Bon Won, we must not miss this chance.

390
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,310
He and I didn't even go to Nanjing.

391
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:32,520
I don't even know what happened in Nanjing.

392
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,980
It's true.

393
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,260
We didn't go to Nanjing. We were held at Liaodong.

394
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,360
Then,

395
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:51,780
didn't Lord Ha Ryun say something similar after coming back to Liaodong?

396
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,200
What are you doing? Rip him up.

397
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,940
W-Wait! Wait!

398
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:08,500
The Ming ambassadors were mistaken that Prince Jeong An was the crown prince.

399
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:14,300
He did say something like that in passing.

400
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,320
This person!

401
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,650
You are still going to act innocent?

402
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,340
Punish him.

403
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,640
Did you get a grasp of the situation?

404
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:42,010
From what they are saying, since Prince Jeong An has a lot of knowledge in Neo-Confucianism, the Ming ambassadors called him the crown prince first.

405
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:46,490
Prince Jeong An explained the truth to them, but they kept calling him the crown prince and treated him as such.

406
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,940
The Ming Emperor saw him personally twice.

407
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,400
How would we know whether he tried to explain the truth or lied about being the crown prince?

408
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,370
I will go out.

409
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,810
Bon Won, we must not miss it now.

410
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:11,330
Because of Prince Jeong An's diplomatic accomplishments with the Ming, the Sadaebu who are wanting to serve the Ming are being moved.

411
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:16,660
The more Prince Jeong An's name is brought up, the crown prince's status will waver.

412
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,360
That's right.

413
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,770
Why are you so down?

414
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:29,640
There are so many things to do but as soon as Prince Jeong An comes back, I have to have a political battle again.

415
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,170
It's exhausting.

416
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,710
Why do you only think of the political battle?

417
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,890
If Prince Jeong An really lied about being the crown prince, it's right that he should be punished.

418
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,840
And if that happens, a big obstacle towards military reformation will disappear.

419
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,850
Queen, are you okay?

420
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,120
Your Highness, when I die...

421
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,590
How can you say that?

422
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,990
What will happen to our crown prince?

423
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,830
Prince Jeong An makes me nervous.

424
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:09,510
Your Highness, please protect our crown prince.

425
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,520
I am here so why are you so worried?

426
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,480
Think of the crown prince in a country where we don't exist.

427
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,800
He's just a rabbit in front of the wolves.

428
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,270
I can't take this.

429
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,160
If I have to pass away, I will take Prince Jeong An with me.

430
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,270
Queen!

431
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:36,400
If you leave Prince Jeong An alone even after his traitorous thoughts have been revealed, what will happen to the crown prince's status?

432
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,450
Your Majesty, please understand me.

433
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,510
Prince Jeong An seems to be in a difficult situation.

434
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,260
I heard on my way here.

435
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,820
Sam Bong probably won't just let this go.

436
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,280
More than anything, Her Majesty's wrath is shooting towards the sky.

437
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,070
Without letting this chance go, it seems that they will surely eliminate Prince Jeong An.

438
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,710
This is something that we didn't expect,

439
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:11,610
but Sam Bong will be facing something unexpected soon.

440
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:16,940
Is it related to you coming back from Nanjing?

441
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:22,760
Yes. I met General So Ryun and asked him to help us with our work.

442
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,270
General So Ryun?

443
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:32,150
Even though the Ming ambassadors just misunderstood, such a terrible thing happened

444
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:37,290
and is spreading through out the town, so you can't just stay silent.

445
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,990
Then, what should we do?

446
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,880
Send Ha Ryun, who was responsible for the envoy group, to exile

447
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,180
and behead Gwon Taek Soo who spread this incident after returning to Hanyang.

448
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:55,930
Also, it is right for Prince Jeong An to stay in the countryside.

449
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:01,940
But Your Highness, Prince Jeong An solved a long time problem with Ming.

450
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,160
If you punish Prince Jeong An for that crime,

451
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,720
we might also get into trouble with the Ming again.

452
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,450
What are you saying Left Chief Minister?

453
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,820
Are you saying we should just turn a blind eye because we are afraid of angering the Ming?

454
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,830
You are people who are supposed to protect the crown prince.

455
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,990
How can you just let Prince Jeong An be?

456
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:32,110
Look here, Queen. We are looking at the possible options right now.

457
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:39,280
Have you ever thought about what will happen to the crown prince when both His Highness and I are not here anymore?

458
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,770
It seems that the job at Nanjing has ended well.

459
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,070
Yes. She has already arrived back in Hanyang.

460
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,550
What are you talking about?

461
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,010
We can't just stay still right now.

462
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,720
You should go to Her Majesty right this instant—

463
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,640
Wife. You are right. I shouldn't just stay still like this.

464
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,190
What are you saying?

465
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,020
Prince Jeong An just went into the palace with Lord Jo Young Gyu

466
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,750
and it seems like Lord Jo is hiding something like a weapon.

467
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,060
No. It can't be.

468
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,720
How can he go into the palace while hiding a weapon?

469
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,410
Your Majesty, there could be a Court worker who has been bribed by Prince Jeong Ahn.

470
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,260
So? Where did they go?

471
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,760
To Donggoong Jeon.
(Donggoong Jeon - place where the crown prince stays)

472
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,710
What?

473
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,750
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

474
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,890
Your Highness the Crown Prince! Please punish me!

475
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:21,560
Because I was incapable and immoral, such a disaster happened.

476
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,360
How can it not be a heavy crime?

477
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,620
The Ming ambassadors misunderstood and called me such terrible thing.

478
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:43,460
But foolishly, I thought that might help with the diplomatic matters.

479
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,640
So it is true that I was a little hesitant to correct them.

480
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,890
Your Highness, please punish me heavily!

481
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,510
Hyungnim, how can you do this? Please don't do this.
(Crown Prince: Lee Bang Seok)

482
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,360
No, Your Highness.

483
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,820
Please punish me.

484
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:19,030
I was the only one who did it so please forgive those people.

485
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:25,760
Your Highness, I will be loyal to you until the day I die.

486
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,580
Father!

487
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:04,790
Please forgive Prince Jeong An. He didn't do anything wrong.

488
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,370
Please also release Prince Jeong An's people.

489
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:24,000
Hyungnim, please stand up. Hurry.

490
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,150
Hurry and stand up, Hyungnim.

491
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,290
Stand up.

492
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,600
Crown Prince.

493
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:15,560
Did you lower yourself to the Crown Prince and pledge your loyalty to him?

494
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,930
Yes.

495
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:26,830
I am trying to repent my past sins and live quietly like you and father have wanted.

496
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:35,360
As in playing Baduk (Go/Weiqi), are you trying to plan an unexpected move after throwing away your stone and surrendering?

497
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,070
Then, it will not be baduk anymore.

498
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,690
What are you saying?

499
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,160
Are you saying that you'll see it until the end?

500
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,330
Didn't I tell you?

501
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:55,520
I will only be loyal to the crown prince from now on.

502
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,270
Bang Won.

503
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,890
Because you called me that,

504
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,910
I feel like crying.

505
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:12,630
Do you want to ascend the throne? Why?

506
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,740
Did you dream of a country different from what I was making?

507
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:27,430
Did you have different thoughts regarding the country, ideals and system that I have?

508
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:36,260
The fifth rule of the Five Rules of the King: the royal family must not participate in politics.

509
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:44,260
You were desperate and enraged because of it. But what are you going to do if you become the king?

510
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:51,050
Are you just going to let the royal family interfere with politics and practice their power?

511
00:49:53,630 --> 00:50:01,960
The system where officials are only chosen by civil exams and where they check each other and correct the king's faults.

512
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,960
Do you not think of doing that if you become the king?

513
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:15,610
Or unlike what I'm trying to do, are you not going to reform the military,

514
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:22,950
give up the centralized command system and, like in Goryeo, allow princes and important figures to have their own private armies?

515
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,150
None of this is true.

516
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:35,800
Even if you become the king, looking at your temperament,

517
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:39,670
you are going to try to take control of appointment of officials in each department,

518
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:47,830
and watch over them yourself. And like me, you'll say that it can't be helped because it's the early period of founding a country.

519
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,780
Only that much will be different.

520
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,860
Is it not?

521
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,580
Everything

522
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,670
is right, Teacher.

523
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:11,020
In the end, your ideals about the country are not different from mine.

524
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,730
Your self-interest, personal motive, personal reason, and personal dream

525
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,180
of doing it yourself,

526
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,760
that's all there is to it, isn't it?

527
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,740
Can it not work if it's my personal dream?

528
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,560
This is the great cause of the public, so

529
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,720
how can that work?

530
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,180
If it's the same, then I can do it.

531
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,180
Does it really have to be Bang Seok?

532
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,540
The paths have already turned awry, have they not?

533
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,150
Yes.

534
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:47,430
It's gone awry and is bent and broken.

535
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:53,030
So I will not care about the road

536
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:57,730
and just go in the direction of my dream.

537
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,760
You asked if I want a new country?

538
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,020
Do I have a different belief?

539
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,390
No. I don't.

540
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,250
Why do I have to have that?

541
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,610
Bang Won.

542
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,770
My strongest man

543
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,750
was you.

544
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,570
My dream

545
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,640
is to look after the beautiful country

546
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,730
that you will create.

547
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,710
So

548
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:46,550
I must have it.

549
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:55,470
You are really like Bidam.

550
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:59,230
You are quite briliant

551
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,930
and have the tenacity and cleverness to take hold of people,

552
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,630
and you have the sharp insight to look after the world.

553
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:09,210
But you can't control your mistaken desire,

554
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,910
so you create false causes.

555
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,850
Bidam was caught in his personal conspiracy

556
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:22,970
and you are helpless in your personal desire for power.

557
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:28,670
There's no helping it now.

558
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,640
One thing will be different

559
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,670
between Bidam and I.

560
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:53,170
Bidam was the loser.

561
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:57,410
That's right. Nobody can predict the future

562
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:03,210
but Bidam collapsed because of Kim Yushin's sword,

563
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,570
and he probably didn't know it until the day he died in front of Deokman,

564
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:12,190
that he was the loser.

565
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:27,210
No. The game is not over yet!

566
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:34,470
You haven't gotten my doksu yet.
(Doksu: a merciless and fatal move in baduk)

567
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:44,370
You can't do this.

568
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:48,230
Isn't it obvious that Prince Jeong An is lying?

569
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,720
Do you still believe him?

570
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,880
Prince Jeong An's tears

571
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,460
still make me shiver.

572
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,710
- Queen.
- Your Highness.

573
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:04,960
You must not just leave Prince Jeong An like this.

574
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,680
Queen! Queen!

575
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,800
Is there nobody there?

576
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,490
Gently.

577
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:18,670
Moo Hyul! Aigoo. Master Hong. Moo Hyul!

578
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:21,040
Are you okay? Did they release you?

579
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,690
Everyone was released but...

580
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,730
Moo Hyul, are you okay?

581
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:27,620
Hurry and lie down inside. I will call a doctor.

582
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,020
Grandmother, this is nothing.

583
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,150
No! Even if it looks okay now...

584
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:37,300
If you just let it all stack up, it will become a serious illness.

585
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,840
Go inside and I will call a doctor.

586
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,700
Gab Boon, hurry and take our Moo Hyul inside.

587
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,000
Noonim! It hurts so much that I can't speak.

588
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,960
Noonim, let's go togethere! Noonim!

589
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,340
Gab Boon.

590
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,730
Could there be... here in Banchon...

591
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:58,200
Eun Ho!

592
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,400
Myeong Ah!

593
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:12,790
Did you hide here again?

594
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,830
If you go in there just like that...

595
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,300
How could this be in Banchon?

596
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,060
Lady.

597
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:32,130
Warrior-nim, please pretend that you don't know.

598
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:37,490
I heard about the previous king.

599
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:42,110
I'm not even thinking of revenge.

600
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:49,030
Even in that cave, you didn't kill me.

601
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:55,470
So please pretend that you don't know this time as well.

602
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:01,430
Yes. I understand.

603
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:15,030
But

604
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,570
you have changed a lot.

605
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,990
Yesterday morning it passed the border.

606
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,700
It was faster than I expected.

607
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:43,910
"Now that Joseon is sending someone every traditional holiday,

608
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:48,770
"and sending greetings with a letter of worship, you seem to be courteous,

609
00:57:55,430 --> 00:58:00,770
"but the message is insincere and you have looked down upon me.

610
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,870
"So

611
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:27,890
"the envoys that you sent will be sent back.

612
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,800
"also, the writer, proofreader and

613
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,350
"the man responsible for it, Jeong Do Jeon--"

614
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,460
Jeong Do Jeon

615
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,460
Jeong Do Jeon

616
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:58,830
Hurry and read it. What are you doing?

617
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,610
Read it.

618
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:08,570
"Transfer all of them

619
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:15,090
"to Ming."

620
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,760
You still haven't

621
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,720
gotten my merciless and fatal move.

622
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:39,930
Could be be that your merciless move is

623
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:45,510
related to this? Lee Bang Won.

624
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,490
My merciless and fatal move,

625
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,170
take it.

626
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,810
Teacher.

627
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,990
Six Flying Dragons

628
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:39,410
Please send Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon.

629
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:42,640
Your Highness, please send Sam Bong to Ming.

630
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,410
It will be hard for Lord Sam Bong to endure.

631
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:49,770
I, Jeong Do Jeon, will resign from all my government posts.

632
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:54,400
Please protect the crown prince. It's my last request.

633
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,690
What about Sam Bong's whereabouts?

634
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:58,840
- Not yet.
- Where are you and what are you doing?

635
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,530
Everything is set. This is the beginning.

636
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,700
I still haven't made my merciless move yet.
