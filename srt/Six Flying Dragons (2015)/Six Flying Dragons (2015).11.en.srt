00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,000
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,240
The person I'm going to serve as my lord

3
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,220
is linked to him by blood, that Pok Doo that's hard to control.

4
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,330
According to military strategies,

5
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,630
if you want the commander to collapse, then aim for his horse first.

6
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:09,960
Teacher Sam Bong, my place in that cave,

7
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,670
please take care of it well. I will surely come back to it.

8
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,710
The An Byeon Chaek wasn't sent by Lee Seong Gye.

9
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,250
His son, Lee Bang Won, stamped it with his father's seal and forged it.

10
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,140
Lee Bang Won?

11
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,500
So, things have become more difficult.

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,670
Now, Lee In Gyeom will counterattack.

13
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,300
Lee Bang Won, Lee Bang Won!

14
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,640
Did you suddenly think of a good idea?

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,600
Have you thought about the thing that is the hardest to understand in this whole palace?

16
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,640
How is it that Lee Seong Gye's An Byeon Book

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,500
was favored by Hong In Bang and Gil Tae M? It was this.

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
You've pinpointed it.

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:05,320
Now, I will make people understand that.

20
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,270
What is that?

21
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,780
I-It's nothing.

22
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,740
Nothing? You're face suddenly went pale. What is it that you're being like that?

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,860
Through the An Byeon Book, the tax revenue of the now secured Northeastern side

24
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,910
will be divided between Hong In Bang, Gil Tae Mi, and Lee Seong Gye

25
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,990
in a secret agreement?

26
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,320
It's only an anonymous letter. There isn't any basis for it, either.

27
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,550
No, no. It couldn't be.

28
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,560
Lee Seong Gye is not that kind of person. Certainly.

29
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,120
Pan Yi Bu Sa,
(Pan Yi Bu Sa: a government post name)

30
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,520
I need to ask for a favor.

31
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,170
Yes. Please speak.

32
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,950
General!

33
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,670
I... have something I want to consult with you about.

34
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,650
What is it, Pan Yi Bu Sa?

35
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,690
Have you heard about the stories going around now?

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,430
Are you talking about the anonymous letter that nobody can confirm?
(Choi Yeong)

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,420
You have to read this.

38
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:06,150
I want to tell you that a series of letters like this shouldn't be overlooked.

39
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,880
Isn't it strange?

40
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,580
If the contents of that letter aren't true, then just why

41
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,570
would you, Gil Tae Mi and Hong In Bang, vote in favor of the An Byeon Book when you have a really bad relationship with Lee Seong Gye?

42
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,170
That's definitely because,after stabilizing the Northeastern side (Woo Hak Joo),

43
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,230
there will be a strong defense.

44
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,390
Ah, so that was it.

45
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,540
For the stability of the Northeastern side?

46
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,860
But during the last Do Dang meeting, what did you say?

47
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,890
"Is Lee Seong Gye the only one protecting the country?" Didn't you say that?

48
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,600
That is...

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,550
Look here. Seung Rok Dae Bu!
(Seung Rok Dae Bu: a government official during the Goryeo era)

50
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,450
Kwa Jeuk...Mul Tan Gae?
(Kwa Jeuk Mul Tan Gae: Not hesitating to immediately fix what you did wrong)
(Gil Tae Mi)

51
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,050
There's a saying like this!

52
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,670
According to Jung Yong! Jung Yong!
(Jung Yong: Doctrine of the Mean, one of the 4 Books of Confucian texts)

53
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,160
Non Eo.
(Non Eo: Analects, one of the four books)

54
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,450
Non Eo. According to Non Eo!

55
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,290
It means that a superior person should not be afraid of fixing what he did wrong.

56
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,800
But right now, I am showing you my image as a superior person.

57
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
What is wrong with that?

58
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,810
Ah, seriously.

59
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,890
Did I really say that?

60
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,770
Anyway, there was an uproar at the royal palace because of this so we need to investigate.

61
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,890
Investigate? What investigation do you need?

62
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,360
What?
(He spoke informally to someone older than him.)

63
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,230
What? You bastard!

64
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,240
-Bastard? Bastard?
-What, you bastard?

65
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,190
- I ought to just--
- Bastard? Why?

66
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,730
Hey, you bastard!

67
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,810
Stop!

68
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,630
Prime Minister.

69
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,440
Me?

70
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,970
A few days ago, your son got nominated as a Gam Chang Gwan in the Northeastern region.

71
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,560
Gam Chang Gwan: an official rank given to someone who inspects tax and warehouses

72
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,060
What are you saying? It's something that I didn't know.

73
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,350
There's a written certification like this and you're still denying it?

74
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,550
Go Gong Chong Rang Gil Yoo has been appointed as a Northeastern region tax and warehouse inspector.

75
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,570
If it's the Gam Chang Gwan, then isn't that the one who inspects taxes in the Northeaster region?

76
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,870
How could this be!

77
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,510
Even with this, are you still going to say that you didn't have a secret agreement with Lee Seong Gye?

78
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,080
Then, it is true...

79
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,300
- It's true?
- How could this be?

80
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,330
It's that position too.

81
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,490
Okay, okay, okay.

82
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,060
Although it is anonymous,

83
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,650
since some of the Do Dang members have spoken up about their will,

84
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm thinking of going through with the investigation...
(Lee In Gyeom)

85
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,240
My Lord!

86
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,070
If Gil Yoo has really been appointed as a tax inspector,

87
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,320
this series of circumstances is enough to be suspicious.

88
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,580
Do you really think that General Lee Seong Gye is that kind of person...
(Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo)

89
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,890
No. Do you think he's someone who would do that?

90
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,400
Lord.

91
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,200
Didn't we already witness the unpleasant crumbling of heroes many times?

92
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,520
It's just a groundless rumor.

93
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:58,900
It's a rumor, just a rumor. But in that rumor, General Lee Seong Gye

94
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,820
will get the most fatal blow.

95
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,440
It is indeed fatal. Integrity...

96
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,710
He is attacking Lee Seong Gye's biggest weapon, his integrity.

97
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,550
Yes. As is expected of Lee In Gyeom.

98
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,140
I need to go to Ham Joo. I need to meet General Lee Seong Gye.

99
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:21,310
A report came in saying that Lee Shin Jeok is coming to Gaegyeong by Lee Seong Gye's order.

100
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,110
Please decide after meeting him first. He'll be here soon.

101
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,310
Just what are you saying?

102
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,340
It's as you heard, Hyung-nim.

103
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,440
So, at a time like this when the war with Ho Bal Do has started, you came here to Gaegyeong?
(Lee Bang Woo)

104
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,210
Yes. I already relayed the message and was about to go back immediately, but you were scolding me.
(Lee Bang Gwa)

105
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:52,130
Then immediately withdraw the An Byeon Book, give the documents to the Do Dang, and go back to Ham Joo.

106
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,250
But Hyung-nim.

107
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,760
Is withdrawing the An Byeon Book right, or...

108
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,250
Whether it is right or wrong, Father has already decided. We can just follow him.

109
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,710
He is our father but he is also the leader of the Ga Byeol Cho.
(Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army.)

110
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,680
It's what we have to do according to our military discipline.

111
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,630
How could you also be played by Bang Won's lies?

112
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,460
Where are you going? Where are you going that you're packing you're stuff?

113
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,480
Ham Joo.

114
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,830
Ham Joo?

115
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,750
To take responsibility.

116
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,160
You said that being an adult is taking responsibility.
(Lee Bang Won)

117
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,350
Withdrawing the An Byeon Book?

118
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,330
Lee Bang Gwa has the documents to withdraw the An Byeon Book and he has arrived in Gaegyeong.

119
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,740
Where is Lee Bang Won's house? Lead me there.

120
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,410
What are you going to do?

121
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,350
Gyo Ui Lee is going to Lee Bang Won's house, right? First, we have to stop him.

122
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,290
In the end, there's a sequence to giving up. It has to be that way to allow the next move.

123
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,810
Hey, I'm fine with you going wherever, but you have to tell me where ajussi is before you go.

124
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,690
Young Master!

125
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,850
Did you come from Ham Joo?

126
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,010
Ah, there's a big problem. The general told me to catch you immediately.
(Jo Young Gyu)

127
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,950
Like your legs will get clubbed... Like, really! Well, it's that kind of atmosphere.

128
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,210
I'm already on my way to Ham Joo anyway.

129
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,580
I'll go and settle things.

130
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,550
Aigoo, I should've stopped him back then. What kind of hard work is this when the An Byeon Book will be withdrawn anyway...

131
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,540
What did you say?

132
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,500
Young Master Bang Gwa came with me.

133
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,380
He has the documents to withdraw the An Byeon Book.

134
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,230
You bastard!

135
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,390
No matter how young and foolish you are, how could you behave in such an immature manner?

136
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,550
Everything is my fault. Still, how could you withdraw the An Byeon Book?

137
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,660
That will not do.

138
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,000
I will go to Ham Joo and receive my punishment, whatever it is.

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,890
You must not withdraw it, Hyung-nim!

140
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,860
This bastard still cannot clear his head.

141
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,100
There's an execution in this mountain-like work.

142
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,350
Did you see the Ga Byeol Cho and Northeastern region that you rattled?

143
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,450
Go to Ham Joo and accept your punishment. You will be on detention.

144
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,880
Hurry and go to the Do Dang. Hand over the documents of withdrawal to them.

145
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,480
Yes, Hyung-nim.

146
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,310
Hyung-nim! You must not do this.

147
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,690
Please hold on to it for just a bit. I will meet Father and I can persuade him.

148
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,860
Please wait.

149
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,760
Bang Won, you bastard!

150
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,020
What are the police doing here?

151
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,710
Is General Lee Seong Gye's fifth son, Lee Bang Won here?

152
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,310
He is but why are you looking for him?

153
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:13,670
He is being charged of having illegal dealings with Head of Seonggyungwan, Hong In Bang, to get the An Byeon Book approved.

154
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,560
Arrest him!

155
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,300
Yes!

156
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,550
It is you, Hap Ha.

157
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,840
In thinking of your next step regarding Head of Seonggyungwan, Hong In Bang,
(Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan Owner)

158
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,840
you must be busy.

159
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,640
That's why you called on to your Jang Goon.
(Jang Goon: General, a chess piece)

160
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,620
I...

161
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,530
I didn't call my General for Hong In Bang.

162
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,410
What?

163
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,180
Then for whom?

164
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,610
I think Hong In Bang is just being controlled.

165
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,520
Then, is Lee Seong Gye standing behind Hong In Bang?

166
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,900
No.

167
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,860
A glimmering shadow behind Lee Seong Gye and Hong In Bang...

168
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,920
I've sent the General to that shadow.

169
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,590
Even if you meet with Gyo Ui Lee, how will you block the documents?

170
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,340
Isn't that Bang Won?

171
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,880
The shadow behind Lee Seong Gye.

172
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,450
Can you see and receive it this time?

173
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,810
We can gain four things from just this one happening.

174
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,680
First, if the arrested Bang Won, in the middle of being tortured,

175
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,650
has something bad happen to him,

176
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,840
the forging of the An Byeon Book documents will be buried.

177
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,410
What?

178
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,510
Second, if that happens, Lee Seong Gye and Lee In Gyeom

179
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,020
will have already crossed a river of no return.

180
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:54,190
Lee Seong Gye will be standing in the position you wanted him in.

181
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,510
Then, third. The thing you are worried about, Bon Won,

182
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,390
that serious Pok Doo,

183
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,780
will be naturally solved.

184
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,070
So are you just going to watch over this situation?
(Lee Shin Jeok)

185
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,050
Are you just going to let a person without sin be tortured to death?

186
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,100
Sin and death have never been related to begin with.

187
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,490
You don't die because you have sinned

188
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,260
and you don't live because you have no sins.

189
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,090
In this country, has any death

190
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,810
been related to sin?

191
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,130
What? This wench is wholeheartedly wishing ill upon others!

192
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,740
We are all gathered to change that kind of country!

193
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,210
Elder Bon Won, this must never happen.

194
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,460
Let's say that Bang Won did something wrong.

195
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,480
Even so, you can't sacrifice him to this kind of conspiracy.

196
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,940
I only follow Elder Bon Won's will.

197
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,140
I will follow your decision.

198
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,490
Bug. A bug.

199
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,310
A bug has finally started crawling in my mind.

200
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,540
No, it was from the moment I saw Lee Bang Won arrested.

201
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,990
What Yeon Hee said was right.

202
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,990
If I let Lee Bang Won be tortured to death,

203
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,000
the many things that came to be might get easily and swiftly be resolved.

204
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,500
I can just turn my head away for a bit.

205
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,430
In that smooth-sailing process,

206
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,560
how many people need to die?

207
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,530
That's a process we need to go through.

208
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,220
Every great cause is followed by hardship.

209
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,640
Taking responsibility.

210
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,530
I've already prepared myself for that.

211
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,090
It's a bug. A bug.
(Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon)

212
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,650
But...

213
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,460
We have to save Young Master Bang Won!

214
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,920
We need to do something, whatever it is.

215
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,220
Hurry and send the documents to cancel everything, okay?

216
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,810
Give them to me.

217
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,830
What are you going to do?

218
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,170
I will not send this.

219
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,610
- Hyung-nim!
- This is how Lee In Gyeom

220
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,140
is proclaiming war against our family.

221
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,300
The Ga Byeol Cho doesn't avoid war!

222
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,370
Hyung-nim.

223
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,690
You two command the Gaegyeong Ga Byeol Cho

224
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,010
and be ready and in position.

225
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,500
- Yes, Hyung-nim.
- Yes!

226
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,750
I will go to Ham Joo, report the situation to Father,

227
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,990
and receive a strict military command.

228
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,120
He is being charged with illegal dealing with Head of Seonggyungwan Hong In Bang to get the An Byeon Book approved.

229
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,280
Hong In Bang...

230
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,730
You met?

231
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,580
Yes. That night when I got attacked,

232
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,270
it is true that Lee Bang Won came to me.
(Hong In Bang)

233
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,450
We didn't have a secret agreement but there's also no evidence of that.

234
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,620
What's the use of evidence?

235
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,690
If Lee Bang Won confesses, then that would be the evidence.

236
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,720
How can such a young kid endure police torture?

237
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,320
Let's kill him.

238
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,230
Lee Bang Won...

239
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,110
If he dies,

240
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,940
we might be suspected, but

241
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,310
so what?

242
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,090
Let's kill him!

243
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,340
Elder Hong In Bang!

244
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,910
Elder Hong In Bang!

245
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,790
It's an important matter. You have to see me, Elder!

246
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,610
Father!

247
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,370
Un Nyeon, no!

248
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,110
You!

249
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,520
Crazy wench, you came here on your own!

250
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,790
After meeting with the Elder, what will you do?

251
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,660
Let go of this! Let go!

252
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,820
Follow me.

253
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,050
- Follow me.
- What's going on?

254
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,390
Elder, this wench is the mastermind of the Western district village.

255
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,390
She came here on her own.

256
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,810
Transfer her to the government office.

257
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,220
Young Master Lee Bang Won...

258
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,660
I was sent here by Young Master Lee Bang Won.

259
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,280
What happened on that night... I knew about it.
(Boon Yi)

260
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,330
Bang Won sent you?

261
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,080
Actually, I wasn't sent by Young Master Bang Won.

262
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,830
I came here to meet you.

263
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,110
That night, there wasn't a secret agreement,

264
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,840
but I know that you said that you will join hands with General Lee Seong Gye.

265
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,920
So?

266
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,400
Then, you should have prevented it!

267
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,400
That's...

268
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,760
what Young Master Bang Won would probably think.

269
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,040
I came instead of him.

270
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,020
If something bad happens to Young Master Bang Won while he's being tortured,

271
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,910
can't you to predict what General Lee Seong Gye will do?

272
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,990
The time is limited!

273
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,070
You have to save Young Master Bang Won fast!

274
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,490
There's no reason for Lee In Gyeom to kill Bang Won.

275
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,950
He only wants to hear Lee Seong Gye's confession.

276
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,390
Even so,

277
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,080
in the investigation office,

278
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,460
we don't know what might happen in the middle of torture.

279
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,540
How can you be calm like this?

280
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,200
You're passionate.

281
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,780
What's you're relationship with Bang Won?

282
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,320
What relationship do you have with him that you, a girl from the Western district,

283
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,060
would come running here on your own when you could be caught and killed?

284
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,750
So what is your reason for passionately asking that Bang Won be saved?

285
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,480
Could it be

286
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,490
that you and Bang Won...

287
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,700
He bought shoes

288
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,370
- for me.
- What?

289
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,340
A certain nobleman kills us

290
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,960
but Young Master bought me shoes.

291
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,730
I will do something

292
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,550
so meet Bang Won and tell him this.

293
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,330
You know, I

294
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,430
am someone who renounced my belief as soon as I entered the investigation office.

295
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,370
But that bastard, Bang Won,

296
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,190
always said that is different than I am.

297
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,920
But he must never mention my name

298
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,190
or his father's name in a confession.

299
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,070
If our names come up,

300
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,880
everything that you are worried about will happen.

301
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,840
Is it Ap Seul?

302
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,110
Ap Seul: a method of torture that presses the knees using a heavy object.

303
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,930
Is it fire torture? Or torturing by hitting my body?

304
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,880
If they hit me, the bones in my knees will be broken

305
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,390
and I won't be able to walk again.

306
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,340
If I get out of here alive,

307
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,940
how will I look?

308
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,650
You are here because of the charge against you saying you had illegal dealings with Hong In Bang.

309
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,590
The torture will continue until you confess to that.

310
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,980
There was no secret agreement of any kind.

311
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,470
Let's start.

312
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,930
Yes.

313
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,120
Before flying,

314
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,500
there's no way of knowing if I am a chicken or a bird

315
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,760
Lee Bang Won, you punk.

316
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,600
This time, you have to withstand it! Endure!

317
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,910
I am not a chicken.

318
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,830
You have to come out fast!

319
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,220
Yes, I understand.

320
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,470
This way.

321
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Hey, Lee Bang Won!

322
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,530
Hey!

323
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,200
How did you...

324
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,060
Are you okay?

325
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,660
Do you think I'm okay?

326
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,410
How did you get in here?

327
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,700
First, eat.

328
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,550
How did you get in?

329
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,760
Hong In Bang sent me in.

330
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,360
You met Hong In Bang?

331
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,800
He asked me to give you a message.

332
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,290
Say it.

333
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,360
He said that as soon as he went to the investigation office he renounced his belief,

334
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,820
but you always said that you are different from him.

335
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,620
So?

336
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,710
"So,

337
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,370
never mention

338
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,110
my name or you father's name."

339
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,160
Of course not.

340
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,780
I shouldn't become like Hong In Bang.

341
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,470
That's right, Hang in there.

342
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,390
Enduring it will be the wisest thing to do.

343
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,250
Ajussi will quickly make a way.

344
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,500
Teacher Sam Bong

345
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,010
wishes

346
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,060
me to die.

347
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,820
What nonsense are you saying?

348
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,970
If I die,

349
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,050
the forging of the An Byeon Book will be naturally covered up.

350
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:44,470
Then, Father will be Lee In Gyeom's opponent.

351
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,010
A big nuisance like me will also be taken care of.

352
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,690
Impossible.

353
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,370
You are being like that because ajussi scolded you.

354
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,170
Ajussi will save you and resolve this situation and everything else.

355
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,580
He will find a way to do that.

356
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,610
Will he really do that?

357
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,490
Will that person really do that?

358
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,150
You have to hurry and come out now.

359
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,040
Yes, I understand.

360
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,280
I'm going.

361
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,450
Don't lose hope.

362
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,480
Also, smile.

363
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,280
You should smile first.

364
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,900
Do you know why I like you?

365
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,150
Because I don't think you will die.

366
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,650
I don't think you will leave me.

367
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,510
You like me?

368
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,630
I won't die.

369
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,900
I will definitely live and get out.

370
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,970
Just wait.

371
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,260
Don't die.

372
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,230
I don't want to see someone leaving me again.

373
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,000
I won't even think about it.

374
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,290
Brother and mother.

375
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,560
I forgot about them.

376
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,600
Don't you forget.

377
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,160
Did you meet Bang Won?

378
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,940
- Yes.
- What did he say?

379
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,820
Where is ajussi?

380
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,380
I have to see him. I have something to say.

381
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,430
You're not a contact anymore.

382
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,130
How can a member act like that without permission?

383
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,830
Please let me see him for the last time.

384
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,240
- Grandmother!
- Aigoo, this guy!

385
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,000
Moo Hyul! Hey! What happened?
(Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's Grandmother)

386
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,840
Have you already caught the Viper?

387
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,680
I caught a better one!

388
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,400
A better one?

389
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,180
Could it be that you

390
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,890
caught Gil Tae Mi?

391
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,440
No.

392
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,730
(Moo Hyul)

393
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,360
I got General Lee Seong Gye.

394
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,220
You crazy bastard. This rotten bastard!

395
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,810
Hey, you bastard. Goryeo's hero,

396
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,530
General Lee Seong Gye. Are you saying you killed him?

397
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,590
This ridiculous bastard! Hey, get me the broom!

398
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,910
He's going on with this nonsense...

399
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,930
No, no.

400
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:19,450
I saved General Lee Seong Gye's son's life twice.

401
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,350
That's why I am now a second rank Buk Doo body guard.

402
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,050
Second rank Buk Doo body guard?

403
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:35,290
What is Buk Doo body guard? Why is it second rank?

404
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,160
Oh? Why is that swindler here?

405
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,770
Hyung, our household got a servant!

406
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,570
What servant!

407
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,680
What happened? Why is that person here?

408
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,040
That person...

409
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,550
Do you think I would just let that person who swindled our family leave unscathed?

410
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,590
So I went and gave him trouble!

411
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,100
I told him to take out everything that he has taken from our family.

412
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,780
That's why he's cutting costs with manual labor like that, every day.

413
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,880
Ah, Noonim! What cutting costs.

414
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,850
To a dignified person... He's deducting it! That's how you say it.

415
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,650
Noonim?

416
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,470
Ah, right. Now that we are living in the same house, while thinking of the age order,

417
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,360
I arranged a title for her.

418
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,470
- That's why...
- Ah! Forget it! Forget it! Anyway!

419
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,350
Grandmother, our hardship has ended now.

420
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:37,360
General Lee Seong Gye's eldest son told me to bring my whole family to Gaegyeong.

421
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,740
We have all become part of the Ga Byeol Cho!
(Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army.)

422
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,920
Ga Byeol Cho?

423
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,060
Our whole family to Gaegyeong?

424
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,510
So, our whole family. So what you're saying is we became part of the Ga Byeol Cho and we're going to Gaegyeong? Finally?

425
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,670
That's what I said!

426
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,270
Aigoo! Our Moo Hyul!

427
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,750
Hey!

428
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,180
Our Moo Hyul did it!

429
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,870
Our family is going but why are you the one who's happy?
(Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master)

430
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,420
This Noonim said I am a swindler and spread the rumor in the neighborhood.

431
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,140
I don't have a way to survive in this neighborhood!

432
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,790
That's why you have to take responsibility for me.

433
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,130
Responsibility? Responsibility, my foot.

434
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,670
You swindled our family for a long time. What are you saying?

435
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,190
I've never swindled you!

436
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,070
Hong Ryun, Gil Tae Mi, Gil Sun Mi, I trained them all!

437
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,220
In that cold winter, with my hands trembling.

438
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,690
Why are you holding on to that again?

439
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,550
Moo Hyul.

440
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,480
Noonim! I'm... in pain.

441
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,340
You have to be responsible for me.

442
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,890
Servant Hong! Move.

Have you found out anything about the Viper?

473
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:04,800
Yes. When he was young, he lost his mother to the nobles

474
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,520
and it appears that he was enraged by that.

475
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,360
He's not someone who would go under your control.

Elder! The situation has become urgent.

If he can't endure the torture, Lee Bang Won's mouth

481
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,210
will mention his father's or Hong In Bang's name.

482
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,380
If even your name is mentioned, Elder Bon Won,

483
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,760
everything that you have planned all this time will become nothing by morning.

484
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,540
If you allow me, I will infiltrate the investigation office.

485
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,520
A person being tortured in the investigation office and dying inside the prison is a common thing.

486
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,900
You don't have to do anything.

487
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,770
You just have to turn away for a bit.

488
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,820
That girl from the Western district wants to meet you, Elder Bon Won.

489
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,150
- Boon Yi has come to Gaegyeong?
- That's right.

490
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:28,160
She helped Lee Bang Won in Ham Joo and she followed him.

491
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,170
So I kept her out last night.

492
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,770
A person came into an organization and acted independently. You need to remove her.

493
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,240
Why are you being like that?

494
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,030
Have I ever told you that girl's name?

495
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,750
I have told you about my connection to that girl, but

496
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:57,020
I don't think I mentioned her name.

497
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,920
Actually,

498
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,150
I know her.

499
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,800
How?

500
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,580
When I was young, I also came from the Western district.

501
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,230
I hope that you don't say anything to Boon Yi.

502
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,710
Also, please do not ask me about the story behind it.

503
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:28,120
My brother left then and there was also no news regarding Unni Yeon Hee.

504
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,650
Could that Yeon Hee have been you?

505
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:38,710
Where in Goryeo can you find a person without a story? I will not ask you.

506
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,250
Where is Boon Yi?

507
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,800
At a time when the people are dying of hunger, there was a secret agreement regarding tax revenues!

508
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,450
We will clearly expose what is true and what is not.

509
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,060
We will clearly expose it!

510
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:54,210
Even the students are like this, I

511
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,430
cannot reject an investigation.

512
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:03,400
But you already caught and tortured an innocent Lee Bang Won, so that should do. What else do you want? You can't even make him confess!

513
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,390
If that young child is innocent to that extent, don't you think he would confess in that scary place?

514
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,900
Yes. It's either that he can't trust his conviction

515
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,020
or that he trusts Lee Seong Gye with everything.

516
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,970
Is Lee Seong Gye someone who would accept an offer like that?

517
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,030
I only voted in favor of the An Byeon Book because it will be a great help to Goryeo's defense.

518
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:33,060
Of course, it's also because I wanted to be in a higher position than you in this political war.

519
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,490
But there was no such thing as a secret agreement.

520
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,980
That's why I am going to do an investigation.

521
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,620
What's the use of saying whether there was a secret agreement or not here?

522
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:50,390
But how can we trust that investigation?

523
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,400
There's one person in the investigation office, like a Byek Chang Ho.
(Byeok Chang Ho: A stubborn person who you can't communicate with)

524
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,250
Ah, you're talking about the dumb-head stranger, right?

525
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,870
Ah, that person? Fine.

526
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,140
That person previously

527
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,750
raised an appeal to kick me out.

528
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,420
It will be okay if we assign that person to investigate.

529
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,090
- I was wrong, ajussi.
- Why did you do it?

530
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,260
Why did you help that person without saying a word to me or to Lee Shin Jeok?

531
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,600
I was wrong.

532
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,470
He only has a temper but he doesn't think before doing something.

533
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,730
For the goal in front of him, he couldn't distinguish between fire and water.

534
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,730
Why did you help him?

535
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,330
Didn't I ask you?

536
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,930
Because we are similar.

537
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,570
The people of my village

538
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,060
only have quick tempers and don't think twice when doing things.

539
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,220
They can't distinguish whether what's in front of them is fire or water.

540
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,200
That's why the people of your village died.

541
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,250
Yes, I know.

542
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,200
But we...

543
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,740
the people...

544
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,010
are like that—because we are suffering in hope.

545
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,960
We gain hope and lose it.

546
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,890
We gain hope again only to lose it. Yet again, we gain hope and lose it.

547
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:27,190
Because we keep on being like that, we get quick tempers and don't think twice.

548
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,800
We don't even know how to distinguish methods.

549
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,580
That's how we became like that.

550
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,010
I was wrong, Ajussi. I am really sorry, but

551
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,450
just like I went to Ham Joo to find you,

552
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,710
to Bang Won your plan

553
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,710
is probably his only hope for survival.

554
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,470
You and Lee Bang Won are different.

555
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,890
No. We are not different.

556
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,570
I first met Lee Bang Won when I was young and went to Gaegyeong to find my mom.

557
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,300
At that time, to help those of us who were in a difficult situation, that child

558
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,000
was the one who led us.

559
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,690
Also, that Lee Bang Won that I met again after growing up

560
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,300
risked himself in order to help us, like always.

561
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,760
Among the powerful people I have seen,

562
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,270
they were all people who have taken things from us.

563
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,160
But that person

564
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,850
was the first nobleman to help us.

565
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,570
Also, that person, more than anyone else...

566
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,000
No. More than myself.

567
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
He wishes for your plan to succeed.

568
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,820
That's why I,

569
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,400
more than anyone else, wish for Teacher Sam Bong's plan to succeed.

570
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,240
To defeat the Do Dang officials, turn the tables, and proudly,

571
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,100
proudly live with strength in my guts!

572
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,400
I wish to live like that.

573
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,330
That's why

574
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,670
he waited, waited, and waited some more, in that room,

575
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,780
for you to quickly come.

576
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,090
Ajussi, you have to quickly come back.

577
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,750
We will be waiting.

578
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,340
I know that both Bang Won and I are wrong, Ajussi.

579
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,410
Still, to Bang Won and I,

580
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,130
please give us a chance to make up for our wrongdoings.

581
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,910
Please save Bang Won, Ajussi.

582
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,480
Ham Joo

583
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,040
Shin-dong, Im-dong, Yang-dong.
(Lee Ji Ran)

584
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,910
If we strike these three strongholds, Ho Bal Do's incoming troops
(Ho Bal Do: Yeojin tribe's Chief)

585
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,920
will all be defeated by our Ga Byeol Cho.

586
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,390
As I said, they will be in a situation where they cannot move or back out! If we launch a surprise attack at daybreak,

587
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,060
Ho Bal Do's main force cannot organize their battle line

588
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,040
and we can annihilate them.

589
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,480
Lee Seong Gye

590
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,050
Between five and seven o'clock in the morning,

591
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,670
we will launch a full-scale attack.

592
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,840
Yes, General!

593
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,830
What happened to Bang Won, and why did you come alone?

594
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,620
Did you send the documents to withdraw the An Byeon Book?

595
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,790
Why are you not saying anything?

596
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,510
I didn't send the documents.

597
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,150
What are you saying right now?

598
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,030
Bang Won was arrested by the investigation office.

599
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,610
For what?

600
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,690
As a condition for approving the An Byeon Book, Hong In Bang and Father

601
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:43,390
will divide the Northeastern region tax revenue between yourselves. He was charged for illegally negotiating that.

602
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:50,100
Lee In Gyeom has proclaimed war against our family.

603
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,900
So, as the eldest son of the Jeon Joo Lee Family,

604
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,120
I decided in your stead.

605
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:04,160
We have never avoided a fight when our family's name was on the line, Father.

606
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,050
Shouldn't we save Bang Won?

607
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,060
If Bang Won has to die for what he did wrong,

608
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,330
it has to be by our hands,

609
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,540
not Lee In Gyeom's.

610
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,610
In a situation where we have an upcoming huge battle,

611
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,640
I am sorry for saying this.

612
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,380
No.

613
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,440
We have another reason to win.

614
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,670
Let's take Ho Bal Do's head

615
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,150
and discuss the next case.

616
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:45,540
Daronggarongjoorong... Daronggarongjoorong...

617
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,980
This really doesn't get loose.

618
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,700
That's right!
(Jukryong: Bi Guk Temple's Head Monk)

619
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,530
Who am I? I am Bi Guk Temple's Jukryong!

620
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,680
How could you treat a person like this?

621
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,070
The situation outside has become urgent so we have been busy.

622
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,430
I will explain our stand while we go.

623
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,000
Go?

624
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,290
Where are we going?

625
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,390
You have to go to Gaegyeong with me.

626
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:33,670
I will relay to Head of Seonggyungwan Hong In Bang the Ga Byeol Cho's stance.

627
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,960
- You're going to release me?
- Yes.

628
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,090
- Right now?
- Yes.

629
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,510
Damn it. They should've released me earlier.

630
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,090
If something bad happens to Lee Bang Won,

631
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,490
you said we would gain four things from that.

632
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,080
What's the last one?

633
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,740
I

634
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,030
find your hesitation a pity, Bon Won.

635
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,790
I became like that the more I understood.

636
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,680
"Am I right?"

637
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,600
"Am I also

638
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,240
becoming like other politicians?"

639
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,300
It's because I was scared like that.

640
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,360
By it,

641
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,470
at the moment of the great cause's desperation,

642
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,460
I feared that I am wrong like this.

643
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,070
You are right, Bon Won.

644
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,480
Don't be scared.

645
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,200
Yes,

646
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,080
I am scared.

647
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,710
But I

648
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,130
am me because I am always scared.

649
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,820
So,

650
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,960
I will not use your scheme.

651
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,100
Watch Lee In Gyeom's movements.

652
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,640
What kind of movement are you talking about?

653
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,880
It will be hard to accuse Lee Seong Gye just on a letter and some rumors.

654
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,690
He will fabricate some sort of evidence next.

655
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,920
Watch him while keeping that in mind.

656
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,980
That's right.

657
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,130
This is totally Hong In Bang's handwriting!

658
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,530
Yes.

659
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,900
Since three years ago, I have been training one of my staff to imitate writing.

660
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,730
Great, great.

661
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,540
Now, this...

662
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,450
You can just put it in Lee Bang Won's residence.

663
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,270
Tomorrow, the investigation office

664
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,780
will conduct a search there.

665
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,530
Yes.

666
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:05,480
Since, the secret agreement is written in detail, it will become confirmed evidence.

667
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,670
Now, Lee Seong Gye's moral integrity will collapse.

668
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,210
With that, to prove his innocence,

669
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:19,580
he will have no choice but to withdraw the An Byeon Book.

670
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,200
His alliance with Hong In Bang will also be broken.

671
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,000
I will be going.

672
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,830
I have placed it there according to your orders.

673
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,940
Let's go.

674
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,950
Now, Lee In Gyeom's desire is confirmed.
(Through An Byeon Book, the tax revenue of Northeastern region to be split between Hong In Bang, Gil Tae Mi and Lee Seong Gye.)

675
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,100
After fabricating evidence like this, General Lee Seong Gye's reputation will fall to the ground
(Through Go Gong Chong Rang Gil Yoo being appointed as Northeastern region tax inspector, Lee Seong Gye and Gil Tae Mi's connection is confirmed.)

676
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,340
while Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi will be driven into a corner.

677
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,100
Fortunately, I was able to remove it today.

678
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,180
But what are we going to do in the future?

679
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:53,040
Change the letter to this and put it in that place.

680
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,560
I will turn the tables with this.

681
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,270
Everyone scatter and search thoroughly!

682
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,930
Yes!

683
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,650
Search thoroughly!

684
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,670
Yes!

685
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:28,660
- Search!
- Yes!

686
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,760
Sir, we found something strange.

687
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,860
They say that Lee Seong Gye's residence in Gaegyeong has been searched.

688
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,490
Finally, he's making this issue bigger?

689
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:03,340
They said that the dumb head in charge of the investigation is upright

690
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,910
so we can believe in him.

691
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,940
Using whatever method he can, Hap Ha

692
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,620
will stop the An Byeon Book and break off our alliance.

693
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,220
Whatever comes out of the investigation today is only to push us out.

694
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,390
What can we do now?

695
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,920
There will be something.

696
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,680
Something...

697
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,760
But at this crucial moment, where is Sam Bong?

698
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,640
He said he will be going to Ham Joo...

699
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,400
Today,

700
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,980
regarding the investigation of related materials to the An Byeon Book,

701
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,600
with the many members of the Do Dang,

702
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,890
I want to have a consultation.

703
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,510
Today, at the investigation office,

704
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:11,340
we heard that there was a search conducted at General Lee Seong Gye's residence.

705
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,330
Have you received the report?

706
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,050
No.

707
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:19,600
He will come to the Do Dang himself and report.

708
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,900
That way, there will be no unnecessary misunderstanding.

709
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,090
Open it!

710
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,470
I am an officer of the investigation office.

711
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:59,650
So that there will be no doubts regarding this investigation,

712
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,180
to personally inform you about it

713
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,020
I came to this place.

714
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,490
Have you found anything worthy of being evidence?

715
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:11,290
Today, from the hours of Jin to Mi, we conducted a search.
(hours of Jin: 7-9 AM, hours of Mi: 1-3 PM)

716
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,540
This was found.

717
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:24,160
Then, read the contents of that letter to everyone.

718
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,670
Yes.

719
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:31,760
This was found in Lee Bang Won's room.

720
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,170
No matter how long I wait, you don't appear.

721
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,710
According to your plan,

722
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,590
I killed Baek Yoon first.

723
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,180
Who is the next person?

724
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,810
What?

725
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,860
Weren't you going to save Lee Bang Won?

726
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,510
But mentioning Baek Yoon's murder?

727
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,830
Why did you place the letter the Viper left behind in Lee Bang Won's residence?

728
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,860
Don't you get it?

729
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,120
I don't. This is a different matter than the illegal dealings regarding the An Byeon Book.

730
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,210
Lee Bang Won can die with just this accusation.

731
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:25,190
Really? Will he die?

732
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,090
Bon Won!

733
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:32,670
An intelligent snake will not swallow a boar.

734
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,740
Yes?

735
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,320
If it does, it will break its jaw and its stomach will explode.

736
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,790
Lee In Gyeom is an intelligent and sensible snake.

737
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,750
Also, the current Do Dang can't handle a problem of this level.

738
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,520
What exactly are you talking about?

739
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,630
All of this

740
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,980
is possible because Lee Bang Won is Lee Seong Gye's son.

741
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,960
The letter got changed.

742
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,560
The Elder is crazy. Even if he's just manipulating, how can he put in something that enormous?

743
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,640
He's going to corner Lee Seong Gye as Baek Yoon's killer?

744
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,520
This was forged. It's impossible.

745
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,830
What reason would Lee Seong Gye have to kill Baek Yoon?

746
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:23,920
The one who ordered Baek Yoon to be killed was Lee Seong Gye?

747
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,740
Is he saying that he will go into war with Lee Seong Gye?

748
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,240
There's no way Lee Seong Gye will just sit back while this happens.

749
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,940
Whether it is true or not, if he finds out about this,

750
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,590
20,000 soldiers of the Ga Byeol Cho will be heading to Gaegyeong.

751
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,450
Po Eun, you're thinking of the same thing as me.

752
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,970
This is not Lee In Gyeom's work.

753
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,720
That's right. This is not Lee In Gyeom's forgery.

754
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,290
If Lee In Gyeom corners Lee Seong Gye as Baek Yoon's killer,

755
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:54,430
naturally, after calling him into Gaegyeong, he will have a plan.

756
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,860
There's no way he'd do it to the commander of 20,000 men now.

757
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,550
This is Sam Bong's plan.

758
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,440
We won!

759
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,590
Great victory! Great victory!

760
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,610
That is such a great victory!

761
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:14,320
Please, don't say that Lee Seong Gye had a great victory.

762
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,310
General Lee Seong Gye shot an arrow into Ho Bal Do's horse

763
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,740
and Ho Bal Do fell straight to the ground!

764
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:26,080
From then on the great military force just went jwang jwang kal pang jil pang
(He is making the sounds of the fighting.)

765
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:33,420
They lost most of their troops and they just escaped far, far away to the North.

766
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,000
General Lee Seong Gye is truly good at fighting.

767
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:52,370
But why is the atmosphere like this?

768
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,380
Hyung-nim, let's now go to save Bang Won.

769
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,640
Who changed the letter?

770
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,980
Who would do this?

771
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,510
Could it be... the shadow?

772
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,390
Was it you, shadow?

773
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:59,580
Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom,

774
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,710
will you accept

775
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:04,450
my move this time?

776
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,490
Six Flying Dragons

777
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,400
He'll try to deny the letter himself.

778
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,530
That person keeps on being fishy.

779
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:32,460
Is this the end? Can I only last until now?

780
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,690
Do you have a plan to save Bang Won?

781
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,330
Of course, I do.

782
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,850
Before the night is over, Lee Bang Won has to confess.

783
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,840
I don't know anything.

784
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,070
To save his son,

785
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,990
he'll probably come to me to negotiate.

786
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:50,020
Lee In Gyeom! You did something you shouldn't have done.
