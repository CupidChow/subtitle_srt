00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,050
Hey! Lee In Gyeom's cleaning rag!
Episode 18

3
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,140
Damn it... He stole it.

4
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,430
It's you!

5
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,350
Drop your best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms title here!

6
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,520
And leave.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,480
Right, right. I can't just go while you're still alive.

8
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,580
With a swordsman's speed, in any battle where he cuts a person, the blood won't get on the sword.

9
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,220
Brother...

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,200
That's a shame.

11
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,400
If I had cut you any deeper, your arm would have fallen off.

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,680
You're not that good, eh?

13
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,400
Try harder.

14
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,280
Oh, that attack was quite sharp.

15
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,770
But what can you do? I totally avoided it.

16
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,650
You... I can see all of it.

17
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,320
What?

18
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,600
I can see all of your attacks.

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,740
Crazy bastard.

20
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,970
Gil Tae Mi, you bastard!

21
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,340
Accept the Heaven's punishment, you bastard!

22
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,360
Damn it.

23
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,000
I...
(Gil Tae Mi)

24
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,690
What did I do wrong?

25
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,340
You bastard!

26
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,240
You have always stepped on weak people and stolen from them.

27
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,710
Hey.

28
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,970
Of course, I would step on the weak. Would I step on the strong?

29
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,930
I would also steal from the weak.

30
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,650
Are you telling me to steal from the strong?

31
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,000
Since the world began,

32
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,080
the weak have always been stepped on by the strong.

33
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,680
Even a thousand years ago, even a thousand years from now!

34
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,820
The strong steal from the weak.

35
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,880
In this world,

36
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,040
the only truth is that the strong

37
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,880
take and swallow the weak.

38
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,270
The strong

39
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,490
step on

40
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,050
and steal from the weak.

41
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,010
This is the only constant

42
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,220
truth!

43
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,630
So let's hurry and fight.

44
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,150
The strong

45
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,030
take and swallow

46
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,850
the weak. Like this.

47
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:03,740
♫ Why do you cry so sadly? ♫

48
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,730
What is your name?

49
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,730
I have to at least know who killed me.

50
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,130
I...

51
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,240
I

52
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,820
am the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms!

53
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,100
Lee Bang Ji.

54
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,090
Brother.

55
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:44,490
♫ Ask the world ♫

56
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,060
♫ Politics that distinguishes life and death ♫

57
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,140
Lee Bang Ji...

58
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:59,880
♫ What's the difference of the sword ♫

59
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,790
Gil Tae Mi has died! Gil Tae Mi has died!

60
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,180
That warrior killed Gil Tae Mi!

61
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,800
He's the new best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms!

62
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,700
Lee Bang Ji

63
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
Brother... Are you going like that?
(Gil Sun Mi)

64
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,760
Fortunately, in your last moments, you were not a corrupt official but a swordsman.

65
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,020
I hope the you now rest in peace.

66
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,690
Manse! Manse!

67
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,720
The people... The people are smiling.

68
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,300
Arrest all of Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi's remaining people.

69
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,180
Transfer them to the investigation office!

70
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,880
Also, the lands that they have stolen will all be returned to their original owners.

71
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,720
The falsely accused people will be released and returned to their previous occupations.

72
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,450
Why are you doing this?

73
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,920
We are here to transfer Hong In Bang's informant, Jeok Ryong, to the investigation office.

74
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,620
Those who resist will be charged with a severe crime according to the national law.

75
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,100
Ah.

76
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,290
You don't have to do this.

77
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,430
Let's go to the investigation office.

78
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,070
- Tie him up.
- Yes!

79
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,390
If I only knew beforehand that Hong In Bang wouldn't last long...
(Jeok Ryong: Bi Guk Temple's Head Monk)

80
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,660
Why did I hesitate like this...

81
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,180
So you got a government position again.

82
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,210
That's what happened.

83
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,170
We were also together when you first got a government position.
(Hong In Bang)

84
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,810
Yes. Why did you do it?

85
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,010
Forget the rattle talk and tell me honestly.
(Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon)

86
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:22,410
Why did a person like you, who had good education and knows the ways of a Confucian scholar, do this?

87
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,030
Mencius was wrong.

88
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,550
What?

89
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:33,480
Mencius said so. Benevolence means that when a child goes crawling to a well, you would save him even if he's not your own.

90
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,330
That is human nature.

91
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,570
Isn't it?

92
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,610
But if it's for your benefit, throwing the child into the well is also being human.

93
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,420
During troubled times like this, it's something we've seen a lot.

94
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,500
Humans are weak and selfish.

95
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,600
From the people to politicians—everyone. I was just the same.

96
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,330
The whole time I was tortured and sent to exile,

97
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,790
the Confucian scholar ways that I had learned for half of my life disappeared

98
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,550
and only suspicion and uneasiness remained.

99
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:13,380
Am I going to end like this? Didn't everyone abandon me? Is there not a thing that will go according to plan?

100
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,770
The paved benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, and wisdom powerlessly disappeared.

101
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:23,070
As much as you know, fear makes you tremble and doubt.

102
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,530
That's our nature as educated people.

103
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,850
So that's how you rationalize it.

104
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,930
Rationalize? That's right. Because I have to live.

105
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,220
"It's all a lie. Humans are originally like this."

106
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:46,050
"This country called Goryeo has been hopeless for so long."

107
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:52,770
And this is true. Even if it wasn't me, this country

108
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,610
is hopeless.

109
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,630
We need to go to the execution grounds.

110
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:09,030
You'll probably raise this country up now.

111
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,940
But,

112
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,200
will it work?

113
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,620
Why? Do you want to debate some more?

114
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,480
You probably want to object, right?

115
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,860
But what can we do? We don't have the time.

116
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,790
No.

117
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,980
I realized something good from your words.

118
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,580
I will make good use of it.

119
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,750
Do as you wish.

120
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:42,450
Also, there are also some parts of what you said that I completely agree with.

121
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,670
What are they?

122
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,210
"Goryeo is already

123
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,530
hopeless."

124
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,530
What?

125
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:13,750
I'm not even interested in raising this Goryeo up again.

126
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,240
Could you be...

127
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,700
If there really is an afterlife, make sure to watch. Goodbye, Brother.

128
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,260
Start the execution!

129
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,590
How... How is that guy still alive?
(Boon Yi)

130
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,150
Why do you look like that?

131
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,520
He's still the Elder I have served for so long. To see him go like that...

132
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,860
Ho! This man just says what he wants.

133
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,250
Although it was only because of Hong In Bang's orders,
(Jo Min Soo)

134
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,510
the crimes you committed while being his servant...

135
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,840
I am gravely sorry.

136
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,950
What? What did you say?

137
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,290
I said that I think you are really cool, Young Master!

138
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,100
What are you saying all of a sudden?

139
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,560
At first, I thought you were just a noble who was good at studying and had a way with words.
(Moo Hyul)

140
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:36,520
But you get more amazing in the long run. You look like someone who will make it big. You are an outstanding person!

141
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,510
Ah, seriously... It's an undeniable fact.
(Lee Bang Won)

142
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,450
But why all of a sudden?

143
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,290
At the Ilwol Jeong pavillion,

144
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,620
was it Haedong Gapjok? Anyway, you placed the gunpowder in front of those people.

145
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:55,760
Wow... Really. After that day, my heart wouldn't stop racing.

146
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,860
In the end, you got the King's orders with that signed letter and overthrew Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

147
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,300
Even if other people don't know, I surely know it.

148
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,730
Today at the market, I saw people smiling brightly.

149
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,590
I've always thought that the reason why I always walk around smiling is because I am lacking.

150
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,950
But other people appear to know how to smile too.

151
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,890
It's my first time seeing people gathered like that and smiling.

152
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,570
You made it like that, Young Master.

153
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:35,650
Well, if I think of it like you do, then that is true.

154
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,030
But why are you saying such things all of a sudden?

155
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:43,030
I... want to sincerely protect you.

156
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:51,230
I will protect you, and in the moments when I see the people smiling in the world you're going to make, it will be worth it.

157
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,430
So please officially make me your bodyguard.

158
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,470
You've always been my bodyguard.

159
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,510
Ahh, but those are just jokes.

160
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,750
Buk Doo second rank, whatever... I know that such a thing doesn't exist. Make it official.

161
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:12,810
You are my bodyguard. From the beginning, you've always been my bodyguard.

162
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:22,110
You are the first person I ever gave my sword to. What does this sword mean?

163
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:30,560
It's a weapon. Giving this to you means I trust you.

164
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,150
Really?

165
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,970
What are you doing? Are you not going?

166
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,120
I'm going.

167
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,070
What are you doing? My bodyguard

168
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,870
is not following me?

169
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,490
Yes, my Lord.

170
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,580
Teacher, this is...

171
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,080
Hong In Bang is right. Because the Sadaebu are afraid of leadership being taken from them,

172
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,050
they don't know that they are a bunch of people who doubt, check, get jealous, and try to win against each other.

173
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,460
So?

174
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,070
What kind of idea did you get?

175
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,580
I was also like that. During my exile, I was always anxious about being forgotten.

176
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,430
Why did a person, who found what he has to do there and wanted to help the people, become anxious and uneasy?

177
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,370
We are the same as the Sadaebu.

178
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,830
But Mencius left a group like that in charge of the country. Why did he do that?

179
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,980
Did Mencius not know?

180
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,830
No, Mencius knew about that and emphasized benevolence.

181
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,730
But I can't trust just benevolence.

182
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,250
That's why I will make the Sadaebu's doubts into a system.

183
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,710
I will make a system out of their envy, jealousy, and greed for victory and tearing people now.

184
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,020
I will make the Saheonbu that always doubts.
(Saheonbu: office in charge of judicial responsibilities)

185
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,680
I will make the Saganwon that always reprimands and the Hongmungwan that always chatters.
(Saganwon: office that criticizes the King's faults, Hongmungwan: office that advises the King)

186
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,490
The Sadaebu to the King and the King to the Sadaebu.

187
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,710
Also, so that the Sadaebu keep each other in check,

188
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,850
so that there's no other choice but to stop decay and corruption,

189
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,280
I need to make a bureaucratic cabinet like that.

190
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,650
Are you talking about a system that monopolizes the country even if there is uncertainty and criticism?

191
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,230
That's right.

192
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:53,580
Like that, the evil that was born from the nature of doubt and criticism won't transmit to the people.

193
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:04,290
Clockwise: King-Saheonbu-Hongmungwan-Saganwon

194
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:09,850
Doubting and keeping each other in check

195
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,860
What does this all mean?

196
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,150
Is that... possible?

197
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,890
What about the people?

198
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,250
Is there a way for the people to keep them in check as well?

199
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,730
I want it. All of this.

200
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,880
It's just... ability and talent that I can't compete with.

201
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,940
In the end... I couldn't understand a thing they said.

202
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,640
Why are you like that?

203
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,060
What about you?

204
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,870
You know...

205
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,880
You also didn't understand a thing, did you?

206
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,040
I live because of you.

207
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,160
What?

208
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,740
Now that everything has been wrapped up, I came to extend my gratitude for our deal last time.

209
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:33,040
Because of our deal, I got the King's orders, overthrew the Do Dang triumvirate, and state affairs have totally changed.

210
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:39,500
If not for your help, it wouldn't have been possible. I sincerely thank you.

211
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,810
I heard about how you received the signed letters.
(Min Da Kyung: Future Queen Wongyeong)

212
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:47,460
It was perplexing but still amazing.

213
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,060
In regards to that, I will offer my late apologies to Father-in-law.

214
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,960
I didn't disclose your family's secret to my father.

215
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,580
I told you about it because I trust your judgement.

216
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,980
How are you advancing so far?

217
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,640
What kind of authority are you putting together?

218
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,160
A political alliance between General Lee Seong Gye and General Choi Yeong will probably be formed now.

219
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,750
That person will never approve of this plan. What are you going to do?

220
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,380
I'm sorry. I was rushing you.

221
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,410
Slowly tell me about it.

222
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,320
Then, have a rest.

223
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,770
Hong In Bang, Gil Tae Mi... They both deserved it after what they have done.

224
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,410
Hey... As I lived through these troubled times,
(Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's Grandmother)

225
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,620
I've seen that happen a lot. I saw it first when I was born.

226
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,660
Really... That child Tae Mi was such a nice boy when he was young.
(Hong Dae Hong: Moo Hyul's Master)

227
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,200
This crybaby. Everyone's nice when they are young.

228
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,220
Where would you find someone who wasn't nice when he or she was young?

229
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:13,560
Even when he was young, he acted like a girl. He would wear a flower ring and play house.

230
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:21,290
He acted like a girl when he was young and his father thought he was useless so he brought him to me to make him into a man.

231
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,990
Oh my.

232
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,320
It doesn't even suit you so why are you acting like a teacher all of a sudden?

233
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,410
I'm just feeling totally refreshed.

234
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,490
Tae Mi, this kid...

235
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,860
Aigoo.

236
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,560
You are all grown up now.

237
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,100
Hong In Bang.

238
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,230
Hong In Bang.

239
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:02,620
Hong In Bang. Seonggyungwan Saye.
(government position in charge of guidance)

240
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,440
What Sam Bong said probably made your heart race.

241
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,230
Is that fluttering because of the country that Sam Bong is going to make,

242
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:13,000
or is it because you want to have that country?

243
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,700
I will make a system out of the Sadaebu's doubts.

244
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,990
I will make a Saheonbu that always questions.

245
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,550
I will make a Sagwanwon that will always reprimand and a Hongmungwan that will always chatter.

246
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,530
The Sadaebu to the King and the King to the Sadaebu.

247
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,730
Also, the Sadaebu will doubt and keep each other in check.

248
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,970
So that there is no other choice but to stop decay and corruption.

249
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,660
I want to have it. All of that.

250
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,490
But at one point you'll understand.

251
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:41,670
In that moment, the bug inside of you will start whispering.

252
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,450
I knew you were here.

253
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,620
You already did it.

254
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,320
Yes. I did.

255
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,440
I have to congratulate you.

256
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,520
You have made your start.

257
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,370
Can you promise me one thing?

258
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,690
What promise?

259
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,950
Just in the case...

260
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,300
If

261
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,060
I change.

262
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,820
Change?

263
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,260
How?

264
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,980
There's a bug living inside a person's heart.

265
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,310
If that bug takes and swallows me

266
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,670
and if I'm not who I used to be,

267
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,520
if I change to that...

268
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,990
I will kill you.

269
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,810
Good.

270
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:28,400
But before you kill me, can you tell me just once?

271
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,320
Okay.

272
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,500
"You mean bug. Hurry and spit out Bang Won!"

273
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,350
Like this?

274
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,960
You have to say it like that.

275
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,250
You don't have to worry about that.

276
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,770
But why won't it work?

277
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,100
How can the people keep them in check?

278
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,170
What's the use of them just keeping each other and the King in check?

279
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,940
In the end, it's the people who suffer.

280
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,320
The people can't do it.

281
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:13,160
I'm not belittling the people. It's just that they don't have the power or time to do it.

282
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,950
That's why we will have the administration.

283
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,930
It can change in the future, right?

284
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,450
A bodyguard has to conceal himself for the person he is serving

285
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,300
but the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms?
(Yeon Hee)

286
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,690
He's now the target of the whole country.

287
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,020
I will take care of my own job. Protecting him is my job.

288
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,620
This is my job, Bon Won's stability and safety. If there's a problem, then it's your job.

289
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,650
Problem?

290
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,960
What could happen to Bon Won's safety when the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms is protecting him?

291
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,780
Of course, it will be a problem.

292
00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:00,520
First, if there is an authority going after Elder Bon Won, they will create a plan knowing that the best swordsman in Goryeo is guarding him

293
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,710
because you have been exposed.

294
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:09,700
Second, if the warriors who are targeting you attack, how will you protect Elder Bon Won?

295
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,580
But Yeon Hee, we needed to catch Gil Tae Mi.

296
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,270
He didn't have to tell him his name.

297
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:21,700
Also, this is not something which you can take sides on.

298
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,080
Now that many people have gathered and are ready to start something big,

299
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,190
your safety is not just your problem now, Bon Won.

300
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,440
Also, every action of your bodyguard needs to be under the organization's regulations.

301
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,970
Did I say something wrong?

302
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,230
No, right. You're right.

303
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,800
You should also say she's right. Hurry.

304
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,400
♫ Maybe that's why it won't work ♫

305
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:19,870
♫ I probably won't see you ♫

306
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,200
Why should I? I must be crazy.
♫ I couldn't say your name ♫

307
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:34,250
♫ so I buried it in my heart ♫

308
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,100
Hey! Best swordsman in the Three Kingdoms.

309
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,680
Hey? Are you speaking informally?

310
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,080
You spoke informally first.

311
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,590
I think you're a lot younger than me.

312
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,500
Then, I will call you Hyung.

313
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,560
I hate that more.

314
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,080
Just speak comfortably. Why?

315
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,630
Congratulations. On becoming the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms.

316
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,320
Congratulations?

317
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,410
What about it?

318
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,400
Bastard, what a showoff.

319
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,470
Hey, that will take you to places and the way to success has already opened for you now.

320
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,040
You deserve to be congratulated.

321
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,790
Here.

322
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,890
I will also become the best swordsman in the Three Kingdoms.

323
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,770
Why would you?

324
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,240
What does it mean to be the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms?

325
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,730
The best fighter in the whole country.

326
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,210
Then you would have to fight everyone in the country?

327
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,620
What about you? Did you fight all of them?

328
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,540
That's what I'm saying. Why would I be the best swordsman?

329
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,610
What are you saying? Why do you make it so complicated?

330
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,360
The way you look is also complicated. I look so neat.

331
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,980
Seriously...

332
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,870
Your face and your heart

333
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,070
are both neat. Good for you.

334
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,960
I'm not being sarcastic.

335
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm really jealous.

336
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,920
That's why you can't be the best swordsman.

337
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,610
This bastard! You looked pitiful so I wanted to become your friend.

338
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,120
What do you think is the greatest ability needed for a warrior to live in these troubled times?

339
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,940
What?

340
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,730
It's personality.

341
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,710
Being able to enjoy killing people.

342
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,590
Feeling delight when your opponent dies.

343
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,950
That kind of personality.

344
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,950
But you don't have that. Your eyes say so.

345
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,890
What about you?

346
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,310
Do you have that kind of personality? I don't think so.

347
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,270
I did not.

348
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,240
But that's how it turned out.

349
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,820
That's how it turned out...

350
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,050
I became like that.

351
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,140
Is it really like that?

352
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,520
Is that why I couldn't stand in front of Gil Tae Mi?

353
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,840
This will not end like this.

354
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,070
The reason why this Goryeo became like this to begin with,

355
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,510
as everyone knows, is Lee In Gyeom.

356
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:15,000
This treason case that made Elder Jo Ban into a traitor

357
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,360
was fabricated by Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

358
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:27,410
The fabricated treason case is not the only reason Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi were executed.
(Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo)

359
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,700
For the crimes of buying and selling government offices and messing with the rules and orders,

360
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,890
the crime of forcibly taking lands from the people and fellow subjects and piling up their assets illegally,

361
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,430
for raising the taxes to 90% on land that had already reached its tax limit,

362
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,340
and the crime of throwing the people into agony.

363
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,900
Behind all this is Lord Lee In Gyeom.

364
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,700
You have to say it correctly.

365
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,830
How can raising taxes be a crime?

366
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:01,300
Of course, raising taxes to 90% is definitely something that will get you caught,

367
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:09,000
but the ones who approved those taxes were the Do Dang. I'm saying that it is legitimate law enforcement.

368
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,590
If you put the blame on just anyone now,

369
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:19,260
isn't it right to put the same blame on the Do Dang which approved it?

370
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,840
Yes.

371
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,820
What he said is right.

372
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,550
I was a part of Hong In Bang's faction for a short while but

373
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:34,050
it was a position where I couldn't look at Hong In Bang's evil deeds,

374
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:40,030
so I decided to put an end to my comrade and sincerely appealed for Hong In Bang to be impeached. That's why I am still here.

375
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,390
I also think the same way.

376
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,700
Look at the empty seats in this Do Dang. We have already spilled too much blood.

377
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:58,170
Considering the severity of the punishment, the target needs to be chosen accurately.

378
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,320
Lee In Gyeom needs to be punished.

379
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,380
At least, he needs to be locked up on a remote island so he won't be able to run away.

380
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,470
We must seize his family assets and return them to the people from whom he unfairly took it from.

381
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,740
Does that really need immediate attention?

382
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,240
Just what exactly needs immediate attention?

383
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,550
Even from a long time ago, our relations with the Ming have been critical. Did you not know that?

384
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,370
Our envoys who went to Ming still haven't coordinated and haven't come back yet.

385
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:39,400
Their demands have already gone too far. It's worse than the Yuan.

386
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,990
- General.
- The talks about Lee In Gyeom are not that urgent.

387
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,180
Lee In Gyeom needs to be severely punished.

388
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:57,090
When Lee In Gyeom stepped down, a decent number of his faction members remained in the Do Dang and negotiated with Hong In Bang.

389
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,180
Yes. I heard that there are only about 20 people remaining.

390
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,690
Looking at it, now that Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi's faction members have mostly been removed,

391
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,530
Lee In Gyeom has ironically become the Do Dang majority.

392
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,510
Is that all?
(Lee Bang Woo)

393
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:16,220
People like Woo Hak Joo and Han Gu Young took their faction members

394
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,570
and they survived by sticking on to Lee In Gyeom's faction.

395
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,640
Like this, once Lee In Gyeom's exile comes to an end,

396
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,420
it will only be a matter of time before he comes back to the Do Dang.

397
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,740
Yes.

398
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,790
His Highness will also do anything to call Lee In Gyeom back.

399
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:37,060
That's why we need to get Lee In Gyeom severely punished now.

400
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,590
That... What I'm saying is...

401
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,520
That won't do.

402
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,250
What are you saying? What do you mean it won't work?

403
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,960
You are now waiting for the Do Dang's decision. Why did you ask to see me?

404
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:00,150
I will go out so you two can talk comfortably.

405
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,280
General, you must not corner General Choi Yeong right now.

406
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,550
You must end it with Lee In Gyeom being sent to exile on an island.

407
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:18,670
But in this situation, where Lee In Gyeom's faction members are still in the Do Dang,

408
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,450
he will surely come back after his exile ends.

409
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:30,300
And when he comes back, he will surely make another Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

410
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,180
General!

411
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,730
I will earnestly ask you again.

412
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,650
Can't you just accept those people who are Lee In Gyeom's faction members?

413
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,220
If you will only extend your hand to them now, they will be running to you like crazy.

414
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,800
Look here, Sam Bong!

415
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,870
Those people leached off Lee In Gyeom and for the past decade

416
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:01,410
have persecuted the people. They're not any different than Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi.

417
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,810
What are you saying I should do with those people?

418
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,150
General Choi Yeong.

419
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:12,360
Join forces with those people and aim for General Choi Yeong.

420
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,260
What?

421
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,700
What?

422
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,950
I said that Lee Seong Gye will eventually attack you, General.

423
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,160
With the same mindset, Lee Seong Gye

424
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,980
has defeated Japanese pirates like a comrade in arms.

425
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,620
That Lee Seong Gye would attack me? Why?

426
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,810
Lee Seong Gye trusts and follows you.
(Lee In Gyeom)

427
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:41,230
Also, he still looks weak right now.

428
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:46,890
The problem is Lee Seong Gye's desire.

429
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,150
Desire?

430
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:54,670
As we both know, Lee Seong Gye is Goryeo's useful tool.

431
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:59,880
Like a hammer. But that hammer developed a desire.

432
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,910
Well, what do you mean about the desire?

433
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,100
What kind of desire does Lee Seong Gye have?

434
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,170
It's Jeong Do Jeon.

435
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,160
Jeong Do Jeon? What are you saying?

436
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,250
How can a measly government official be something like that to a great general like Lee Seong Gye?

437
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:22,210
I talked about a shadow before, right?

438
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:25,410
Do you remember?

439
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:32,220
That shadow is Jeong Do Jeon.

440
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:39,400
Those people will eventually attack you.

441
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,670
Aim for General Choi Yeong?

442
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,800
How can it be that we're not aiming for Lee In Gyeom

443
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,920
but General Choi Yeong instead?

444
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,830
This is to save General Choi Yeong, to avoid bloodshed, and to minimize the people's suffering.

445
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,960
Just what are you saying?

446
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,180
The country we are making is not a place we can go to with General Choi Yeong.

447
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,900
If you make General Choi Yeong step down

448
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,800
and you take in his military influence.

449
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,700
How?

450
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,260
How is it that we can't take General Choi Yeong to our new country?

451
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,770
Because the core of the new country is land reform.

452
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,240
If the people won't own lands, nothing will change.

453
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,600
That's why we must take the lands of the powerful noble families.

454
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,780
General Choi Yeong is a part of that family.

455
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,900
No matter how personally upright General Choi Yeong is,

456
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,220
his family is the one who has the most in this Goryeo.

457
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,510
We are going to take that family's lands, so do you think you can make him approve of it?

458
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:46,450
For that system's groundwork, do you think he can throw away Goryeo?

459
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,080
How can a new country...

460
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,440
Please leave.

461
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,610
General.

462
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:55,120
Who said I will set up that new country?

463
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,770
Who said I will be that country's King?

464
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,550
I said leave!

465
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,650
Say something that makes sense!

466
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:26,530
Still, as someone who held a high position,

467
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:31,670
how can you spread such absurd words?

468
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:34,480
Argh!

469
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,660
They're not groundless words.

470
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,000
That man, Jeong Do Jeon, has dangerous thoughts

471
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,330
and Lee Seong Gye has dangerous strength.

472
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:49,050
If those two join together, Goryeo will be in danger.

473
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,870
Your old mother came here from far away so I'm doing you a special favor.

474
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,590
What is this?

475
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,180
What lie is this? You said you're my mother?

476
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,610
It's that person's order.

477
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,290
I will accept the order.

478
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,950
Wouldn't it be a big problem?

479
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,220
If he insists on this again this time, our plan will fall apart

480
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,370
and won't we have to engage in a full battle with General Choi Yeong in the end?

481
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,000
What kind of plan was it?

482
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,620
Am I not suppose to know about it?

483
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,000
If you only do your job...

484
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,580
First, we absorb Lee In Gyeom's faction members and after making Choi Yeong step down from his position,

485
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,930
we will take Goryeo's military force in our hands.

486
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,010
What about the second one?

487
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:37,850
It is to completely control the Do Dang and gradually remove the corrupt Gwon Moon Saejeok.

488
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,280
After reforming the system and gaining the people's trust,

489
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,950
we wait for the right time and dethrone the King.

490
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:49,360
That's the way to minimize suffering while establishing a new country.

491
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,600
If we don't absorb Lee In Gyeom's faction members, Choi Yeong will absorb them

492
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,160
and if that happens, in the end,
(Lee Shin Jeok)

493
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,460
we will have no choice but to physically fight General Choi Yeong.

494
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,800
If that happens... The people will experience great suffering again in that situation.

495
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:11,550
Also, we will lose the people's trust if we attack their highly respected General Choi Yeong.

496
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:21,260
Have you told the General about what kind of country you will establish?

497
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,840
You couldn't tell him everything, right?

498
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:35,070
Actually, because Bang Won caused trouble, I lost the chance to talk to him about it.

499
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,290
The General needs to know the details.

500
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:43,490
He needs to know so he can make his judgement. Don't you think he will lean more toward the idea?

501
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,450
What about Jeok Ryong?

502
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:54,250
He's being investigated at the investigation office so why does he need to see me?

503
00:47:54,250 --> 00:48:00,010
He suddenly said that he will confess to everything if you come, General.

504
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,710
Even before, he has never said a word and is still keeping it up.

505
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,600
Daronggarongjurong... Daronggarongjurong...

506
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,250
Daronggarongjurong... Daronggarongjurong...

507
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:19,610
You should be grateful that you're still alive, for a person who's with Hong In Bang!

508
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:23,230
I'm not one of Hong In Bang's people.

509
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,740
I am only an information seller

510
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,270
who sells information for wealth.

511
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,870
Then you should've just sold information!

512
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,250
Stop your nonsense and start talking.

513
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:42,040
I will dare to sell you the information that I have, General.

514
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,660
You will sell me information?

515
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,060
You should be offering all the information you know while begging for your life,

516
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,640
since you're locked up in this prison. But you're selling it to me?

517
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:57,940
In the past few years, there have been enormous changes in the court and the Do Dang.

518
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,560
Do you think those changes happened coincidentally?

519
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,420
What?

520
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,340
How the An Byeon Book got approved,

521
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,750
how Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom got pushed into retirement,

522
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:12,210
why the Haedong Gapjok suddenly signed a letter like that,

523
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:16,490
and why Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi suddenly collapsed like that.

524
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,730
Aren't you curious?

525
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,810
When you get tortured, you'll probably speak up.

526
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:24,100
- Look here!
- Why!

527
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,640
All this time, why did they not torture someone like me?

528
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,500
It's because no one in the Gwon Moon Saejeok wants me to be tortured.

529
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:44,860
It's because if I open my mouth, almost nobody in the Gwon Moon Saejeok will escape their crimes.

530
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:53,690
That's why, instead of the investigation office, I'm only selling the information that I have to you.

531
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,170
What do you want?

532
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:03,350
I don't have any wish besides getting out of here and going back to my life.

533
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:08,610
I have really not committed any crime other than selling information to Hong In Bang in exchange for wealth.

534
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:15,350
What kind of country Sam Bong is going to establish,

535
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,970
please listen to it this one time.

536
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,170
No.

537
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:28,570
The thing that makes my heart beat fast, the thing that I want to do with you,

538
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:33,230
the thing that even made me forge your seal,

539
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,990
please look at it this one time.

540
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,570
I earnestly ask this of you.

541
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:53,350
If you look through the place I told you about, you will learn about a lot of interesting things.

542
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,910
I found it!

543
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,960
It's a detailed record of every day.

544
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,950
Tell me about the land reform.

545
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,930
Actually, I was going to tell you about it earlier...

546
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:51,200
Please tell me how it will be fixed for the people's benefit.

547
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,310
Yes. Yes, I will definitely do that.

548
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:26,770
Is this really

549
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:30,060
all true?

550
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:33,420
Did Lee In Gyeom get it right?

551
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:52,000
General. General Choi Yeong sent a message that he urgently needs to see you.
(Jo Young Gyu)

552
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,840
The Prime Minister?

553
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,670
Where is he currently at?

554
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,140
He said he will be waiting at the Do Dang.

555
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:06,810
General! It's late at night. What is it about?

556
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,670
Lee Seong Gye!

557
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,330
What is this?

558
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,110
Look!

559
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,230
There was a time when Lee In Gyeom, who you were displeased about,

560
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:53,310
came to me one day and said he was calling you into the Do Dang.

561
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:59,550
Also, one day, Hong In Bang came to me and said that he would approve of the An Byeon Book,

562
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:04,050
so I halted my attack on those thieves for the country's defense

563
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,990
and accepted Hong In Bang's suggestion.

564
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,780
But during that time, you allied yourself with those people

565
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:20,200
and I, Choi Yeong, got played into a rookie's hands.

566
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:25,460
Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon! In that man's plan!

567
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:27,730
What is going on?

568
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:32,160
It appears that Jeok Ryong's ledgers are now in General Choi Yeong's hands.

569
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,260
The interrogation records when he caught me, your private consultation with Hong In Bang,

570
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:45,100
Jeok Ryong going to Ham Joo, and our plans regarding the approval of the An Byeon Book are all included in that.

571
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,940
Is that the whole truth?

572
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,540
Is it true?

573
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,350
Yes, it is.

574
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:06,470
However, it's not what you think it is.

575
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,990
I will explain the whole situation in detail.

576
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:14,260
Get rid of Jeong Do Jeon.

577
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:23,070
If Choi Yeong suspects me, I can just throw away my government position. What importance is there in a small position?

578
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:29,430
But we must not go into a head-to-head battle with Choi Yeong.

579
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:38,810
If you get rid of Jeong Do Jeon, I will get rid of Lee In Gyeom too.

580
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:43,980
How can you put Jeong Do Jeon in the same position as Lee In Gyeom?

581
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,380
When my comrades and soldiers died in the war with numerous Japanese pirates,

582
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,290
Lee In Gyeom is someone who made business out of that war.

583
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:59,850
Beside the village where we were fighting, he stole land from the people.

584
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:03,050
How can you compare such a person to Sam Bong?

585
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:06,260
That man's treacherous plan played with Goryeo's entire court.

586
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:12,750
Thinking about what harm that person can cause Goryeo's great hero keeps me up at night.

587
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,420
That fooling around resulted in

588
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:21,320
ending Lee In Gyeom, Gil Tae Mi, and Hong In Bang's corruption and illegal accumulation of wealth.

589
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,070
No!

590
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,540
That wasn't the only result.

591
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,580
You got into the Do Dang. Is that all?

592
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:35,620
You also secured a strong and independent base through the An Byeon Book.

593
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,570
General, how can you...

594
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,680
I trust you more than anyone.

595
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,640
I also welcome you coming into the Do Dang

596
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,380
but at least get rid of Jeong Do Jeon.

597
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:01,140
If you are going to operate state affairs with me, that is the first condition.

598
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,350
What will you do?

599
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:22,650
You are wrong about Sam Bong, General.

600
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:30,560
Keep him beside you and appoint him in a position where you can judge his talent and him as a person.

601
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,050
Is that

602
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,630
your answer?

603
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,020
That's right, General.

604
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:53,160
Try to deal with him about getting rid of me and Jeong Do Jeon.

605
00:57:54,430 --> 00:58:01,120
"If you get rid of Jeong Do Jeon, I will get rid of Lee In Gyeom." Say it like this.

606
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:08,320
By doing that, you will know Lee Seong Gye's true feelings.

607
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:14,360
I understand what you mean.

608
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:23,780
Go with Jeong Do Jeon. I will go with Lee In Gyeom.

609
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,760
Six Flying Dragons

610
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,590
I have met another type of influential man that I have never experienced before.

611
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:12,090
How is it that the royal command's authority keeps on falling to the ground?

612
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,550
Ajussi, it has been revealed through the corpse.

613
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,560
General Choi Yeong... Just...

614
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,680
- I came to make a deal.
- What do you want me to do?

615
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,220
Who is General Choi Yeong meeting?

616
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,450
I attepmted to make a deal with General Lee Seong Gye.

617
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:25,910
I followed that person's wishes.

618
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,720
No way.

619
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,610
Could it be? If my guess is right, this is...
