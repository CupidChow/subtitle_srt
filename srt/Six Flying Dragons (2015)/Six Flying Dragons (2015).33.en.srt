00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,930
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,890
No! What are you doing! Jeong Do Jeon!

3
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,090
No, kill the fire!

4
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,410
Now, this country's land will be reborn anew!

5
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,720
You've done it again. You are truly amazing.

6
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,990
But I will soon bring you down and give you a rest.

7
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,950
That guy...

8
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:34,030
That guy... I still really like him. Damn it.

9
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,790
I guess there was a reason that you took him as your teacher.

10
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,650
Elder Sam Bong is really cool.

11
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,510
He is cool. Damn it.

12
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,450
Why do you say damn it, even though he's cool?

13
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,500
It's nothing.

14
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,320
It's because it's complicated. Complicated.

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,510
Young Master, you're strange recently.

16
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,150
Was it after you talked with Cho Young?

17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,050
Anyhow, from that day on, you've been a little... strange.

18
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,980
A little... A little what?

19
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,810
That...

20
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,790
Could it be because you put your topknot up weirdly?

21
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,290
You seem a little different than before you put it up.

22
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,610
I did become different.

23
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,100
I feel lonely. I didn't think this would be so lonely.

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,210
I didn't think this would be so distressful.

25
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,500
Did they do this to you while speaking that nonsense again?

26
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,510
Who are they? What are they?!!

27
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,210
I'm okay.

28
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,980
This isn't something a Confucian scholar should do!
These bastards! Why I ought to—

29
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,120
Please don't!

30
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,850
At least, you are on my side.

31
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,230
You called us?

32
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,470
You guys...

33
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,980
Go to Danyang for me.

34
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,400
What for?

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,690
Sam Bong...

36
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,740
Still. What are we going to do since you burned all the land ledgers?

37
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,740
What are we going to do? Well, the only thing we can do is to proceed with the land reform and land survey

38
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,430
at an even faster rate!

39
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,310
You are such an absurd person.

40
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,040
Tonight, I think I will be able to have a good sleep.

41
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,410
Elder Bon Won! Official Lee Shin Jeok returned from Ahsan. He says the work is almost complete.

42
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,600
We will be able to begin right away. Tell him to prepare.

43
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,700
Yes.

44
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,840
Aigoo. If you are a criminal, then act like one and go in quickly.

45
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,460
Alright. I have to be released by tomorrow.

46
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,200
Make sure to tell the General not to forget that.

47
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,920
Why are you drinking so much?

48
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,830
Because I'm happy.

49
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,900
After we withdrew the army,

50
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,870
because of that land reform or whatever,

51
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,750
we went through so much hardship and couldn't enjoy the passing time.

52
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,510
How many did we kill

53
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,010
and how many did we exile...

54
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:16,130
Well, that's because those bastards kept refusing and interfering and flipping out.

55
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,550
Do you want some more?

56
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,580
Ji Ran...

57
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,100
I think it will be good if my work ends here.

58
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,820
Brother what are you saying.

59
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:44,480
Bloodshed from politics smells worse than in battle.

60
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,840
It smells very bad.

61
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,440
Ajusshi said that he isn't going to stop here.

62
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,740
So even if you weren't able to receive any land today, don't be disappointed too much.

63
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,800
Aigoo. We are not disappointed.

64
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,190
Pfft. What disappointment?

65
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,920
Just from the fact that taxes have gone down to 10%,

66
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,970
We here are saying, "Grandfather!"

67
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:14,870
Yeah! When I saw those land ledgers go up in flames, my mind just went blank,

68
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,380
and I felt like I was going to fall backwards!

69
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,940
I was about to cry!

70
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,250
Anyway, Ajusshi said that this is only the beginning,

71
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,820
so whoever wants to return home can do so,

72
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,700
and if you don't want to, you can always stay here.

73
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,950
Young Master Lee Bang Won decided to provide the food and housing.

74
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,110
Good. That's good.

75
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,420
Everyone take some time to think about it.

76
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,590
Yes. Everyone can leave now.

77
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,970
Good work everyone.

78
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,970
Western district?

79
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,790
Yes. I am looking for a person.

80
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,030
These guys... They are from Biguk Temple.

81
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:24,290
I heard that young siblings in their 20s from the Western district are in this house.

82
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,950
Bang Ji and Boon Yi?

83
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,610
Are they not here?

84
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,750
But why are the Biguk Temple guys looking for them?

85
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,580
We asked, ARE THEY NOT HERE?

86
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,370
Jeez! This monk...

87
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,030
There's no one like that here.

88
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,090
But why are you looking—

89
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,670
Excuse us.

90
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,160
Boon Yi.

91
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,990
Mom?

92
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,250
Mom...

93
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,920
Yes. Boon Yi.

94
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,880
Mom...

95
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,850
Are you Nameless?

96
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,840
How did you know?

97
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,540
So you are Nameless...

98
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,440
In any case, it's good that you know.

99
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,490
I'm Nameless.

100
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,510
Is that why

101
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,920
you left us?

102
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,700
Yeah. That's why I left you two.

103
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,920
You never

104
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,400
looked for us even once?

105
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah. I never looked for you. I didn't even want to look for you.

106
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,550
Why are you saying that to me?

107
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,400
Just like other families that meet after being separated for a long time,

108
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,520
shouldn't you be telling me your excuses and crying over it all night long?

109
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,940
Mom.

110
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,550
Were you threathened by Nameless?

111
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,870
Did they say they'll kill us if you don't return?

112
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Mom, tell me. Brother can save you.

113
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,680
Why are you like this? You are not this kind of person.

114
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,820
You guys only knew me from the few years of my life we were together.

115
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,220
The few years of my life when I lived as a very different person than I am now.

116
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,360
I was originally a person like this.

117
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,370
Then why have you come to see me?

118
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,890
Why after all this time?

119
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,340
To tell you not to look for me anymore!

120
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,370
Tell that to your brother too.

121
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,850
I have my own path and I'm living well.

122
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,120
You two should also live well while going down your own paths.

123
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,030
Your own path?

124
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,550
You're living well, you say?

125
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,030
You killed people to stop the land reform

126
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,110
and even tried to hurt your children. Is it that kind of path?

127
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,450
Is it such an important path

128
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,490
that you abandoned your own children?

129
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,650
Are you following Jeong Do Jeon and Lee Seong Gye without that kind of resolution?

130
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,730
In front of the people that follow you, without much determination

131
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,690
do you just say what comes to your mind and speak as if you will take responsibility for things?

132
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,630
Following Jeong Do Jeon means you are trying to flip the world around and

133
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,780
saying something in front of people is a responsibility.

134
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:06,060
So throwing away your precious ones and making them your foes,

135
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,480
if you're not determined to do such things, then forget it.

136
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,760
Acting like you live for the world.

137
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,660
Don't do such a thing if you're not confident.

138
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:23,830
It probably doesn't matter now but if I can give you any advice,

139
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,770
it's just live for yourself.

140
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,950
Don't look at the world and just live well.

141
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,740
What about you? Why you?

142
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,660
Why are you living for Nameless instead of living for yourself?

143
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,080
This organization that you call Nameless

144
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,080
gave everything to me, who was a war orphan.

145
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,550
Food, friends, family, skills, and power.

146
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:19,270
Just like Jeong Do Jeon gives you hope, even when I actually didn't give anything,

147
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,890
this gave me real power.

148
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,840
The power to manage the world.

149
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:38,110
That's why Nameless is me. Living for Nameless is the same as living for myself.

150
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,990
So don't look for me.

151
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:50,660
♫ Cry, cry, bird ♫

152
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,890
♫ Sleep, wake up, and cry, bird ♫

153
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:08,950
♫ I, who is more sorrowful than you, ♫

154
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:14,430
You must not look for me, Boon. You will be in danger.
♫ wakes up and cry ♫

155
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:24,530
♫ Yalli Yalli Yalla Syong ♫

156
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:30,320
♫ Yallari Yalla ♫

157
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,800
Don't go around looking for me anymore!

158
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,760
Tell that to your brother too.

159
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,820
I have my own path and I'm living well.

160
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,820
You two should also live well while going down your own paths.

161
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,220
What? Bi Guk Temple monks came looking for Bang Ji and Lady Boon Yi?

162
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,570
No. They didn't come looking for Bang Ji and Boon Yi. They were looking for siblings from the Western distrcit.

163
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,950
Gab Boon said that there are no people like that here.

164
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,640
Why are those monks

165
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,480
not praying in the temple like they should be? I wonder what they are planning?

166
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,780
Bi Guk Temple monks are looking for sibling from the Western district...

167
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,600
Why are you looking for Yeon Hyang?

168
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,770
Her son and daughter are looking for their mother.

169
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,390
Hwa Sa Dan took the ledger but Bi Guk Temple also came looking for it.

170
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,400
Could it be that Bi Guk Temple is also...

171
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,560
What if Bi Guk Temple's Jeok Ryong is also an informant of Nameless?

172
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,050
It's a joyful night, so what's with the face?

173
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,530
I'm happy. The people like it too.

174
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,590
Did something happen?

175
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,470
About that...

176
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,820
You're happy too, right?

177
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,180
Of course. I like it.

178
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,470
You...

179
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,820
It would be nice if you were on my side. You have to be on my side.

180
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,100
Will you be on my side this time as well?

181
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,320
Do you still have something to say?

182
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,410
No. I don't.

183
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,300
Go ahead.

184
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,430
Husband.

185
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,910
Please see me for a bit.

186
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,290
Do you really not want anything?

187
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:06,040
Are you really satisfied with chasing after Nameless under Sam Bong?

188
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,780
Whatever you think,

189
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,420
the only person completely on your side is me,

190
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,700
whether you give me your heart or not.

191
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,140
Side. Side, you say?

192
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,820
it doesn't matter to me.

193
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,820
- I only—
- It also doesn't matter to me.

194
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:36,200
But you will be on my side, right? You have no choice.

195
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,240
I'm fooling everyone.

196
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,140
What?

197
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,080
I'm not disguising to catch Nameless but to avoid Teacher Sam Bong's sight.

198
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,100
It's to raise my own power.

199
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,340
Of course, I also have to catch Nameless.

200
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,900
What do you mean by avoiding his sight?

201
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,160
No matter how I think about it,

202
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,140
the new country is not for the Lee family.

203
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:08,230
The new country might even become the Jeong family's.

204
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,450
Jeong family...

205
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,420
Are you talking about Lord Po Eun and Lord Sam Bong?

206
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,220
That's right.

207
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,900
How can such an impossible thing...

208
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,720
I also wish for it not to be true.

209
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,110
But if it happens,

210
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,810
I would have to make Teacher stop and rest.

211
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,990
Because of that, it is true that Nameless has become more important to me.

212
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,720
What do you mean important?

213
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,900
By catching Cho Young, Teacher has dominated Hwa Sa Dan.

214
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:52,060
Lady Yeon Hee has totally become Teacher's person, over whom I have no control.

215
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:57,370
Compared to Teacher Sam Bong, the thing you lack the most is information.

216
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,600
According to my calculations, if Bi Guk Temple is also another information organization for Nameless,

217
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,650
I'm thinking of a way to make use of it.

218
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,200
What kind of information do you want that you brought this much payment?

219
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,610
Track and report His Highness, Teacher Po Eun,

220
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:22,410
and Teacher Sam Bong' movements to me, as detailed as you can.

221
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,090
What?

222
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,790
Why?

223
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,550
Is this not enough payment?

224
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,920
Ah, that's not it.

225
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,860
But...

226
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,750
Why are you asking me about Lord Sam Bong's movements?

227
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,780
Do I have to tell you about that too?

228
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,920
No. I apologize.

229
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,840
Also, one more thing.

230
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,560
Have you heard about Nameless by any chance?

231
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,790
Ah, yes.

232
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,580
I have heard of it but...

233
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,660
If you have time, look into Nameless as well.

234
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,060
Yes. I understand.

235
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,000
What? Lee Bang Won?

236
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,600
Yes. It seems that he really has a problem with Sam Bong.

237
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,690
Try to make a deep connection with that guy, Lee Bang Won.

238
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,300
Investigation Bureau

239
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,090
Did Lee Choong Mang finish preparing?

240
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,680
Yes. It seems to be.

241
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,610
Have you been well?

242
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,250
You've worked hard! Is the survey all finished?

243
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,860
Yes. This is it.

244
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,330
It's the data and the petition to the king.

245
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,070
Then let's proceed with it today.

246
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,480
Yes.

247
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:13,830
For the King's teacher position, I wish to have the head monk from Guhmulsa as my teacher.

248
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,660
Your Majesty. That is not right.

249
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,300
What do you mean that's not right?

250
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,740
From far back in time, the royal family has chosen a teacher we can honor and trust and will try

251
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,770
to bring peace and stability to the court and the royal family. Why are you saying we can't do that?

252
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:43,480
According the results of the land survey, you know that only 600,000 gyuls (unit area of land) were surveyed out of the whole country.

253
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,590
How is that related to choosing the King's teacher?
King Gong Yang (Goryeo's last king)

254
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,270
They are very related.

255
00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:00,000
The reason only 600,000 gyuls were surveyd is because of the Buddhist temples.

256
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:09,010
As soon as the land survey started, the Gwon Moon Sae Jok donated the land that they stole to the temples,

257
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,570
because then it's not illegal and they don't have to pay taxes.

258
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:18,220
When we investigated it, the total land belonging to the temples was 200,000 gyuls.

259
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,900
It turns out that the temples had 30% of this country's land.

260
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,920
In addition, there are 12,000 temples in Goryeo,

261
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,110
130,000 monks, and 70,000 slaves in the temples.

262
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:38,830
Your Majesty, out of the temples in Gaegyeong, ten of them are even larger than this palace.

263
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,610
That is so.

264
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,890
And especially for Gilgan, they have more than 3,000 mansions in their possession, and

265
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:52,500
to make Buddhist statues and structures they, have poured enormous amount of gold into it.

266
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,950
That is not all.

267
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,180
There are many temples that are involved in the brewery business and other businesses.

268
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:08,690
Therefore, Your Majesty, I petition to reform the Buddhist temples.

269
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,560
What on earth are all of you saying?!

270
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,290
We have to confiscate all the land of the temples;

271
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,520
forbid anyone from donating to the temples;

272
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:26,040
distribute the wealth of the temples with less than 100 people as military resources;

273
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,160
turn the 80,000 unofficial monks into regular people;

274
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,170
restrain people from becoming a monk to reduce the 50,000 monks to less than 10,000;

275
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,550
turn all the temple slaves into free people;

276
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:50,260
and abolish the useless system of appointing a king's teacher.

277
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,130
However, how can we cut off the people's deep-rooted religious beliefs
Min Jae (Lee Bang Won's father-in-law)

278
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,280
as if we were simply cutting a radish?

279
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,690
Yes.

280
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,750
Even Teacher Mok Eun (Lee Saek's nickname), who is a great Confucian scholar, approved Buddhism.

281
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,440
Then, how?

282
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Teacher Mok Eun is someone who was sent in exile as a criminal.

283
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,400
How could you bring up his name when we are discussing the court's decisions?

284
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,850
Father, that guy Sam Bong is ruining you.

285
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,480
Watch what you say. What do you mean, that guy?

286
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,230
Exclusion of Buddishm?

287
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:34,360
This is why the people are misunderstanding that you are trying to becoming king.

288
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,320
Well, there's also no reason why he can't.

289
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,080
Shut up!

290
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,120
Father doesn't have that kind of thought.

291
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,260
Are my words wrong?
(Lee Bang Woo, Lee Seong Gye's eldest son)

292
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,460
Father, we have to find the people who are spreading those rumors and

293
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,420
you have to make sure that kind of misunderstanding doesn't happen.

294
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,350
Just how far are these guys trying to go?

295
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,850
At this rate, this country is going to perish.

296
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,110
Why aren't you saying anything?

297
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,340
This must not be done.

298
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,180
It's not that we are just being greedy.

299
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,010
This is the end for our family.

300
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,830
All the land that has been passed down to us has been taken away.

301
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:27,860
And even the bit of land I gave to the temples, in order to be able to at least continue the family business, will be going away.

302
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,360
I guess you are at a worse situation than me.

303
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,500
They are just telling me to die.

304
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,560
Lord Jo, where are you going?

305
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,050
They are telling me to die!

306
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,970
I will go die like they want!

307
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,250
But I won't die alone.

308
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:51,340
Ah, look! Lord Jo!

309
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,880
The tides have turned already.

310
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,410
What do you mean they've turned already?

311
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,300
That guy, Sam Bong, called teacher Lee Saek a criminal in the discussion room.

312
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,570
How can he make such a remark when he can't even kill him.

313
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,560
We've pushed it forward, but since there's no one in the country who doesn't believe in Buddhism I'm not sure how the people will react.

314
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,130
We've begun the land reform, the changing of the lands.

315
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,260
Now we must change the heavens.

316
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,620
When faced with hardship the people of this country and even the politicians have always

317
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:34,880
tried to receive salvation from Buddhism, which is transcendental, instead of trying to solve the problem.

318
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,600
Even when the capital was taken over to the Japanese pirates, the people hid away and only prayed in the temple.

319
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,500
Even during the drought and flood, they only made golden buddhist statues and structures.

320
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,700
But, Bon Won, this is about changing the people's hearts.

321
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,540
It won't happen so easily.

322
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,130
Of course. Since this is so difficult, we have to press on.

323
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,840
Yes, you probably don't have anything that bothers you.

324
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,470
You have the power in your hands and even have Teacher Po Eun's support.

325
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:13,710
The new world cannot exclude themselves from gaining knowledge and only pray under a Buddhist statue.

326
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,380
But this is something that is difficult to accept, even for Father.

327
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:23,430
I don't know about trying to move someone who's a devoted Buddhist like Father.

328
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,000
What?

329
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,420
In the discussion room, Sam Bong definitely scolded the ways of the Buddhism.

330
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:36,450
Is that person thinking of changing the whole world? How can there be such an outrageous person?

331
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,210
Now he will be a direct threat to us as well.

332
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,130
Since he has one side of the power in his hands, there is nothing that is stopping him.

333
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,550
The one who leads the Right Army is Lee Seong Gye

334
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,890
and Jeong Do Jeon and Jo Joon, the Left Army.

335
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:54,370
Since they took out Lee Saek's group, don't even mention the courts. The whole country is in their hands.

336
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,870
Yes, so...
(Yeon Hyang)

337
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,940
Sam Bong will receive backlash from this.

338
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,150
We have to send this to His Majesty, so get signatures from all the scholars who agree to it.

339
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,040
Whose signatures are you trying to get?

340
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,650
It is the right of the Confucians to be cautious towards Buddhism.

341
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:23,220
Even teacher Lee Saek said that is solely depended on each individual and not the problem of the denomination.

342
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,370
That is why teacher Lee Saek receives criticism that he is a heretic.

343
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,630
What?

344
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:33,850
To think that you people are following Sam Bong who impeached Teacher like that, you are all committing the same crime!

345
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,430
What did you say, you bastard?

346
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,920
You bastard!

347
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,290
No. You must not!

348
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,400
You are the heretic.

349
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,040
In Seonggyungwan?

350
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,560
Yes.

351
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,560
They said it started from a disagreement in the Buddhism discussion.

352
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,730
There have been 80 men injured and 2 men are in severe condition.

353
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,660
You can leave now.

354
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,390
Yes.

355
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:12,660
General, you must stop Sambong.

356
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,880
This cannot continue.

357
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,120
It's not something that would work by using force.

358
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,570
Don't you know about the people's hearts?

359
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,870
When you pulled back the troops

360
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:33,870
and returned 50,000 soldiers to their parents, the cheering went on for a while.

361
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,040
The only memory that remains in the people now is General Choi Yeong,

362
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,390
who you've served your whole life and cared for. You attacked him with your own hands.

363
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,700
Then, what should we do?

364
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:59,590
Teacher Lee Saek's followers will try to stop Sam Bong who's screaming for Buddhism exclusion.

365
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:05,740
If that happens, Sam Bong will eventually kill Teacher Lee Saek as well.

366
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,760
After General Choi Yeong, if Teacher Lee Saek ends like that as well,

367
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,750
do you think you can handle the public's opinion?

368
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,470
What should we do?

369
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,350
What about making Sam Bong rest for a little bit?

370
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,720
You must stop Sambong.

371
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,590
This must not happen. Can you handle that kind of public opinion?

372
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,300
What is the matter, General? Please have a seat.

373
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,420
What is the matter?

374
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:03,390
Sam Bong, what about slowing things down a little bit?

375
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,730
If we do not continue on with this, it is a problem that cannot be solved.

376
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,800
Buddhism is something that has been passed on for 1,000 years, since the Shila dynasty.

377
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,190
How can you get rid of that in a matter of days?

378
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,450
That is why, even if we try to fix that from now, it will still remain for a long time.

379
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,130
I am also a Buddhist.

380
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:33,080
My heart feels heavy thinking about excluding Buddhism all of a sudden.

381
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,390
If I, who support you, feel like this, then how do you think the others feel?

382
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,670
I am not trying to eliminate Buddhism.

383
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,760
How can that be erased from a person's heart?

384
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,880
It's not just me. No one in the world can do that.

385
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,000
But this country's Buddhism cannot cleanse itself.

386
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,700
Also, fixing Buddhism is the best choice for making a Confucian country.

387
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,960
Buddhism will remain,

388
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,560
so don't waver and believe in me, General.

389
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,510
Seriously, aren't you supposed to let people make a living? It's not just me.

390
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,100
If this goes on, it will be a big problem.

391
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,290
I will reinstate you to a public office position.

392
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:37,710
If that happens, according to the law, you guys will receive lands.

393
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:44,310
Not from cheating others or taking it from them, but land that is rightfully earned.

394
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:48,430
T-That... W-Why is that so?
(Woo Hak Joo)

395
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:58,830
That is if you and the people who follow you will do as I say.

396
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,460
Your Majesty, Sam Bong is giving you a good opportunity.

397
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,960
What do you mean?

398
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,590
Already the people who decide on your wrong doings are all my people.

399
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,930
And even lord Lee Saek's people decided to support me.

400
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,480
To such an extent, everyone is going against that plan.

401
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,070
If it goes according to plan, we can use this opportunity to stop Sam Bong.

402
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,560
But the problem, in the end, is General Lee Seong Gye.

403
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,540
Do you have a plan?

404
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,330
What should we do? Even I do not know.

405
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,300
Please follow Teacher Po Eun and Sam Bong's decisions.

406
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,800
I am saying this because those two have different opinions.

407
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Pardon?

408
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:59,700
Po Eun is against it saying that Sam Bong is going too fast.

409
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,790
Po Eun is against Teacher's will.

410
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:07,380
It's not that I don't know about Sam Bong's good intentions, but

411
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,270
because we cannot receive the people's trust,

412
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,760
he asked me about making Sam Bong rest for a bit.

413
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,790
Something is strange here. Teacher Po Eun wants Teacher to rest?

414
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:30,180
What's the matter that you are coming to see me?

415
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:34,590
I just thought of greeting you as I was walking past.
(Han Goo Young)

416
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,720
It's not a place that I can't go to.

417
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,170
Of course. Please bring in tea.

418
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,330
What is this?

419
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,970
It's a small gratituity for you.

420
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:03,310
Your father will become king anyway. Aren't you going to be the prince?

421
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:07,070
If you keep me by your side, I will pledge my loyalty to you.

422
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,340
Bastard!

423
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,720
There's a huge problem.

424
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,540
Right now, Bang Woo is.. Bang Woo is...

425
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,200
What's wrong with Bang Woo?

426
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,000
He's being held at the Investigation Bureau.

427
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,650
Please leave us for a bit.

428
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,500
I have to talk to Father.

429
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:09,920
He was badly hurt. How could Hyung-nim do such a thing?

430
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,880
Heaven's help came from an unexpected place.

431
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,050
I must not lose this chance.

432
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,790
Teacher Po Eun, are you having different thoughts?

433
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:33,310
Are you going to become king?

434
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,640
Are you saying that I should not?

435
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,580
Father.

436
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,990
I learned a lot about our family when I was twelve.

437
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:53,380
After that, I've only had one goal in life.

438
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:00,590
I have made up my mind to live for only one thing.

439
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:07,150
Through me, I want our family's betrayal to end.

440
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,120
Bang Woo.

441
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,830
Our early ancestor went onto the Mongol's side and betrayed Goryeo, and

442
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,310
our uncle once again betrayed the Yuan dynasty.

443
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:20,210
Right now, you're betraying Goryeo again.

444
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,740
Yes. Actually, it doesn't matter whether it is Yuan or Goryeo.

445
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:32,150
But I won't be able to commit betrayal anymore.

446
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,660
How could you say such harsh words? I—

447
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,560
If you're going to be the king, then go ahead.

448
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,570
If you're going to establish a country, then do it.

449
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:49,980
Also, you have to surely give me the position of Crown Prince.

450
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,030
What?

451
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:56,600
I will be the crown prince and if I become the king in the future,

452
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:02,640
I will give the throne back to Goryeo's Wang family.

453
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,380
Bang Woo!

454
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,550
You must do that.

455
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,710
As the eldest son of the Lee family of Jeon Joo,

456
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:19,830
don't I have enough qualifications to become the crown prince?

457
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,930
He asked me about making Sam Bong rest for a bit.

458
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,360
I also said the same thing.

459
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,280
I would have to make Teacher stop and rest.

460
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:53,380
Is it a disguise? Just like how I'm using Nameless to disguise myself, is Po Eun also faking it?

461
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,560
What are you saying right now?

462
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,920
General.

463
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,680
Say it one more time.

464
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,690
I said you must not waver because of something like this.

465
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,690
Something like this?

466
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,810
I said that you must not stop.

467
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,850
What did you tell me before?

468
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,020
More than the great cause or the people, my family

469
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,470
and the people under me are more important to me.

470
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:25,060
You told me that if I extend my fence to the whole Three Kingdoms, that is a nation and I will be king.

471
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,680
Yes, that is correct.

472
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,110
But the people are criticizing me and even my family is ashamed of me,

473
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,500
so what is it about a great cause? What about being king?

474
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:41,490
A monarch has to withstand by himself and still walk past criticisms if that path is correct.

475
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,610
That's right.

476
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:48,850
Then, I am someone who does not have what it takes to be a monarch.

477
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,180
General.

478
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:56,220
Get out. I told you to leave.

479
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,450
Tan Yang?

480
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,340
Yes. Po Eun secretly sent someone to Tan Yang.

481
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,360
If it's Tan Yang...

482
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,370
The thing that Po Eun is continuously looking for...

483
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,480
Is that it?

484
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,390
Then...

485
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:23,720
Don't you think that we have to re-evaluate our thoughts about Po Eun?

486
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,910
Is he a useful sword to us after all?

487
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,310
Now,

488
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:41,260
we must do it. We must not lose this chance.

489
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,930
However,

490
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,850
Sam Bong... Sam Bong.

491
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,770
He hasn't come back home yet.

492
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,920
Is that so?

493
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,400
Yes.

494
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,620
You definitely said that he went into his house, right?

495
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,970
Yes. He went in an hour ago.

496
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,570
Teacher.

497
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,050
Seriously. I told you it's not like that.

498
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:42,330
Then why did you disguise yourself as a servant to infiltrate that household after teaching me and Tae Mi?

499
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,040
Well that was just because I wasn't making much money.

500
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,160
Didn't you go in there to learn the Goksan swordsmaship?

501
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,660
You have seen it and know its weakness, right?

502
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,070
Cheok Sa Gwang has appeared.

503
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:02,230
I have to know the weaknesses of that swordsmanship.

504
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,960
My my...

505
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,600
You appear after ten years and that's what you say?

506
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,030
Are you thinking of getting your students killed?

507
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,950
Fine. I will tell you a way to survive.

508
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,830
If you see Cheok Sa Gwang, run away.

509
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,550
That's a way to survive. Even with my skilled eyes,

510
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,590
I couldn't find a weakness to that swordsmanship.

511
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,570
Let's stop the conversation here.

512
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,720
Hyung-nim, let's go now.

513
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,460
It's almost time for the meeting.

514
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,840
You've come?

515
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,160
I was late.

516
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,890
No. Have a seat.

517
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:46,910
Another person came.

518
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,500
Your Majesty.

519
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,780
Right now?

520
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,780
Yes.

521
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,640
Through Jeong Mong Joo, His Highness and General Lee Seong Gye are meeting in secret.

522
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,340
What is it?

523
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:23,540
Since the relationship between lord Lee Seong Gyae and Sam Bong has withered because of the Buddhism plan, they are probably talking about a counter plan.

524
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,360
Because of the new plan, the relationship of the two being different from the past

525
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:33,030
is something even people drinking in the street can estimate.

526
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:39,410
Do you think that is the right answer to the money I gave you for the information?

527
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,110
This isn't all.

528
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:48,710
Let Lee Bang Won know this. Tell him that Po Eun will attack Sam Bong.

529
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,730
Po Eun will soon

530
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,390
impeach Lord Sam Bong.

531
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,880
I will work harder.

532
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,270
Your Highness, please don't say that.

533
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,060
I will do the reform that you want.

534
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:16,810
Lord Po Eun will lead it and I will support it with all I have.

535
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,350
Your Majesty.

536
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:21,490
Let's just take it a little bit slower.

537
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:26,910
I know that your intentions are not different from mine.

538
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,070
But the whole of Goryeo, the court

539
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:39,190
and the people. Do you really not know we are all tired from this?

540
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,680
Your Majesty, he is probably also as tired as anyone else.

541
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,830
Yes. He probably is.

542
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:55,430
It's hard for all of us to catch up with the speed of a skilled person like Lord Sam Bong.

543
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,940
Buddhism exclusion is a huge thing.

544
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,750
Do you think I do not know about the temple's wrongdoings?

545
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:10,430
All the years the people of this land have believed in Buddha are deeper than Goryeo's history.

546
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,970
We must not do it like this.

547
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,770
Yes.

548
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,430
Let's do it this way, Minister.

549
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:25,170
It's for the court and the people. It is also for Sam Bong.

550
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:28,490
For Sam Bong?

551
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:33,370
Sam Bong needs a rest from politics right now.

552
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,070
It will be hard for Sam Bong to last long like this.

553
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,890
Impeachment? Impeachment...

554
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,800
Why are you looking serious again?

555
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,830
Po Eun will impeach Teacher.

556
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:56,620
What? What do you mean? You said he was in a special relationship with Po Eun.

557
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,960
Will that work?

558
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,660
Even though he has power, is that something that can work?

559
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,140
With what crime?

560
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:11,440
No. But nevertheless, for what reason do I feel my anger rising?

561
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,110
Ah, of course! Aish...

562
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:20,390
Thinking about it, you were right this time too.

563
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:23,990
You said so before that we have to keep an eye on Lord Po Eun.

564
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,420
That's right. You were right again.

565
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,960
But why don't the elders listen to you?

566
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,800
I am also ready with a different path than Teacher

567
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,400
and even planned to attack teacher if things didn't work out, but...

568
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,500
But...

569
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,940
If he really gets impeached, what will happen to us?

570
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,250
If Teacher gets impeached and loses his power,

571
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:57,810
Po Eun will

572
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,720
swallow Father whole.

573
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:09,790
Hyung-nim, how did it go?

574
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,060
Let's go pray at the temple.

575
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,000
What?

576
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,460
Let's go to the temple.

577
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,920
This late at night?

578
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,290
Does it say anywhere that you cannot go pray at a temple late at night?

579
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,110
Let's go quickly.

580
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,870
Yes.

581
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:39,330
It's done. I have to do it tomorrow. I have to.

582
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,750
Teacher Po Eun.

583
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,730
The night breeze is cold.

584
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:48,870
Who is it?

585
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:54,980
I am the one who sent you to Sam Bong's cave.

586
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,950
Nameless?

587
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:05,660
We were hoping you would go against Sam Bong and save Goryeo,

588
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:12,810
but you joined forces with Sam Bong and proceeded with the reform so we thought that we picked the wrong person.

589
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:15,850
We were thinking like that.

590
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,970
But it seems like we were wrong.

591
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,570
What are you referring to?

592
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:27,770
You sent a person to Tan Yang.

593
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,360
You have gotten that right?

594
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:38,980
We were also thinking of using that when the time came.

595
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:44,190
Right. Are you going to attack Sam Bong now?

596
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,900
What do you want from me?

597
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,620
After you attack Sam Bong, we will help you.

598
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:58,700
And for the reformation, do it slowly and carefully.

599
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,680
It would be better if you don't do it.

600
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:08,130
I will tell you for sure, reforming this country and solving this country's injustice and corruption

601
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:13,670
and then rightfully raising this country's law is my work as well.

602
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:19,200
Except for changing the court, I have the same thoughts as Sam Bong.

603
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,530
Is that so?

604
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:27,320
Are we wrong about this one too?

605
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:35,270
Stop your actions in trying to control this country's court, royal family and lords from the dark shadows.

606
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:39,190
If you don't, I will surely find you

607
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:43,780
and make sure that you guys won't damage history ever again.

608
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,690
Ah, yes. I understand.

609
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,830
I hope you achieve it.

610
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,560
Let's go.

611
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,990
Why aren't you saying anything?

612
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,840
Tell me what the problem is.

613
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:26,550
I think that Teacher Po Eun is having different thoughts.

614
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,870
Are you not going to believe me, Teacher?

615
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:34,550
You seriously don't listen.

616
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,590
Pardon?

617
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,990
That night at the cave, didn't you lose to me?

618
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:44,240
So you said that you wouldn't do anything to Po Eun. In the end, did you follow him and keep him under watch?

619
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,540
That is the truth, Teacher.

620
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,590
I will tell you what happened.

621
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,880
Teacher Po Eun will...

622
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,400
He'll probably impeach me.

623
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,030
If you look at it that way, you actually won the bet.

624
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,490
Did you know about it?

625
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,020
What are you going to do?

626
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,490
But I will win.

627
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:14,820
Teacher Po Eun has tricked you and while doing that has gained control.

628
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,120
He's also making Father waver.

629
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,220
Then how can you still be so sure?

630
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,830
He'll remove me from the Do Dang and send me into exile.

631
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:28,200
Or to give me a bigger punishment, he'll need that much more reason to for it.

632
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,820
Without reason, the police bureau does not move.

633
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,980
If he just tries to do it with power, then brother cannot win over us.

634
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,150
But do I have a crime like that?

635
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,500
No matter how much the Do Dang pushes me out, will they find a crime that I did?

636
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:51,060
Don't worry so much.

637
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:57,930
The only thing is, even it's already like this, I still have to persuade Po Eun.

638
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:01,710
It just that I feel a little bit tired.

639
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:57,060
Minister Lee Seong Gye cannot come today

640
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:00,900
so I will lead the meeting.

641
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:08,950
Before taking care of all the problems that have been piling up,

642
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:15,480
I will announce one important thing to you guys, and

643
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,900
according to your decisions, it will be decided.

644
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,460
Jarang Park Cha Yun come inside.

645
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,990
Announce it.

646
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:50,560
All the scholars wish to impeach Jeong Do Jeon.

647
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,930
I'm getting impeached?

648
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:08,970
What crime did I commit?

649
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,560
What sin?

650
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,760
The crime of impeaching Teacher Lee Saek as a Confucian scholar?

651
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,550
I impeached him for the crime of enthroning Shin Chang

652
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:27,300
And it was you who first brought up throwing out the fake and putting up a real one.

653
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:33,080
You will get thrown out of Do Dang now.

654
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,690
Whatever my sin is, I will definitely counter it.

655
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,950
Ja Rang hurry and read the document.

656
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:57,370
Jungdak Moonhak Jeong Do Jeon, with his low-class rank.

657
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:04,010
Still, you're on my side, right?

658
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:09,520
Don't take it to heart. To think that you're of low birth...

659
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,490
Still...

660
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,070
It could be the truth.

661
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:23,390
When I was young, I heard something like that among the elders.

662
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:28,350
My grandmother on my mother's side was the daughter of a slave.

663
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:33,700
That's nonsense. There's no way that's true.

664
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:36,760
Isn't that just a rumor?

665
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,530
Don't listen to thoughtless words from the elders.

666
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:46,980
And also you can not say things like that later on ever again.

667
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,710
Whoever it is.

668
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:03,410
Jungdak Moonhak Jeong Do Jeon, who has obtained a position with his low-class rank,

669
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:08,150
has taken control of the Do dang and temples and brought shame upon the royal family.

670
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:13,010
That is not a light crime.

671
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:20,080
Jeong Do Jeon's maternal grandmother was a slave.

672
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,810
I cannot listen to it!

673
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:25,860
You, how can you say scheming things.

674
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:31,950
Do you think you will be safe even after speaking such antagonizing words in the Do Dang?

675
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:36,150
With bringing up that old, old, already past rumor,

676
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,070
what kind of nonsense are you spouting?!

677
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:41,240
There is evidence.

678
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:53,140
This is Tan Yang's record of a deceased person's life.

679
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:58,900
If you look at it closely, you will know the truth.

680
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,790
Something like that can be easily forged.

681
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:12,250
With only that can you impeach someone from the Do Dang?

682
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:17,250
If it a record, then I can bring up as much as other record counterfeiting that.

683
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,990
You be careful of any further words.

684
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:22,470
Jungdak Moonhak.

685
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,740
I will ask you.

686
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,720
During our time in Seonggyungwan,

687
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:41,410
the time we were in Seonggyungwan...

688
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,840
This devastating truth.

689
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:51,570
Did you

690
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:57,610
confess it to me or not?

691
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,680
Have you confessed or not?

692
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:13,760
If you didn't, say so. Tell me that all of this is fabricated.

693
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,110
Jeong Mong Joo.

694
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,370
Six Flying Dragons

695
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,710
The King's command for him to be exiled has arrived.

696
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:46,490
I will kill you and reinstate you as a Confucian scholar again.

697
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:49,470
You will have to make no mistake and kill me for sure.

698
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:52,470
The day that Sam Bong dies will also be the day that Goryeo will be ruined.

699
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:54,350
Just kill me here.

700
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,060
We must help Po Eun.

701
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,960
I am Gil Seon Mi. I am here to escort you to Geung Rang.

702
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,090
Lee Seong Gye fell from his horse, and we cannot tell if he will survive or not.

703
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,190
We must take this chance and get rid of everyone.

704
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:06,790
I will do it. I will kill Lee Seong Gye.

705
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:11,510
How amazing is Goryeo for you to do something like this?

706
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:12,780
We were tricked.

707
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:16,550
I will find Father no matter what.
