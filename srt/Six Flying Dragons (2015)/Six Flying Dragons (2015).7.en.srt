00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,290
Episode 7

3
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,700
No. It's not the time for you to worry about a woman, Moo Hyul!

4
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,590
Ip Shin Yang Myeong.
(To succeed and gain world recognition)

5
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,530
That's right. Just think of Grandma.

6
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,340
Grandma.

7
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,030
Warrior-nim.

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,600
Do you want to go with me?

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,300
Where are you going?

10
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,400
Ham Joo. I'm on my way to Ham Joo

11
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,740
Ham Joo?

12
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,150
Yes.

13
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,230
To Ham Joo where General Lee Seong Gye is.

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,740
If you join General Lee Seong Gye's forces and fight the Japanese pirates,

15
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,540
you will immediately be acknowledged by General Lee Seong Gye and your name will be widely known.

16
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,160
My name will be known?

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,430
Yes. It's doing Ip Shin Yang Myeong.

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,830
Among the warriors I have seen so far, you are the best.

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,920
Yes, let's go.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,790
Ham Joo.

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,120
That person

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,030
is where Father is. Ham Joo.

23
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:13,370
Then, the owner of the cave is gathering people at Ham Joo?

24
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,610
This no ordinary matter.

25
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,240
It's an organization trying to destroy Goryeo. They are even using a secret code.

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,330
Am Eo: A secret code only select people can decipher

27
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,550
That kind of organization is hiding at the General's base...

28
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,550
- Let's go.
- Yes!

29
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,430
I will get the horses running to Ham Joo right away.

30
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,630
No. To Gaegyeong.

31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,630
Pardon?

32
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,700
We need to go to Gaegyeong first.

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,230
G-Gaegyeong?

34
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,270
What is going on? Is everything connected to Sam Bong?

35
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,580
Why did the Bi Guk Temple monks do that, and who was the warrior who saved the woman?

36
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,680
I think Hong In Bang is the mastermind.

37
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,890
What do you mean by Hong In Bang?

38
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,810
Hong In Bang came out of the monk's room.
(Gab Boon)

39
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,100
Enter.

40
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,660
Did you hear back from the boys that are tracking the kids?

41
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,590
Yes.

42
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,280
Where are they headed?

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,820
Their destination is still unknown but we have been informed that they're going north.

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,900
North, you say?

45
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,030
What could this person be doing in Ham Joo?

46
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,040
Jeong Do Jeon's book about building the stronghold of the revolution

47
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,770
Jin

48
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,940
Chae
(Jin Chae: A base where military troops gather)

49
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,120
Gye
(Gye: Strategy/Plan)

50
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,050
What's the matter?

51
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,420
Jo Young Gyu

52
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,620
Why didn't you tell Young Master Bang Woo?

53
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,940
If it's something concerning Ham Joo, then your eldest brother, Young Master Bang Woo—

54
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,000
You must never tell him.

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,790
Surely not to Bang Woo Hyung-nim. Also not to those in Ham Joo, General Lee Ji Ran, Bang Gwa Hyung-nim, Father...

56
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,440
We cannot tell anyone about what has happened up to now.

57
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,690
Then, I cannot go with you.

58
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,140
I was born and raised in Ham Joo.

59
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:56,450
I have always thought proudly of my parents and the whole military troop.

60
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,060
In that Ham Joo, in that military troop, unknown people have infiltrated.

61
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,930
No! We're not even sure if a lot of people have already gone in there, but

62
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,930
you're telling me to just shut my mouth? That's betrayal!

63
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,160
It's not betrayal!

64
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,890
Ham Joo is...

65
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,680
a base.

66
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,820
Base?

67
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,970
What is that?

68
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,930
It's the base of a revolution.

69
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,440
The stronghold for a revolution.

70
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,730
That person

71
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,940
has chosen Father's Ham Joo as a revolutionary base.

72
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,130
Who is that person?

73
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,010
That's what I'm also trying to find out.

74
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,850
It doesn't make sense! To betray because of a person we don't even know—

75
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,890
We don't know who he is but I know what he's going to do!

76
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,120
What is it?

77
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,770
What is he going to do?

78
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,900
This won't do. I have to tell Young Master Bang Woo.

79
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,750
Goryeo...

80
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,770
This rotten Goryeo...

81
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,670
What?

82
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,630
That person is going to end this rotten Goryeo and establish a new country.

83
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,720
And I

84
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,000
will make sure to do that with him

85
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,480
Goryeo has disappointed me,

86
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,320
frustrated me,

87
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,670
and left me sapped of my strength.

88
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,780
Then, we can just tell the General.

89
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,100
Don't you know Father?

90
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:37,060
That person has made a perfect plan to establish a new country but has left out one thing.

91
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,130
What is it?

92
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,440
That person I call Father.

93
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
He left out that person, Lee Seong Gye.

94
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,530
If Father finds out about the truth,

95
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,620
that person will die.

96
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,940
Then this revolution will also end.

97
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,490
Please help me. I beg of you.

98
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,830
Ham Joo, Lee Seong Gye's military troop barracks

99
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Soldiers were reading this in the barracks, so brought it.

100
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,330
Please take a look.

101
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,050
Isn't it impressive?

102
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,130
If it goes this way, wouldn't it be really good for us?

103
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,030
Who wrote this?

104
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,100
That, I do not know.

105
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,240
Soldiers were looking at it one day.

106
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,090
Still, whoever wrote this, the content is really good.

107
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,680
How about if we submit this to the government.

108
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,560
This is not going to happen.

109
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,910
Lee Seong Gye

110
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,380
It won't work and it will bring suspicion from the government.

111
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,200
But—

112
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,910
Did you not consider this might have been written by a spy?

113
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,340
Based on what I'm hearing I agree, Brother.

114
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,620
Just discussing it would cause the government to suspect us of treason.

115
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,990
Lee Ji Ran

116
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,360
Bang Gwa, find the person who wrote this.

117
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,200
Didn't you hear your uncle?

118
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,830
Yes. I understand.

119
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,480
Assign it to 1st class military officer Lee Shin Jeok.

120
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,790
He's the most trustworthy and he'll surely do it well.

121
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,710
Sir, thank you very much.

122
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,200
- Follow me.
- Yes.

123
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,900
Next!

124
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,870
Lady, it seems that they don't accept just anyone here.

125
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,200
That's because in the whole land of Goryeo, this a place that tries to feed people.

126
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,240
That's why homeless people gather here. Even people from the North come here.

127
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,850
How do you pass?

128
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,960
That, I don't know...

129
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,500
You bastard! This is not a place where you can enter after committing a crime!

130
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,180
It's not that. It's something that I couldn't control.

131
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,250
Please—

132
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,020
Arrest this person and let the Ham Joo government office know.

133
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,070
Yes!

134
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,530
Then, at least let my children in!

135
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,530
Please at least let my children in!

136
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,310
Sir, Sir!

137
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,280
Next!

138
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,360
Who are you and where are you from? What's your reason for coming here?

139
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,660
Slowly explain it.

140
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,170
Even the slightest lie and you will be severely punished. Do you understand?

141
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,890
I am Boon Yi from Yi Seo Geun (Western district).

142
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,500
This is Ham Joo!

143
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,740
Ah! After coming to Ham Joo, I now feel good.

144
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,660
Hurry and let's go! Let's meet Young Master Bang Gwa and the General.

145
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,620
No.

146
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,500
What is it again?

147
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,430
Before meeting them, we need to figure out what's going on in Ham Joo.

148
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,280
So what are you going to do?

149
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,420
You know a lot of people from here, right?

150
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,260
Are you going to say it like that? Of course, I know everyone from Ham Joo!

151
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,710
Fine. I'll go to an inn first and you secretly infiltrate and

152
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,890
try to find out what Father has been doing these days. Don't let yourself get caught.

153
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,690
We,

154
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,130
from a 5-year-old child to a 80-year-old man,

155
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,730
daily visited that wasteland by removing one rock at a time,

156
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,020
planting the crops and watering them.

157
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,420
I've spent three years like that.

158
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,020
Then, on that day,

159
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,260
the day we'd been hoping for,

160
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,890
was the first harvest, but...

161
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,790
Did you get that taken away from you as well?

162
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,200
I just

163
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,030
said that they can take it.

164
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,960
For something like that,

165
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,950
they can take it and we will just start over.

166
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,140
Like an idiot, it wasn't worth it, it was just food,

167
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,020
and they died while protecting it?

168
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,090
How can they can just kill them for that?

169
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,610
That's why I...

170
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,370
All of the stolen crops,

171
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,280
I burned them.

172
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,140
What? What did you say?

173
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,290
Memorial Service to go with them in paradise.

174
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,000
No.

175
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,800
Although they may wonder for 9000 years,

176
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,070
at least they will be full.

177
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,080
What should we do?

178
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,650
Send her to 13 base.

179
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,740
Let's go.

180
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,430
This is unbelievable, unbelievable!

181
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:49,280
They raised the tax last time as well. Now with tax going up to 90%, what are the people supposed to do?

182
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,460
Shouldn't we just kill them all?

183
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:59,010
After hearing all those shocking stories I'm not surprised any more.

184
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,780
These bastards!

185
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,750
Brother!

186
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,420
After winning back Ssang Sseong Colonial Office,

187
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,810
After I was born... A lifetime!

188
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,530
Stuck out here at the border and fighting foreign enemies.

189
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,630
In the mean time all my soldiers died.

190
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:30,580
All my people who have died thus far, what has spilling their blood accomplished?

191
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,790
The people are becoming increasingly impoverished.

192
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,970
Lee In Gyeom! Gil Tae Mi!

193
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,850
Hong In Bang! These three ministers!

194
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,540
Day by day.

195
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,890
Brother...

196
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,020
This nation,

197
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,190
doesn't get better even by just a bit.

198
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,810
We have fought for so long.

199
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,770
We have endured! But this nation

200
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,000
has not improved. Not even in the slightest.

201
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,530
Not even by a bit.

202
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,600
Come over here.

203
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,670
You should stop crying now.

204
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,290
Father Pal Bong, just wait for a little bit.

205
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,780
I have passed one obstacle now.

206
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,430
Bang Gwa brought a document from military camp, and suggested submitting it to the government.

207
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:09,600
General said it might be a spy, so he gave the order to capture the author of the document.

208
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,020
What's in it?

209
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,900
That, I don't know either.

210
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,980
The General, General Lee Ji Ran, and Young Master Bang Gwa—only these three saw it.

211
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,900
I think the content must be extraordinary.

212
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,250
Where is it? I have to see it.

213
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,060
That's probably with the person investigating it.

214
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,600
If they're going to look for the person who wrote it, wouldn't they be comparing and checking handwriting?

215
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,690
Who is investigating it?

216
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,600
Lee Shin... Lee Shin Jeok? They said he's the Jin Mu Bu Ui.

217
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,570
- Lee Shin Jeok?
- Yes.

218
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,960
It's been three years since he came here. It's my first time hearing that name.

219
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,770
I have brought everyone.

220
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,350
It's here.

221
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,650
Okay, everyone. Write the character "An" for peace.

222
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,660
That person is Lee Shin Jeok.

223
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,490
Looking at his clothes, it has got to be him. That person has the documents.

224
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,290
Next, write the character "Bang" for country.

225
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,540
But Bang Won, you must not do anything reckless.

226
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,360
Brother Heo Gang?

227
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,210
Contrast handwriting

228
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,240
Among these people, there is nobody with the same handwriting.

229
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,350
Tomorrow we will broaden the scope of the investigation. Go deliver the message to Lee Bang Gwa.

230
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,020
Yes.

231
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,210
Three.

232
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,710
Why? Did you forget something?

233
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,720
Brother Heo Gang.

234
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,470
I was worried about you, Brother Heo Gang.

235
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,420
After I came here, I knew I would see you someday.

236
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,870
It's a relief that you're looking good. How have you been all this time?

237
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,600
I have abandoned that name, Heo Gang.

238
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,740
Anyway, I am no longer Heo Gang. I am Lee Seong Gye's troop's 1st military officer, Lee Shin Jeok.

239
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,650
- Still, Brother—
- So I'm definitely not your brother anymore.

240
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,470
I just want to follow General to war and start a new life.

241
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,880
- He uses his left hand.
- Who? That Heo Gang person?

242
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
No. Lee Shin Jeok.

243
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,780
Heo Gang uses his right hand.

244
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,600
So what?

245
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,350
In all of Ham Joo, about a hundred or so people can write.

246
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:22,230
But out of those investigated they didn't find the writer.

247
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,880
Could it be?

248
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,980
Could it be what?

249
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,110
We'll know once we get there.

250
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,290
Go? Where?

251
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,730
Let's go in.

252
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,650
What is that? We have to get out soon.

253
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,570
"Prepare the people for military training in peacetime

254
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,650
to prepare for foreign aggression."

255
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,190
That's just an obvious thing. Let's go out and talk. Let's go!

256
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,260
New furnishing number one.

257
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,150
"Combine 100 units in to 1 section"

258
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,810
All of the people

259
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,240
belong to General's military camp."

260
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,320
Ah, putting together the military and agriculture? It's easy to say but that one is difficult!

261
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,090
Let's get out.

262
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,390
Using the tax collected from the northeast region

263
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,090
to create a self-sufficient governing nation.

264
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,010
Ah! Provisions from taxes?

265
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,250
What? To be independent?

266
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,740
If it's like this..

267
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,310
If it's the Northeast, either the military or the administrative part

268
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,590
will be independent.

269
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,120
Sure, so it was that all along.

270
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,640
Bang.

271
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,990
a country. (Bi Bang)

272
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,300
Bang(a country) Bi Bang(area not a country)

273
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,090
A region that's not part of the country, the Northeast,

274
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,030
will become an independent region.

275
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,880
It will become the base of a revolution!

276
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,970
Let me take a look.

277
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,620
To be able to do this, there are two plans.

278
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,710
An. Byeon. Chaek.

279
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,020
That's right. This is the An Byeon Chaek!

280
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,370
It sounds good but will this be accepted by the government?

281
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,440
There must have been a plan make this happen. That's why it was submitted to my father.

282
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,280
The problem is...

283
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,360
More than the government office,

284
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,830
it will be harder to go through the General. Is that it?

285
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,690
That's right. That's why he needs me.

286
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,530
You've worked hard.

287
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,910
We have to follow him.

288
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,000
Why?

289
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,840
That An Byeon Chaek... Lee Shin Jeok put it out.

290
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,940
Brother Heo Gang is right-handed.

291
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,160
Did you say you are Boon Yi from the Western district?

292
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,700
Yes, that's correct.

293
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,430
However, why are you like this? How—

294
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,780
What is this?

295
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,000
That... It was made by my mother's friend--

296
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,790
Shut up!

297
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:35,450
We have intelligence information that there have been spies sneaking into camp as migrants

298
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,690
and this figurine is proof.

299
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,700
Just tell the truth.

300
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,550
No, I...

301
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,620
I really do not know what you're saying.

302
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,250
What is that organization? What is it about spies?

303
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,980
I don't do things such as torture.

304
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,540
I can just catch the spies.

305
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,960
I'm going to ask you one more time, with what motive

306
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,640
did you go into Ham Joo?

307
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,470
I've been suspicious of you since the homeless people inspection.

308
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,410
Don't even think about getting away. Just answer my questions.

309
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,180
Before entering, my belongings were searched.

310
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,930
Of course you would have discovered the wooden soldier.

311
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,360
But why didn't you arrest me right then?

312
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,440
- That's because I have to observe you and—
- Yes.

313
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,670
You could release me first and ask me who I'm in contact with. After identifying me, you could just arrested me.

314
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:48,380
I still haven't contacted anyone and yet you arrested me in the middle of the night!

315
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,050
Also, not in the barracks but deep in the forest.

316
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,880
What is this woman saying?

317
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,040
Also, after looking at it, this person

318
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,800
is surely from General Lee Seong Gye's 3rd barracks.

319
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,700
But how is it that you brought soldiers who belong to the 3rd barracks and are doing investigation?

320
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,390
Elder Military Officer.

321
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,930
If I'm correct,

322
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,220
I am not being investigated.

323
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,040
Currently, right here,

324
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,610
I am being tested for something.

325
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,350
Am I wrong?

326
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,690
You have the same necklace as mine.

327
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,600
I will put my life on the line.

328
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,010
I don't have time.

329
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,510
I have village people waiting for me.

330
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,290
I have things to tell him and things I need to ask.

331
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,930
Please tell that person that Boon Yi from Lee So Geun has come and he should keep his promise!

332
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,720
This is the secret order.

333
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,290
"Close down the seven strongholds and gather into Ham Joo.

334
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,190
Be one of Lee Seong Gye's people."

335
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,100
Coming to Ham Joo,

336
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,690
I welcome you.

337
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,880
Young Master, now...

338
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,460
Aigoo. Please stop! You said you have something important to do.

339
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,670
I have to do it. That important thing.

340
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,300
With those people.

341
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,850
It's that bastard.

342
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,600
We just have to take that bastard to Head Monk Jeok Ryong at Bi Guk Temple.

343
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,900
Who is this? If it isn't the fake monk Jeok Ryong?

344
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,320
Seriously, what in the world.

345
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,320
A monk going into the gisaeng house during the day.

346
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,540
This is really tasty. It's fits my taste buds.

347
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,890
I heard you can buy few houses with few baskets of these.

348
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,170
We're not close enough to be joking around like this.

349
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,700
Why? What's the matter?

350
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Jeok Ryong.

351
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,930
What do you think I came to buy from an information merchant?

352
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,130
Obviously to buy information.

353
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,780
The head of Bi Guk Temple came to Hwa Sa Dan to buy information?

354
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,840
Who killed Baek Yoon?

355
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,720
Give me the info and swallow that.

356
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,000
We're both doing business.

357
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,920
People in Songak say this ...

358
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,950
Hong In Bang probably killed Baek Yoon.

359
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,330
Why?

360
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,800
Because Hong In Bang gained the most after Baek Yoon was killed.

361
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:54,250
Hong In Bang is your best customer, but that Jeok Ryong of Bi Guk Temple

362
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,860
came to me, of all people,

363
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,110
to ask about who killed Baek Yoon.

364
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,670
You don't know?

365
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,920
Yahhhh...I'm really disappointed.

366
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,820
It's something that happened in Gaegyeong so the Hwa Sa Dan should know about it.

367
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,830
When are you going to use your trick?

368
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,890
The legendary girls, the most beautiful ones.

369
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,910
Does she really exist?

370
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,390
Stop talking nonsense.

371
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,120
The reason why you suddenly became curious about me,

372
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,500
I want to buy that information.

373
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:04,250
Something came up in connection to Baek Yoon's killer, right?

374
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:10,080
If it't not that, then you wouldn't be curious about something that's already on trial.

375
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,670
How is it? Are you going to sell it?

376
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,590
Fine. There is some kind of organization.

377
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,730
We caught a person involved with that organization and were doing an investigation.

378
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:30,300
A swordsman possessing skills that are unheard of came and rescued that person.

379
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,370
Where? Right in front of my eyes.

380
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,880
What kind of organization is it?

381
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:48,110
I don't know. She was taken away before we could investigate. But originally there's no sword skill like that.

382
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,400
No matter how much I looked, I couldn't figure out who it was.

383
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:58,550
So wouldn't that swordsman be Baek Yoon's killer?

384
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,760
I thought about this.

385
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,930
We weren't originally chasing after a secret organization, but

386
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,590
someone asked me to look for someone, and

387
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,810
while doing so, things got more complicated. That's everything. We're done, right?

388
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,720
The person you were looking for... Who is it?

389
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,680
Jeong Do Jeon.

390
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,460
There will be movement soon. Watch carefully.

391
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,190
Yes.

392
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:48,490
Since I've already thrown the bait, Cho Yeong, that wench, won't be able to stay still.

393
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,480
Find out about what happened in Bi Guk Temple during the past days.

394
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,440
Go to the center of your assigned identity and region.

395
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,850
Grab ahold of all information and report it.

396
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,980
Investigate Baek Yoon's death from the start and report it.

397
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,790
Yes!

398
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,580
Should we also communicate with Ja Il Saek?

399
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,150
No. Until Ja Il Saek contacts us personally,

400
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,070
never interfere.

401
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,840
Yes, I understand.

402
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,600
Elder Hong In Bang is here.

403
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,210
It's been a long time since we've met..

404
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,970
Where are you returning from?

405
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,970
We've been looking for you for a long time.

406
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,340
Why?

407
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,080
Choi Yeong came and made a commotion.
(Gil Tae Mi)

408
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:54,270
It's because of the Western district. He said that if the taxes are not rolled back, the alliance will be broken.

409
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:59,120
So? are you scared?

410
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,600
Scared? It's just that I thought it might be a problem.

411
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:25,820
There's a misunderstanding regarding Elder Baek Yoon's death.

412
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,480
Firstly, I would like to apologize.

413
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,750
Well, I'll accept your apology.

414
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,370
Sit.

415
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,150
I wanted to ask you once.

416
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,700
Since we met like this, I'll just ask anyway.

417
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,610
Yes, of course. Say what you have to, please.

418
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:59,850
About that land which reached it's limit. Taxes at 90%.

419
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:00,380
Yes.

420
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,660
Because of that, Lee In Gyeom is suffering from Choi Yeong.

421
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,670
You don't have to worry about that.

422
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,290
Don't worry? But what if, with one blow...

423
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,920
They won't be able to do it anyway.

424
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,640
How?

425
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,870
To run a country, a lot of things need to be included.

426
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,790
Where would the soldiers we need to fight off Japanese pirates come from?

427
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,100
If not for us, this country wouldn't function.

428
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,630
Could it be that the reason why you didn't go to Lee In Gyeom, although he called for you, is...

429
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,930
I am not rebelling against Lee In Gyeom.

430
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:38,780
But we have to arrange the rankings according to the level that fits us.

431
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,480
We can decrease the taxes to 70%.

432
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,770
Lee In Gyeom should also consult us about the country,

433
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,750
and, in all, should earn our consent. That's what I'm saying.

434
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,070
Yes. Instead of giving us orders, he should consult with us.

435
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,590
In that way, we will also gain power.

436
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:04,690
Yes. Is there anything that you can't do more than Yi Ui Min?

437
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:11,100
Garnering strength, you should be 'a man under one but above many.'

438
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:18,150
Okay, let's drink to Elder Gil Tae Mi joining
the Mun Ha Shi Jung in the future.
(Mun Ha Shi Jung: Goryeo's highest government office)

439
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,450
Cheers.

440
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,840
Do you really not know?

441
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,060
That man, Hong In Bang, is checking you out right now.

442
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,340
Without them, the country cannot function,

443
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,700
but I'm saying that they shouldn't just do as they please.
[Choi Yeong]

444
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,030
I.

445
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,410
I'll take care of it and restrain it, General.

446
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,330
Do you have a plan?

447
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,120
I'm asking if you have an alternative for those people.

448
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,120
An alternative...
Lee In Gyeom

449
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,790
There has to be an alternative.

450
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,340
If it's Lee Seong Gye,

451
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,420
it is a possibility.

452
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,830
But...

453
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:22,680
Should I call Lord Hong In Bang back to Do Hwa Jeon?

454
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,080
Stop it, it's enough.

455
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,650
What's that commotion?

456
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,710
Didn't they finish the morning ceremony of placing Buddha's statue?

457
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,260
Yes. It has ended but there was an astrologer from the west with them.

458
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,310
It appears that the woman is looking at people's fortunes.

459
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,160
They said she came from the West.

460
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,750
Are you reading constellations?

461
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:16,140
I'm trying to match the movements of Cheon Gi to human affairs.

462
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,410
I was word in January of the year of 1318.

463
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:26,190
I have been pondering on something these days.

464
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,300
What should I do?

465
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,790
It is the Cheon Gi Seong.
(Cheon Gi Seong: name of the star)

466
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:36,900
Fire penetrated the wood and couldn't reach Tae Baek.
(She's explaining his constellation)

467
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,680
At the moment, there is no visible path, whether to the front or to the back.

468
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,590
There is no way?

469
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,370
You're saying one who originally has concerns cannot do anything.

470
00:38:54,370 --> 00:39:00,170
In that note, it could be described as Hok Se Mu Min.
(Hok Se Mu Min: A ploy to disturb the world and deceive people)

471
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,570
Enjoy that as a form of entertainment.

472
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,570
There is a path for you upward.

473
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,080
Upward, you say?

474
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,750
The top of Cheon Goong is the north.
Yeon Hee

475
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,670
If the Buk Nak Sa Mun can be seen in the sky, it will bring good luck.

476
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,940
Buk Nak Sa Mun?
(Could mean the fish constellation or the military force at the northern border)

477
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,570
It's a star protecting the northern sky.

478
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:42,710
In this land, it would be the northeast.

479
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:49,390
Seeing the look on your face, it seems that you have figured out the answer.

480
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,640
If you follow your heart

481
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,460
fortune will come from the star of the Shepherd.

482
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,750
Star of the Shepherd in the northeast?

483
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,760
A surname that has Wood Mok in it...

484
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,220
Surname Lee. Lee Seong Gye.
(Mok Character: meaning of Lee Seong Gye's surname)

485
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,400
Surely,

486
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,900
is that person the only alternative?

487
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:25,080
Ham Joo

488
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,650
Is the work not tiring?

489
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,070
Indeed, there are a lot of clothes to wash.

490
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,650
But if you compare it to farming, then it's nothing much.

491
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,680
If you don't have anything else to say, then I'll leave now.

492
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,710
I see. You may leave.

493
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,280
Bon Won wants to see you. Look ahead.

494
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,920
Following the stream where you do laundry, if you go down about five units, there will be a trail.

495
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,180
If you follow that path, there will be a stone tower. Wait there.

496
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,150
How did that girl know Bon Won?

497
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,290
From Western district,

498
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,030
Boon Yi.

499
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,370
Meddlesome, mannerless, and reckless.

500
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:46,670
She can lie really well and will bite when she's angry.

501
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,500
You should be careful too, Brother.

502
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,350
As I told you, I am not your brother.

503
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,280
Let's have a talk.

504
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,340
I've nothing to say to you.

505
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,790
"Break down the seven walls

506
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,800
and gather in Ham Joo."

507
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,190
Lady.

508
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,960
Lady. I'm up here.

509
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,980
Oh, sir! What are you doing up there?!

510
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,980
I'm doing first level training.

511
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,990
First level. As you may know, I'm not someone who should be doing first level training, right?

512
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,810
Right?

513
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,220
Still, you have to start from the bottom and slowly take your chances.

514
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,390
Hurry and go back to your position. Understand?

515
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,670
Then.

516
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,120
Lady— Lady!

517
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,120
This isn't it...

518
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,060
You said I was best....
I almost fell off.

519
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,620
Ahjussi.

520
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,320
Even though I'm not sure,

521
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:58,750
you already know that much. Now, you called me out here, defenseless, to a quiet place. What's next?

522
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,130
Who is it?

523
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:04,030
Who is on top of this and leading your organization?

524
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,750
Lee Shin Jeok

525
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,780
If I get caught, I would bite my tongue off here and die.

526
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,430
Whatever you try, that person is-—

527
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,790
Father wants to meet that person.

528
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:22,010
For what that organization is doing, don't they need Father?

529
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,420
Then why didn't they pass the An Byeon Chaek?

530
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,000
An Byeon Chaek: A plan to stabilize the border

531
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,190
General knows about it too?

532
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:36,050
Yes and he wants to meet that person.

533
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:41,210
Tonight at Ja Shi, the place is at the memorial shrine of Hong Yoon Myo.
(Ja Shi: Between 11pm and 1am)

534
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:46,460
You and that person. My father and I. Just four people. Everyone should be unarmed.

535
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,480
Please keep that promise.

536
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,070
Pardon?!

537
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,080
You said General really wants to meet that person?

538
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,900
Yes! Finally, the General is getting involved!

539
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,730
I'm lying.

540
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,710
Father never said that.

541
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,510
Young Master, are you insane?

542
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,280
Why would you do that?

543
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,120
Father is like a mountain,

544
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,610
and this is something that requires moving a mountain.

545
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,950
I'll meet that person before him.

546
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:30,140
Then, with that person, I will move a mountain.

547
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,870
I'll do that, for sure.

548
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,610
I've met him.

549
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,190
Thank you for helping me out.

550
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,600
Okay. What did he decide to do?

551
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,160
Ajussi said to use me as a messenger.

552
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,020
'Ajussi'?

553
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,080
Never mind.

554
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,040
Read it.

555
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,960
It's okay for me read to you?

556
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,850
Bon Won said that

557
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:11,780
he trusts you, so I guess I will do that too from now on.

558
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:26,490
If General Lee Seong Gye's reaction to the An Byeon Chaek is like that, then I will personally—

559
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:34,310
I'll meet Lee Seong Gye in person.

560
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:38,850
It's difficult but make it possible.

561
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,000
Does Bon Won think that way as well?

562
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,030
But will the General meet him?

563
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,920
Actually, it's already been arranged.

564
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,010
I heard that General Lee Seong Gye wants to meet that person himself.

565
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:58,510
Oh. That's good then even if I'm not sure.

566
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,600
That side proposed it first?

567
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,230
They know about our organization?

568
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:09,790
That's why they asked to arranged this meeting.

569
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,330
Sure, I'll get going now.

570
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,630
But what if it's a trap?

571
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:31,440
General Lee is not someone who would do that.

572
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,870
Yes.

573
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,660
I know it isn't my place,

574
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:44,140
but in this world I grew up in, there's no such thing
as "that kind of person, not that kind of person".

575
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,950
Right there.

576
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,870
We decided to meet there.

577
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:08,280
I'll wait right here.

578
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,420
If General Lee Seong Gye shows up, I'll go to Ajussi and let him know.

579
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:23,100
If anything strange happens outside, immediately blow on this thing.

580
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,610
Yes.

581
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,460
Are you really alright?

582
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,670
Will he really come out?

583
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,430
What if it's a trap?

584
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:45,960
Stay here and watch. If needed, you must come running right away.

585
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,060
I would be running, but...

586
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:57,390
Ah, really, can he really do this without the General's permission?

587
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:19,190
Please, please be there, you must be there.

588
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,710
Why are you alone?

589
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,540
Why did you come alone then?

590
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,990
He will come soon.

591
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,820
That person will come soon too.

592
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:39,510
It's past the promised time, how?

593
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:44,520
You didn't lie to me so that I would bring him to you?

594
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,600
It was a trap!

595
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,310
It isn't a lie.

596
00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:00,930
We decided that I would greet him first and then meet my father.

597
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,550
If you wait a bit more...

598
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,340
So it was a trap. Lee Bang Won.

599
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:29,040
Darn it. I knew this would happen.

600
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,700
Young Master.

601
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,660
Ahjussi!

602
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,230
Ahjussi!

603
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,050
Ahjussi, there's a huge problem!

604
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,960
General, General, General!

605
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,630
Wait, what's the ruckus?

606
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:15,750
Just now, Young Master Bang Won got kidnapped.

607
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,490
What are you talking about?

608
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:20,790
How did he get kidnapped?

609
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:25,440
Bang Won? How is that he is here?

610
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,200
Um, that..

611
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,740
Just spit it out!

612
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:33,070
I'll tell you everything.

613
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,750
Aiyo. Was it wrong to come here?

614
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:48,030
Shouldn't I just have caught the Viper?

615
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,950
What should I do with this person?

616
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,840
He is injured. It's too much to drag two people with us.

617
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,480
Just kill him.

618
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,210
What are you guys?

619
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:00,600
Hurry and escape. It's Bon Won's order.

620
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,010
What are you talking about?

621
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:05,800
Please come out for a little bit. I have something to tell you.

622
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,900
What are you talking about?

623
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,570
I have a servant protecting me.

624
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,530
I saved you again.

625
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,840
It must be our fate.

626
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,210
Please be quiet.

627
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,280
My servant has probably reported everything.

628
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,830
He probably misunderstood that I got kidnapped.

629
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,780
The soldiers have probably already been mobilized.

630
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,440
Leave me, go ahead and block it.

631
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,290
Tell them that I am safe and it's all a misunderstanding.

632
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:08,060
If he's already reported everything, then my identity must have already been found out. Do you think they will believe me?

633
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,220
You should be the one to stop it. Go!

634
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:15,110
You. Can you run while carrying me on your back?

635
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:18,380
Me? Why?

636
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,060
Bang Won!

637
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,720
Young Master!

638
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:30,430
I will slit this wench's throat.

639
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:42,760
Between you wenches, I already know that there is a secret organization.

640
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:50,470
I also know that those bastards kidnapped our young master.

641
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,230
It's not me. It's really not me!

642
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,310
Confess.

643
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,040
Where is he?

644
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,100
Tell me!

645
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:11,170
If not, your neck will be separated from your head.

646
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,580
You guys are going to stay quiet?

647
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:30,780
Then, I will cut this wench's head off first and ask again.

648
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,850
Stop, stop!

649
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:36,130
Stop, stop!

650
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,490
Stop, stop!

651
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,300
He wasn't kidnapped.

652
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,300
We've found Bang Won!

653
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,110
He's safe.

654
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,900
But!

655
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,600
It is true that you have bad intentions for coming into Ham Joo.

656
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,050
General.

657
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,370
I will take this opportunity to fish out that organization

658
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,890
so it doesn't happen again.

659
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:21,330
All the things you told me, are they all just lies?

660
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:28,180
About your village's people dying and about that young girl, Uh Nyeon's death,

661
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,920
and the tears you have shed.

662
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,790
No, It isn't a lie.

663
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:40,990
It's not just me. The homeless people who gathered here in Ham Joo for the past years

664
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,910
are all the same.

665
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:49,280
In this whole land of Goryeo, I only have my small self.

666
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,440
That's why I came here. It's the truth.

667
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:59,490
If not for you taking us in, all of us

668
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:04,750
are just people who would be corpses rotting on the walkways.

669
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,410
The reason why that person

670
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:17,030
sent us to you, General, is because our despair, hopes,

671
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:20,470
and dreams will be accepted.

672
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,520
I think that is the meaning of being saved in this world.

673
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,170
Then who is it?

674
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:41,710
Reveal everything. General is asking.

675
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,500
That person...

676
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,750
That person...

677
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,660
Right here.

678
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,940
I am that person.

679
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,970
Ahjussi..

680
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:26,120
Ahjussi?

681
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:37,270
That, that person..!

682
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,230
War should not be decided by those who have power!

683
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,860
It's not something that can be decided by old people.

684
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,490
That man is the Jantgar.

685
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,790
Jantgar: Strongest man

686
00:58:55,770 --> 00:59:01,500
The owner of the New Joseon is Jangpyeong Gate's Jantgar.

687
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:08,930
It's me. Jeong Do Jeon.

688
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,740
Six Flying Dragons

689
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,370
Do you think I will waver because of one word from a scholar I just met?

690
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:31,890
- He's a person we can trust.
- I will not do it.

691
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,620
I'm asking you why you called Lee Seong Gye to block my path.

692
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,860
I'm thinking of helping you.

693
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,020
What exactly are you saying?

694
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,540
I need you, Brother, and you also need me.

695
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,360
What are you? What are you doing?

696
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,430
- Why is it me?
- I'm going to defeat those three people and establish a new country.

697
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:48,540
I chose you.
