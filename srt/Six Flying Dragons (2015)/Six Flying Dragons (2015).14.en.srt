1
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,080
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,770
Yeon Hee, for what reason

3
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,590
are you doing this dangerous and scary job?

4
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,470
What about you?

5
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,350
I, at least, work as story teller.

6
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,290
The Viper.

7
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,450
You are the assassin who killed Baek Yoon

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,870
and stirred up Do Dang and this country's political powers.

9
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,530
I don't think you can say that to me.

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,110
Yeon Hee.

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,890
I don't know why you came to this path but

12
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,760
stop. Please.

13
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,770
You are not someone who can and would do this.

14
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,750
Don't act like you know me.

15
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,580
People are meant to change.

16
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,190
As you live many things happen.

17
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,870
Amidst the things that happen, you become yourself as you choose which one to follow.

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,480
I have chosen certain things.

19
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,650
And this is me right now, as are you, also.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,510
I

21
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,800
still

22
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,870
hate seeing you.

23
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,130
Leave.

24
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,400
♫ Someday, at the end of life  ♫

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,050
♫ I will call for you like crazy ♫

26
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:38,090
♫ You, who resemble my tears ♫

27
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,820
♫ I miss you the more I love you ♫

28
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,670
My plan is Haedong Gapjok.

29
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,010
But, I am the most-liked countryman among the countrymen in the northeast.
(Lee Seong Gye)

30
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,220
Then will they support our family?

31
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,000
Then what can we do?

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,160
You wanted individual influence in the Do Dang.

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,780
Furthermore, didn't you want a respectable influence?
(Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon)

34
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,850
Are you resenting me?

35
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,360
Why wouldn't I? I am blaming you.

36
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,160
I probably will, even while doing this job. You have to endure that.

37
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,910
So you were someone that knew how to laugh.

38
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,960
Fine.

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,730
Let's endure it.

40
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,800
I'll endure it and you who have to serve this hard master. We'll endure it together.

41
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,070
Father, Teacher Po Eun is here.

42
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,010
Did you find out?

43
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,000
I am going to meet Uh Eun from the Min family.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,850
But what are the reasons for them to support General Lee, who has just recently entered the Do Dang.

45
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,040
Even if they decide to,

46
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,600
do you think they would if they have to have Hong In Bang as their enemy?

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,410
They probably will. But for 700 years, they

48
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,280
have chosen, with their scary judgement, which group to support during important times.

49
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,620
Please make time for me to meet them.

50
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,740
I can persuade them why it is General Lee.

51
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,750
I am Lee Bang Won, the fifth son of General Lee.

52
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,260
Please teach me a lot.

53
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,290
General Lee has just entered the Do Dang.

54
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,940
Our work to build a new country has just begun.

55
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,970
Also, the more important thing than building a new country is

56
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,210
deciding what kind of new country to build. You cannot forget that at any time.

57
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,740
Yes, we understand.

58
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,400
Come in.

59
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,550
There's another woman to introduce, but for now try to familiarize this child.

60
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,710
You said you are Boon Yi?

61
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,650
Yes, I am Boon Yi.

62
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:28,050
She know how to read and write. So if there are messages to send, send them through her.

63
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,910
She is in control of the people in the market as well.

64
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,900
But, Elder Brother.

65
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,350
I heard that for General Lee's power, you chose Haedong Gapjok.

66
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,370
Do you have a way to persuade them?

67
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,830
A way?

68
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,920
General Lee?

69
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,210
Yes. About General Lee.

70
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,970
What do you think about him?

71
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,940
He is someone to admire.

72
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,970
Then please support him.

73
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,830
Min Jae
(Haedong Gapjok's leader, Uh Eun)

74
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,200
What kind of power do I have?

75
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,410
I alone do not have the power to stop all of them.

76
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,280
We need General Lee.

77
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,320
If it's General Lee then General Chae Young might as well help us also.

78
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,190
Therefore, please meet one of General Lee's men.

79
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,100
But I...

80
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,570
Elder, it seems like you have to come out for a moment.

81
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,680
Who are you?

82
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,710
I am Cho Young, the leader of Hwa Sa Dan.

83
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,860
I have come here at Elder Minister Hong In Bang's request.
(Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan's Owner)

84
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,520
What did you send?

85
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,230
I have send my son's Sajoo to the Ming Jae family.
(Sajoo - birthdate, and way of asking for marriage from the man's side.)

86
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,200
I sent Cho Young from Hwa Sa Dan.

87
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,970
Wow, then my in laws' laws become Haedong Gapjok?

88
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,640
But then, why did you send Cho Young?

89
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:31,360
The whole world knows that Hwa Sa Dan has worked for Hap Ha.

90
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,090
We have to show him that after Hap Ha was removed, I took control of Hwa Sa Dang as well.

91
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,210
But you know they act all cool and stuff

92
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,780
and only arrange marriages among themselves.

93
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,480
Perhaps, they wouldn't reject it, right?

94
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,620
I should not make a mistakes with them, but

95
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,630
they should also not make any mistakes with me.

96
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,340
SaJoo

97
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:26,460
It is Hong In Bang's third son's sajoo.

98
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,210
In the end they will eventually pick us. There are three reasons.

99
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,740
First, it is the autonomy of the northeast that General Lee has.

100
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,360
The other nobles, no matter how much land they have, they just have to confiscate it.

101
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,980
But now, the northeast

102
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,460
has become General's base that no one in Goryeo can overtake.

103
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,890
They will know that.

104
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:10,100
Second, it is our leader's decision to become the only power house among everyone.

105
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,590
It is a stupid thing in a political way.

106
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:20,210
But in the end, that made General Lee different from the current people in the do dang.

107
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,560
General Lee became the symbol of the anti-Do Dang.

108
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,800
They will read the common people's thoughts.

109
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:36,620
They have experienced the common people's thoughts, which they viewed as weak, can cut through the flow of power at some point.

110
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,760
And the third reason is...

111
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,070
Haedong Gapjok will think that it will be easy to control General Lee.

112
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,920
I think that you have to go now.
(Lee Shin Jeok)

113
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,470
Po Eun is looking for you.

114
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,380
If we accept the marriage, then our family will become the people's enemy, along with Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi,

115
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,660
and will make Lee Seong Gye our enemy.

116
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,070
What are your thoughts?

117
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,770
Is it marriage with Hong In Bang or holding hands with Lee Seong Gye?

118
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,930
I think your question is stated incorrectly.

119
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,040
What do you mean?

120
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,530
It is not whether it's Hong In Bang or Lee Seong Gye.

121
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,570
I think it's whether it's General Chae Young or General Lee.
That is the correct question.

122
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,740
How come?

123
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,870
I think there will be a revolt in a short time.

124
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,750
What? Revolt?

125
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,630
General Chae Young will look for the right time and will eventually take out Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi..

126
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,320
Since Lee In Gyeom is not in the do dang there will be no obstacle.

127
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,050
So? You are saying our family needs protection as well?

128
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,130
Yes. It is a time of disturbance and a time when protection is needed.

129
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,990
Then, if it were you, who would you choose?

130
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,250
I, for many reasons,

131
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,400
think General Lee is the right choice.

132
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,400
Hong In Bang asked for marriage?

133
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,910
Uh Eun should be bewildered. He wouldn't be able to reject the marriage request.

134
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,820
If that happens there's no solution for us.

135
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,680
That Hong In Bang bastard has a clever mind... Should just go and hit him!

136
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,630
Can't we just send a marriage request as well?

137
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,840
There is Ban Gang young master and....

138
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,370
Myu Hyul, that is why you are far behind.

139
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,200
What do you mean?

140
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,230
Look. At the peak.

141
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,170
Gun Moon Sae Jeok (The highest nobles)

142
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,510
The group that has long history and has political power.

143
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,470
So what's next to that?

144
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,330
Haedong Gapjok.

145
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,590
Hae... Haedong Gapjok?

146
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,980
The group that doesn't really have interest in political powers, but

147
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,660
for more than 700 years they've kept their high status and

148
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,910
also their properties are like... a lot!

149
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,420
On top of that, if it's drawings or musical instruments, they are good.

150
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,640
Education, they have that as well. There is nothing they are missing.

151
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,960
That is!

152
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,780
But General Lee also has land!

153
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,380
He has all the swords, horses

154
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,460
and bows!

155
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,860
Still, with that, it is not the same for the countrymen with power.

156
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,200
The thing is that, from the past they did not consider their countrymen as a group with the same status as theirs.

157
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,400
What did you just say!

158
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,580
No, why do you so much anger in your heart?

159
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,010
What I am trying to say is that, yes, General Lee someone to inspire us,

160
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,710
and he is very famous. However—

161
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:00,400
Oh, that's right. I think what he said is all true.

162
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,640
On top of that, they already received a marriage request.

163
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:11,120
But if we send a marriage request as well, that means war with the other group.

164
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,990
Do you understand?

165
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:20,700
Father, Hong In Bang's era won't go for too long.

166
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,550
This marriage cannot happen.

167
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,330
But the reason to reject...

168
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,050
I made sure there were no other marriage requests,

169
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,970
so they shouldn't be able to reject it.

170
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,150
They shouldn't be.

171
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,390
After four or five days pass, you should go greet them.

172
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,170
Then the marriage will be sealed.

173
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,170
Did you come because you were hungry? Sit. Let's eat together.

174
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,740
Is there something you want to say?

175
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,670
Father, Teacher.

176
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,860
There is a way to stop Hong In Bang's marriage.

177
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,210
There is a way to hold hands with Haedong Gapjok.

178
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,500
What is that?

179
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,400
That is...

180
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,850
My plan is...

181
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,470
That sounds like a good plan.

182
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,220
You did well.

183
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,890
- That is a good plan?
- Yes.

184
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,450
So it does not matter to you even if I execute that plan?

185
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,830
No, it doesn't.

186
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,160
Really, nothing? Are you telling the truth?

187
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,230
Yeah. There really isn't. You really are a great comrade.

188
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,700
For real! Dammit.

189
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,790
So it does not matter at all to you, but is it only I who am going crazy and am worried about you?

190
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,810
You are not the type of person to stop your plan just because you are worried about me.

191
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,410
No, I am not that kind of person.

192
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,710
I am the crazy guy that stamps my own fathers stamp.

193
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,290
Yeah.

194
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,150
So stop whining just because you were worried about me for a little bit.

195
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,910
Whine?

196
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:06,200
In this Goryeo, since I was born there are too many things I do not understand.

197
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,790
But do you know what I understand the least?

198
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,680
The reason why I am like this about you.

199
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:21,650
I'm about to go crazy because you rejected me.
Do you know why I am like this?

200
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,080
Laugh? How can you laugh?

201
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,310
I am gloating.

202
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:33,000
Since a noble like you is acting like this about me, I feel so good.

203
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,310
Oh, that girl... Really.

204
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,750
Yah!

205
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,690
I'm going crazy, for real.

206
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,820
Are you really crazy?

207
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,530
Why are you suddenly not leaving, even after being chased like that by the monks?

208
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,920
- I can't leave right now.
- What is so hard?

209
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,050
What made things so complicated?

210
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,490
What did you say to me?

211
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,850
For my mother who was dragged to the pig's pen.

212
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:09,710
For my little brother who died of hunger.
You said let's pay back the guys who made it like that.

213
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,250
That is why I followed you. I did not say let's do that.

214
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,650
If you say you cannot do it, I can leave.

215
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,970
I can forget everything. But why?

216
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,590
Why are you saying you are going to stay here again? For what reason?

217
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,850
I'm sorry.

218
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:45,830
♫ I live, I have lived

219
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,000
♫ I have lived in Cheong San.

220
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:01,350

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,310
♫ sleeps, wakes up, and cries

♫ Yallari Yalla

230
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,020
There is someone from General Lee's house.

231
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,900
It is the fifth son of the general. He is asking to see you.

232
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,590
General Lee has brought his son?

233
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,530
They are probably asking for a union.

234
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:29,650
Now that is hard to do I am going to go and politely reject it.

235
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:35,130
Father, it is not right for you to go meet a guest who did not even make an appointment.

236
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,020
Also, since the family's son came

237
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,830
it also does not suit your standards for you to go personally.

238
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,530
So, I'll go and politely reject it.

239
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,700
I am Min Da Kyoung, the daughter of Uh Eun Min Jae, from the Min family in Hyangyeo.

240
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,740
I am Lee Bang Won, the fifth son of Hwaryung Booyoon,
Lee Syung Gae, from the Lee family in Jungju.

241
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,750
Sit down please.

242
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,160
I sent the Duk Pal family to Hamjoo.

243
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,410
There will be a message from the south market.

244
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,950
Okay, be careful.

245
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,050
Ta Dah!

246
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,730
I was wondering where you always went. You came to trade for taffy?

247
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,940
Yes.

248
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,810
Where did young master Bang Won go dressed up all fashionably.

249
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,480
Probably somewhere good.

250
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,310
How would I know where he went.

251
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,190
Oh. But,

252
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,010
you cannot act and speak so informally to him like that.

253
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,040
You will really get in trouble.

254
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,700
Young master is a noble.

255
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,080
He is different from us.

256
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,590
That is right.

257
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,660
To me... You can speak informally to me.

258
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,480
Treat me any way you want.

259
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,780
But do not do that to Young Master.

260
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,060
You will really get in trouble.

261
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,720
That is right.

262
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,910
I will get in big trouble, right?

263
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,150
I for sure cannot do that, right?

264
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,540
Are you crying?

265
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,010
That isn't something to cry about. You can just do better from now on.

266
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,830
I heard everything well, but

267
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,710
alliance between the families is not possible.

268
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,660
I gave you three reasons to why we should hold hands.

269
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,260
Nothing comes to your mind?

270
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,800
The first thing you mentioned,

271
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,360
that your family controls the land in the northeast side.

272
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,670
That is an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time.

273
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,890
It means that your family has no power if you leave the northeast side.

274
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,990
Second reason.

275
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,210
You said you will rule over everyone without gaining help from anyone else.

276
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,450
If that is true, then there is no reason for you to come to us.

277
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,290
What about the third one?

278
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,180
The family of Hwangyeo Min can easily control our family.

279
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,890
What do you think about that?

280
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,840
The reason is so embarrassing that it is hard to answer.

281
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,300
Yes, we might think like that.

282
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,590
But, since you guys brought that up

283
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,490
it seems like your family is a very hard family to control.

284
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,460
Therefore, we will not hold hands with your family.

285
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,460
I have to leave because there is something important to do.

286
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,740
Please tell your elders everything well.

287
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,990
Then excuse me.

288
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,280
Can your MIn family really not

289
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,600
read how Goryeo is moving or

290
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,630
are you like this because you guys are scared of Hon In Bang?

291
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,960
Such discourtesy.

292
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,790
You received a marriage request from the Hong family, right?

293
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,500
That is something that has nothing to do with your family.

294
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,640
Marry me.

295
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,470
With me.

296
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,580
Let's marry.

297
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,370
You went over the limit.

298
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,520
There is no family that would play around with
Haedong Gapjok, Min family from Hwangyeo.

299
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,370
I'll tell you again.

300
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,570
Please marry me.

301
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,400
There is already a marriage request, so

302
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,090
how can I reject that and marry you?

303
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,100
If,

304
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,190
there is a way to make the marriage request with Hong In Bang like it never happened, with no commotion,

305
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,710
and there is a way for us to marry,

306
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,190
will you marry me?

307
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,920
Is there a

308
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,640
plan like that?

309
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,930
Then I will go now...

310
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,920
I came back.

311
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,830
Did everything go well?

312
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,830
Seems like you did it.

313
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,650
Yes, Teacher.

314
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,320
Now Hwangyeo Min family is on our side.

315
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,740
Then I will go now.

316
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,230
I am going to speak formally from now on.

317
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,160
To be honest, it didn't make sense for me

318
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,610
to speak informally to you.

319
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,450
Now you will become the husband of noble woman.

320
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,750
I know one thing now.

321
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,480
Among the things I could not understand from before

322
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,430
the reason why I was mad.

323
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,400
It was not because you rejected me.

324
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,850
It wasn't because you rejected me

325
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,360
but because of the reason why you rejected me.

326
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,280
You

327
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,980
were someone who slapped me in the face even when you knew I was a noble.

328
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,580
You could have died

329
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,650
but started the fire in the storage for the memorial of Uhn Yeon.

330
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,320
Then what?

331
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,860
Because of our status?

332
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,530
Because I act childish?

333
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,950
Because you do not want to become the second wife?

334
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,160
Those lies made me mad.

335
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,870
What is your real reason?

336
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,710
You... like me.

337
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,150
But what is your real reason for telling me that you do not like me.

338
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,370
I love you.

339
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,110
What?

340
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,880
I think I do love you.

341
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,140
Hey.

342
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,210
Do you want to die?

343
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,700
I don't want to die yet.

344
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,640
♫ Even if I walk, this road that never ends ♫

345
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,670
♫ You are there to hold my hand ♫

346
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,170
You.

347
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,640
I really love you.

348
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,550
I don't know what to do

349
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,120
and I think I will love you until I die.

350
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,110
Oh, I'm going to go crazy.

351
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,990
♫ I certainly recognize your voice ♫

352
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:32,850
♫ No matter how many times you ask, I think it is you ♫

353
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:41,390
♫ You who made me live and breathe ♫

354
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,290
Is it true that you met with a man outside?

355
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,940
Are the rumors going around true?

356
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,500
Father, I only have that person.

357
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,130
Please forgive me.

358
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,960
Kick her out of the house this instant!

359
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,210
Right now!

360
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,810
I am so sorry and ashamed of myself

361
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,880
that I cannot raise my head.

362
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,580
You must have been very shocked.

363
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,760
I really cannot tell you anything, but

364
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,320
the marriage...

365
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,370
Do not worry about that.

366
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,480
What can we do about that situation?

367
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,940
Its really a shame.

368
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,850
You can just help

369
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,630
me and my group a lot from now on.

370
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,040
Anyway, a family marriage is suppose to happen for the benefits.

371
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:18,180
After I go to Lee Seong Gye's family, if everything goes wrong...

372
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,490
Father, you'll have to dispose of me.

373
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,390
And the family, the family just has to choose.

374
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,720
Are you certain?

375
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
Yes.

376
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,930
I will bet on the Lee family from Jun Joo

377
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,500
and that young man.

378
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,800
A marriage?

379
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,870
Oh, looks like a big feast is going to happen.

380
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,920
Since there are stories behind it, we will have to do it quietly.

381
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,810
I will choose the dates of the marriage, so prepare the newlywed room.

382
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,840
Is it true?

383
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,610
How can something like that happen in the Min Family?

384
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,950
They were acting so fancy because they are Haedong Gapjok.

385
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,770
It was funny to watch.

386
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,720
Doesn't something seem weird?

387
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,050
What's weird about that? That is just the standard of a family

388
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,090
that cannot even take care of one daughter.

389
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,130
Did you find out?

390
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,140
Yes.

391
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,360
There is a group that Jeong Do Jeon is leading.

392
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,560
So that was right.

393
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,180
I was able to get in as their member, but

394
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,170
I'm still a newcomer so I could not get much information.

395
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,690
So Jeong Ryong's idea was right.

396
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:41,060
Right now Jeong Do Jeon is thinking of a way to hold hands with Haedong Gapjok.

397
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,910
Aren't you Teacher Nam Eun?

398
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,640
I almost made a crucial mistake.

399
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,920
Ah, right.

400
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,040
Are you with Elder Bon Won?

401
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,320
I'm on my way to meet him.

402
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,540
What is this?

403
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,910
I have caught a spy.

404
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,670
Spy?

405
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:15,300
I saw this girl, Yeon Hee, come out of Hwa Sa Dan.

406
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,510
Also, this girl is a Hwa Sa Dan spy and contact.

407
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
- Release her.
- What?

408
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,450
It's something I already know.

409
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,890
You knew about it?

410
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,020
It is true that she approached me as a Hwa Sa Dan spy.

411
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,820
Then?

412
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,080
But it is also true that she is now working with us towards the same goal.

413
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,660
She only exposes the information I order her to tell Hwa Sa Dan.

414
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,230
That's why she went into Hwa Sa Dan.

415
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,970
She was trained as a spy from when she was young.

416
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,160
Do you know this girl's story?

417
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,140
Do you know about where she was born or why she became a spy?

418
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,740
That is something only Cho Young knows.

419
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,980
Yet,

420
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,150
she works not for Cho Young,

421
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,560
but for you, Bon Won. Are you sure about that?

422
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,480
I am certain.

423
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,770
Yeon Hee trusts me and I trust Yeon Hee.

424
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,300
If you say it like that, I will follow you.

425
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,930
But I am in charge of protecting the organization.

426
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,440
I will do my job.

427
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,940
Let's go.

428
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,980
I should have told them in advance. I'm sorry.

429
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,060
Don't apologize.

430
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,990
Even if it was me, if I knew that a Hwa Sa Dan spy joined the organization, I would have done the same.

431
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,050
Are you hurt anywhere?

432
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,940
Do you really trust me?

433
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,870
"Hurry and establish a new country, make an alliance, set up a new influence."

434
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,230
"You must eliminate a troublemaker."

435
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,530
You kept on saying that. You don't feed me until I make a decision.

436
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,080
Given the desperation I feel from you,

437
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,950
how can I not trust you?

438
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,290
Bon Won.

439
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,340
With General Lee Seong Gye at Yeo Am Jeong,

440
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,920
I have arranged to meet Min Jae tomorrow at the hour of Mi (1-3pm).

441
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,570
Then, I will go first and observe.

442
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,320
It's a secret meeting. There might be someone ready to attack.

443
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,670
No.

444
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,310
I'm also concerned about the Hwa Sa Dan side.

445
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,820
As time passes, you should also be particularly careful.

446
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:51,310
I have to observe in advance tomorrow.

447
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,810
Until when are you going to do this dangerous job?

448
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,600
I'm not in danger.

449
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,560
Even a little while ago,

450
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,140
you were found out by another member

451
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,570
and were almost in trouble.

452
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,790
Are you following me around?

453
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,810
This

454
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,670
is not dangerous?

455
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:34,920
Being alive during times like this is dangerous in itself.

456
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,060
Do you trust that person, Sam Bong, that much?

457
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,260
No. I don't trust him.

458
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,120
Then why?

459
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,840
Do you think this Ja Il Saek will trust a person?

460
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,090
What I believe in is not Sam Bong

461
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,280
but the world that Sam Bong will create.

462
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,980
I placed my bet on that. Just on that.

463
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,480
Is that world possible?

464
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,060
No, even if it is, why do you have to be the one to do it?

465
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,250
You,

466
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,830
Yeon Hee, are not not kind of person.

467
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,390
You

468
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,200
stayed beside Boon Yi when she was alone.

469
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,610
And for me, who lost a mother,

470
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,240
you cried with me.

471
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,190
For the person you liked, you made clothes and smiled.

472
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,670
You were that kind of girl.

473
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,820
Right.

474
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,380
I was a girl.

475
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,710
I was like that.

476
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,550
Yeon Hee.

477
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,700
What is chaos?

478
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,010
Chaos is a weak person's

479
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,090
hell.

480
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:59,730
There are different kinds of weak people in chaos.

481
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,290
Among those, the ones who never get left out

482
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,840
are the children and women.

483
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,650
Right.

484
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,490
I was a child

485
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,250
and a female. I was a girl.

486
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,560
I didn't have strength as a child.

487
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,980
And as a female,

488
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,700
those people wanted something from me.

489
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,580
So

490
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,770
in that brutal chaos,

491
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,910
I got stepped on like that.

492
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,830
Stop it.

493
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,560
Are you asking why am doing this job?

494
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,780
I was so weak as a young girl that I suffered in chaos like that.

495
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,590
More than you, who ran away,

496
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,870
do you think that I don't have a reason to fight this chaos?

497
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,310
The 'us' that we knew

498
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,540
doesn't exist in this world anymore.

499
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,940
Ddang Sae.

500
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,550
There is another person who shouldn't live like the two of us.

501
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,220
Boon Yi. Your sister.

502
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,560
What are you saying?

503
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,050
Boon Yi joined our organization.

504
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,650
Boon Yi is different from me. She can still make a choice.

505
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,430
So you should take Boon Yi

506
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,120
and leave.

507
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,520
Please.

508
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,920
Although a few of them came back,

509
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,700
Boon Yi didn't.

510
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,170
Boon Yi is alive.

511
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,360
What was it like to step down?

512
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,710
You must be lonely.

513
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,860
No. I really like it.
(Lee In Gyeom)

514
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,360
Actually,

515
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,900
I've wanted to rest anyway since my body is not feeling well.

516
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,410
Although I've become laughable for stepping down, the result is the same.

517
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,860
Because you have stepped down,
(Choi Yeong)

518
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,620
His Highness has been really uneasy.

519
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:32,070
It seems like he couldn't trust me yet as much as he trusts you.

520
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,910
That's probably true.

521
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,710
I have assisted him since he was young,

522
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,160
so even though it will be difficult,

523
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,340
you must do it now.

524
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,860
I will do that.

525
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,960
About what you said the other day,

526
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,820
what do you mean by Lee Seong Gye's shadow?

527
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,160
Elder.

528
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,390
We came to greet you.

529
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,050
In-law and I agreed to meet here.

530
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,660
So you were both here.

531
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,130
Yes. So you came.

532
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,760
I should've met you earlier

533
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,080
but there were a lot of state affairs.

534
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,450
You,

535
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,830
after bringing up marriage talks with Hwangyeo Min,

536
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,850
got humiliated.

537
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,820
What could be humiliating about it?

538
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,550
It was Hwangyeo Min's family who got tricked.

539
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,680
Why are you laughing?

540
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,360
Do you really think that Hwangyeo Min's daughter fell in love with a man

541
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,010
and broke the marriage deal with you?

542
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,010
What are you trying to say?

543
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,250
I got it as soon as I heard, though.

544
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,020
The reason why you got tricked.

545
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,350
Do you know who the man she fell in love with is?

546
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:11,070
I don't. Did you also find that out?

547
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,730
No, I never tried to find out.

548
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:19,490
But isn't it obvious?

549
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,980
You...

550
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,920
Why did you break away from Lee Seong Gye?

551
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,720
You should've held on to the hem of his garments.

552
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,990
What can you do without Jeong Do Jeon?

553
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:48,160
Immediately go to Jeok Ryong and find out who the man was that Min Jae's daughter fell in love with.

554
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,880
Hurry.

555
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,510
Wow. There are not a lot of people who can win against you one on one.

556
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,220
Right? Right?

557
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,600
That's why I'm wondering if I'm really undervalued.

558
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,000
I've been thinking about that.

559
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,720
Aigoo, this guy.

560
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,370
Hey, that's why you should have a record. Record!

561
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:39,600
Record?

562
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,720
For example, winning against a famous warrior!
(Jo Young Gyu)

563
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,060
That's a record!

564
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,560
Record!

565
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,360
Record!

566
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,730
Right, record.

567
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,330
I went out to catch the Viper because of that.

568
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,010
But then I met Lady Boon Yi...

569
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,360
Should I go and catch him again?

570
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,870
I want to ask you something.

571
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,660
Yes?

572
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,510
Go ahead.

573
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,730
Is there someone here called Boon Yi?

574
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,810
Why?

575
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,460
I need to meet her right away.

576
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,850
She's not here right now.

577
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:29,150
Then can I leave a letter...

578
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,920
Who?

579
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,840
Yes.

580
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,620
The man who caused trouble with the daughter of the Min Family is Lee Bang Won.

581
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,980
Lee Seong Gye's son. That Lee Bang Won?

582
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,680
Just what are you doing as a person who's supposed to gather information that you didn't find that out in advance?

583
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,240
Jeok Ryong: Bi Guk Temple Head Monk

584
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,480
I'm sorry.

585
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,340
Did we get tricked by Lee Bang Won?

586
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,210
It was Jeong Do Jeon.

587
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,670
It was Jeong Do Jeon's scheme.

588
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:07,440
Then, did Lee Seong Gye already benefit from the Haedong Gapjok?

589
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,000
Jeok Ryong, find a skilled assassin.

590
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,130
Who are you going to kill?

591
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,260
Jeong Do Jeon.

592
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:30,880
In-law. Calm down a bit.

593
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,250
I like things like murder and assassination,

594
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:39,080
but we have already dominated the Do Dang. Isn't this too much?

595
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,590
I'm not doing this because of my emotions.

596
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:46,880
If those people ally themselves with the Haedong Gapjok, it will be an ominous ember for us.

597
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,250
Before that ember turn into flames and spread, we must put it out.

598
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,110
Young Master.

599
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,080
What?

600
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,290
The thing is that last night.

601
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,210
What about last night?

602
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:16,090
Yes, late at night this guy with a dirty face was looking for Boon Yi.

603
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,370
Who was it?

604
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,520
I don't know.

605
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,800
But he had a very bad look in his eye.

606
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,820
And what can I say? He had a very depraved atmosphere.

607
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:33,400
So? Did he and Boo Yi meet?

608
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,940
I said she wasn't there because it didn't feel right.

609
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,120
Then he gave me a letter and told me to give it to her.

610
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,840
Oh gosh.

611
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,220
It seems like he's literate. Can't believe...

612
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,630
A message?

613
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,030
Oh, yes.

614
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:53,210
It's this but I want you to check it beforehand.

615
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:57,910
He looked very very suspicious...

616
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,400
What is it?

617
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,110
What does it say?

618
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,970
Perhaps is it something like a confession?

619
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:13,250
Keep this a secret from Boon Yi, and you get a sword and follow me.

620
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,200
I will be waiting for you in under the dangsan tree on Jihak mountain. Your brother.

621
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,700
What happened to your brother?

622
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,070
He died.

623
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:35,520
What is this, an older brother? Who is this?

624
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,400
Ah, where are we going?

625
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,770
What did it say?

626
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,460
Stop talking and just follow me.

627
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,010
Sword.

628
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,100
You have it.

629
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,930
Why is he here?

630
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:07,400
Huh? You!

631
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,410
It's that guy, he asked for Boon Yi.

632
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,080
The Viper. How do you know Boon Yi?

633
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,480
What?

634
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,010
The Viper?

635
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,440
Why did you come out?

636
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,450
Why are you doing this?

637
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,930
You said you were The Viper. Do you know how much I tried to find The Viper—

638
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:50,190
Myu Hyul! Stop it! Stop!

639
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:55,820
I, would listen to anything from you but not this.

640
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:01,970
I have to capture and defeat this guy in order to spread my name.

641
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,490
Put your sword away! He is Boon Yi's older brother.

642
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,070
What?

643
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:20,490
He was Boo Yi's older brother? The Viper?

644
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:27,220
I can vaguely remember you after seeing your face.

645
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,210
We hid together in Dohwajun.

646
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,490
Boon Yi thinks you are dead. What happened?

647
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:39,690
Bring Boon Yi. I am going to leave with her.

648
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,910
Leave? Leave where?

649
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,040
You guys are using a clueless girl.

650
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,640
Are you telling me to just sit back and watch?

651
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,130
Okay.

652
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,300
You wouldn't really know much about your little sister.

653
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,280
She will never leave

654
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,570
because she is more dedicated than anyone else in this.

655
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:07,220
How did Sam Bong persuade you guys like this? Why are you all caught up in the illusion?

656
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,730
It is not an illusion.

657
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:10,500
It is.

658
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:17,060
Everything made in this world by humans is, up to a point, an illusion.

659
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:23,140
But people gather in that, and their blood, sweat, and tears mix up

660
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,660
and make it a reality.

661
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,430
We are trying to make a reality

662
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,990
that we've never seen in this world.

663
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,270
Blood? Tears?

664
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:49,380
Yes, that blood is the problem. Didn't I tell you? For your plans and process how much blood do you need?

665
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,960
You answered in this way.

666
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,710
It is a unavoidable sacrifice.

667
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,720
In the world we are living in,

668
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,220
no matter what you do, or what status you have,

669
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:13,980
you can be sacrificed at any time with no meaning or power.

670
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:22,000
That is not just for the people or grassroots, but for anyone.

671
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,620
We are going to make a world where no one will die powerlessly.

672
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,970
Even if you can make that kind of world.

673
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:46,780
People like Boon Yi and I won't see that world. Yes, you can see it,

674
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,670
but in the end, Boon Yi will be used and abandoned,

675
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:55,890
just the way you people have done throughout history.

676
00:50:55,890 --> 00:51:01,690
That is the reason why I want to take Boon Yi and leave.

677
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,650
Boon Yi will never leave.

678
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:10,330
That's something that neither you, I, nor anyone else, can make her do.

679
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:19,430
Boon Yi will never give up on the world that Teacher Sam Bong is creating.

680
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:38,390
If Sam bong disappears, will Yeon Hee and Boon Yi be free? Should I kill him?

681
00:51:55,290 --> 00:52:00,160
Byeok Sagye. Why is that person in Gaegyeong?

682
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,520
- Did you find out?
- He got an order from the Bi Guk Temple.

683
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,580
Since Byeok Sagye came to Gaegyeong, there will be an assassination. Who could it be?

684
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,870
He asked the inn lady where Yeo Am Jeong is.

685
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,660
Yeo Am Jeong?

686
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:23,660
With General Lee Seong Gye at Yeo Am Jeong, I arranged to meet Min Jae at the hour of Mi.

687
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:28,090
Could it be Elder Bon Won?

688
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,930
I'm sorry but please go back that way. There's something going on at this side.

689
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:42,140
No, no! He's someone I know.

690
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,410
What's the matter?

691
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,840
No, it's great that you came. You made the right choice.

692
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,090
I'm a person serving Bon Won.

693
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,650
Do you have warriors who are available?

694
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:07,080
It's my first time seeing you...

695
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,900
Bon Won is in danger.

696
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,230
Danger? What happened?

697
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,470
It seems that Hong In Bang has sent an assassin.

698
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:16,720
- Where is he?
- At Yeo Am Jeong.

699
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,370
Hurry and send the troops.

700
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:22,930
Everyone went to train with Young Master Bang Woo.

701
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:27,570
I need to go first. Please gather the troops.

702
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,510
Moo Hyul, what about Young Gyu?

703
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,360
Young Gyu Hyung-nim is also with them.

704
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,160
This...

705
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,070
I

706
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,800
had two chances to die.

707
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,700
The first one was at the wheat fields

708
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:53,180
and the other was when I stood at the top of a cliff. Both were on the same day.

709
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,890
It was the day that I couldn't protect anyone.

710
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,810
Go on.

711
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,120
At that moment when I was hanging at the top of the cliff,

712
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,040
my life was clinging on to one thing.

713
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,980
Kill Baek Yoon.

714
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,360
This country will end.

715
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,810
But this world didn't even budge.

716
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,960
No, it became worse.

717
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,440
Sam Bong,

718
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:46,510
I don't care about what kind of world you are going to create,

719
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:53,160
but I can't let my remaining people to suffer because of it.

720
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,110
Who are you talking about?

721
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,030
Boon Yi and

722
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,890
Yeon Hee.

723
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:09,580
If those people won't leave you, I will make it so that you will leave this world.

724
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:21,410
I don't know what you have experienced and how you lived

725
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:26,960
but I also lived with the same feelings.

726
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,260
Like how you didn't get to protect something,

727
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,050
I also

728
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:37,290
wasn't able to protect.

729
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:57,850
While blaming myself like crazy, I thought I would end up killing myself.

730
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:03,720
I just wanted to live. Because I have to live, I pointed that sword towards the world instead of myself.

731
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:08,010
That's when I knew.

732
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:13,680
It wasn't me who couldn't protect those children.

733
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,840
This is really not my responsibility. It's not an excuse but it's not that I couldn't protect them.

734
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,180
It wasn't me who couldn't protect those children.

735
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,270
I...

736
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:32,630
About those people who couldn't protect the children,

737
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:36,980
it is my duty is to question this world.

738
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:41,490
I don't need anything. If a person is killed, it is just right to pay back with life.

739
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,240
I

740
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:51,030
will cut the life of this Goryeo.

741
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,960
Although I don't know what you have experienced,

742
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:09,850
there is no perfect obligation to a person living in this world.

743
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,400
It's not your fault.

744
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,210
I never said it was my fault!

745
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,840
Then why?

746
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,050
Why did you blame yourself for not dying?

747
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:29,830
You should

748
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,900
forgive yourself.

749
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:47,190
Don't speak nonsense. I will not be fooled by you people anymore.

750
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:56,290
Yeon Hee and Boon Yi,

751
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,490
please leave them out.

752
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,710
I beg of you.

753
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,270
What are you saying? Sam Bong is in danger?

754
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:16,740
Well, she said that Elder Sam Bong is in danger.

755
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:19,090
She said something about Yeo Am Jeong.

756
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:23,310
It is crazy now with everyone running here and there!

757
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,350
She said it was at Yeo Am Jeong.

758
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:30,070
The air is filled with the thirst for blood.

759
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,820
Hurry and send the troops.

760
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,540
No. I will go.

761
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,570
Ajussi!

762
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:09,550
Six Flying Dragons

763
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:12,830
Groom and bride.

764
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:15,890
- Are you feeling that way because of Young Master getting married?
- What about me?

765
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:17,590
Who's land is this?

766
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,900
Go and find out who owns this land.

767
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,810
Hong In Bang did something that puts him at a disadvantage. This will become an opportunity.

768
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:25,190
I think it's a bit strange. It's like a trap.

769
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,380
Hong In Bang will end.

770
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,550
From now on, stay here with my son.

771
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,150
That warrior was trained by Sam Bong from the start?

772
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:33,840
Hey, Jeong Do Jeon. Since when have you been playing us in your hand?

773
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,210
Take that sword away and get out!
