00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,870
Episode 1

2
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,830
The outskirts of Geogyeong

3
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,760
And to see a person that actually shares his food with another

4
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,780
in this day and age...

5
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,010
What is life anyway? Live and share.

6
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,450
Do you come to Gaeseong often?
(Goryeo’s capital)

7
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,150
Well, about once every ten days.

8
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,410
For me it's been eight years. Were there many changes?

9
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,210
Eight years? A lot has changed. It's operating like a dog house.

10
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,030
Those three crazy bastards sitting in Do Dang are exploiting the middle class,
Do Dang: Highest institute of state affairs during late Goryeo era.

11
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,140
And the ones in the middle are exploiting the commoners.

12
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,140
As a result, common people are taking from beggars to live.

13
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,110
So don't just go around giving food away.

14
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,200
Then you will draw all the beggars in Gaeseong.

15
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,310
That's why (I prepared this) to eat before I entered Gaeseong...

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,470
By chance...

17
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,320
Was that my food?

18
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,610
Oh!

19
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,950
What's this?

20
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,030
Later on, if you come find me, I will give you ten times the amoun—

21
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,060
- Look you crazy bast—
- I'm serious!

22
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,700
Why, you....

23
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,650
Ai! Ai!

24
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,870
Just come find me later.

25
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,360
- Hey, you bastard!
- I will see you again.

26
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,170
Hey!

27
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,810
Who are you?

28
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,950
I've waited a long time to see you.

29
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,480
Me?

30
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
Yes!

31
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,190
Teacher.

32
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,570
A disciple I don't know about.

33
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,480
Then the person behind me is waiting for me too?

34
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,120
What?

35
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,930
I've waited a really long time...

36
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,740
Sam Bong.

37
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,210
You...

38
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,670
You are...

39
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,390
You came too.

40
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,810
You know me?

41
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,600
Of course I do.

42
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,720
I know you very well.

43
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,580
I don't know you. Who are you?

44
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,850
Then you? Who are you?

45
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,430
I am the one who was cheated of life by you.

46
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,050
Someone I've never seen or known... I cheated you?

47
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,040
Who are you?

48
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,960
I... know both of you.

49
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,050
I know you... very well.

50
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,230
Who are you?

51
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,190
So... Who are you?

52
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,360
I am...

53
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,880
Lee Bang Won (son of General Lee Seong Gye).

54
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,440
8 years ago, Hamjoo

55
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,440
Bang Won! It's dangerous. Do not come!

56
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,820
Never you mind, Hyungnim (older brother).
I'm going to catch him.

57
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,650
Ya! Ya!

58
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,020
Damn it.

59
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,150
Let's run quickly!

60
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,050
Fall backwards, Hyungnim!

61
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,280
Lee Bang Won (later King Tae Jong)

62
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,290
Lee Bang Gwa

63
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,800
Lee Seong Gye

64
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Father, father I caught him.
(Joseon’s first three kings)

65
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,470
I said to learn the Gaegyeong language.

66
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,140
Yes!

67
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,330
Tie him up and bring him.

68
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,320
How nice!

69
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,580
Boy, our father sure is a Jantgar!
Jantgar: The strongest man, in Mongolian.

70
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,980
Again, again... That's Mongolian language.

71
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,780
He says to use neither Mongolian nor Chinese (Beijing dialect), so why do you keep on doing so?

72
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,900
What else should I use to call a Jantgar

73
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,040
but exactly that?

74
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,520
Doesn't that fit his description the best? Jantgar!

75
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,710
You're right.

76
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,960
If a man like that isn't a Jantgar, then who else would be?

77
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,450
The traitor started to run away.

78
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,830
I ran really hard!

79
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,620
What about Young Master Bang Gwa?

80
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,120
Hyungnim was following me from behind.

81
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,360
Little by little,

82
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,450
I caught up to him like the wind, and then suddenly like this—

83
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,070
Bang Won.

84
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,950
Are you going to neglect your studies? Are you?

85
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,090
I don't like to study.

86
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,240
I want to be like you, Father.

87
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,480
Like me? What is that?

88
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,320
Someone good at archery, riding horses and who wins every battle.

89
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,110
Isn't that why people are cheering for you?

90
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,520
Isn't that why all the people of this land respect you?

91
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,470
That is why I want to go to battle with you.

92
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,050
Do you have any idea what a war is like?

93
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,270
A war?

94
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,410
War is...

95
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,440
Come with me!

96
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,010
Who ordered you to commit this disloyalty?

97
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,860
Are you deaf? ANSWER ME!
(Lee Ji Ran)

98
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:22,690
This is the letter you tried to give to the spy within our group.
(Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army)

99
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,760
Lee In Gyeom sent this. Right?

100
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:38,080
I'm asking if Prime Minister Lee In Gyeom is the one watching your back?
Su Shi Joong: the highest ranking political figure in Goryeo

101
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,310
- Beat him up.
- Yes sir!

102
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,360
Enough!

103
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,610
You... You've already betrayed me.

104
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,050
If you reveal who is behind this act then you will be betraying for a second time.

105
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,710
Don't betray anymore.

106
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,830
In this spot,

107
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,330
let's sever our connection right here.

108
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:26,530
This is what war is about. No matter what words I use,

109
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,330
war is killing people.

110
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,510
Aigoo. Were you shocked? Was it scary?

111
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,670
I wasn't scared. It was just shocking.

112
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,990
Our General is a generous man, but he does not forgive betrayal.

113
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,390
Of course. Since that bastard, Jeong Nam Jo So Saeng,
he never allows (betrayal).
(Jo So Saeng: one who betrayed Goryeo)

114
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,430
Are you referring to that Jo So Saeng?

115
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,310
That bastard put all of his comrades-in-arms and soldiers, who he lived with and shared joy with,

116
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,790
into a deadly situation and tried to run away.

117
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,690
As he tried to do that (run away),

118
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,210
General caught him. Ah!!! The heartbreak!

119
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,550
Betrayal by someone as close as a brother.

120
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,650
Then what? What did he do after?

121
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:22,230
What else? Jo So Saeng pleads, "Brother, spare my life," as he runs away.

122
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,610
Right then, what he said as he placed the arrow in position was

123
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,870
"Don't call me brother." With that, Jo So Saeng!

124
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,810
Oh!

125
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,870
-He met his end.
-Wow...

126
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:42,830
Father is indeed awesome. "Don't call me brother."

127
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,490
No matter what, I'm going to become just like Father.

128
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,630
There will be no mercy toward traitors.

129
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,590
Move! Move out of the way!

130
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,430
Move! Where did you spring from?!

131
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,110
Lee In Gyeom

132
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,170
Ahh... why is Gil Tae Mi making such a fuss?
(Baek Yoon)

133
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,430
Elder. Elder! Move!

134
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,850
What did I tell you? Since you announced that you'd invite the envoy from Yuan,
(Gil Tae-Mi)

135
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,930
I told you that Jeong Mong Joo was suspicious, right? Did I tell you he was going to cause trouble or not?

136
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,050
What do you mean trouble?

137
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:22,610
He made visits to the Dowager Empress and whispered away. Now Lee Seong Gye is being called into the government!

138
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,250
The royal command already went to Hamjoo!

139
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,930
Huh?

140
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,590
I believe it was Lee In Gyeom. The spy most likely would be the one sent by Su Shi Joong (Prime Minister) Lee In Gyeom.

141
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:37,010
Why would that bastard Lee In Gyeom send a spy to this border area? To gain what?

142
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,010
General! General!

143
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,530
General! General... We have been instructed to return to Gaegyeong.

144
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,690
To Gaegyeong?

145
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,090
Yes, Young Master.

146
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,930
It's a royal command.

147
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,710
Royal command?

148
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,670
Is that true?

149
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,430
Of course! His Highness has given His approval. Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo (Shinjin scholar, poet and scientist.)

150
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,650
General Lee Seong Gye will become the Jae Choo of Do Dang.
(Jae Choo: the highest level to participate in legislative organization.)

151
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,330
As I have sent a separate message to him, he will arrive around the first five days of the month, when the Do Dang meeting is assembled.

152
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,710
That's good! (Hong In Bang - nobleman)

153
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,410
Now we can prevent the establishment of diplomatic ties with Yuan and prevent the war.

154
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,370
This is not because Lee Seong Gye is great.

155
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,270
If Lee Seong Gye comes back, there is a big possibility that Choi Yeong will cross over.

156
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,490
Then Gyoung Bok Heung could back out!

157
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,630
That's what I mean. How many times do I have say it?

158
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,110
At this rate, if the Dowager Empress, who was shoved back behind the scenes, were to reemerge,

159
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,910
it wouldn't matter if you're the one occupying Dohwajeon, Prime Minister. That's what I'm saying!

160
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:46,230
Additionally, what if they join the noblemen? Then what will you do?

161
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,530
Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon

162
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,390
Sam Bong!

163
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:09,810
Sam Bong... Did you hear? General Lee Seong Gye is coming.

164
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,990
This is because you detected and prevented Lee In Gyeom from carrying out his plot.

165
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,970
When General Lee Seong Gye arrives, the (effort to establish) diplomacy will end and we can avoid war.

166
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:29,630
Hmmm... General Lee Seong Gye... Don't trust him too much

167
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,830
What? What are you saying now?

168
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,810
Doesn't he appear to be jealous of you, Chief, who have achieved a great feat?

169
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,250
- Sam Bong wouldn't do that.
- Don't protect him.

170
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,430
Since you keep on protecting him, he steps above his station!

171
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,810
The one who saw through Su Shi Joong's (Lee Yin Gyeom's) plan was Sam Bong.

172
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,870
Sam Bong never said anything wrong before.

173
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,450
This time it's not true. It's only because Sam Bong has never seen General Lee Seong Gye.

174
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,910
Send your man to make a secret delivery to the border.

175
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,950
The border?

176
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,450
Yes.

177
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,370
What are you planning to do?

178
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,570
We should at least prevent the war.

179
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,390
We will be prepared to depart in three days.

180
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,230
Go to Gaeseong (Goryeo’s capital) and deliver my message to Teacher Po Eun (Jeong Mong Joo).

181
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,850
Tell Bang Woo to be ready.
(Lee Bang Woo - 1st son)

182
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,570
I'm going. I will be going too!

183
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,810
We will all be going together in few days anyway.

184
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,890
No, no! I won't go with everyone.

185
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,410
The oldest brother went alone, and the second oldest brother also went alone.

186
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,970
Bang Gwan Hyungnim, Bang Wi Hyungnim, everyone has gone alone.

187
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,010
Why do I have to be left out just because I didn't learn the Gaegyeong language?

188
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,690
I know you're trying to leave me.

189
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,750
If you'd let me go, then I will learn the entire Gaegyeong speak!

190
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,470
Well, in that case I will be the guardian.
(Jo Young Gyu)

191
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,450
If I went with Father there wouldn't be any sightseeing.

192
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,270
Of course. It worked out well!

193
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,410
But why do you look so dressed up?

194
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,170
You don't look so bad yourself.

195
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,910
I did it because I didn't want the Gaegyeong folks to put me down as a country bumpkin from the border.

196
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,710
You did well! Let's go!

197
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,970
Go!

198
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,990
Gaegyeong

199
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,100
Everyone get paired up!

200
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,680
The work you must do from now on is to walk around in pairs

201
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,890
and find the country bumpkins who have come to visit the capital, without fail.

202
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,000
Country bumpkins on a capital visit?

203
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,970
Aigo! Aigo! Aigo!

204
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,500
I'm talking right now!

205
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,910
Hey Gab Boon, where did your mother run off to

206
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,910
when she gave birth only few days ago?

207
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,060
My mom did not run away!

208
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,000
Leader.

209
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,930
It's okay. Okay! Okay!

210
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,890
Gab Boon, you can just beg for the baby's milk today.

211
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,910
You have to feed the baby so that the baby won't cry.

212
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,420
- What was I saying before?
- Country bumpkins coming to the capital.

213
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,990
But what is a country bumpkin coming to the capital?

214
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,200
You mean someone like us who has just come to Gaegyeong?

215
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,640
You're not a country bumpkin coming to the capital.

216
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,760
You are country beggars!

217
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,750
-Hahahaha!
-Don't laugh!

218
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,760
What kind of people are they then?

219
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,950
Listen carefully. From now on I will tell you who to look for.

220
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,860
I will tell you exactly.

221
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,690
First, they are wearing flashy clothes.

222
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,800
Flashy clothes?

223
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,770
- But they're totally over the top.
- Over the top?

224
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,370
They are wearing over-the-top flashy clothes.

225
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,550
And they look around too much.

226
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,500
They are always looking around, like this.

227
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,390
We joined the beggar's den just like you said.

228
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,490
How are we suppose to find Mother here?

229
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,100
We have to eat something.

230
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,850
Have you had a proper meal since coming here to look for Mom?

231
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,380
Did you just come for a free meal then?
(Ddang Sae - later Lee Bang Ji)

232
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,820
You said that Mom was dragged to Gaegyeong
(Boon Yi)

233
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,700
so we came to Gaegyeong and searched for her for a month

234
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,380
asking if anyone has seen our mom, Gan Nan Yi, alright?
(Gan Nan Yi is a typical country name given to women.)

235
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,080
The whole world is filled with Gan Nan Yi.

236
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,980
We can't find her just with her name.

237
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,100
Even so, we have that song she sang that night.

238
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,600
If we find the person who knows the song then we would find a clue...

239
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,800
Listen.

240
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,970
Do you know this song?

241
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,810
What's that? What kind of song is that?

242
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,450
Look at this. Just look at this, huh?

243
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,610
We haven't found a single person who knows this song.

244
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,010
There is nobody who knows this song.

245
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,710
Since not a single person knows this song, when we find even a single person who knows the song,

246
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,000
then that person will know Mom.

247
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,290
There is more.

248
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:09,600
That night, the person who dragged mom away, on his wrist

249
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,890
I saw this picture.

250
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,350
Gab Boon, go find someone to feed the baby.

251
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,770
I will find a visiting country person and get you some food.

252
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,110
- Okay!
- Go!

253
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:38,090
How are we supposed find people donning over-the-top clothes that are looking around too much?

254
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,880
Over there!

255
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,300
It's a little overboard, right?

256
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,300
- It is.
- A lot.

257
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,590
I'll be back after I inform our leader.

258
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,500
Keep a close eye on them.

259
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,250
Okay...

260
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,870
I'll be back after feeding the horses.

261
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,360
It's a taffy!

262
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,210
Everyone, here are some interesting items from the Western region!

263
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,300
Please come take a look.

264
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,270
Master! Master! Come look at this!

265
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:31,010
These... Aren't these corpses?

266
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:41,420
Do people in Gaegyeong not collect their family's corpses?

267
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,510
They don't have any family either.

268
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,280
Who is there?

269
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,640
Master, do you know how much this is?

270
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,400
Master! Master! Master!

271
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,550
What? What about the Young Master?

272
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,610
Nothing. He was just with me here.

273
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,810
You should have kept a close eye on him. I'll look here, you look there.

274
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,460
Yes!

275
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,300
Master!

276
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,750
You! Do you know who I am?!

277
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,310
You punk! Take it!

278
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,800
Do you know who I am?!

279
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,920
I don't know.

280
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,960
We know you have a loud voice, though.

281
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,220
You're laughing?!

282
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,360
That's right! Have your fill of laughs now. You have to laugh now, so...

283
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,950
Master! Master!

284
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,660
What did I tell you? I told you to laugh when you had the chance, didn't I?

285
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,020
You rascals. Move aside now!

286
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,740
If you don't step aside, you will die.

287
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,100
Young Master, come over here.

288
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,910
Where is my mom?

289
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,710
You are the one that dragged my mom away.

290
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,670
Me?

291
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,200
You are the one who hid this over there.

292
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,020
This picture in this letter!

293
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,300
The person with this picture took our mom.

294
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,510
This letter is meant to be sent to a spy in our army.

295
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,370
This was sent by Lee In Gyeom, right?

296
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,340
Ajussi, you're a traitor?

297
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,160
Chase him!

298
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,020
Get him!

299
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,100
Get him!

300
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,960
Boon Yi!

301
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,790
What are you doing? Go after him too!

302
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,810
Are you okay? Are you hurt somewhere?

303
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,870
What are you doing? We have go after him too!

304
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,270
I should at least put clothes on.

305
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,650
So frustrating! You two are so frustrating!

306
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,910
And there is no need to chase him.

307
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,470
Why?

308
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:21,870
Doesn't the fact that he hid a letter mean that he's trying to send it to someone?

309
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,330
But now that you took the letter,

310
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,280
where do you think he would go?

311
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,640
I don't know.

312
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,080
Don't you think he went to see the person the letter was intended for?

313
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,740
Who would that be then?

314
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,590
Lee In Gyeom.

315
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,200
Is that so? Then let's go to Lee In Gyeom's house.

316
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,030
Lead the way.

317
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,850
Me? I don't know the way.

318
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,810
You kids acted like you knew where to go.

319
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,090
When did we?

320
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,830
I know where it is.

321
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,890
It is the biggest house in this city.

322
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,350
You know where?

323
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:16,390
Yes, I know. I go there sometimes to steal food.

324
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,830
Are you that worried about a country bumpkin from the North entering the Dodang?

325
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:25,570
If you give me the order, I will go and bring back his head.

326
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,530
Gil Tae Mi

327
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,910
Oh my gosh, what's this? It's way too delicious!

328
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,910
Really, what is this?

329
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,850
Oh my gosh, how can a taste so good (exist)...?

330
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,470
Of course, it would be tasty
 (Lee In Gyeom)

331
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,270
since it is a piglet fed on human milk.

332
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,750
Anyhow, how can you, who control the Dowager Empress' Gyeongbok Palace

333
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,550
and even General Choi Yeong, be worried about a mere Lee Seong Gye? That's what I'm saying.

334
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,890
Since I do not know.

335
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,550
What do you not know?

336
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:59,050
There are two ways to put a person in the palm of your hands

337
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:06,630
—by fulfilling their ambitions and making them into my people,

338
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,810
or by utilizing their fears and weaknesses,

339
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,910
making them tremble in fear.

340
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,770
But I don't know Lee Seong Gye's ambitions

341
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,370
or his fears.

342
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:32,310
He hasn't shown ambition or fear.

343
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:40,850
That is why I find Lee Seong Gye difficult.

344
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,830
Here. If you go in this way, you'll see the kitchen right away. It's really big.

345
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,790
I said we should just go to the police...

346
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,610
If you heed my words, you can get a rice cake while sleeping.
(Good things happen when you listen to me.)

347
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,010
There really are rice cakes?!

348
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,230
What is that delicious smell?

349
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,230
Hey, now is not the time to be eating this food.

350
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,990
Hey, what is this? How come it's this tasty?

351
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,350
Let's go. Come on!

352
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,890
Come on. Let's go now.

353
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,530
Follow me now.

354
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,130
Go that way!

355
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,170
Isn't that Gab Boon's mom?

356
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,690
Is anyone out there?

357
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,750
While I was seeing my guest off, someone entered here.

358
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,130
Lock all the doors and find them. Hurry!

359
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,970
Yes!

360
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,470
What is that?

361
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,890
Oppa. What is that?

362
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:50,250
Why are people breastfeeding piglets?

363
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:01,530
Could it be that the meat from earlier...

364
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,290
This...

365
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,550
To make pork dishes, they make women feed pigs.

366
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,850
Is this why Gab Boon's mother has been dragged over here?

367
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,150
Just wait. If I tell my father about this,

368
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,030
this place can be wiped out with one attack.

369
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,790
Everyone engage to find them. Quickly!

370
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,490
Yes!

371
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,110
Run!

372
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,320
You! Come here!

373
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,470
How did you get in here?

374
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,250
Let go. Let me go!

375
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,850
Come here!

376
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,530
Search.

377
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,770
Come over here.

378
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,330
Those little rats. How dare you come here!

379
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,150
We found them!

380
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,110
Prime Minister!

381
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,950
I found the culprit!

382
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,890
Aren't you just a beggar who came to steal some food?

383
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,570
There weren't any other trespassers.

384
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,910
Forget it.

385
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,990
Just scold him and send him away.

386
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,750
Yes!

387
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,470
Bastard.

388
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,890
Why did this beggar learn to steal?

389
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,470
What do we do? It's locked.

390
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:20,330
Butler Song!

391
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,550
Yes!

392
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,910
You...

393
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,770
Do you know the story about Lee Seong Gye and Jo So Saeng?

394
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,530
Well, they pledged to be brothers.

395
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:35,330
It's said that Jo So Saeng betrayed Lee Seong Gye during the reclamation of the Ssang Seong colonial office.
(Sssang Seong colonial office: Yuan's governing office in northern Goryeo.)

396
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:40,930
That's right. That's what this world believes.

397
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:45,270
Tell them to perform what's written here.

398
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:56,030
Bastard. Bastard!

399
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,230
Young Master!

400
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,830
- Where are you—
- Move!

401
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,970
Boon Yi, when my father arrives, I will...

402
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,870
What happened?

403
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:19,210
What else? The baby died. Someone can just breastfeed the baby for a day or two.

404
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:23,030
How can a newborn baby endure?

405
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:29,170
Just how can Gab Boon's mom abandon her baby?

406
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,810
Look at this.

407
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,870
To make pork dishes, they are breastfeeding pigs.

408
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,670
Young Master! Young Master!

409
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,650
Young Master!

410
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:37,250
Is that a man or a woman?

411
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,810
Let me down.

412
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:01,080
Aren't you General Gil Tae Mi, Goryeo’s best swordsman?

413
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,870
That's what people call me since I defeated Hong Ryoon.

414
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,590
I am also pleased that I got to meet you, General Lee Seong Gye.

415
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,690
I heard that you're a shingoong.
(a person with outstanding archery skills)

416
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,850
But what brings you here?

417
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,610
Lord Lee In Gyeom prepared a big banquet, when he heard that General Lee was coming,

418
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,380
tonight at Dohwajeon.

419
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,870
You will be coming, right?

420
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,410
You must come.

421
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,090
Anyway, I have delivered the invitation.

422
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,020
What?

423
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,060
Baek Geun Soo was a spy?

424
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,540
That's not all.

425
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,930
To take young mothers and use them as piglets' wet nurses?

426
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:57,570
Then what happens to infants without their nursing mothers?

427
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,960
My friends witnessed it with me.

428
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,070
They are still being held at that place. We have to save them.

429
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,610
Father!

430
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,990
General. Lord Po Eun is here!

431
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,880
Hurry up and bring him in here.

432
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,000
- Lord Po Eun
- General.

433
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,920
It's been a long time.

434
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,490
What is it that I have to do in the Do Dang?

435
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:36,350
You have to block the diplomatic relations with Yuan and stop the war.

436
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,740
People with their limbs cut off are all over Gaeseong.
(Jeong Mong Joo)

437
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,170
And the bodies of people who die of starvation are overflowing in the streams.

438
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,980
At this juncture, how could he promote a positive relationship with Yuan?

439
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,920
And to go to war with Ming?

440
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,220
As the nation's Su Shi Joong,

441
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:56,960
he's accepting war to protect himself. Does this make sense?

442
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:03,710
Your thoughts and my thoughts are not different.

443
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,760
Although I'm not talented,

444
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,000
I will defeat Lee In Gyeom and stop this war from happening.

445
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,180
General.

446
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:22,200
I have yet to be defeated in any battle.

447
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:31,220
Dohwajeon: Lee In Gyeom's residence

448
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:44,090
Aigoo! General Lee, how long has it been?

449
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,450
Thank you

450
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,510
for hosting a banquet for such a lowly humble military man.

451
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,590
General Lee is the main pillar of Goryeo!

452
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,580
This feast is no big deal.

453
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,190
Ah, you are...

454
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,150
Is this your son?

455
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,400
I heard about my son's rude behavior.

456
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:19,580
You little brat! A son of Great General of Goryeo shouldn't be stealing meat.

457
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,650
I'm here to catch the spy.

458
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,000
Spy?

459
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,230
I've heard that a spy within Ga Byeol Cho snuck into this house.
 (Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army)

460
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,210
Have you seen him?

461
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,170
Oh, is that so?

462
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,130
I'm hearing this for the first time.

463
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,640
I see.

464
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,460
Then...

465
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,230
I also heard that his friends and new mothers

466
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,520
are held against their will in this house. Do you know anything about it?

467
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,690
How could that be?

468
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,040
I've witnessed it!

469
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,870
You were mistaken.

470
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,440
Come, come, come. Let's go inside.

471
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:44,030
For our General Lee Seong Gye who's returning to Gaegyeong,

472
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,410
let's have a congratulatory drink.

473
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,260
Congratulations!

474
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,150
Now, now.

475
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,580
Now it seems it's becoming more fun.

476
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,440
Let's watch an interesting play.

477
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,440
Go ahead and start.

478
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,890
Ah...

479
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:31,610
The time was the 86th year after Goryeo surrendered to Yuan.

480
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,570
Nice!

481
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:39,530
Our King Gongmin finally crushed the thief, Yuan!

482
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,170
Great!

483
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,450
Take off pigtail.

484
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:49,710
Push out Gi Cheol's people too!

485
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:55,800
He wanted to reclaim the land that was taken away,

486
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:02,790
but the land was owned by traitors

487
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:06,460
who sold the country to build their own wealth.

488
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,660
To tell you more about the traitor's land,

489
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,420
it was den of bastards who mooched off of Yuan

490
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:18,950
for a hundred years!

491
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,830
However,

492
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:32,890
King Gongmin gathered soldiers and attacked them.

493
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,660
The ruler of the land was...

494
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,790
Who was he?

495
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,730
He was, he was, he was

496
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:44,660
a shameless and audacious traitor! Red wolf! Jung Nang!

497
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,570
Jung Nang?

498
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,390
Brother.

499
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,690
It's too high.

500
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,770
Hey! Hurry up and come down!

501
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,300
Hey!

502
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,970
That's the sound of a dog.

503
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,600
This wolf had a real son of a bitch.

504
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,650
It was traitor Shepherd!

505
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:55,170
The word shepherd implies Lee Seong Gye's last name, Lee.

506
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:03,730
Brother Wolf, the tide has already turned. Surrender now!

507
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,070
Surrender now!!

508
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,320
If you don't surrender, you will die.

509
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,530
You will die.

510
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:19,000
But if you surrender...

511
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,560
You will die!

512
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:26,390
I. I am Jung Nang!

513
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,660
Father, what do you mean get rid of Brother Jung Nang?
(1356, Ssang Seong Colonial Office)

514
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:38,330
At Ja Shi (between 11pm - 1am), Goryeo troops will attack us at the Ssang Seong colonial office tomorrow.

515
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:41,000
You will have to open the gate.

516
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,330
Father!

517
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,860
Yuan will collapse soon.
(Lee Ja Choon, Lee Seong Gye's father)

518
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,870
Then, even now we can persuade Jung Nang.

519
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,980
Don't say the name Jung Nang!

520
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,840
Now he is only an enemy of Goryeo, traitor Jo So Saeng.

521
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,880
If Jo So Saeng is a traitor, then we are too.

522
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,950
Shut your mouth!

523
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,570
Can't you understand?

524
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,960
If we contribute to Goryeo now,

525
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,520
then all of Jo So Saeng's assets will be ours.

526
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,300
I... cannot do it.

527
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,130
As a soldier, I will fight with the Jo family.

528
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:23,350
Will you really destroy my family line here?

529
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,400
Father!

530
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:33,190
Our relationship with Jo So Saeng is insignificant. Look at the big goal, Seong Gye

531
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:01,250
There was a traitor! Some bastard opened the gate!

532
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:05,970
Since the northern gate is the weakest, we must go through there now!
Jung Nang Jo So Saeng: head of Ssang Seong colonial office, traitor of Goryeo.

533
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,120
You can't go.

534
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,180
Was it you?

535
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,490
Did you open the gate, Brother?

536
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,040
Don't call me brother.

537
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:38,850
I did not raise a brother, but a dog.

538
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:46,430
Your family's lineage is that of a dog who bites its owner.

539
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,140
Goryeo.

540
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,920
What has Goryeo done for your family?

541
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,020
I gave you everything you have.

542
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,100
In the end, you bastards

543
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,600
will also betray Goryeo.

544
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,580
That is...

545
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,940
That is the dirty fate of the dog who betrays his owner.

546
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,620
You dogs of Goryeo.

547
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,920
Your family of dogs that bite their owner's hand will eventually

548
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,340
end up looking like this.

549
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,140
Give me my sword.

550
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,590
Hey! What are you doing? Why aren't you cutting his head off?

551
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,210
Take my sword!

552
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,580
I got rid of my enemy!

553
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,770
I got rid of him!

554
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,930
Did you enjoy the play?

555
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:24,210
Gaegyeong people are good at laughing about nothing.

556
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,950
Since you betrayed Jo So Saeng, someone like your own brother,

557
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,630
it must be painful for you.

558
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:37,450
We prepared in a hurry so we used swords.

559
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:42,190
Originally it was an arrow, wasn't it? Since you are a god-sent archer.

560
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,220
It's alright, General Lee.

561
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:53,180
You must have had a good reason for what you did.

562
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:59,640
Of course General Choi Young, and nobles who value loyalty over life,

563
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,770
might think differently.

564
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:08,820
In order to play out this hand, did you plant a mole in Hamjoo?

565
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:14,730
I never planted any spies in Hamjoo.

566
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,890
LOOK HERE, Prime Minister!

567
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,960
Now I understand

568
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,740
why you throw yourself into countless battles, risking your life.

569
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,730
You're generous to people, without limit.

570
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:39,270
So, why didn't you have a goal to enter Gaegyeong?

571
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,870
Why?

572
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:47,550
What ambition does he have to live that way?

573
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,640
Now, I understand.

574
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,320
It was because, more than anyone else, you can't forgive yourself.

575
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,840
But...

576
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,540
Why, now, are you trying to forgive yourself?

577
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,730
Why, now, are you getting involved in politics?

578
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,150
Why right at this moment?

579
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,820
Why are you blocking my path?

580
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,270
Why!

581
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,510
Does anyone else

582
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:41,590
know about this?

583
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,490
Nobody else knows

584
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:48,290
whether it will be secret between us or not.

585
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,470
What are you going to do?

586
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,240
Please

587
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:23,460
look the other way this time.

588
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,600
I beg you.

589
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,980
The First Dragon

590
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,890
The First Dragon: Lee Seong Gye, Joseon’s founder

Episode 2

592
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,840
General Lee Seong Gye is returning to Hamjoo.

593
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,880
Father, why aren't you saving my pitiful friends?

594
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,380
We can't push this country into hell anymore.

595
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,210
What on earth are you trying to do?

596
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:32,630
No matter what method I use, I have to stop the war.

597
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,740
All the nobles could be in danger.

598
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,870
Lee In Gyeom's trap!

599
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:39,400
Are you going to do it yourself?

600
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:44,280
Only by going there myself will stop Lee In Gyeom, who is in cahoots with Yuan, and stop the war!

601
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,030
Man to man, can you promise me?

602
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,340
I promise.
