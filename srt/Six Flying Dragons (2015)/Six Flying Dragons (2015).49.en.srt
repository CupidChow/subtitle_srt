00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,650
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:54,210
Then, did you think that I would share power with those people?

3
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,730
Nameless. I will now take away

4
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,670
your 700-years of life.

5
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,610
Lee Bang Won is the similar to Sam Bong?
Episode 49

6
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,150
He has never gone against Sam Bong's political views. He always admired them.

7
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,790
But Prince Jeong An understands human desires.

8
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,310
No. He only understands his own desires.

9
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,030
But do you think Lee Bang Won will understand Nameless' desires?

10
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,830
I will confirm it for you.

11
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,870
How?

12
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,230
Won

13
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,250
Lee Shin Jeok

14
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,510
How can I manage the country if I just leave an organization like Nameless alone?

15
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,550
That's right, but how?

16
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,850
We can't even find out their true nature.

17
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:21,510
We have to attack three of their foundations.

18
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,130
Foundations?

19
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,810
First...

20
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,290
The reason why Sam Bong took Silla documents from the puclication office...

21
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,230
Eunuchs, court ladies... The organization with people from the palace.

22
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,630
Second.

23
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,290
Then what is going to happen to the system in which the king seeks advice from the high priest?

24
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,970
Buddhism and the Buddhist temple organization.

25
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,930
Third.

26
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,930
She's a merchant group leader who's also famous on the Mainland.

27
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,390
Merchants and merchant groups.

28
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,950
Buddhism, merchants, and people in the palace.

29
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,190
We must stir up those three foundations

30
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,990
to get rid the central figures of Nameless at the same time.

31
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,410
Yes. The Buddhism expulsion policy, a plan to replace the court lady organization,

32
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,610
and the ones regarding merchant groups, I'll arrange it.

33
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,690
Until you're done with the preparations,

34
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,590
I will maintain a very close relationship with those people.

35
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,430
Does this make sense?

36
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,210
You're not the one who distributed these contribution awards, right?

37
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:40,330
It's not Hyungnim. It's His Highness.

38
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,910
Yes, Your Highness.

39
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:49,810
How could you only put Bang Won's people down as the first class contributors?

40
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,990
So what do you want me to do?

41
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,590
Are you the king or is it Bang Won?

42
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,630
Hey! Bang Gan!

43
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:07,910
Your Highness Hyungnim, how is something like this possible?

44
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,110
How could you be a second class contributor, when even Jo Joon, who didn't do anything, is selected as first class?

45
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,630
The award meriting should not be done this way.
(He mixes up the words)

46
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,130
Park Po

47
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,530
It's awarding merits accordingly, my Lord.

48
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,070
That's right. Right. This is why you're my tactician.

49
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,530
Are you just going to sit still?

50
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,950
I can't! What do you think we should do?

51
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,190
What we are lacking is an information organization. So how about we...

52
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,970
Prince Hoe An, what brings you here?

53
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,870
Am I not allowed to come to here?

54
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,130
No. I'm just glad to see you.

55
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,950
You didn't get any compensation from Bang Won after making contributions, right?

56
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,710
That kid has always had no manners.

57
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:21,430
I see that you have a guest. I'll be going, Monk.

58
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,890
Okay. Let's go in.

59
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,430
You'll probably die within an hour.

60
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,050
I found you, Nameless.
(Cheok Sa Gwang)

61
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,170
Prince Hoe An has a lot of complaints. Monitor his movements.

62
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,810
Yes, I understand.

63
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,490
Also, did you still not find Jeong Do Kwang?

64
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,730
He's on the wanted list of each of the government offices and we've arrested Banchon people. We're currently interrogating them.

65
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,770
Banchon people? Why?

66
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,450
It was a person from Banchon who went to Seonghyeonbang and told them about our rebellion,

67
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,890
and the person who died while we were going after Lee Bang Ji and Jeong Do Kwang is also from Banchon.

68
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,790
Yes. A considerable number of Banchon people

69
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,590
are originally from Jeong Do Jeon's information group. They need to be interrogated.

70
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:41,510
Putting the recent incident aside, we can't leave such foul people inside the capital.

71
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:50,830
Do you have a different opinion?

72
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,650
What you all said is right.

73
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,830
Please proceed with it strictly and thoroughly interrogate them.

74
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,410
Then, regarding the people of Banchon—

75
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,690
Don't mess with the leader there.

76
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,890
Let's end this here.

77
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,530
Who ordered you to go to Seonghyeonbang and inform Jeong Do Jeon?

78
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:47,070
I just went there to tell someone I know to escape.

79
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,310
My Lord, the people of Banchon didn't do anything wrong.

80
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,870
What greed would Gab Boon have? It's just human nature—

81
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,090
Wake up.

82
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,750
In the end, aren't you all Jeong Do Jeon's information group?

83
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,550
If you put it that way, at one point, we were also Prince Jeong An's info—

84
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,290
The person who placed all of you in Banchon

85
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,790
is also Jeong Do Jeon.

86
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,730
If you don't want to be named a traitor, never do this again.

87
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,430
Prince Jeong An!

88
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,170
Do you know what he did?

89
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,190
Just look a step ahead. Just one step.

90
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,390
Warrior-nim!

91
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,930
All of our people might die. Warrior-nim...

92
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,210
I can't do it.

93
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,010
Why?

94
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,990
Because I understand.

95
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,590
I understand this whole situation. Politics, power...

96
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,070
It has always been like this.

97
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,550
Lady, you too.

98
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,870
You actually understand it too, right?

99
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,910
Seonggyungwan was dominated by Jeong Do Jeon and it's the same for Banchon.

100
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,090
Do you think that politics and power

101
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,450
will just leave that be?

102
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,650
You do understand.

103
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:13,410
I can't understand. How could I understand that?

104
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,590
Even if the whole world understands, as the leader of Banchon seeing her people die,

105
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:24,970
how can I just nod my head and understand that this kind of thing can happen to them too?

106
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,650
I'm also not sure,

107
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:36,510
but I decided to just look one step ahead.

108
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:45,290
Isn't this moment that one step ahead?

109
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,550
Grandma.

110
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,510
What happened to these?

111
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,040
Don't say anything. I just have to clean it up.

112
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,250
Who did it?

113
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,690
So many people of Banchon have been arrested.

114
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,430
Would those people feel good?

115
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,630
The whole village knows that the weapons came from here and all that happened.

116
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,760
Moo Hyul, you said you would quit.

117
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,280
When are you going to stop doing it?

118
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:52,670
Isn't this moment that one step ahead?

119
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,390
Is it now?

120
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,480
What?

121
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
The people of Banchon who got arrested...

122
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,010
Why would you care about that?

123
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,100
They're people I've been with for a long time and I've grown fond of them.

124
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,880
Fond?

125
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,220
You probably become deeply attached to them.

126
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,950
Should I practice politics using affection?

127
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,590
Will it become a good country?

128
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,740
It's the investigation office's job. They'll probably take care of it.

129
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,510
Your Highness, I...

130
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,250
What?

131
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,890
I want to go to my hometown.

132
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,470
Go ahead. But you must come back within ten days.

133
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,820
No. I want to retire back to my hometown.

134
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,570
It's hard.

135
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:23,350
I'm having a hard time too. Stop talking nonsense.

136
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,700
Pardon?

137
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,010
It's a draft of the Buddhism expulsion policy.

138
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,090
Because you said you're investigating the truth,

139
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,780
take a look to compare, review and add anything.

140
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,460
Yes.

141
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,300
Will Prince Jeong An enact Teacher Sam Bong's Buddhism exclusion as it is?

142
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,180
My Lord.

143
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,880
You were alive?

144
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,600
The same thing?

145
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,980
Is Lee Bang Won planning to practice the same politics that Sam Bong did?

146
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,600
That's right.

147
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,440
This is Lord Ha Ryun's appeal regarding the Buddhism exclusion.

148
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,200
This will do.

149
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,260
What are you going to do?

150
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,180
What is this?

151
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,760
This is a draft of an appeal written by Ha Ryun.

152
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,340
It's about the Buddhism reform.

153
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,080
Is Prince Jeong An really

154
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,640
going to continue everything that Sam Bong was going to do?

155
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,840
Mugeuk, this has already started.

156
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,480
We can't just let this be.

157
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,880
I will get rid of Prince Jeong An.

158
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,640
But how?

159
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,040
Prince Jeong An, who we used as our sword to stop the Liaodong conquest, is no longer of use.

160
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,460
Prepare a banquet for Prince Jeong An.

161
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,120
We are going to break that sword.

162
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,200
Lee Bang Won.

163
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,900
Aigoo, Moon Dong!

164
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,720
What did you do wrong. Moon Dong?

165
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,000
Just what is happening?

166
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,920
Just how many is it now?

167
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,590
How can the investigation office torture a young child like that?

168
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,410
Let's go.

169
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,620
Aigooo, Moon Dong!

170
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,910
Aiggo, Moon Dong!

171
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,230
Stay still.

172
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,840
It's here! It's this place! Here!

173
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,460
Moon Dong came back dead.

174
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,440
Oh my goodness!

175
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,740
My goodness. Such a young child.

176
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,500
To gain wealth and honor for his family,

177
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,170
you make this neighborhood look like this?

178
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,640
Aigoo. What are you saying?

179
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,210
I was just...

180
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:24,380
So it's true. Getting involved in politiccs is enough for a person to get kicked out of Banchon.

181
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,710
My goodness. You were holding piles of weapons in here?

182
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,180
Why are you doing this?

183
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,640
Just have your high and mighty grandson to beat us all to death!

184
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,390
No. It's not like that.

185
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,430
Grandma.

186
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,170
Grandma. What's wrong?

187
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,590
Who did this?

188
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,290
No. It's not that, Moo Hyul.

189
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,300
These bastards.

190
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,770
No!

191
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,930
Moo Hyul, you must not. No!

192
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,080
Let me go, Grandma! This doesn't make sense. What did we do wrong?

193
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,070
We were wrong.

194
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,790
We did wrong.

195
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,810
If it were me too... If something bad happened to you because of someone

196
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,670
I wouldn't have stayed still.

197
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:50,130
Moon Dong, that young child, died after being tortured at the investigation office.

198
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,400
Moo Hyul, let's leave.

199
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,270
Don't live committing crimes anymore, Moo Hyul.

200
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,510
Moo Hyul, let's just leave now.

201
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,060
I will arrange a place somewhere else so

202
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,460
get out of Banchon.

203
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,360
I will leave.

204
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,710
I do understand what you're feeling but—

205
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,430
I...

206
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,540
The reason why I followed Your Highness,

207
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,350
do you remember?

208
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:03,610
Politics that would make the people smile.

209
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,620
But Your Highness,

210
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,780
who...

211
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,500
Who is smiling right now?

212
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,760
Have you seen a smiling person?

213
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:33,150
I want to feel satisfaction when you make people smile.

214
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,210
Am I feeling satisfaction

215
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,460
beside Your Highness right now?

216
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,260
Then, leave

217
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,510
before I change my mind.

218
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,990
Also, give those to your grandmother.

219
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,310
Your Highness!

220
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,260
Can I say something?

221
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:45,250
Please save my Banchon people, Your Highness.

222
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,350
Because of this incident, there were already three people

223
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,950
who died after being tortured at the investigation office.

224
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,310
- Please.
- I can't.

225
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,280
They didn't do anything wrong.

226
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,280
Even if they didn't commit anything wrong,

227
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,630
people who are connected to the traitor Sam Bong

228
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,880
cannot be released without justification

229
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,590
and cannot stay in the capital.

230
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,850
Your Highness!

231
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,800
That's why

232
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,120
I told you to do your best, for you to survive.

233
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,730
It was impossible no matter what I did.

234
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,770
If they've been arrested for being connected to Elder Sam Bong,

235
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,720
then we never had a way out to begin with.

236
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,810
You...

237
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,370
What's with that look?

238
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,140
"Bug, spit out Bang Won."

239
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,870
- Why not do that?
- That kind of childhood joke,

240
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,530
what use would it be?

241
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,780
You're right. Its meaningless.

242
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Aren't you hesitating because you're afraid

243
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,250
that the world will turn against you and that you'll be lonely?

244
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,270
No. It's not that.

245
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,670
I will write a poem. A warm poem.

246
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,570
Right. That's right.

247
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,460
Prince Hoe An has lots of complaints.

248
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,740
I don't have other intentions. Do you understand?

249
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,070
Right. That's right.

250
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,440
I will rip your mouth with my own hands.

251
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,210
Even a dog or a pig

252
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,530
won't kill their brother and teacher!

253
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,290
No, Yeon Hee!

254
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,770
Am I feeling satisfaction

255
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,400
beside Your Highness right now?

256
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,980
I will leave.

257
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,150
I will leave.

258
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,320
- What?
- If I take everyone and leave,

259
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,190
can't I do that?

260
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,240
Yes. Politics is like that so

261
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,360
it would be difficult for Banchon people who were originally information group members

262
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,170
to stay inside the capital, right?

263
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,480
If you will save their lives and release them,

264
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,260
we will go to a place with nothing and quietly live there.

265
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,140
Please let me leave with them.

266
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,240
You will leave?

267
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,630
No. Stay with me.

268
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,490
- Your Highness.
- Marry me...

269
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,500
- Anyway...
- I'll do it.

270
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,520
I will do it.

271
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,740
If you tell me to stay beside you, I will. If you tell me to marry you, I will do so.

272
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,300
Whatever it is, I will do as you say.

273
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,190
So

274
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,150
please release my Banchon people.

275
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,110
Is that true?

276
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,530
Why are you doing this?

277
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,500
What are those Banchon people?

278
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,390
In the morning before Sam Bong died,

279
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,480
I met brother.

280
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,110
I met Ajussi Sam Bong too.

281
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,970
If I had told them about the armory at that time,

282
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,620
what would have happened to this country and to Your Highness?

283
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,240
Also, why did I do that?

284
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,840
Was it because I love you so much

285
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,760
that I didn't tell them about the armory,

286
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,820
not caring whether my brother would die or not?

287
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,070
No. I did it because the many people here would suffer

288
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,970
if it was revealed that there was an armory inside Banchon.

289
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,860
But...

290
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,580
One way or the other,

291
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,540
it still ended like this.

292
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,420
In the end, the people of this age

293
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,090
couldn't do anything.

294
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,580
Still, the people who are locked up in the investigation office,

295
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,260
even if it's hard,

296
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,240
will believe in a nobody like me,

297
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,600
saying that I will do something.

298
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,250
That's why I can't throw away those people's hearts.

299
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,800
Is that all?

300
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,710
That's why you're marrying me?

301
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:36,790
You were someone who wouldn't bend your will even if they held a sword to your neck.

302
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:41,370
You said you would never marry me even if you died.

303
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,640
You were like that.

304
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,110
But

305
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,780
without any feelings at all,

306
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,360
just for of that reason,

307
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,800
you will marry me?

308
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,840
Is that the only reason? Why?

309
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,820
Because you're a powerful person.

310
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,460
What?

311
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,170
- Why do you ignore a person's good will?
- You're a person with power.

312
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,690
All of the powerful people I've seen

313
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,080
only stole what's ours.

314
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,810
Here. Look closely.

315
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,930
I'm not that kind of person.

316
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,160
People like us, no.

317
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,790
Someone who can make all the people of this country

318
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,260
disappear without a trace.

319
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,200
You've become a powerful person like that.

320
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,210
You...

321
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,560
Just stay there like that for a second.

322
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,990
♫ When moonlight shines down ♫

323
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,250
♫ on the barren land ♫

324
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:23,480
♫ My heart that I've concealed, you ♫

325
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,620
♫ carried by the wind ♫

326
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,050
♫ came down as tears ♫

327
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,550
I'm trying to not be that kind of person.

328
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,040
I tried to not be that.

329
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,970
To you.

330
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,480
I came back to the beginning.

331
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,770
We tried so hard.

332
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:02,510
♫ In the middle of this painful world ♫

333
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,870
♫ I breathe even if it's hard ♫

334
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,510
♫ And live while trying to endure the day ♫

335
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:17,470
♫ Even if destiny blocks me, ♫

336
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,690
♫ even if you abandon me, ♫

337
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,810
♫ I must do it  ♫

338
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,350
Go.

339
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,850
Pardon?

340
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,270
Go where you want to go

341
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,730
with those you want so terribly.

342
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,050
Then...

343
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,930
I will release them all.

344
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,510
Go.

345
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,150
Moo Hyul... Boon Yi...

346
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,530
I will get stronger now, right?

347
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:54,770
Also, I'll be lonelier.

348
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:05,110
I'm a bit late. Were you talking?

349
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,250
These people asked you to go out on a trip.

350
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,390
A trip?

351
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:18,590
Yes. My superiors said that since you've worked so hard, we should get together and catch up.

352
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,910
Of course, we'll end up talking about politics too.

353
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:32,030
Yes. That's great. When should we go?

354
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,570
How about in two days? We'll arrange a fabulous place.

355
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,310
Yes. I'll meet you there then.

356
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,830
Mugeuk, Moo Hyul is retiring to his hometown.

357
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,130
Is that so?

358
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,370
I guess Lee Bang Won's heavenly luck is all out too.

359
00:33:54,370 --> 00:34:01,050
Mugeuk, how are we going to proceed regarding Prince Jeong An's death?

360
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:09,710
I will make it as if Lee Bang Ji killed Prince Jeong An.

361
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,930
It seems that she still doesn't know that Lee Bang Ji is her son.

362
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,290
While Lee Bang Won and Jeong Do Jeon were fighting for intense power,

363
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:31,190
in the end, as a bodyguard seeking revenge, they killed each other. That's how it will be recorded in history.

364
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,930
Yes, of course we should do that.

365
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:42,910
Oh, and here is the Bichisa.

366
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,590
Bichisa?

367
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,530
You actually managed to get it?

368
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,730
The only colorless and odorless poison that exists.

369
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:01,110
In the middle of tomorrow's fight, kill Yook San too.

370
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,750
I understand. But why are you making Lee Bang Ji Prince Jeong An's assassin?

371
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,770
It will be hard for Bang Ji to live in this country anyway.

372
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,910
We have to resolve his grudge and open a different path for him.

373
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,830
It's tomorrow.

374
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,830
Okay.

375
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:31,050
Ddang Sae. What are you going to do after that?

376
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,570
After killing Lee Bang Won, what are you going to do with your life?

377
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:42,770
Don't go back to Boon Yi. She'll be in danger.

378
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:50,070
Go to the Mainland with me. You will be able to dream of something else.

379
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,510
The only thing I'll be doing with you is this.

380
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,730
Pardon?

381
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:16,590
Please process it as if the Banchon people in the investigation bureau were sent to the northern labor house.

382
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,710
Release all of them at Mapo port.

383
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,710
Ah, yes. I understand.

384
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,250
Husband, Moo Hyul and Boon Yi have arrived.

385
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,770
They want to see you.

386
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,250
His Highness has entered his bedroom.

387
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,070
Then, I will be coming again early tomorrow morning.

388
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:01,230
He will be leaving for Jeongryu early tomorrow morning. You don't have to come again.

389
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,670
You, too.

390
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:12,050
Does that mean that he doesn't want to see us?

391
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,930
You must be upset but it's not like you don't understand.

392
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:24,510
Goodbye. You've worked hard all this time.

393
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,010
It's been a while, Leader.

394
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,410
What's the matter?

395
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,630
I wanted to meet you.

396
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:49,330
Ajussi Oak and Myeong Hee died.

397
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,790
Do you know?

398
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,790
Yes, I do.

399
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,430
That day, something bad happened in Banchon.

400
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,870
Were you involved in it?

401
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,810
Yes.

402
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,950
That day, Eun Ho died too.

403
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,090
I have really become alone now.

404
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,510
- Then...
- Excuse me.

405
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,990
Do you want to come with us?

406
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:31,870
Everyone is in a situation similar to yours.

407
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:38,090
We will leave tomorrow. It will be in the hour of Mi at Mapo Port.

408
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,690
If we all live comforting each other, good things will happen.

409
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,650
It's an island called Muhaengdo, and it's abundant with water--

410
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,410
There's something that I must do tomorrow.

411
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:56,710
You said that you're by yourself now. What do you have to do?

412
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,650
Five...

413
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,070
I'm going to ask the five people to pay for the things they are responsible for.

414
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,050
There was something I was jealous of about Tae Mi.

415
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,710
What is it?

416
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,570
In this world, there are people who use other and people who get used.

417
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,710
We have no choice but to be used.

418
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,290
But Tae Mi overcame that.

419
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,330
I'm not saying this because he became a powerful authority.

420
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,290
I saw him die by your hands.

421
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:45,050
I thought that he died after getting used his whole life

422
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:53,190
but seeing him in his last moments, he actually lived for himself.

423
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,270
And so?

424
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:11,930
Is that revenge for you?

425
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:28,570
♫ The father collapses from the sword ♫

426
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,150
♫ while the child dies from taxes ♫

427
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:36,550
It's going to feel disheartening and empty.

428
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:42,440
♫ In the Royal Palace where ashes fly, ♫

429
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,020
♫ just a wail of pain can be heard ♫

430
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,600
Go to Mapo port. Someone will be waiting there.

431
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:56,290
♫ Nameless bird in the sky, ♫

432
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:03,600
♫ why do you cry so sorrowfully? ♫

433
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:10,130
♫ The place where wild flowers fall ♫

434
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,760
♫ cannot be found anyway ♫

435
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,720
Leader!

436
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,300
How did this happen?

437
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,510
Oh, Gab Boon.

438
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,240
Unnie. Unnie.

439
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,640
Are you okay? Are you really alright?

440
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,770
Of course.

441
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,690
But, Unni, why are you here?

442
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,300
Let's leave together.

443
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,200
Leave? Not to a labor place?

444
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,460
I was thinking that we got released from our sufferings. So it was because of Leader.

445
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,460
No.

446
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,110
Leader.

447
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,030
Thank you. Really.

448
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,690
Leader, is someone else coming?

449
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,130
Madam Chungjoo.

450
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,750
Let's just wait for a little bit.

451
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,090
Madam Chungjoo?

452
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,590
Well, she's indeed from Banchon.

453
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,020
Yesterday, she asked me who was the owner of the armory. What could it be for?

454
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,580
The armory?

455
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:51,670
Are you really going without seeing His Highness?

456
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,070
Yes. I came to see him early but he has already left.

457
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,570
Is that so?

458
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,350
I guess we're leaving without even saying goodbye.

459
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,600
Let's go.

460
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,940
Yes.

461
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,720
Madam Chungjoo is not coming. Let's go.

462
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,320
Please wait a second!

463
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,480
Maeng Soon, what's wrong?

464
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,680
Madam Chungjoo came and asked me to give this to you.

465
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:41,450
I was really happy when you asked me to come.

466
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:44,050
I will never forget it.

467
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,730
I have some jewelry left, but I don't think I will need it anymore

468
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,290
so I give it to you to use it well.

469
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:56,190
Also, I'm not from the Chungjoo clan.

470
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,510
I'm from Goksan.

471
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,390
Goksan?

472
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,580
How strong is Cheok Sa Gwang?

473
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,990
She's born a woman so she was in a bit of a disadvantage

474
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,270
but she's the heir to the Goksan swordsmanship.

475
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,630
Perhaps...

476
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,630
You said that Madam Chungjoo asked you yesterday about who owned the armory, right?

477
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:29,130
Yeah. And what else... She also asked how to get to Neoreunma.

478
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,380
He will be leaving for Jeongryu early tomorrow morning.

479
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,460
There's something I must do tomorrow.

480
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,410
The owner of the armory is Bang Won.

481
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,050
I will be back in a bit.

482
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,650
Welcome, Grand Prince.

483
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,970
Please have a seat.

484
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,380
No matter how I think about it, I don't think this is right.

485
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:45,410
I have to say something to His Highness before I go.

486
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,390
Yes. Go and hurry back.

487
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:52,330
I thought I was going to be bothered to death because you kept on stopping since earlier.

488
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,630
Aigoo.

489
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,520
Give it to me.

490
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,060
I'll be back soon.

491
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,450
Have you been well?

492
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:28,430
Nameless?

493
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,650
Why would Nameless be here? I have to tell him right away.

494
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,970
About politics,

495
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,970
we have to communicate well.

496
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:45,660
In a way, we have to know how to listen to wise opinions,

497
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,250
just like Our Highness.

498
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,620
Yes, that's correct.

499
00:47:54,010 --> 00:48:00,630
How much did we suffer the other day because of Sam Bong?

500
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,870
That's what I'm saying.

501
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,710
We have to quickly get rid of Lee Bang Won's bodyguards.

502
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,930
Do you understand?

503
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,270
Yes.

504
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,430
Let's go.

505
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,650
I have something to ask.

506
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,630
Cheok Sa Gwang?

507
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,570
Your Highness.

508
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:18,360
For the country that will live a thousand years, and for our pact,

509
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,640
let's all have a drink.

510
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,360
Sir.

511
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:50,870
Um...

512
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,930
What's the problem?

513
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:56,830
A servant of His Highness said she has an urgent message.

514
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,180
Let her enter.

515
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,160
Mom?

516
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:32,140
What happened? Why is Bang Won with Nameless?

517
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,460
Should I just tell him that Cheok Sa Gwang is targeting him?

518
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:41,530
No... What if Cheok Sa Gwang is with Nameless?

519
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:42,860
Boon.

520
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:49,810
What was the message you came to deliver?

521
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,410
Why is Boon Yi here?

522
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:57,110
What should I do? Should I just scream that it's dangerous?

523
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:02,830
No. Warrior Moo Hyul isn't even here. What if it really gets dangerous...

524
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,270
Just what kind of message did you come to deliver?

525
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,730
Your Highness.

526
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:43,490
Goksan swordsmanship. Cheok Sa Gwang.

527
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,450
What is it?

528
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,430
Did something happen at home?

529
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,230
I...

530
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:08,970
It's a message to spit out the bug.

531
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:17,990
Why is she saying that now all of a sudden?

532
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:24,070
Please, Bang Won. You need to understand. You can recognize it.

533
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,950
Just what...

534
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:30,510
Spit the bug out?

535
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:31,930
I will kill it.

536
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:35,950
Before you kill it, can you just tell me once.

537
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:42,130
Okay. You bad bug, hurry and spit out Bang Won!

538
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,150
Like this?

539
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:48,990
Before killing it, one word...

540
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,190
Okay. I understand.

541
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:06,090
Teacher Ha Ryun. We'll have to talk for a bit.

542
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,870
It's nothing much. I'll be back soon.

543
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:34,050
Why did Banchon's leader come here?

544
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,590
Don't say anything and just walk.

545
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,470
Boon Yi is not a servant in Prince Jeong An's house.

546
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,710
Start!

547
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,910
Boon Yi.

548
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,720
Brother.

549
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,030
What are you doing? Attack!

550
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,830
Nameless.

551
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,070
It's now. Let's go!

552
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,270
Your Highness!

553
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,430
It's Lee Bang Won! Chase Lee Bang Won!

554
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,110
Chase him!

555
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,050
Your Highness.

556
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:58,310
Please have a gentle and easy death.

557
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:14,410
I got pushed by strength?

558
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:27,790
Moo Hyul!

559
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,670
Warrior-nim!

560
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,730
I was late, my Lord.

561
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,510
Can you get us out of here alive?

562
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:55,750
Warrior Moo Hyul! Without any mistake, I will follow your order!

563
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:06,750
Sixth Dragon
Joseon's best swordsman, Moo Hyul

564
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:11,690
Will protect the future Great King Sejong, Lee Do

565
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:23,430
Six Flying Dragons

566
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:28,370
The promise that Your Highness made to me as you gave me the hanbok tie...

567
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:33,470
The people's dreams. Just don't forget them.

568
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:37,690
Then, you won't become the bug.

569
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:43,510
That's how Boon Yi will be able to smile somewhere.

570
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,130
Be healthy.

571
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:49,750
Final episode tomorrow.
