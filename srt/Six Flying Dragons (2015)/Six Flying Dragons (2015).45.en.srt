1
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,390
Your Highness, please permit this war

2
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,510
and break the 1000-year history of us serving them.

3
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,890
Not persecuting the people on the inside,

4
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,130
and not submitting to the strong on the outside. Please make a new country

5
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,620
and new history.

6
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,150
We must stop this war

7
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,130
and save this land of Three Kingdoms, Your Highness.

8
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:19,590
So this was the truth behind my uneasiness and anxiety.

9
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,090
Let's go

10
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,000
to Hanyang.

11
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,220
Episode 45

12
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,460
The problem now is preparation.

13
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,330
We have a lot of things to do starting tomorrow.

14
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,150
Elder.

15
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,380
What is it?

16
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,810
What about having something to eat here and resting for a bit?

17
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,960
It seems that Yeon Hee has sprained her foot.

18
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,570
No. I'm fine.

19
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,470
Why didn't you say anything?

20
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,980
When I was 15 years old,

21
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,750
I saw King Gong Min execute the Buwonbae

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,950
and expel the Mongols.

23
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,510
What do you think it was like for me during my childhood, seeing the Mongols and the Buwonbae practicing violent and merciless politics?

24
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,470
It felt like my heart would explode.

25
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,690
Through that, I begged my father and entered Seonggyungwan.

26
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,620
Then I learned about King Gong Min, and at that time
(King Gong Min: Goryeo's 31st King)

27
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,890
it was the first dream I had.

28
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,420
Managing Liaodong.

29
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,990
That person gave that dream to you.

30
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,010
That's right. Dream.

31
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,240
A dream is

32
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,050
the hope in life, but

33
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,270
it's actually comfort, don't you think?

34
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,630
To me,

35
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,940
he was that kind of person.

36
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,260
At that time, that's what you were to me.

37
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,870
Is that so? I'm grateful that I was able to comfort you.

38
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,930
But you can't live from comforting alone.

39
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,910
There has to be life after it.

40
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,250
Your own life. Your own happiness.

41
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,010
Are you talking about that again?

42
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,690
Do you still want me to quit?

43
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,880
For me to stop doing this work and to live my own life

44
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,810
is Elder Bon Won's new dream.

45
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,530
Right.

46
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,090
Looking back after establishing the country,

47
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,720
I couldn't properly take care of my family.

48
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,690
My few comrades, and you two,

49
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,200
are no different from family to me.

50
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,270
So

51
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,000
I want to marry you off, Yeon Hee.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,400
Pardon?

53
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,170
What do you think?

54
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,690
That...

55
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,980
She will get married to you.

56
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,590
Starting tomorrow, the full-scale battle will begin.

57
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,110
About the Ming pointing at me as the one who wrote the document.

58
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,470
Even when I stamped the An Byeon Chaek;

59
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,490
when I went to the Haedong Gapjok carrying gunpowder;

60
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,760
when I set fire on Doomundong;

61
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,500
and when I killed Po Eun

62
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,140
that night at Seonji Bridge,

63
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,210
I was the one who did it.

64
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,720
I confidently made the choice.

65
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,880
Yes. You did.

66
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,810
But...

67
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,530
Yes.

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,750
Regarding a powerful subject holding the whole country in his hands

69
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,000
and controlling it as he wills,

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,740
I did talk to the Ming ambassadors about it.

71
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:22,700
Like a village kid tattling to an older guy who's good at fighting,

72
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,560
I borrowed Ming's power and attacked Sam Bong.

73
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,470
Are you okay?

74
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,270
Moo Hyul.

75
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,780
Yes, Your Highness.

76
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,370
I...

77
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,720
Yes. Please speak.

78
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,550
I became a village kid.

79
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,730
That man, Sam Bong,

80
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,690
is thinking of taking on the Mings.

81
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,560
Damn it.

82
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,730
Your Highness.

83
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,340
Nothing. It's nothing.

84
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,370
Even when I was only twelve years old,

85
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,240
I didn't tell Young Gyu Hyung or didn't ask for any help,

86
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,440
and I killed the three Lee brothers with my own hands.

87
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,480
But why?

88
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,380
How did I become like this?

89
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,200
Hyungnim, Father has returned to the palace.

90
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,850
The problem with this...

91
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,670
What is it?

92
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,890
Sam Bong came back with him.

93
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,410
What? Sam Bong?

94
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,500
Where was Sam Bong and what was he doing?

95
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,530
I'm not sure.

96
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,930
The envoys who went, Jeong Cheong,

97
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,640
Kim Yak Hang, and Noh In Do,

98
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,100
were killed by order

99
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,410
of the Ming emperor.

100
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,670
What does this mean?

101
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,130
What does it mean when we kill another country's envoys?

102
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:23,610
Ming is declaring war against us.

103
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,030
Accordingly, we will accept the battle.

104
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,920
Perhaps...

105
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,320
We will conquer Liaodong.

106
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,670
Your Highness!

107
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,220
In preparation for this, all this time,

108
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,800
we implemented the battle formation training

109
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,540
but it wasn't properly enforced.

110
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,220
Therefore, on the first day of every month, from now on,

111
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,800
we will carry out battle formation training

112
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,350
so every commander and prince with a private army

113
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,120
has to attend, without missing anyone.

114
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,710
This is a military command.

115
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,530
Also, to expedite the Liaodong conquest,

116
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,790
I will reorganize the personnel on a large scale.

117
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,060
Please announce it.

118
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:48,170
"First, to prepare for the war, l the Military Armaments Storage will be reinstalled,

119
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,270
"and Jeong Do Jeon will be instated as the head administrator.

120
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,990
"Also, to strengthen the weak provincial armies,

121
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,790
"all provincial offices will be reorganized.

122
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,960
"Choongchung-do Governor, Ha Ryun;"

123
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,190
Yes?

124
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,300
"Jeolla-do Governor, Park Gil Po;

125
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,630
"Head of Ansan, Lee Sook Beon;

126
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,580
"Kyeongsang-do Overseer, Lee Ji;

127
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,940
"Kangwon-do Military Officer, Lee Chun Woo;

128
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,530
"Choongchung-do Military Officer..."

129
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,670
Liaodong? What Liaodong?

130
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,950
It's only Sam Bong's scheme to abolish private armies.

131
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,700
What are you saying?

132
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,630
If he gathers the armies using Liaodong conquest as an excuse, and merges them into a central army,

133
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,900
private armies will naturally be eliminated.

134
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,520
Still, even if His Highness wants to get rid of the private armies,

135
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,120
will he really go to this extent?

136
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,100
That's why it's a scheme.

137
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,580
Then, we can just not attend the army training.

138
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,660
It's not like we're really going to war, so

139
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,570
I will not attend.

140
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,510
What if the Liaodong conquest is not a fake play?

141
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,390
Sister-in-law, it can't be for real. It's an impossible thing to do.

142
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:06,150
If a military command says to dispatch the troops and you reject it,

143
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,950
that will be treason.

144
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
It's not a fake play.

145
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,700
It's not? That doesn't make sense.

146
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,970
Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang) will die soon.
(Zhu Yuanzhang: First Ming Emperor)

147
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,670
Pardon?

148
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,920
Then, the Mainland will go into civil war.

149
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,580
Do you see any possibility for the Liaodong conquest?

150
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,300
No one can guarantee it.

151
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,260
But if Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang) really dies

152
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,690
and civil war starts in the Mainland, it's not completely impossible.

153
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,870
But still, this is crazy.

154
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,490
Even if I look at it optimistically, the probability of taking over Liaodong and managing it

155
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,440
is only a 50% chance, at most.

156
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,680
Let's pretend there's a gambling game with a 50% chance of winning.

157
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,220
Betting with 100 gold nyangs

158
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,300
will yield 200 nyangs if it wins and will throw away the 100 if it loses. If it's like this, it's worth a try.

159
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,270
However, with this, it's 10,000 nyangs if we win,

160
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,000
but if we lose, we just die.

161
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,310
This kind of gamble...

162
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,170
Why participate in such a bold gamble?

163
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,530
Bold gamble...

164
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,610
Your Highness, what's wrong?

165
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,020
I don't know.

166
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,670
If Ju Che (Zhu Di) advances to Namgyeong (Nanjing) after Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang) dies,

167
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,640
we will advance to the North.

168
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,490
In this process, we also have to achieve the removal of the private armies.

169
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:08,150
The princes will resist hard so we will have to prepare well.

170
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,110
Yes. We have to especially monitor Prince Jeong An (Lee Bang Won).

171
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,870
Yeon Hee, find out the locations, number of weapons number of soldiers of the princes.

172
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,290
Yes, Bon Won.

173
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,400
Put the mission inspectors on stand by.

174
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,840
Yes.

175
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,320
From here on, we have to push forward like a storm.

176
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,090
Accessories made of silk or gold and silver

177
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,800
will be prohibited

178
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,960
for second rank officials down to common folk.

179
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,360
When did we even get to use silk?

180
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,160
What is going on all of a sudden?

181
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,700
Lord Sam Bong is going to conquer Liaodong.

182
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200
Liaodong?

183
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,340
That time, they also took our Moo Hyul and Han Nom.

184
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,530
Isn't this going to stir up trouble again?

185
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,610
Also, until the day of departure,

186
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,730
a prohibition (no alcohol) order will be in effect, so everyone must take note of it.

187
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,700
Ah, why? If it's a ban,

188
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,650
then what do we do with our tavern?

189
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,610
I know, right?

190
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,080
Leader! They are looking for you in Seonggyungwan.

191
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,750
You were looking for me?

192
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,770
The scholars will be gathering rice and giving it as a military supply.

193
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,010
From now on, reduce the amount of food in half.

194
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,860
Yes. I understand.

195
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,190
- Please come out.
- I will also hold a sword for His Highness.

196
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,400
Isn't this Teacher Sam Bong's will? I will also support it.

197
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,020
Good. The first training of central army will be on the first of the month, so let's meet again then.

198
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,350
-Okay!
-Good!

199
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,580
Let's conquer Liaodong!

200
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,650
Sam Bong finally causes trouble.
(Woo Hak Joo)

201
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,610
How dare you say such nonsense?

202
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,910
How dare you?

203
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,340
Where do you think this is?

204
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,510
Woo Hak Joo. When did he come back?

205
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,150
What? Puppet?

206
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,810
Are you saying that I'm a puppet?

207
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:30,290
If not, how come an important thing like this happened without you knowing?

208
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,720
What are you saying?

209
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,140
I'm talking about conquering Liaodong. Did you know about it?

210
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:41,810
Lord Sam Bong is indeed amazing. Did he fool you as well?

211
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,950
Yes.

212
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,040
I also agree with the elimination of private armies.

213
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,800
So I have gave my consent to Lord Sam Bong, regarding this, a long time ago.

214
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:00,360
Keep this to yourself. The Liaodong conquest is a powerful move brought about to eliminate the private armies.

215
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,350
It's a fake play.

216
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,580
It's not a fake play.

217
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,390
Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang) may even die today or tomorrow.

218
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,650
So you really didn't know.

219
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,490
Also, not too long ago, at the royal court in Gaegyeong,

220
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:25,670
did you know that His Highness, Lord Sam Bong, and General Lee Ji Ran met secretly?

221
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,840
This...

222
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,920
Is there even anything that you knew about, Left Minister?

223
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,510
Sam Bong... Is this person really...

224
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,400
All of a sudden...

225
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,700
Why do I have to go to Ansan?

226
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,530
You have to at least go a day earlier.

227
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,790
There will the removal of private armies soon.

228
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,150
There's no way of protecting Prince Jeong An's private army here in the capital.

229
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,000
So?

230
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,300
Go to Ansan and make the government officials into Prince Jeong An's people.

231
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,740
I will gather military troops in Choongchung-do.

232
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,240
So, was this the plan from the start?
(Lee Seok Beon)

233
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,200
Nothing is for sure,

234
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,660
but the moment Prince Jeong An makes a decision,

235
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,090
we have to be prepared.

236
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,660
When do you think he will decide?

237
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,390
I'm not sure. He decides faster than others, so he'll probably do it soon.

238
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,430
But...

239
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,740
Your Highness the Prince is here.

240
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,780
His Highness the Prince?

241
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,810
This is herbal tonic.

242
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,520
Herbal tonic?

243
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,910
I figured you went through hard times recently.

244
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,850
You're really amazing.

245
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,170
I'm being sincere.

246
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:12,260
Yes. Thank you.

247
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,490
Your Highness.

248
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,200
I'm sorry for keeping a busy person here. Continue with your work.

249
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,830
Lord Jo Joon urgently wants to meet with you.

250
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,660
My husband went to give herbal tonic to Lord Sam Bong?

251
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,910
So where is he now?

252
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,890
He went to Dongjin Market to buy a good inkstone.

253
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,730
Inkstone... Did you say inkstone?

254
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,350
Is he going to give it to Sam Bong as a gift as well?

255
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,880
Are you really going to conquer Liaodong?

256
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,120
Not just to get rid of the private armies?

257
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,850
It seems like you heard something.

258
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,220
I heard it from Ha Ryun.

259
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,120
Ha Ryun? Then, Prince Jeong An knew about it.

260
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,660
But herbal tonic?

261
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,760
His Highness, General Lee Ji Ran

262
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,120
and you met secretly at the royal court in Gaegyeong.

263
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,170
Yes. It is to conquer Liaodong

264
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,840
and break the hell-like history.

265
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,890
Look here, Sam Bong!

266
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,250
There's also a person who said the same thing before.

267
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,590
You remember, right?

268
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,760
General Choi Yeong. Are you really going to be another General Choi Yeong?

269
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,110
Woo Jae (Jo Joon)!

270
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,660
This country is barely becoming stabilized now, but a war?

271
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,020
How long has it been since this country was created?

272
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,660
That's the same for the Ming.

273
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,620
Do you know what you're talking about?

274
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,030
Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang) is in a critical situation.

275
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,420
I knew about it. I know but!

276
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,950
We must not lose this chance that will never come again, Woo Jae!

277
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,280
Okay, fine. There's a message that a civil war is going on in the Mainland.

278
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,660
Let's say that we capture Liaodong. What about after that?

279
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,620
We must protect it.

280
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,970
That's what I'm saying. Are we capable of protecting it?

281
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,290
How much military force and provisions are needed to manage Liaodong?

282
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,000
How many people do we have to migrate there?

283
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,090
And how long it will take for the people that migrate to settle down?

284
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,190
Do you know about that? Without even making these calculations,

285
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,180
how can a country's ambassador decide on something like this?

286
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,610
These are calculations for all of that.

287
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,040
It's possible.

288
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,200
If you want, you can take these and closely review them.

289
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,770
These can't probably be created in just a few days, right?

290
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,120
It's data that was planned and prepared for a long time.

291
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,400
But how come I, the Left Minister,

292
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,660
have never heard of this data?

293
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,520
Woo Jae, if Ju Won Jang (Zhu Yuanzhang)'s condition hadn't become critical this fast,

294
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,370
it's data that we wouldn't have to use, so there was no reason to tell you in advance.

295
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:02,880
Still, what this data can prove is nothing but possibility.

296
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,590
It cannot be the basis of the fate of a few hundred thousand people.

297
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,910
It's something that His Highness has already decided on and permitted.

298
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,160
You have to go to the training now.

299
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,580
What's wrong with Lord Jo Joon?

300
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,000
Prince Jeong An knows the truth about the Liaodong conquest.

301
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,530
What?

302
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,510
I've warned everyone.

303
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,050
I have told them that nobody from our side will go to the battle formation training.

304
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,190
It's the same for our side.

305
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,510
Then today, as well, only Sam Bong will be there

306
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,550
and he'll just go back.

307
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,310
What happened to the training, Young Gyu?

308
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,800
Is it right that nobody appeared?

309
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,960
If there's someone who gets scared, just tell me.

310
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,730
About that...

311
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,850
These bastards.

312
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,740
Take down the names of everyone who didn't attend today

313
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,480
and report them to me.

314
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,340
I will not leave these people alone.

315
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,590
What did you say?

316
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,150
His Highness personally wore his armor

317
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,410
and went to the training ground.

318
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,590
Hyungnim, if this happens...

319
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,840
Keep your voice down.

320
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,020
I just felt feverish because of the boils.

321
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,380
Inspector Generals, start the impeachment for everyone that did not attend the training today.

322
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,030
Yes, my Lord.

323
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,770
What are you going to do about Prince Jeong An?

324
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,800
Since Prince Jeong An knows that the Liaodong conquest is not fake play,

325
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,290
we have to push ahead as soon as possible.

326
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,940
Have someone keep an eye on Prince Jeong Ahn.

327
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,880
Yes, my Lord.

328
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,840
If we are impeached for disobeying the military command, it will bring a severe punishment.

329
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,300
It will be hard to at least avoid exile.

330
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,640
Let's raise the soldiers.

331
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,220
Are you saying that we should revolt?

332
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,880
Then, are you just going to sit down and take it?

333
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,050
Please think before you say it!

334
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,810
Is that even possible right now?

335
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,230
During an important time like this, where did Bang Won go?

336
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,890
I'm sorry, Brother-in-law.

337
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,080
Hyungnim, are you giving me a present?

338
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,670
You need to read and write a lot,

339
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,060
so it means that you should keep yourself together even more.

340
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:21,050
Yes. Lord Sam Bong teaches me a lot of things.

341
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,990
Since you gave me this, I will use it right away.

342
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,840
Good older brother

343
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,640
Good older brother, one heart

344
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,660
What?

345
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,550
So the laughing sound we're hearing

346
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,150
is that of the Crown Prince and Prince Jeong An?

347
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,030
- Yes.
- He gave Lord Sam Bong herbal tonic?

348
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,070
Yes.

349
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,200
Why do you think he's doing that at a time like this?

350
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,660
Did he start to talk about something but never finish it?

351
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,820
Or something like roughly washing his face.

352
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,330
Yes. He did that.

353
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,750
Something's going to happen.

354
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,060
What is it? Do you know what it is?

355
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,620
Was it when he was twelve years old? He did something like this.

356
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,090
Yesterday...

357
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:08,600
Young Master! Tell me. What happened?

358
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,430
Young Gyu...

359
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes.

360
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,730
Oh. So frustrating.

361
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,290
Why is he doing that?

362
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,340
I know... How do I explain this...

363
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,170
Ah! You're really curious about something

364
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,050
so you want to confirm it, right?

365
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,930
That kind of feeling.

366
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,530
That...

367
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,100
What do you mean by that?

368
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,290
Anyway, don't ask His Highness anything. He'll get himself together like that.

369
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,680
Also, whatever decision he comes up with,

370
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,000
you have to follow it.

371
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,660
Of course I will follow, but

372
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,570
when will he get himself together?

373
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,390
I don't know.

374
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,070
He'll probably come to his senses if he gets shocked.

375
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,650
Ah, he needs to be shocked.

376
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,020
Oh wait. That'll be the death of me.

377
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,200
Your Majesty, the 292 people listed

378
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,210
have disturbed the king's heart by not attending the training.

379
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,320
That crime is serious.

380
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,360
I will punish them heavily

381
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,610
and set this country's discipline.

382
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:33,330
Your Highness, Left Minister Jo Joon is entering.

383
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,160
Your Highness, I, Left Minister Jo Joon, need to urgently speak with Your Highness.

384
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,030
What?

385
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,130
Yes, Lord. Left Minister is speaking privately with His Highness right now.

386
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,940
It seems like he is remonstrating the Liaodong conquest.

387
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,620
Lord Jo Joon only knows how to keep a ledger on measurements.

388
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,060
He is not a person with whom to aim together for a great cause.

389
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,620
Interfering with everything...

390
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,430
Lord.

391
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,860
Did you check on Prince Jeong An's movements?

392
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,930
Yes.

393
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:33,830
Prince Jeong An went into Donggung Jeon to give the Crown Prince an inkstone as a gift and is now having friendly talks with the crown prince.

394
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,730
- Friendly talks?
- With the crown prince?

395
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,890
Didn't Prince Jeong An give you herbal tonic?

396
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,110
Herbal tonic?

397
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,810
Prince Jeong An... Just what are you...

398
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,640
Could it be that he has given up and will just follow the tide now?
(Shim Hyo Saeng: Crown Prince's father-in-law)

399
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,150
Prince Jeong An is not like that.

400
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,610
Then, I will resign from my post.

401
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,920
Left Minister.

402
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,640
What was Your Highness' first reason for retreating from Wihwa Island?

403
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,960
It was because, if a small country goes against a big country, the country will waver.

404
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,520
And what's more, you are going to impeach the royal family and princes

405
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,200
and exile them?

406
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:36,980
If my sincere requests cannot be accepted,

407
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,680
it is just reasonable for me to leave my post.

408
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,760
Please allow my resignation.

409
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,320
Left Minister.

410
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,440
Your Highness, there is also a reason for Left Minister's worries.

411
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,180
The Liaodong conquest has to be considered very very carefully,

412
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:03,120
and I think it would be best to reconsider the princes' impeachment.

413
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,080
But don't you also agree with the elimination of private armies?

414
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,040
That's right.

415
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,080
Your Highness, what about doing it this way?

416
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,940
How?

417
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,600
Husband! At a time when you are being impeached and might even go into exile,

418
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,020
you went to Lord Sam Bong with oriental medicine?

419
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,890
That's right.

420
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,790
You also went to Crown Prince and had an idle chat with him?

421
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,440
I did.

422
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,950
So you already have a plan.

423
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,410
As expected. You wouldn't do that without any reason behind it.

424
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,490
You surely have a plan in mind.

425
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,930
I don't have anything like that.

426
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,030
Pardon?

427
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:10,540
I don't have any plan, scheme, or reasons.

428
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,970
I also don't know why I'm being like this.

429
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,220
Someone from the palace came.

430
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,760
What is it?

431
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,490
The king commands that you equip yourself and come to the practice hall by jinshi (7am-9am).

432
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,750
What? What is this, all of a sudden?

433
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:42,930
His Majesty says that he will grant amnesty regarding the impeachment.

434
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,840
I will go now.

435
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,600
What do you think happened?

436
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:02,650
I'll be seeing Father tomorrow anyway.

437
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,880
An amnesty? What happened all of a sudden?

438
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,000
From what I heard, it happened through Left Minister's effort.

439
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,990
If that is so, then things went well. What are you going to do now, Hyungnim?

440
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,590
Last time, Father went to the training ground

441
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,240
and none of us came so he will be infuriated.

442
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,260
We are going to have to hide more weapons in Banchon.

443
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,140
Did something happen?

444
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,100
Something feels ominous.

445
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,140
Will it be possible?

446
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,880
The situation is different from when Banchon was being newly established.

447
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,260
If we get caught carrying weapons, it will cause a disturbance.

448
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,150
That's why you have to be more careful.

449
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,170
That armory is our lifeline.

450
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,730
I understand. I will find a way.

451
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:06,690
If that storage gets exposed, His Highness the Prince and his followers will all die.

452
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,630
Please be especially careful.

453
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,990
Yes.

454
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,600
Your Majesty, we have gathered upon your calling.

455
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,980
Did Prince Jeong An not come?

456
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,970
Your Highness, I came to accept your summons.

457
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,880
All of the princes are in attendance.

458
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,580
Then, let's start.

459
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

460
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,060
What? Is that true?

461
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,960
Armory?

462
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,300
Be quiet!

463
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,120
The situation right now is not good.

464
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,260
When go out to the market to buy food ingredients, place it under.

465
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,190
Weapons from the training camp will also be slowly moved to the secret storage today.

466
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:27,240
Our Highness the Prince's life hangs in this. You must not be caught.

467
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,540
Yes.

468
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,520
I understand.

469
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,950
Eun Ho! Eun Ho!

470
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,110
Did Eun Ho not come back?

471
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:50,090
No. The food is ready, but where is he and what is he doing?

472
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,020
I will go out and look for him. Go in first and eat.

473
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,540
Yes.

474
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:06,200
What does that mean? There is an armory in there?

475
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,190
Leader doesn't know, right?

476
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,270
There will be chaos if she finds out.

477
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,750
But what's with your face?

478
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,030
It's strange.

479
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,520
What is?

480
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,400
Why do I feel so uneasy?

481
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,850
You're being like that so I also feel anxious.

482
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,200
What to do?

483
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,360
Eun Ho!

484
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,230
Eun Ho!

485
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:50,320
For disobeying the law and repeatedly not attending the mandatory battle formation trainings,

486
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,800
many civil and military officials were impeached.

487
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,630
But I consider myself to blame and will grant an amnesty.

488
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,470
Your grace is immeasurable!

489
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,390
But

490
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:20,060
the punishment for disobeying the military command so many times will not be light.

491
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:32,180
Only those who relinquish their badge as a military official will be granted amnesty.

492
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,870
Enforce the royal command!

493
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,910
Yes!

494
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,740
What are you all doing?

495
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,710
His Majesty has commanded us to take over the weapons and the list of private soldiers.

496
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,000
We have found weapons!

497
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,980
I was right.

498
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,130
Lord Jo Young Kyu, I leave it to you.

499
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,170
Eun Ho!

500
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,710
Eun Ho, where are you?

501
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,360
Everyone listen!

502
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,750
From now on, every soldier will be moved to the Three National Armies

503
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,180
and will be assigned to a new place.

504
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:47,740
Everyone, follow. We have the list of private armies so don't even think of doing other things.

505
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,070
Bring your weapons and come out.

506
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,440
Take the weapons.

507
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:09,930
They took all of it. They're taking all my babies.

508
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,640
We have to tell them.

509
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,390
Hurry.

510
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,580
Ajussi, why are you doing this?

511
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,770
Ajussi, let me go.

512
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:34,980
Your Highness, I pledge my loyalty to you until the day I die!

513
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,530
Everyone here has received amnesty from the great sin of disobeying the military command

514
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,900
and has pledged your loyalty to His Highness until the day you die.

515
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,630
Jeong Do Jeon.

516
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:22,080
Today, the Three National Armies have

517
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:29,750
taken over the private soldiers of all the princes and royal family and the lists of their names.

518
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,990
Starting today, Joseon's private armies have been dissolved.

519
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:11,830
These badges of military command from the previous dynasty have all been terminated.

520
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:28,270
Starting today, this Tiger Emblem will be the symbol of this country's military authority.

521
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:38,470
Without this Tiger Emblem, no one will be able to use a single soldier or any weapon for personal purposes.

522
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:47,380
Without being designated and authorized by the King, no one will be able to use the army.

523
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,460
Why did you come in here?

524
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:08,980
I'm sorry, Ajussi. I will not do it again.

525
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,500
What do I do? What do I do?

526
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,800
What should I do about this?

527
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,940
If that storage gets exposed, His Highness the Prince and his followers will all die.

528
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,640
I will never go in here again.

529
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,650
I will go. My aunt will be looking for me.

530
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,520
What do I do?

531
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,560
Darn it.

532
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,270
Ajussi. Why are you doing this?

533
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,870
Ajussi.

534
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:01,900
Kid, what you saw in here, just...

535
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,400
Eun Ho!

536
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,610
Aunt! Run!

537
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,140
Eun Ho!

538
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,400
Aunt.

539
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,170
Eun Ho!

540
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,540
Hyungnim!

541
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,370
Hyungnim!

542
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,210
Hyungnim! Hyung!

543
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,570
Young Gyu Hyungnim!

544
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,130
Moo Hyul!

545
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:17,390
Close the door! We'll get caught!

546
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,510
Hyungnim.

547
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,010
We'll get caught.

548
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,360
Young Gyu Hyung.

549
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:29,810
Eun Ho. Eun Ho. Wake up, Eun Ho.

550
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,240
Eun Ho. Eun Ho.

551
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,130
Eun Ho, wake up.

552
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,980
Hyungnim!

553
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,890
Eun Ho!

554
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,390
Your Highness.

555
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,650
You are really

556
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,360
amazing.

557
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:57,250
Keep an eye on the princes and the key people close to Prince Jeong An.

558
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,950
Yes.

559
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,570
Your Highness.

560
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:26,750
What's with you?

561
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,910
Y-Young...

562
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:33,520
Young Gyu Hyungnim...

563
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,390
Young Gyu...

564
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,180
Young Gyu... What?

565
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,300
Hyung.

566
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,200
Hyung.

567
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,870
Hyung.

568
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,680
Your Highness.

569
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,400
This...

570
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,150
Hyung.

571
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,200
Hyung. Hyung!

572
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,530
Get up! Get up!

573
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:03,660
Get up, Hyung! Stop joking!

574
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,520
Hyung!

575
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:27,740
Hyung.

576
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,900
Get up! Stop joking!

577
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,130
Hyung!

578
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:59,010
Who did it?

579
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,770
Nothing has been confirmed yet, but probably...

580
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,780
Forget it.

581
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,370
What can I do even if I find out who did it?

582
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,460
Someone must have killed him.

583
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,850
I understand it now,

584
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:31,690
the reason I bought medicine and went to Teacher,

585
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,290
why I went to visit Bang Seok.

586
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,770
When I was twelve years old,

587
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,580
something like that happened.

588
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,850
Was it when he was twelve years old? Something like that happened.

589
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:09,530
The three Lee brothers in Seonggyungwan were really bad people,

590
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,840
but strangely, I wanted to see them.

591
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:22,410
It was awkward at that time too, so

592
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:30,230
I brought presents saying I have something to ask. I went to see them without any reason.

593
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:38,560
I didn't know at that time why I did it.

594
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,930
After a while,

595
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,780
all three of them.

596
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,240
Did he kill them?

597
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,610
I killed them all.

598
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:07,530
The reason I did it at that time...

599
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,920
When you're really curious about something

600
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,500
you want to confirm it, right?

601
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,290
Confirm?

602
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:21,690
To see if I can do it,

603
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,260
I went to see them to confirm it.

604
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,250
Moo Hyul.

605
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:39,060
Yes, Your Highness.

606
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:46,370
Bang Seok... Jeong Do Jeon...

607
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,940
I'd have to kill them.

608
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:20,610
Six Flying Dragons

609
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:27,220
Success of this operation depends on whether we can get rid of Jeong Do Jeon, Nam Eun, and Shim Hyo Saeng in the first half.

610
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,240
Second is Lee Bang Ji.

611
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,670
We have to remove Lee Bang Ji in order for us to have a higher success rate.

612
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:37,350
Third, we have to secretly take out the hidden weapons in Banchon.

613
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,540
It begins now. Let's attack Sam Bong.
