1
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,010
If that also doesn't work then,

2
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,740
take this and come find me.

3
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,310
Only if you lose your path again.

4
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,310
I'm lost again

5
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,610
Yes, I'll come find you, right now.

6
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:28,680
Go to the wood plate store at Sogam Market and ask for Lee Eun Chang.

7
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,950
Episode 6

8
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,180
Did the guards see you set the fire or not?

9
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,330
I think they are already looking for you. The fire is visible now.

10
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,570
I can't leave you like this

11
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,210
Follow me.

12
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,380
That, I already knew.

13
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,650
You're a criminal. You're dead if they catch you!

14
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,970
Then...

15
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,180
I would like to not be involved with you anymore.

16
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,900
From my perspective, I cultivated the land in secret to make a living,

17
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,890
but according to you, I broke the law.

18
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,560
For me, I was setting a funeral for Uh Nyeon who died unfairly,

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,750
but according to you I am a criminal who burned the country's crops.

20
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,760
For a young master, who is growing like a flower in a terrarium,

21
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,610
the burden is too much for you.

22
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,150
What?

23
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,080
I'm really thankful that you saved me.

24
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,700
What? A flower in a terrarium?

25
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,000
The Viper or whoever. Are you not going to look for him?

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,870
Go check on it yourself! Let's meet at Sogam Temple or somewhere.

27
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,130
Ah. Why are you like this?

28
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,090
She's jumping around without knowing what's coming!

29
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,210
I've got to teach her.

30
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,610
You like her, right?

31
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,260
Again, did you hear what I said or...

32
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,230
You're wrong.

33
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,550
I'm being told to follow her to the end. There will be something amazing.

34
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,830
That... That... If you like her, just say so.
(Jo Yeong Gyu)

35
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,530
"I'm falling for her!" Why can't he just say that?

36
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,870
Ayoo. Seriously!!

37
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,690
Aigoo. Where did you go?

38
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,860
We were so worried.

39
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,300
We can't even go to the village. What should we do?

40
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,470
Leader Boon Yi, you should tell us what to do.

41
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,420
From now on, ajussi, you are the leader.

42
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,800
What are you saying?

43
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,270
I have someone I need to meet.

44
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,640
If I meet that man, there will be a way for us to live.

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,030
Then, can't we just all go together?

46
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,970
We can't.

47
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,790
We have someone who is pregnant and there are a lot of people. It will be hard if we get caught while going together.

48
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,330
Still, what are we supposed to do by ourselves?

49
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,930
Whatever happens, I will definitely come back within a month.

50
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,290
Hang tight in the cave for about a month.

51
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,270
Where did she go? I was sure she went this way.

52
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,480
We have to at least resort to stealing just to live.

53
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,150
We can't do it like this.

54
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,090
You must never do that.

55
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,780
It's too dangerous.

56
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,000
Then, what?

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,190
Should we just starve and die in this cave?

58
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,660
Anything that can be eaten on this mountain has already been eaten.

59
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,650
That is true.

60
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,740
We don't have a way to survive anyway,

61
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,510
unless the mountain god provides us with gold, silk, and food.

62
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,550
The mountain god has never come, but he'll come now with gold, silk, and food?

63
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,130
Ajussi, please.

64
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,220
Is anybody here?

65
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,240
So you were all here.

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,110
He has gold..

67
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,860
He must be rich..

68
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,290
Look at him!

69
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,930
Gather this and that too! Hurry! Hurry!

70
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,750
Hurry and tightly tie him up.

71
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,950
I can't tell you how sorry we are.

72
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,670
A person should pay back kindness when she's given one.

73
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,050
Also, I won't be able to pay you back in the future.

74
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,670
Still, I will never forget what you did.

75
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,970
I sincerely apologize.

76
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,850
Yes. Yes.

77
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,180
It's not that I don't know your situation,

78
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,220
If you can survive with this, it's also worthwhile for me.

79
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,950
So please untie this.

80
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,680
I originally came here to help you.

81
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,770
But... What if you report us?

82
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,780
That will never happen. Release me.

83
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,510
I can't do that.

84
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,990
As you know, all of us are being chased by the Magistrate's Office.

85
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,770
I said I wasn't going to report you!

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,750
What is that?

87
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,310
I can't release you right now,

88
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,860
but if you rub the rope against this rock for a day, the rope will break.

89
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,070
Hey! Hey!

90
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,290
I don't even know your name, how am I going to report you!?!

91
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,930
- Hey!
- Boon Yi, let's go! He's getting angry.

92
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,040
Why say her name?

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,910
B-Boon Yi? Boon Yi!

94
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,340
You said Boon Yi, right?

95
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,170
Hey!

96
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,960
Untie this before you leave!

97
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,430
Hey, you!

98
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,900
So are you saying that I lied to you?

99
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,460
You said that the Mae Hwa Warrior I defeated is just a newbie who hasn't even held a sword.

100
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,010
Is that all a lie?

101
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,320
Unless you were trying to wring food from my family.

102
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,950
- Wring?
- I mean...

103
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,190
How dare you, to your teacher?

104
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you really want to experience the 24 skills of Eastern Twin Dragons?

105
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,540
Eastern Twin Dragons 11th skill out of 24 skills

106
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,900
I...

107
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,290
Did I overtake you?

108
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,630
For more than a year, you

109
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,770
have already surpassed me.

110
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,090
Then,

111
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,360
it is true that you lied to me.

112
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,400
It's not a lie.

113
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,100
It's because you are too strong.

114
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,530
But, Moo Hyul, being strong doesn't mean passing the national military exam!

115
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,920
To get a government post you need at least one of the four.

116
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,960
Wealth, connection, family background, or reputation!

117
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,690
I will look into government post for you.

118
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,300
Moo Hyul.

119
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,240
That's right, Moo Hyul.

120
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,820
You have thought well.

121
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,470
You chose the right thing, Moo Hyul.

122
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,210
I will teach you truly secret skills.

123
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,070
Moo Hyul. Where are you going?

124
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,200
Moo Hyul! Moo Hyul!

125
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,490
You're strong but slow, you can't feel someone else's energy.

126
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,460
If you leave this way you will die.

127
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,230
Moo Hyul! Seriously, you...

128
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,740
That lady called me warrior-nim.

129
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,900
At that moment, I realized

130
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,460
that I am Moo Hyul, the warrior.

131
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,950
So Hong Ajussi lied?

132
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,020
He took what's ours.

133
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,220
I don't have anything to say to you guys.

134
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,900
Well, that might be true but what your master said is not all wrong.

135
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,990
We... don't even have a house.

136
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,960
Wealth, connection, family background, or reputation!

137
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,220
Myo Sang, Moo Hyul's grandmother

138
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,630
Fame. That's right, fame!

139
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,370
That's something you can earn with your strength.

140
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,800
You are the best warrior. You even defeated a Mae Hwa warrior!

141
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,260
- Yes
- What's there that you can't do?

142
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,050
If you defeat a famous master,

143
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,590
when word gets out about that defeat, then

144
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,710
that becomes your reputation.

145
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,910
Who is the famous master?

146
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,830
Ah! Gil Tae Mi

147
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,630
That won't do. If things go wrong, your brother will die.

148
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,950
She said he'll die!

149
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,360
Then, who?

150
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,310
The Viper.

151
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,130
Right now, he's the most famous in Gaegyeong. The Viper!

152
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,970
I will catch the Viper.

153
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,860
That's right.

154
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,970
Catch him.

155
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,400
Be careful, Hyung!!

156
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,540
Make sure to eat well!

157
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,060
Eat well!!

158
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,720
Warrior Moo Hyul, this is the beginning.

159
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,710
Be careful! Goodbye!

160
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,750
You know the girl right?

161
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,910
He said Boon Yi, right?

162
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,160
You will see.

163
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,690
The weather is hot, I'm suffering so much because of young master.

164
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,690
The Viper or what not, I don't even see anything.

165
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,820
Young Gyu Hyung!

166
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,820
-Is this the only thing you could get?
-Master.

167
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,220
Why?

168
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,350
You are so... romantic!

169
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,030
Tell me honestly. You became like that because you were trying to do something with her, right?

170
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,390
I told you it's not that!

171
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,850
You did more than enough. You said you have to go to Sogam Market.

172
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,180
Yes, thank you!

173
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,560
Did the clothes fit you?

174
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,230
Hey, crazy...

175
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,810
Hey! Stop right there!

176
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,810
Hey!

177
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,970
Wow. It's romantic!

178
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,310
I'm sorry! I said I'm sorry!

179
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,990
First, stop! Stop!

180
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,920
You should stop first for me to stop as well.

181
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,580
Okay! I will stop! I will stop!

182
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,390
Hey! I stopped.

183
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,700
I stopped.

184
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,990
I know what I did was wrong.

185
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,210
But we didn't have a choice.

186
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,190
Please forgive us.

187
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,690
No!

188
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,200
No!

189
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,060
Stop! Hey!

190
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,220
Hey... Ow!

191
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,370
Hey! If you bite me, do you think I won't bite you back?

192
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,020
From here on, you have to properly answer my questions.

193
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,720
Did I save you or not?

194
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,040
You saved me.

195
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,340
When you burned the crop storage, did you think that I saw you as a criminal?

196
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,040
No. Just a weird wench.

197
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,740
That's right.

198
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,480
Then did I follow you to report you or because I was worried about you?

199
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,110
Because you were worried.

200
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,300
Then, you should have just said so. Do you think I would have given you the gold piece or not?

201
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,000
I did think you would give it.

202
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
Then why did you do that?

203
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,610
Why did you steal it and run away?

204
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,940
Why do you ignore a person?

205
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,450
Answer me!

206
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,770
Answer me!

207
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,070
You are a person with power.

208
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,940
You are a noble so how can I trust you?

209
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,430
All the powerful people I've seen have only taken our stuff.

210
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,360
Okay.

211
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,890
Then closely look at me.

212
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,270
I am not that kind of person.

213
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,910
I am a person who is striving to not be like that.

214
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,170
I'm really sorry.

215
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,370
I am sincerely sorry.

216
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,140
That... How could she...

217
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,840
What does that mean?

218
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,930
They raised the tax to 90%?

219
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,720
That's not all!

220
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,210
Hong In Bang's men stole all of the cultivated land from the people.

221
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,980
And they killed everyone who resisted.

222
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,210
Hong In Bang.
(Choi Yeong)

223
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,570
I will immediately...

224
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,650
Will blaming the Hong In Bang will solve it?

225
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,170
It became possible because Lee In Gyeom is supporting Hong In Bang.

226
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:44,260
General, you gave power to Lee In Gyeom.

227
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,270
What are you trying to tell me?

228
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,470
Because at that time,
(Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo)

229
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,790
if only General hadn't give power to Lee In Gyeom,

230
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:59,070
the power of Lee In Gyeom, Gil Tae Mi and Baek Yoon, would have solidified this much.

231
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,690
Because of that, those people stole lands from the people,

232
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,930
raised taxes and satisfied their greed.

233
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,690
The one who killed Baek Yoon is Hong In Bang.

234
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,580
When Baek Yoon was alive, at least Gil Tae Mi kept him in check.

235
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,900
Hong In Bang has always been on Gil Tae Mi's side so what is there for him to fear?

236
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,680
This is worse then when Baek Yoon was alive.

237
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,110
There is no one stopping him.

238
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,330
There is no one else who will be responsible.

239
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:35,180
No matter how much you may dislike scholars, general, you must take responsibility for this.

240
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,170
You have to think of the people they killed.

241
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,720
I've heard what you said.

242
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,510
However, in 1375 that Sadaebu was Hong In Bang,

243
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:05,340
and Woo Hak Joo who followed Baek Yoon, and Han Goo Young who mooches off of Hong In Bang.

244
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,290
That is the spirit of Sadaebu.

245
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,930
They never offer themselves, nor do they fight off the Japanese pirates.

246
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,700
That's the spirit spat out in words only.

247
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,360
It's not your fault.

248
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,410
You didn't know that another person would come in after Baek Yoon died.

249
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:37,100
That Shim Bong or Sam Bong or whatever who said to kill Baek Yoon is the one at fault.

250
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,020
Maybe he turned bad too.

251
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,350
Earlier, that general said so. The sadaebu are such people.

252
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,020
What happened with what I asked you to look for?

253
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,380
Oh?

254
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,910
Ah. I will quickly come back.

255
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,220
Sam Bong, what happened?

256
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,040
Is this the right path?

257
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,490
Is that your path?

258
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,960
Yes! I will kill Baek Yoon and put an end to Goryeo.

259
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,260
That person said so.

260
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,760
Hey, you bastard. Do you think that a country will end just by killing one official?

261
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,800
If I find him

262
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,480
then I'll hear next set of orders.

263
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,700
If I knew that was your goal, I wouldn't have taught you.

264
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,470
I've seen too many swordsmen end when they get involved in politics.

265
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,520
Don't do it.

266
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,970
I

267
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,740
have nothing else to do.

268
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,130
This is...

269
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,670
So it's because of a woman.

270
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,860
So it's not something that you can stop.

271
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,040
In your life, that woman has always been there.

272
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,650
Ddang Sae, later Lee Bang Ji)

273
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,240
Yeon Hee.

274
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,170
- Have you checked on it?
- You surprised me!

275
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,940
I'm finally taking time to organize the books.

276
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,900
What are you going to do after you find out?

277
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,980
You did find out.
(Gab Boon)

278
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,020
Hurry and tell me about it.

279
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,860
I don't know.

280
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,040
Why are you being like that, King Beggar.

281
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,510
What King Beggar?

282
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,120
I'm Beggar King.

283
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,390
That's what I'm saying! King Beggar!

284
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,020
Hurry and tell me.

285
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,310
Hey, there's no way to find Jung Do Jeon.

286
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,640
But Lee Eun Chang or Shi Gun Chang,

287
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,980
I found it.

288
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,330
He has a business of selling plates.

289
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,780
Where?

290
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,490
By raising the tax to 90%,

291
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,560
he absorbed everyone in Baek Yoon's group.

292
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,120
My lord, did you allow Hong In Bang to do this?
(Cho Young)

293
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,530
I did give him permission, but...

294
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,760
Baek Yoon's followers were causing so much trouble that

295
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,160
my in-law just gave what they wanted for my sake.

296
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,520
General Choi Yeong has arrived.

297
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,810
You're here, General.

298
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,340
Younghogun and Eungyanggun

299
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,010
and all the well trained soldiers are

300
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,530
under my command. You know that right?

301
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,600
The reason why I supported them after King Gong Ming passed away was the

302
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,270
Ohrotyi resignation and well being of the people.

303
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,530
Yes, of course General.

304
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,190
I've been patient for eight years!

305
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,230
The barbarous acts of Baek Yoon and Gil Tae Mi make me grit my teeth trying to be patient.

306
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,300
But that man, Hong In Bang, has crossed the line.

307
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,720
Taxing people 70% causes starvation and death and now they have raised it to 90%!

308
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,560
This is the last chance.

309
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,030
You and Hong In Bang

310
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,910
and if his barbarity is not rained in, then

311
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,260
our alliance will be broken.

312
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,740
I've said my piece.

313
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,520
What did he eat to have so much energy?

314
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,420
Ah the nagging...

315
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,220
Immediately bring Hong In Bang to me!

316
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,780
Have you been looking into what I asked you about?

317
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,910
If it's too hard, should I just go to Hwa Sa Dan?

318
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,560
Jukryong (Bi Guk Temple Monk)

319
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,960
I got a hold of a clue.

320
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,520
By any chance, do you know Lee Eun Chang?

321
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,020
Ah. Lee Eun Chang.

322
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,490
He's a student of Sam Bong.

323
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,690
Lee Eun Chang would know where Sam Bong is.

324
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,510
Where is Lee Eun Chang?

325
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,980
He changed his name and is now doing trading

326
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,730
in So Gam marketplace.

327
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,100
So Gam marketplace?

328
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,330
That girl definitely said she's going there, right?

329
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,360
Yes. She was looking for a Mok Ki Jeon in So Gam marketplace.

330
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,330
Mok Ki Jeon - a store that sells all kinds of wood plates.

331
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,310
- Let's go.
- Yes.

332
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,540
So Gam marketplace

333
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,790
Then, when will Lee Eun Chang come?

334
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,670
He will be here soon.

335
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,030
It has probably already started by now.

336
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,800
Hey!

337
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,570
- You go that way.
- Yes.

338
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,580
Lee Eun Chang

339
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,610
Mr. Lee Eun Chang,

340
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,100
I have something to ask but why are you avoiding us?

341
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,320
Just why are you doing this to me?

342
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:55,100
♫ Help me pass Arirang mountain pass

343
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,880
Aigoo! Aigoo! Aigoo!

344
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,080
Ay, I don't know what happened, but how can you make a person like this?

345
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,410
There was just a misunderstanding so just keep on going.

346
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,360
If there were two misunderstandings, then

347
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,790
you would kill a person.

348
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,010
Aigoo, kill a person...

349
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,640
Don't get involved in other people's business and just do your stuff.

350
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,980
Yes. Yes.

351
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,710
Aigoo.

352
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:41,670
♫ I'm passing Arirang mountain pass

353
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,990
Aigoo. You're good.

354
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,510
♫ My husband

355
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,270
♫ Whether he is good or bad

356
00:27:52,270 --> 00:28:00,100
♫ Bind and stitch up the legs and arms of a person ♫

357
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,300
Are you Teacher Lee Eun Chang?

358
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,680
Buy a hat, buy a hat.

359
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,570
How much is it?

360
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,910
Just a second.

361
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,550
Oh, Warrior-nim!

362
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,030
Warrior-nim.

363
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,260
Warrior-nim, hurry and draw your sword.

364
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,970
Warrior-nim!

365
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,620
The lady who caused me to be born a warrior again.

366
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,920
Please buy a hat as well.

367
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:54,030
Warrior-nim. Warrior-nim?

368
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,380
- Please buy this
- No.

369
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,720
No. Now there is only the entrance examination.

370
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,730
Also, gaining fame.

371
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,430
Warrior-nim, please just buy this one.

372
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,900
I'm sorry, maiden.

373
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,230
I should've asked for her name.

374
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,560
You lost him?

375
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,570
Some bastard got in the way.

376
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,860
This stupid fool. If you lose him, then how will we find Sam Bong?

377
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,500
How should I solve this strange code?

378
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,270
Excuse me, is Scholar Lee Eun Chang--

379
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,850
You're looking for Lee Eun Chang.

380
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,110
No, maiden, why are you here?

381
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,750
No. It's so strange. So strange!

382
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,970
Excuse me.

383
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,650
Have we met somewhere before?

384
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:11,240
This is good. "Have I met you before?"

385
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,670
You mean that girl had woodcarving soldier?

386
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't you have some sort of powers, young master?

387
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,390
Plague victim!

388
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,290
Move aside! Plague victim body!

389
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,180
Move!

390
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:05,510
Move aside! Plague victim's body! Move aside!

391
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,130
There it is! Mok Ki Jeon.

392
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,690
That child earlier,

393
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,490
does it look like she was infested by the plague?

394
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,140
Did it look like she died right away because of the plague?

395
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,160
What does that mean?

396
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,700
It's that girl Boon Yi

397
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,550
They are Biguk Temple monks.

398
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,290
- It seems like she got kidnapped, right?
- Yes.

399
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,130
Plague victim's body!

400
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,650
That's the girl who went to the Mok Ki Jeon.

401
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,850
She got kidnapped and now they're taking her.

402
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,200
They are monks from Biguk Temple.

403
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,690
Biguk Temple?

404
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,350
Biguk Temple

405
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,390
What's your relationship with Lee Eun Chang?

406
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,750
Who are you?

407
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,330
Why me...

408
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,260
Monk Jukryong

409
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,500
When you look at it, you're not in a position to be asking questions.

410
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,670
Why did you go to Mok Ki Jeon?

411
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,660
Why do you think I went there?

412
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,650
I went to buy plates. Lee Eun Chang is the owner of the place.

413
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,240
Lies!

414
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,130
Even in that marketplace, they didn't know that Lee Eun Chang owns the place.

415
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,210
But you know that.

416
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,810
I'm saying its the same organization.

417
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:36,340
Fine. It doesn't matter to us how you are related to Lee Eun Chang.

418
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,530
What we want is

419
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,510
this.

420
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,540
As Lee Eun Chang escaped, he asked for this secret message to be delivered to someone.

421
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,630
Ameo: A secret code or message that a person must solve.

422
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,360
You, wench, have to solve this.

423
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,760
How would I know about that?

424
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,370
So you also don't know. Still, think again.

425
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,920
If you still can't figure it out,

426
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,670
you'll get hurt.

427
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,490
Painfully.

428
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,120
Lee Eun Chang.

429
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,640
We are looking for him.

430
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,390
The injury is deep so he won't be able to escape the marketplace.

431
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,390
They say that Biguk Temple is not a real temple.

432
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,700
The cart was brought into the storage, right?

433
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,770
Yes.

434
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,260
Let's go!

435
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,650
But,

436
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,940
did you come to save someone?

437
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,070
That girl was the organizer.

438
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,350
You've come to rescue her.

439
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,330
Move aside! I will slay all of you!

440
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,530
Well, whatever.

441
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,590
Charge.

442
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,200
Stop!

443
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,980
Who is this?

444
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,750
Why are you here?

445
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,070
The thief that stole from me was dragged here to Biguk Temple

446
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,760
I just followed.

447
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,380
And what about you?

448
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,560
I have something to talk about with that girl so I brought her here.

449
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,740
Is that so?

450
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,660
Well then... I will finish my business with that girl.

451
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,190
After that my lord can finish your business with her.

452
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,350
Last time, we both had business with the same person,

453
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,230
although you were the one who killed him in the end.

454
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,580
So this time, we're also targeting the same person.

455
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:15,890
I've always told you this. We strangely match.

456
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,560
So, come and join me.

457
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,120
The former Administrative Judiciary Heo Jo covered the sins of the son Heo Gang

458
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,170
and manipulated Gil Tae Mi's documents,

459
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,910
exposing a closed capital punishment incident.

460
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,650
You wrote that posting, right?

461
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,410
To frame me.

462
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:48,320
That's right. I did.

463
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,710
In the future, there will be more instances like this.

464
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,590
Why? Why?

465
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,730
You know too much about me.

466
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,740
What happened?

467
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,210
Why is your father...

468
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,880
Because of the posting that you wrote,
Elder Heo Jo committed suicide.

469
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,640
No! I didn't do it!

470
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,180
Brother!

471
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,860
This bastard.

472
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,250
You call yourself students but you use violence on your classmate.

473
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,870
If you feel apologetic

474
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,400
bow down to Bang Won

475
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,480
Why are you doing this?

476
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,250
Just punish me instead.

477
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,050
Why?

478
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,720
Didn't you want to establish justice?

479
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:02,480
You said you will get rid of evil. I see that you're out to kill me.

480
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,560
With that mindset, I joined hands with Gil Tae Mi.

481
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,100
because I needed power.

482
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,880
Weren't you the same?

483
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,260
That which can redeem you is not justice

484
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,640
but power.

485
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,250
I will give you power.

486
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,540
Join hands with me.

487
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,490
How many times do I have to tell you?

488
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,220
I

489
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,540
will never join you.

490
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,770
Because of one torture you've abandoned what you believed in your whole life,

491
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,880
betraying comrades and discarding your friends.

492
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,970
Disgusting.

493
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,290
Someone who weakly blames the world instead of himself,

494
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:07,980
sharing power with a weak bastard like that.

495
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,950
I will never believe it.

496
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,510
Then what are you going to do?

497
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,230
What can you do?

498
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,620
Haven't you endured long enough?

499
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,760
All of your comrades have turned their backs on you, and there is no one who will listen to your story.

500
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,460
Not only are you unable to kill evil and initiate justice but you can't ensure yourself.

501
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:42,100
What are you going to do? Haven't you been wandering around after losing your way, each time

502
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,710
thinking about going to your father and throwing a temper tantrum?

503
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:54,850
The only path you have is to join me so that you can gain the power you've been craving.

504
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,700
I have found a way.

505
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,490
You will lose your way again.

506
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,490
Like always.

507
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,800
This time, it's different.

508
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,430
In this path that I found,

509
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,560
we will cross paths again,

510
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,640
and I will destroy you.

511
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:22,400
I hope that you will make sure to do that.

512
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,070
Make sure.

513
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:30,100
At that time you have to be prepared to kill me.

514
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,310
You have the ability to withstand my persecution or anybody else's opposition,

515
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,940
but you're weak and you will not be able to withstand it much longer.

516
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,340
Make sure to find it.

517
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:53,470
If you can't find your path this time, then you might actually join me.

518
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:02,600
Are you saying you came to pray at this time of night?

519
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:10,620
All merciful Buddha's virtue doesn't care about time.

520
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,150
I'm a storyteller.

521
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,490
People told me that this Biguk Temple is so marvelous.

522
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,810
Hey, wait a minute.

523
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,670
It was this person, this person.

524
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,670
He is the one who interrupted us earlier at the market.

525
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:44,160
What are you saying? How can I interrupt you?

526
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,770
I've been performing in Gaegyeong this whole time and it'ss my first time coming to this village.

527
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,750
I didn't even go near Sogam Market.

528
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,730
It's true. I said it's him.

529
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,460
Have you seen me before?

530
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,500
I'm seeing you for the first time.

531
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,940
Uh?

532
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,460
You're mistaken.

533
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,540
Catch him.

534
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,390
This man said no so why are you doing this?

535
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:27,630
How...did you know that it happened in Sogam Market?

536
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,220
That... That, earlier...

537
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,170
Ah, really...

538
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,630
I really don't have anything else to say,

539
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:49,270
since you haven't attained enlightenment in this lifetime, make sure to do so in your next life.

540
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,660
Swordsman.

541
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,860
Yes, I am warrior Moo Hyul.

542
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,550
Here, quickly.

543
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,260
Who are you?

544
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,230
Young master.

545
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,670
What's the matter?

546
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,370
There's an intruder outside.

547
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:10,670
An intruder?

548
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,500
It's that way, chase them.

549
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,030
Catch him!

550
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,000
Monk!

551
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,370
That girl ran away.

552
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,730
There was another person.

553
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,650
We should immediately send troops down the mountain and surround them.

554
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,270
No. No.

555
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,990
Ler her go. You guys chase them with our men.

556
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,680
Yes.

557
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,140
Maiden, a little bit more.

558
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,630
There were two intruders.

559
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:25,410
One kept us busy and the other one took the girl.

560
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,400
That girl,

561
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,450
she also took the code tag.

562
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:38,310
There is a master that exists that I don't know about. Does it make any sense?

563
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:47,630
But the one who took the girl was really tall. He had a unique sword.

564
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:52,380
The sword was decorated with dragons in three parts, and the scabbard was made out

565
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,890
of fish skin.

566
00:47:55,890 --> 00:48:01,920
It seems like you failed.

567
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,500
That's what I'm saying.

568
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:10,290
Because of my guards, you also lost the thief. I will buy you a drink next time.

569
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,330
We've both become chicken-chasing dogs.

570
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:18,770
Eventually we'll meet again if we keep chasing the chicken.

571
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,670
It's that woodcutter, right? The one who took off with your sword. Who is he?

572
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,830
All of your comrades have turned their backs on you, and there is no one who will listen to your story.

573
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:42,640
Not are you unable to kill evil and initiate justice, but you can't ensure yourself.

574
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,980
He pretended to be a logger and captured fake Japanese pirates.

575
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:52,470
And this time, he turned Biguk Temple in complete chaos. On top of that, he took away this girl?

576
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,460
At that time you must be ready to kill me.

577
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:00,690
You have the ability to withstand my persecution or anybody else's oppositions,

578
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:06,350
but you're weak and you will not be able to withstand it much longer.

579
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,320
That woodcutter must be at a high level in a big secret organization.

580
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,150
I knew it when that woman burned the government office!

581
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,790
- That wench must also be—
- Whether it's that wench

582
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,720
- What?
- The loggers.

583
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,350
We have to find them for sure.

584
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:27,990
Yes, we must find them.

585
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:32,330
If we can't find them...

586
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,790
If we can't,

587
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:40,000
what then?

588
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:48,040
If you can't find them this time either, I'll capture you.

589
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,560
If we can't then,

590
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,790
then what? Young master!!

591
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:08,200
What did you say? There is still a way?

592
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,050
Yes.

593
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:16,910
When the swordsman escaped with the gir, I secretly put a tail on them.

594
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:22,340
That woman is probably running back to her leader.

595
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:29,600
Yes. We are not sure if it's Jung Do Jeon, but the chase starts now.

596
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,050
- Hey, hey. I've got something to ask.
-Yes.

597
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,810
I would like to meet this store's owner. Do you know where he is?

598
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,100
There was a huge ruckus during the day.

599
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,870
Those thuggish monks came in and

600
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,550
used the sword, he ran away and was chased.

601
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,670
- Was he caught?
- I don't know.

602
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,290
Anyhow, I don't see him, so...

603
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,950
Where does he live?

604
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:59,180
If someone is being chased, they wouldn't go to their house, but they would run somewhere far away instead.

605
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,570
If we go there, we will probably find out something about him.

606
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:03,910
Young Master, on this night?

607
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,770
Those Biguk Temple monks are probably looking for that person as well.

608
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:09,270
We must find him first.

609
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,500
It's the Biguk Temple monks!

610
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,190
- Who are you?
- Look here,

611
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,840
Look here, look here.

612
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,930
Lee Eun-Chang

613
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,470
So Bon Won sent you.

614
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,140
Hurry...

615
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,450
This...

616
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:56,860
To everyone...

617
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,910
He's dead.

618
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:20,460
Let's ran away first. The Bi Guk Temple monks are coming.

619
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:34,870
But where are you going?

620
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,030
Since we are out of danger, you must have places to go yourself.

621
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,760
I took most of your time, right?

622
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:49,070
Ah, yes, no, I mean yea.

623
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:54,150
It is so, but where are you headed?

624
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,910
Swordsman, I need a moment to relieve myself.

625
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,320
Yes.

626
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,220
Why is it so hard to leave.

627
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,110
Hurry up and take it out.

628
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:41,990
"Chil Gak Bong Seon Bul Pyeon Geo."

629
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,560
What does this mean?

630
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:49,430
Let me figure out the meaning.
"Serve goodness, not serve comfortably."

631
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:53,260
What is this?

632
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,070
This... This is a secret code!

633
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,030
This can't be solved.

634
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,300
Not anyone can solve this. Ah!

635
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,880
These bastards are doing all sorts of things.

636
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,210
Ay, stop already.

637
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:14,140
They said the owner of the wood plate store must've run far away by now.

638
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:16,490
No.

639
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:24,190
This person waited there risking his life to deliver this message.

640
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:27,420
It's a much more meticulous and bigger organization than we thought it was.

641
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,750
That person, already knows something.

642
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:36,090
This is definitely can be used to find that person.

643
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,180
We must solve this.

644
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:43,840
Aigoo. Why did that person give it to Young Master? You can't even solve it.

645
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,550
Also, this one.

646
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,620
It must be because of this.

647
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,580
The doll that Boon Yi has.

648
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,190
Is there any connection?

649
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,690
Ay, what is this?

650
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,850
They're doing all sorts of things.

651
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,810
What is this?

652
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,970
This is just wood.

653
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:08,540
Should I try to break it...or burn it?

654
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,840
I'll try burning it.

655
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,760
What is this?

656
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,530
It's called nanjagak.

657
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,160
Nanjagak?

658
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,600
It's used to solve secret codes.

659
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,230
Wait a minute.

660
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:08,900
The length of one side of this is the same length as a letter on here.

661
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,730
So?

662
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:55,600
"Shut down the seven bases..."

663
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,500


664
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,140
Also,

665
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:05,280
"Shut down the seven bases..."
And...

666
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,530
- Hamju.
-Hamju.

667
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:10,420
"And gather...

668
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,700
"at Hamju..."

669
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,040
"Hamju?"

670
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,500
"And become Lee Seong Gye's people..."

671
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,650
Swordsman.

672
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,750
Would you like to go with me?

673
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,840
Where are we going?

674
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,780
That person...

675
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,010
To Hamju.

676
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:49,250
Where my father is

677
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,970
is Hamju.

678
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,340
We will go to Hamju.

679
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:19,930
Six Flying Dragons

680
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:23,410
If you fight in General Lee Seong Gye's army, you'll earn your reputation.

681
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,280
Yes, I'll go.

682
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,060
We're at Hamjoo!

683
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:30,590
We have to sneak in and find out what happened first.

684
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,270
I will absolutely be with him.

685
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:36,930
Please tell him that Boon Yi from Yiseo County is here. Tell him to keep his promise!

686
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:39,220
- That's betrayal!!
- No, it isn't.

687
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,830
I'll chop off your head!

688
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:43,230
The reason he sent us to you, General, is that...

689
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:44,280
Who is that person?

690
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,930
I am that person.
