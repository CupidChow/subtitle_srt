This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,810
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,890
How are you here, Po Eun?

4
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,910
A strange letter told me to come here.

5
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,630
Sa Hyeong.

6
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,090
New Joseon...?

7
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,440
What is this?

8
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,510
A letter told you to come here?

9
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,150
Episode 27

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,160
There is an important truth you must know about Sam Bong.
If you are truly for Goryeo, then go to the cave on Mt. Jinam.

11
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,920
It said there was an important truth I must know and told me of this location.
(Po Eun - Jeong Mong Joo)

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,950
That I must come if I am for Goryeo.

13
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,220
However this is our study space. Let us leave for now.

14
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,870
Go outside for a bit.

15
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,240
Teacher...

16
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,080
I have to talk with Sa Hyeong.

17
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,420
Yes.

18
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,720
That person also came after receiving a letter?

19
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,900
Yes.

20
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,790
But Po Eun helped Ajussi and the general a lot. Doesn't that mean he's on our side?

21
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,730
That doesn't seem to be the case.

22
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,410
I thought so too, but the atmosphere was a little weird.
(Moo Hyul)

23
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,800
This place...

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,540
What is this place?

25
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,450
The system to establish a new nation is being made here.

26
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,290
Sam Bong!

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,350
Ho Jung (Ha Ryun) told me that you were in the midst of planning something. I did not believe him.

28
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,340
That you were even planning to bring down Goryeo. I had not believed him, but...

29
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,460
I kept my promise with Sa Hyeong.
(Sam Bong - Jeong Do Jeon)

30
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,450
Bringing down Goryeo was not first, but I kept my promise with Sa Hyeong.

31
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,030
Kim Yong, that bastard, falsified the king's decree.

32
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,810
Who is it!

33
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,700
Your petty desire for power caused innocent children

34
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,100
to die unjustly

35
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,280
Calm, calm down. Look here.

36
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,610
Because of your forgery of that false document!

37
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,930
That's not a fake.

38
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,940
What?

39
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,340
Why do you think that it is fake?

40
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,300
The King would never issue that kind of decree.

41
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,010
I'll tell you the truth.

42
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,890
The truth...

43
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,300
The Red Turbans invaded in vast numbers.
(Kim Yong)

44
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,960
The King abandoned the capital city and its people and went to Mong Jin.
*Mong Jin: When the king abandons his country and goes to a safe place.

45
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,970
He ran away.

46
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,220
The image of the great king who was supposed to punish the indignity we experienced from the Mongols

47
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,700
fell flat on the ground.

48
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,240
But those four generals who saved this country,

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,960
furthermore, they controlled all of the army.

50
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,170
What do you think His Majesty would have done?

51
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:28,690
All of the people cheering for the four generals who saved Gaegyeong

52
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:36,350
Just how would His Majesty see this?

53
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,280
This is a matter of power, of politics.

54
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,010
Your Highness!

55
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,350
Before the sweat from the feet of those who recaptured Gaegyeong could dry,

56
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,820
before the victory cry ended.

57
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,010
Why, why

58
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,430
was Goryeo's hero Kim Deuk Bae's accomplishment

59
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,970
met with bloodshed?!

60
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,960
Your Highness!

61
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,020
Why are you doing this?

62
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,890
How can a scholar burn Mencius texts?

63
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,090
Nothing in this text is correct.

64
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,200
Both Confucius and Mencius were wrong.

65
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,000
If not, how could our wise king (King Gong Min, the 31st king)

66
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,190
view the heroes who protected Goryeo as enemies and kill them?

67
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:56,450
I thought it was just because of Kim Yong's wickedness. But it wasn't.

68
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,670
His Majesty committed this act in order to keep his power.

69
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,860
In the end, this is what politics is.

70
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:14,030
Confucius and Mencius' words that politics and justice are one are all false.

71
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,180
This text is useless!

72
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,730
You fool!

73
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,490
The text has no fault. The fault lies solely with men who do not follow the text.

74
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,470
What was the difference between Chu-tzu and Buddhism.

75
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,710
It's not that man can be redeemed by leaving this world,

76
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:45,610
but that in the world man can only redeem himself.

77
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,100
It said to be diligent and devote yourself to completion.

78
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,310
But what kind of diligence and devotion did you show this world

79
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,290
that you commit this kind of act?

80
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,420
Can I devote myself, Sa Hyeong?

81
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:13,030
Truly, truly can I do that?

82
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,180
You can. Of course you can.

83
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:24,090
If I'm diligent can I really make a world like these texts?

84
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:30,950
You can! Let's make it. We can make it.

85
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,840
I

86
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,500
trusted in your words.

87
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,150
In order to make this nation like the one in the texts

88
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:48,740
I thought again, and again, again...

89
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,520
So please listen, listen and then tell me.

90
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,070
They are the same troubles that we debated over when we were young.

91
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,120
They must be planning on talking all night.

92
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,670
Then it'll probably work out well.

93
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,870
When I first heard Ajussi's plan my heart also fluttered and became excited.

94
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,240
Po Eun (Jeong Mong Joo) will also be like that.

95
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,170
Is land the only problem? Eumseongjae is also one.
*Eumseongjae: When the offspring of someone who was previously in public office or achieved an accomplishment was granted a government position without examination.

96
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,520
A situation where a twelve-year-old child is given a governmental position because his father was an authority figure

97
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,890
is a frequent occurrence in this country.

98
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,360
So all authority positions will be given based on the civil service examinations?

99
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,380
Yes. That way we can prevent the malignant effects of one family continuously taking the important responsibilities of the royal court without the required capability.

100
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,310
There will be more people with exceptional ability, and if those people are given positions of authority then the qualifications will go up!

101
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,690
Yes, only then will there be a government position

102
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,330
that does not bend under any power whether it be the king's or the prime minister's, and is capable of denouncing the king's wrongdoings.

103
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,850
Then what do you think of the reformation of military power?

104
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,050
Yes, that's...

105
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,360
They're really staying up all night.

106
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,280
Must be.

107
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,600
It'll be fine.

108
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,940
But why did you do that yesterday?

109
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,560
- What?
- After the Nameless organization was mentioned you said you were tired

110
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,130
and suddenly became weird.
(Lee Bang Won)

111
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,210
I mean there are times when a person is like that.

112
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,910
But if Po Eun was really sent here by the Nameless organization then...

113
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:02,240
It means that Nameless wants Po Eun to know about our plans.

114
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,630
But don't the Nameless want to interfere with our plans?

115
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,900
That's what I'm saying.

116
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,560
Look at this. Isn't this the country

117
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,940
that we were concerned about and wanted to make when we were young?

118
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,470
You

119
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,540
have prepared something truly great. This is incredible.

120
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,690
Thank you.

121
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,680
Let's do it under the title of Goryeo.

122
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,090
The country that you-- No. The country that we want to make, let's create it under the title of Goryeo.

123
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,640
Why? No. Is that even going to work?

124
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,970
Goryeo is the country of Buddhism with a society of nobles.

125
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,320
But the thing we are trying to accomplish is only possible by basing it on Neo-Confucianism and breaking apart the nobles.

126
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,080
Without getting rid of them, we can't even carry out a reformation. So why does it have to be Goryeo?

127
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,520
Then even though you talk of making an ideal Confucian country,

128
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,110
you are going to start with a treason, which is the complete opposite of Confucian ideals?

129
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,580
It's making something new, not treason.

130
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,410
It's treason. How is changing the country not considered treason?

131
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,670
Then how can we begin?

132
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,210
You are contradicting yourself by saying you are going to make an ideal Confucian country while doing something a Confucian scholar shouldn't do.

133
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,000
There is always a contradiction in the beginning of something.

134
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,870
Then I cannot go with you.

135
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,310
The country that I'm trying to make needs you. No, I need you.

136
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,680
Then listen to me.

137
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,480
I will convince you. I will try to convince you until the day I die. Mark my words.

138
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,710
That goes the same for me too. I, also, will convince you.

139
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,820
How did it go?

140
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,990
I told him everything.

141
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,430
Then did he decide to join us?

142
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,310
I will convince him until the end.

143
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,180
Moo Hyul, chase after Teacher Po Eun.

144
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,920
What are you doing?

145
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,730
Aren't you saying he didn't agree even after hearing all of our secrets? Then we can't just leave him like that.

146
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,540
And?

147
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,530
Whether or not he's going to the criminal investigation bureau, or the palace

148
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,200
or is meeting someone or not, we have to put him under surveillance.

149
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,900
You don't need to. He's probably gone to meet General Lee Seong Gye.

150
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,870
Father? Why?

151
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,580
He's probably going try to convince him.

152
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:16,650
What if he's not? What if he is going to the criminal investigation bureau to report and arrest Father?

153
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,950
What if that is the reason the Nameless sent him here?

154
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,160
Whatever the Nameless' intentions are, Colleague Po Eun is not going to do something like that.

155
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,680
How can you trust a person? Even from a single drop of rain,

156
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,680
a person can change. Even if you and Teacher Po Eun have had a deep friendship in the past,

157
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,580
how can you just simply let him go with such important secrets?

158
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,970
You've told me that since you do not trust the Sadaebu, you are going to make a system where they are suspicious of each other.

159
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,640
But you are letting Teacher Po Eun go, because you trust him? That's not right.

160
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,750
Do you want to bet?

161
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,180
If I win, do not do anything to Po Eun.

162
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,830
Yes. But if I win, then I will act on my own.

163
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,270
Let's go, Moo Hyul.

164
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,510
Then even though you talk of making an ideal Confucian country,

165
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,110
you are going to start with a treason, which is the complete opposite of Confucian ideals?

166
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,290
So please join me.

167
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,760
You are the only person who can keep me on the path of a Confucian scholar.

168
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,270
Since the Nameless now knows, we have to get rid of this data, right?

169
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes. We have to.

170
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,210
Yes. I will get rid of them all.

171
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,780
Ajusshi.

172
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,270
You have to muster up your strength.

173
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,240
I know. Don't worry.

174
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,530
- General.
- You have something to say to me.

175
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,090
Since you heard everything to from Sam Bong, you must have something to say.

176
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,170
General. For the last few decades, without caring for your own safety,

177
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,540
you have been a hero who has saved Goryeo numerous times.

178
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,180
But if that comes to an end by overthrowing Goryeo,

179
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,960
you will end up being a usurper.

180
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,970
I do not want for that either.

181
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,930
But what has happened so far?

182
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:02,810
While I was fighting in all those countless wars, the Gwon Moon Sae Jok sitting in Do dDang have been taking from the people,

183
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:09,240
and the Sadaebu were too suppressed by their power to take responsibility.

184
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,620
- Isn't that right?
- Yes. That is right.

185
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:19,030
I had no thought of gaining power, nor did I have the method to gain power.

186
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,560
But it was just Sam Bong that came to me,

187
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,920
and he asked for power in exchange for a future for the people.

188
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,100
Sam Bong was desperate

189
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,460
for the country, for the people.

190
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,770
Yes. I admit it.

191
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,090
When I was looking through all the systems that he had drawn out,

192
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:55,820
I could feel how fiercely he had thought it out.

193
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,200
I was ashamed of myself, and I wanted to join him.

194
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:10,340
But General. Don't make Sam Bong into a traitor. Don't be a usurper.

195
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,390
If you raise Goryeo again with this reformation, you will shine throughout history

196
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,670
as the hero who saved Goryeo.

197
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:25,050
Sam Bong said that you are the most important person in the new country we are going to make.

198
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,170
Let's do this together, Po Eun.

199
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,060
General!

200
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,210
Teacher...

201
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,580
Is the General inside?

202
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,110
Yes.

203
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,280
What is it?

204
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:14,330
Kim Song Ak, the official from the Ministry of Revenue who was going to leave today to survey the land, has been murdered.

205
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,210
It's a knife wound. According to the wife, he came home drunk last night and they fell asleep together.

206
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,480
But when she woke up, he was lying dead like this.

207
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,750
The wife who was right next to him didn't even know?

208
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,000
Does this guy even know anything?

209
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,620
Oh, when I saw him last time, he surprisingly seemed to have great skills in this area.

210
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,310
That's unexpected. Have you found out anything?
Lee Bang Gwa

211
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,790
In one strike, his airway, esophagus, and vocal cords have all be severed.
(Hong Dae Hong, Moo Hyul's Master)

212
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,620
He probably died without being able to scream or feel anything.

213
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,920
The strike must have been very fast...

214
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,820
What's wrong?

215
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,610
What is this?

216
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,760
This is...

217
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,800
What happened?

218
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,510
Did Kim Song Ak really die?

219
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,290
Yes. On a day like today...

220
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,790
Today was the day they were leaving to survey the land for the land reform...

221
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,630
Elder Sam Bong!

222
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,730
The revenue official, Lee Dae Young, has also died.

223
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,680
Then...

224
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,330
The Elder is still sleeping.

225
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,830
Hey, are you inside?

226
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:17,100
The three officials from Ministry of Revenue who were going to survey the lands

227
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,450
have all died.

228
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,340
How did this happen?

229
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,480
Is it because of the land survey?

230
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,070
Did this happen... because of that?

231
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,830
Could it be the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok? Or is it Nameless?

232
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,410
Hyungnim, now that we're feeling better, you don't have to come.

233
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:08,700
Before that, what is this talk about a government official being killed?

234
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,290
It's not just one.

235
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,900
The three officials who were leaving to survey the lands...

236
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,420
All of them were murdered.

237
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,800
What?

238
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,930
What bastards did it?

239
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:36,010
I think they did it. The ones who tried to assassinate you, General.

240
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,520
The one who suddenly came out in Do Hwa Jeon?

241
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,760
Who is that? Do you know who's behind that person?

242
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,990
Nameless. I think it is Nameless.

243
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,340
That organization actually exists?

244
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:02,310
I think that's what the situation says. I will certainly find those people.

245
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,980
I confirmed that Teacher Po Eun went back to his house.

246
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,030
I understand.

247
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,390
Just who would do just a dreadful thing?

248
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,300
Teacher Sam Bong said that it seems to have been done by those who tried to assassinate the General in Do Hwa Jeon.

249
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,630
What is that about?

250
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,500
Are you saying that the Nameless killed Kim Song Ak?

251
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,650
It wasn't just one person. They say that there were three people.
(Myo Sang: Moo Hyul's grandmother)

252
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,370
All three of the officials who were supposed to go out tomorrow to survey lands died.

253
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,940
Really?

254
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,260
Yes. That's why everyone is worried now,
(Gab Boon)

255
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,920
because there are no more government officials who want to do the survey for fear for their lives.

256
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,000
Just today, five people already opted out using illness as an excuse.

257
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,630
Isn't this because of the land survey?

258
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,650
Yes. Three government officials who received the order to do the land survey have already died.

259
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,150
Who would want to do that job now?

260
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:59,100
To think that government officials of this country would be scared and resign because of such a thing...
(Lee Bang Woo)

261
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:05,860
From the start, the members of the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok didn't want to do this so it's becoming more out of control.

262
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,960
This is a warning from someone.

263
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,580
Nameless. Just who are they?

264
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,570
Whoever you are, I will not surrender to you and stop the land survey.

265
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,410
I will think of a way.

266
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,660
(Lee Bang Ji)

267
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,400
Mother...

268
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,940
Why are you going around like this, Brother. You're not resting.

269
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,770
Boon Yi.

270
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:11,080
The mark used by the people who kidnapped Mother has appeared again.

271
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,080
They say it's an organization called Nameless. I will look for Mother again.

272
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,140
Mom is dead. That's what you said.

273
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,160
But why are you going to look for her now?

274
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,110
Actually, there's something that I wasn't able to tell you.

275
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,380
There was a time that I met Gil Seon Mi when I was young. He said that if I continued looking for Mother,

276
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,260
you and Mother would both die.

277
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,240
That's why I just buried her in my heart.

278
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:54,460
But the situation now is different. The person who tried to kill General Lee Seong Gye at Do Hwa Jeon is a member of Nameless.

279
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:59,720
If I keep on following the Nameless, I will surely be able to find Mother.

280
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:07,720
I'm just thinking that while expecting it,

281
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,360
I might end up just being disappointed.

282
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,580
She's alive. She's certainly alive.

283
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,150
But Brother, if...

284
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:29,890
If Mom was alive

285
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,300
during this long period of time,

286
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,400
how could she not have looked for us?

287
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:53,290
Even after all that, I stayed in the Western district for a long time.

288
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,500
There will be a reason for it, Boon Yi.

289
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:16,370
The officials who are supposed to do the land survey are trembling in fear of an enemy they can't see. What should we do?

290
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,500
But if we stop now, aren't we just going according to what those people want?
(Jo Joon)

291
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,600
We must proceed with the land survey.

292
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,930
Still, it's not something that we can just stubbornly enforce.

293
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,860
What do you think we should do, Sam Bong?

294
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,620
Proceeding like this is reckless.

295
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,120
Then, are you going to stop here?

296
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,210
No. I will not stop eitherl.

297
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,380
General, you need to make a move first.

298
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,570
Minister Lee Seong Gye is coming in.

299
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,880
Your Majesty. Please dismiss everyone.

300
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,340
What are you saying? Why are we supposed to go out?

301
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,830
Three officials who are supposed to go and do the land survey have died.

302
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:14,480
I urgently need to speak to His Highness about that incident.

303
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,120
Because it is an important national affair, please understand.

304
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,980
Please leave.
(King Chang: Goryeo's 33rd King)

305
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,850
What is it about?

306
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,570
Please review this document and sign it.

307
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,400
General Lee Seong Gye and Sam Bong's actions are suspicious.

308
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,740
Information came about Lee Seong Gye meeting His Highness in private. What's so suspicious about that?
(Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan's owner)

309
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,890
Sam Bong's associates

310
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:30,140
have all been instructed to prepare to leave Ga Byeol Cho in disguise. It's tomorrow.
(Yeon Hee)

311
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:36,380
Are they going to survey the lands in secret?

312
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,480
I'm not sure about that...

313
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,520
You have to go. Chief Minister of Personnel Lord Jo Sang Won is here.

314
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,790
Ah, right.

315
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,050
Find out more information related to this.

316
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,540
Yes.

317
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,090
Yes, You only have to sell the information you got from me to the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok.

318
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,760
The royal family's well-being ritual?

319
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,450
Yes. The queen dowager asked His Majesty after Lee Seong Gye left,

320
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,870
and the signed document was about the costs related to the ritual.

321
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:26,030
Ah, this doesn't make sense. Why does he need to talk about it in private?
(Woo Hak Joo)

322
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,660
What could Lee Seong Gye be planning to do again?

323
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,220
It seems that he's planning something else now that there's a problem with the land survey...
(Han Gu Young)

324
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,680
This man, Lee Seong Gye, is quite suspicious.

325
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,770
- What do you mean?
- Cho Young gave us a heads up.

326
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,840
Lee Seong Gye has instructed his associates to be prepared in disguise.

327
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:55,420
Lee Seong Gye received a secret document
(Lee Saek)

328
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,670
and instructed his people to be on standby?

329
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,540
Look into what Lee Seong Gye and Jeong Do Jeon are plotting.

330
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,390
They will be leaving Gaegyeong today.

331
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,720
Yes. I understand.
(Jeok Ryong: Bi Guk Temple Head Monk)

332
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,160
Lee Seong Gye and His Highness talked in private

333
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,970
and Jeong Do Jeon's people are secretly doing something.

334
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,350
Should I send the guys?

335
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,000
I will go myself.
(Gil Seon Mi)

336
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,980
The preparations are done.

337
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,080
Give this sealed document to each of them.

338
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,220
My Mother, palace maid Yeon Hyang.

339
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,720
What kind of person is she?

340
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,400
She's intelligent and strong

341
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,900
and very talented in various things.

342
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,750
That's why Princess Noguk always kept her by her side.

343
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,450
You don't seem like Yeon Hyang's son,

344
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,880
but Boon Yi looks exactly like her.

345
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,320
Could Princess Noguk's death and

346
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,560
our mother's disappearance be connected?

347
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,410
I don't know about that.

348
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,730
Just that, after Princess Noguk died,

349
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,750
there was a rumor that went around that Yeon Hyang committed suicide.

350
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,140
Why do you think my mother got kidnapped?

351
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,320
Bang Ji.

352
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,860
This is not about finding your mother but about finding Nameless.

353
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,750
[Nam Eun]

354
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,670
I'm going with you.

355
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,780
We have to find the man called Baek Geun Soo.

356
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,520
- Who is Baek Geun Soo?
- When we were young,

357
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,590
in the beggars' hideout. Don't you remember?

358
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,510
This drawing in this letter!

359
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,550
The one who has this drawing took our Mom.

360
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,530
Ajussi are you a traitor?

361
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,760
Your brother says that man even tried to kill him.

362
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,060
When I was young,

363
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,780
I just thought that person was a spy sent by Lee In Gyeom but that man is a part of Nameless.

364
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,360
Did you look for Baek Geun Soo's whereabouts after that?

365
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,050
I did but since then, his whereabouts have been unknown.
(Jo Young Gyu)

366
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,410
Boon Yi.

367
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,840
Make a composite sketch of that person and look into it through the organization members.

368
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,570
Can we find a person who went missing a long time ago just by using a composite sketch?

369
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,500
If he's still active through Nameless,

370
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,240
he's probably in Gaegyeong right now or he'll appear in Gaegyeong someday.

371
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,760
He will be caught by your members someday.

372
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,950
- Yes.
- Also...

373
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,860
- Yes.
- Please watch over Teacher Po Eun.

374
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,770
Teacher Po Eun?

375
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,830
In the end, General,

376
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,850
you will become a usurper.

377
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,570
The reformation can't be done without attacking those people. But why does it have to be Goryeo?

378
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,420
Chief Scholar of Royal Advisory, Jeong Mong Joo is entering.

379
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,340
Your Highness! Why are you crying?

380
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,960
His Highness is being like that because he misses the previous king.

381
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,140
Why wouldn't he? Minister Lee Seong Gye comes frequently

382
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,570
and tells him to sign a document he doesn't even know about.

383
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,080
How can His Highness not be scared, considering his young age?

384
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,150
But Your Highness,

385
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,480
the documents that the Minister asks you to sign

386
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,070
are things that the people of this country really need.

387
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,790
You have to definitely read the contents.

388
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,700
How could even you not understand His Majesty's feelings?
Queen Dowager (31st King Gong Min's Wife)

389
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,540
What else can I say...

390
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,820
Serving such a young king like this,

391
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,570
just what must I do?

392
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,580
This country.

393
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,460
What will happen to Goryeo?

394
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:51,160
You didn't inform His Highness, right?

395
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,480
Can I say something?

396
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,470
Why can it not work?

397
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,500
You agree with all of the reform but why can't we change the country and the system?

398
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,880
Isn't that disloyalty and treason?

399
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,170
In what way is it disloyalty and in what way is it treason?

400
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:26,960
Is it the people? Is it the country or the system? Mencius definitely

401
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,650
said it was the people.

402
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,560
Don't you think so, Teacher Po Eun?

403
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:44,740
I will say this as your teacher in Seonggyungwan.

404
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,840
Don't sell the people in that way.

405
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,270
There's no law that says that you can't protect the people while doing the reform and keeping the country and the system.

406
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,790
Also,

407
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,780
are you bringing up talks about the people because they are in your heart

408
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,310
or are you just bringing them up for

409
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,260
your family's honor?

410
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,650
Take a good look at your heart yourself.

411
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,330
Teacher,

412
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,780
it would be good if you could have a look at your own heart.

413
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:30,200
Saying that it must not happen because it is disloyalty and treason,

414
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:35,190
is it just because of your sense of loyalty to the country and the system?

415
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,980
Or is it so that your name would remain for generations to come?

416
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,760
One who considers precious his name and honor,

417
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,710
does not cause harm to history at least.

418
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,670
I'm saying this with my short thinking.

419
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,180
History

420
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,800
is something that hangs on what the future generations of people will talk about.

421
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,310
What?

422
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,480
You asked me if the people are really in my heart.

423
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,310
Yes, I will have a good look at it.

424
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:17,600
But in my heart, in any moment,

425
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,450
there is no chance of accepting

426
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,280
the people of a future generation in which history has no meaning.

427
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,590
But only those that are standing together on this ground,

428
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:40,580
and gritting their teeth to live, only those people of the current world will have place in my heart.

429
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,930
Thank you for the teachings, Teacher.

430
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,520
Now, you should have your own people too.

431
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,090
Visit Father frequently.

432
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,170
I suppose, in the current rapidly changing situation,

433
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,930
you're not someone who would deeply involve yourself with one side.

434
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:40,060
That is very humiliating to a Confucian scholar

435
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:45,970
but I don't know why it sounds like a compliment to me.

436
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:50,430
Elder. Son-in-law Bang Won is here.

437
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,410
Father-in-law, did anything happen recently?

438
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,170
Why did you come?

439
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:08,320
Well... "Father-in-law, you should go into the Do Dang now."

440
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:14,890
"Go in there and please help me with a few things." I think he came to say that.
(Ha Ryun)

441
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,060
Don't be too serious.
(Min Je: Haedong Gapjok's Head, nicknamed Eo Eun)

442
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,190
The one who takes Ho Jeong seriously loses.

443
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,730
But why are you really here?

444
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,450
Was Ho Jeong right?

445
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,940
I told you I was right.

446
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:53,030
This man. You're quite good with physiognomy. Are you now into reading people's minds as well?

447
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,090
No. I just made a guess.

448
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:11,340
Sit down. This man makes a lot of jokes so don't mind it.

449
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,420
Why are you looking at me like that?

450
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,400
Make a guess again.

451
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,540
Make a guess about what?

452
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,230
Whether Elder Min Je will go into the Do Dang or not? Or maybe...

453
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,070
This country,

454
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,260
how long will it last?

455
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,970
This country...

456
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:14,180
doesn't have a way like this.

457
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:19,870
It was wrong from the moment General Jo Min Soo enthroned a young king.

458
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,620
Because General Jo made it that way, the royal family has become weaker.

459
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:29,270
After the troop withdrawal, Prince Jeong Chang should have been naturally enthroned.

460
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:35,900
Prince Jeong Chang... I will find a way.

461
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,970
Prince Jeong Chang's (Wang Yo's) residence

462
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,690
Aigoo. Aren't you Lord Po Eun?

463
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,960
Is Prince Jeong Chang inside?

464
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,300
Yes. It's cold so please come inside.

465
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,540
Watching you dance is my only happiness.

466
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,520
I am happy to be able to show you my dance.
(Yoon Rang)

467
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:57,190
Say your greetings. He's Lord Po Eun Jeong Mong Joo.

468
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,090
I am Yoon Rang.

469
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:25,210
I don't know where such a lady appeared to make me this happy.

470
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,510
Isn't it such a breathtaking dance?

471
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,870
Ah, yes. I enjoyed it, Your Highness.

472
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,170
Don't even call me that.

473
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,950
What Your Highness? A while ago, when the Generals who lead the troop withdrawal
(Wang Yo: Future 34th King of Goryeo, King Yang Wang)

474
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,600
told me to be the king and stuff like that,

475
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,960
my first thoughts were to run away with this woman.

476
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,210
I'm enjoying a happy life and you tell me to be the king?

477
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:07,230
I will just be a powerless puppet and I would have to

478
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,580
keep getting married to maidens those people tell me to marry.

479
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,890
I cannot live like that.

480
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:24,200
Because you say it like that, I am also delighted.

481
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,720
Right.

482
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,680
I have a guest so you should go rest.

483
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,300
Yes.

484
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,880
Teacher Po Eun. What's the matter?

485
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,080
Ah, yes. I was walking past so I thought about having a chat and came here.

486
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,310
I am also curious as to how you have been.

487
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,890
Let's start.

488
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,120
Were you not followed?

489
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,050
Laid on the ground are a map and a compass.

490
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,960
Just what are they doing?

491
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:19,430
Jeong Do Jeon and his group have split up. It looks like they are returning to Gaegyeong.

492
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,030
Just what these guys trying to do?

493
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:29,980
Jeong Do Jeon pointed to the southeastern mountain,

494
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,650
and they seemed to discuss something with the map open.

495
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,390
And they also seemed to be looking that way.

496
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:44,170
What does this location mean?

497
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:47,630
It's not a farmland, so it's probably not to survey the land.

498
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,110
Perhaps...

499
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,480
Perhaps what?

500
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,690
Maybe they are trying to move the capital?

501
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,980
Move the capital?

502
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,990
Yes, if they move the capital, it will weaken the Gwon Moon Sae Jok who are based in Gaegyeong.

503
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:08,410
But this area is too mountainous, so it makes it difficult to travel and transport goods.

504
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,710
Also, looking at the geomantic interpretations, this location doesn't fit well.

505
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:17,140
Then what is this place for?

506
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:32,720
No...

507
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,800
What's wrong?

508
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,280
No way.

509
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,690
Can't you see? What kind of location this is?

510
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:53,430
Everyone, draw your swords.

511
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,620
What?

512
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,110
You know, this location...

513
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:02,950
It's a great location to surround your enemies and ambush.

514
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,790
All of you drop you swords and surrender!

515
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:40,300
Jeong Do Jeon, Jeong Do Jeong... You are indeed great.

516
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,780
If you get caught, do as we've sworn.

517
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,920
Yes, sir!

518
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,760
Attack them all!

519
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,240
You can't catch Gil Sun Mi with just those men.

520
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,650
You are right.

521
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,990
We can't catch him, but I also said not to catch him.

522
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,150
Then?

523
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,600
Now, it's time for you two to do your part.

524
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,720
If Gil Sun Mi escapes, then chase after him.

525
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,410
We must obtain some sort of clue regarding their leader no matter what.

526
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,370
- Yes.
- I understand.

527
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,760
Okay. Go.

528
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,570
After them!

529
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:31,130
What are you? A warrior or an assassin?

530
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:34,660
I become whatever is necessary.

531
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,310
Are you disappointed that I attacked you by surprise?

532
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,920
Not really.

533
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,160
Well I mean this isn't an official duel. Our places have changed, huh?

534
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,690
With my brother, you were always the one being chased.

535
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,200
Have you arrived?

536
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,650
Please come in. He is waiting.

537
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,660
Four are dead and one has been captured.

538
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,980
He tried to commit suicide as well, but we put a gag in his mouth and tied him up.

539
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:42,130
You won't be able to get anything useful from him, just think of him as bait and think of a plan.

540
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,050
Yes, I understand.

541
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,240
Here it is.

542
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,210
It's the third white soil mark.

543
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,880
It must not be that far away.

544
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:08,040
It's another white soil mark.

545
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:13,500
What happened?

546
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:19,830
I got caught while following him, and as I was fighting him, he ran this way...

547
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,610
So he is inside this temple.

548
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,290
Surround this temple.

549
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,830
Yes I understand.

550
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:28,610
Let's go.

551
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,600
Gil Sun Mi has gone inside Seong Bo Jeon

552
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,800
Yeon Hyang!

553
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,620
Mother!

554
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:46,010
Six Flying Dragons
Preview

555
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:49,040
Mother is alive. I'm not going to give up anymore.

556
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,740
- Where is she?
- You'll never be able to see her.

557
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,460
These are all reports saying we need to postpone the land survey.

558
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,650
How can they not say a word like that?

559
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:00,020
I will never do such a thing as changing this country.

560
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,230
Please give this to Lee Seong Gye as a royal gift.

561
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,990
I am Chuk Ga who lived in Goksun.

562
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:07,170
Kill the ash tree's flower... Is that really his will?

563
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:10,850
He said to cut off the flower before it blossoms.

564
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,530
Teacher Po Eun is definitely thinking of other plans.

565
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,710
I can't trust him completely.

566
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:18,740
Nameless. It's the Nameless.
