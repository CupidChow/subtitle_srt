Episode 34

3
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,100
Just live for yourself without looking at the world.

4
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,760
Unni, are you busy?

5
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,760
Master Sambong wants the reformation in the Buddhist temples to happen soon.

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,040
I met Mom.

7
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,200
What?

8
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,580
I met Mom.

9
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,020
How?

10
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,040
Mom appeared in front of me

11
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
but I couldn't tell anyone.

12
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,380
Not even to Elder Sam Bong or Young Master Bang Won.

13
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,080
I can't even tell my brother.

14
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,000
I met Mom after more than ten years.

15
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,090
What does that mean?

16
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,530
You met Mother?

17
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,490
Brother.

18
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,310
Tell me. What does that mean?

19
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,830
Brother.

20
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,970
Jeong Mong Joo.

21
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,740
Did Mother really say that?

22
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,340
Yes.

23
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,260
She also told me to say that to you.

24
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:39,580
Did she really say that you should be willing to abandon people who are important to you for the great cause?

25
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,940
Yes. If I'm not ready, I should just quit.

26
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,540
I think what she said was right.

27
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,920
After a while, I came to understand.

28
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,880
Mom said that Nameless is herself.

29
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,400
That is possible too.

30
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,230
It seems that I care less for Mom than you do. It's not hard on me at all.

31
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,750
Don't be like that, Boon Yi. It's not that.

32
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,210
No. It's true. I'm really okay.

33
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,030
Mother said that?

34
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,950
Teacher Sam Bong...

35
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,530
Teacher Sam Bong got arrested.

36
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,320
How can this happen?

37
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,060
Minister Lee left last night and hasn't come back yet.

38
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,760
This would never happen without Father's complicity.

39
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Jeong Mong Joo must've done this while General Lee was absent.

40
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,220
Did Po Eun really consume Father?

41
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,120
For now, we have to find General Lee.

42
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,880
Whatever happens, I will find Father.

43
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,220
So your judgement was right, Mugeuk.

44
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,590
No matter what Jeong Mong Joo thinks of us, we just have to support him.

45
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,200
That's right. The problem is Lee Seong Gye.

46
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,480
You mean how Lee Seong Gye will react to Sambong's arrest will be crucial, right?

47
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:44,230
Will Jeong Mong Joo be able to control Lee Seong Gye?

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,800
Yeon Hyang, I'm sorry.

49
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,790
If I hadn't look for you,

50
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,150
then something like this wouldn't have happened to your children.

51
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,490
You should be the leader now. Organize the group and launch a counterattack.

52
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,640
How can we just let those people live?

53
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,340
Why are you looking at me like that?

54
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,480
I can't attack Yooksan now.

55
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,020
The organization might collapse.

56
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,530
It's nothing.

57
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,290
I was thinking about what you said.

58
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,810
Ah, yes.

59
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,640
In order for this country to quickly regain the peace it once enjoyed before Lee In Gyeom's doings,

60
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,380
Jeong Mong Joo must be able to control Lee Seong Gye.

61
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,460
Yes, that's right.

62
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,340
For now, hold a firm grasp on Po Eun's actions.

63
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,300
Yes.

64
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
We must send Sam Bong into exile.

65
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,520
But the agreement with Minister Lee at Jangyeongak was

66
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,960
to temporarily remove Sam Bong from office.

67
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,420
Do we really have to send him to exile?

68
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:25,300
Let's say that he temporarily rests from public office but as long as he is in Gaegyeong, his communication with Minister will continue.

69
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,460
Still, when Minister Lee comes back—

70
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,840
I will take care of Minister Lee,

71
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,100
so please order Sam Bong to be sent into exile, Your Highness.

72
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,590
We have to send him to exile before Minister Lee comes back.

73
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,200
Secretly and as soon as possible.

74
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,830
Okay, bring the writing utensils.

75
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,370
Torturing is not needed.

76
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,780
An order for him to be exiled has arrived from His Highness,

77
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,300
so prepare a palanquin for him.

78
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,000
A palanquin, not a cart?

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,430
That's right. Get it ready.

80
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,220
Yes. Let's go.

81
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,520
Did you plan this scheme?

82
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,000
I guess, i'm just another Confucian scholar

83
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
who gave in to the inevitabilities of politics.

84
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,300
If you were going to give in

85
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,740
why didn't you join me?

86
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,700
You should have joined me for my great cause?

87
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,360
No.

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,420
I can never agree to changing the court.

89
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,540
I will now kill you

90
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,020
and bring you back as a Confucian scholar.

91
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,780
I couldn't see Unni Boon Yi so I told Pal Bong's father

92
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,900
to disperse and find General Lee.

93
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,120
I also ordered Master Hong

94
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,900
to disperse the soldiers in training and find him.

95
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,080
Unni!

96
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,310
What's going on?

97
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,290
Teacher Sam Bong was arrested?

98
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,390
Yes. In Do Dang.

99
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,010
How did this happen?

100
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,610
What about the General? Did he just let it happen?

101
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,890
He wasn't there. We don't know where he is.

102
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,640
Could it be that this was done by Nameless?

103
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,460
- What about that?
- I asked if it was done by Nameless.

104
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,730
Brother.

105
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,840
I don't know whether Po Eun is Nameless or if he's taking orders from them,

106
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,340
but I am sure of what Nameless wants.

107
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,120
Young Gyu, look for Father and let me know.

108
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,340
Yes.

109
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,260
Let's go to the Investigation Bureau.

110
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:31,140
You will be remembered as an example of a royal Confucian scholar

111
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,320
who tried to reform a failing country and died.

112
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:42,630
That's the only way, because you won't stop.

113
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,870
After making a perfect plan for the world,

114
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,450
you won't be able to give up on it.

115
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,790
So are you going to kill me?

116
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,990
Didn't you always say this?

117
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,040
Dying in your grave means that the essence is more important than the body,

118
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,800
so a noble man sacrifices the body to achieve meaning.

119
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:25,520
Then don't make a mistake and make sure to kill me.

120
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,810
If you don't, you will end up dead.

121
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:39,680
If that happens, the example of a loyal Confucian scholar will not be me, but

122
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,420
it will be you.

123
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,830
What? What exile?

124
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,760
A royal order came to exile him so Lord Sam Bong already departed to where he will be exiled.

125
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,340
What?

126
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:12,200
I don't know what's going on. Where did Father go?

127
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,010
Did you see a cage-cart that went past here?

128
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,180
Have you seen a cage-cart?

129
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,810
I'm not sure. I don't think I did.

130
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:40,520
By any chance did you see a cage-cart pass by? It would be teacher Sam Bong who burned all the land information. Didn't you see the cart he was in?

131
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,410
I haven't seen one.

132
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,050
That way.

133
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,980
They already departed but we haven't seen it.

134
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,860
I came as soon as I heard but where did they take him?

135
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,780
It seems that he was secretly sent there so that we won't know.

136
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,710
Does this make sense?

137
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,480
They didn't even receive the king's order or get Sam Bong's confession.

138
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,920
Does it make sense to be sent to exile first?

139
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,990
From here it goes to the mountains.How is it that there is no one that saw them.

140
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:33,220
Is this something that a person who wants his name to remain in history would do?

141
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,510
It's something that a person who wants to protect the court would do.

142
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:43,030
Teacher Sam Bong begged you. He will give you all the power of the new country.

143
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,080
I don't need even a bit of power from a tyrant.

144
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,290
How amazing is Goryeo that, even when something like this happened, you're still willing to protect it?

145
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,130
How amazing is that great cause

146
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,200
that he is trying to demolish the country where he were born and raised?

147
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,780
Do you really think that Teacher Sam Bong is of low birth?

148
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,110
There's a evidence.

149
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,950
What evidence?

150
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,160
Do you mean like before, when you impeached King Wu by stating that he was not really of royal birth?

151
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,920
Do you think King Wu himself knew

152
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,210
whether he was Shin Don's son or the precious king's son.

153
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,750
Who would know?

154
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:40,360
In the end, the powerful remains noble

155
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,990
and the weak are made to be of low birth.

156
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,180
That's why Sam Bong is of low birth.

157
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,070
Because the sin he caused is so big, he became of low birth.

158
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,870
So you should keep that in mind as well.

159
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:10,130
Yes. I will put your lessons deep in my heart, Teacher.

160
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,860
Wasn't there any commotion about sending away Sam Bong?

161
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,580
I secretly sent him there.

162
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,800
Then of course, for lord Lee Saek,

163
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:48,340
pause his exile along with all the impeachments and exiles Sam Bong has put on others. I will also proclaim their reinstatement, so

164
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,680
proceed with it right away.

165
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,060
Don't you think that we need someone to be our strength?

166
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,250
A message has probably reached Lord Lee Saek by now.

167
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,770
What?

168
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:08,240
That's what I said. Teacher is for sure, but all of us will also be reinstated to our positions.

169
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,660
Was there a promise from Po Eun?

170
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,650
Yes. Po Eun didn't betray us. He was looking for an opportunity.

171
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,680
He even put Po Eun into a situation to make a scheme like this.

172
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,430
I feel such a grudge towards Sam Bong.

173
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,760
Po Eun, oh my goodness.

174
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,560
You have to go back to Gaegyeong as soon as possible and support with your power.

175
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,710
Please get ready. I will escort you.

176
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,240
I understand. Wait for a bit.

177
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,150
But it seems like I can't see lord Jo Sang Won.

178
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,180
That guy has been weird these days. He's drinking all day and crying.

179
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:07,280
Because he has become homeless because due to the land reform. He has probably killed minister Lee in his heart several times already.

180
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,550
Why are you looking like that?

181
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,500
It's nothing. I was just shocked that Po Eun did that.

182
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,700
Lee Bang Won is probably against the wall right now.
Wonder what he is doing right now.

183
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,280
The ones who were impeached will be reinstated, and those people

184
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,860
will all be against Jo Joon's reform.

185
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,100
How can such a thing happen just like that?

186
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,120
It seems that Father-in-law's will has changed.

187
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,180
The General has returned.

188
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,700
Where is he?

189
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,010
What? What does that mean? Who went to exile?

190
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:03,060
So you mean Po Eun did not pledge anything to you?

191
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:09,570
He only said that he will make Sam Bong rest for a bit. He didn't mention that he will send him to exile like this.

192
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,100
- How can Po Eun do this—
-Teacher Po Eun

193
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,750
seemed to have planned this from the start.

194
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:24,290
I'm sure that he pretended to go with our reform while scheming behind our backs.

195
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,810
Hyung-nim!

196
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,760
General!

197
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,580
General!

198
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,470
What I heard is that you and Sam Bong

199
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,390
are going to persuade each other until you die.

200
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,730
Yes. That is right.

201
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:04,580
Then why did you impeach Sam Bong using the excuse of his low birth?

202
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,690
It's because Sam Bong has become someone who cannot be persuaded anymore.

203
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:18,270
If that is so, then you can just say that we are all traitors and it will be easily over.

204
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,800
Isn't that so?

205
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,910
If I do that, I'd have to press you with a crime as well.

206
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,890
I don't have power to kill you.

207
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,870
Are you saying that you have power to kill Sam Bong?

208
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,420
Do you think I will just let it slide?

209
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,560
Because Sam Bong will die,

210
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,580
do you think that this great history will just disappear?

211
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,970
I will say this to you here.

212
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,260
The day that Sam Bong dies

213
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,740
will be the day Goryeo will be ruined.

214
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,750
Call Sam Bong back.

215
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,820
I cannot do that.

216
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,880
Call Sam Bong back.

217
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,130
I'd rather you just kill me here.

218
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,790
- What did you say?
- The day that Sam Bong dies,

219
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,280
you said that Goryeo will be ruined.

220
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,160
I dare to say this right now, but even if I die right now,

221
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,650
Goryeo will be ruined.

222
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,850
It's not because I am great

223
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,170
but because this country is now almost at the end.

224
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,130
So just kill me here.

225
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,530
Take the Ga Byeol Cho, go to the royal court,

226
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,510
drag His Highness down, and you, General,

227
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,400
can sit down on the throne.

228
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,020
Wouldn't it work with that?

229
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,240
Can you do that?

230
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,340
You cannot. You

231
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,940
are someone who cannot do that.

232
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,040
Making Gaegyeong into a blood bath,

233
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,930
sitting down on a bloody throne,

234
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,570
and turning over the country. You are not a person who would do those things.

235
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,130
That is why it is a path upon which you can no longer proceed.

236
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,380
If you don't stop here, the blood that will be spilled from now on

237
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,490
will be so much, it will overflow.

238
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,510
So, General, please,

239
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,750
please remain as a hero to Goryeo.

240
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:33,920
I will not say anything more.

241
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,530
- Bring Sam Bong back!
- I cannot do that.

242
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,910
Then,

243
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,500
- I will give up on everything.
- General!

244
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,260
Just because I will resign,

245
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,700
the military that I have

246
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,590
will not disappear,

247
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,190
and you know that.

248
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,070
You're going to resign?

249
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,060
If you resign,

250
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,340
then who is going to protect inside this palace?

251
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,570
I cannot allow that..

252
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,350
I have already made up my mind

253
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,810
so I will take my leave.

254
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:45,360
Look here, Minister Lee. Minister Lee! Minister Lee!

255
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,900
His majesty has rejected your resignation.

256
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,670
This is His Highness' reply.

257
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,530
I made myself clear.

258
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,110
I will come to you everyday.

259
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,560
I will leave Gaegyeong.

260
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,810
Bang Gwa will be training the Ga Byeol Cho

261
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,850
and have the Ga Byeol Cho in Ham Joo in very good condition.

262
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,320
The moment I say the word,

263
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,200
you must make sure that they will make their move.

264
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,930
Yes.

265
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,140
Let's go.

266
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,930
Minister Jeong Mong Joo is here!

267
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,710
What happened?

268
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,100
It seems that he doesn't have any intention of changing his mind.

269
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,330
However Minister Lee won't take careless action.

270
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,440
- How can you be so sure?
- Minister Lee,

271
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,270
because he is a warrior who has virtue and courtesy.

272
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,230
Virtue was one of the strongest points he had,

273
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,080
but from this point on, it will become a weakness that will stop his actions.

274
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,350
Then, what are you going to do from here on?

275
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,900
The traitors will receive punishment and

276
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,480
Minister Lee's deep wish to avoid betrayal

277
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,590
will surely turn him back.

278
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,940
When did Po Eun start looking like a different person?

279
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,100
Sam Bong, now, your will

280
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,980
can never come true.

281
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,660
General Lee Seong Gye cannot attack Po Eun

282
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,420
but he also cannot let me be like this.

283
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,600
so he will hesitate in the end.

284
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,270
He might even turn away.

285
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,130
Then, will that hesitation end first

286
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,720
or

287
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,950
will Po Eun be faster in reinstating those who were impeached?

288
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:25,800
If the Heavens will extend help to someone, which side will it be?

289
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,700
Lee Sung Gye blew up over the impeachment of Sam Bong, and

290
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,650
he even put a sword to Po Eun's neck.

291
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,960
It seems that Po Eun couldn't

292
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,790
completely persuade Lee Seong Gye.

293
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,350
If it comes to this, we have to help Po Eun.

294
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,990
How?

295
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,860
We'd have to kill Lee Seong Gye. If he dies,

296
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,740
Sam Bong will eventually be killed

297
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,810
and we will then support Po Eun

298
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,970
and stabilize the country again.

299
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,390
Right now, when Lee Sung Gye is out of Gaegyeong

300
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,810
is the crucial opportunity.,

301
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,120
Why are you in a hurry? It's not like you.

302
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,280
Your mind

303
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,700
is complicated, right?

304
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,490
It's hard to continue looking at Yook San.

305
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,560
It's hard to remain calm in front of him,

306
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,870
so after stabilizing the country as soon as possible,

307
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,020
the organization needs to be adjusted.

308
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,450
You should personally

309
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,470
do it without making mistakes.

310
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,420
Yes. I will follow your orders.

311
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,750
Hyung-nim.

312
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,240
Are just going to hunt like this?

313
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,340
What are you going to do about Sam Bong?

314
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,130
What about Po Eun?

315
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,750
Pardon?

316
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,520
Just what should I do with Po Eun?

317
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,270
They say that Master Hong is a skilled teacher,

318
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,870
so now the soldiers are ready.

319
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,240
- Is it possible to put them to action?
- What?

320
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,660
Nothing.

321
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,250
General went out to hunt.

322
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,890
- What? Hunting?
- Doesn't this mean that he will just turn away?

323
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,490
Is he just going to leave Elder Sam Bong like this?

324
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,270
Is he saying that he cannot abandon Po Eun even if he dies?

325
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,230
Where is Hyung-nim?

326
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:29,190
He said that he's feeling stuffy so he hiked up.

327
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,770
General Lee Seong Gye.

328
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,090
Gil Tae Mi?

329
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:55,020
- I'm Gil Seon Mi.
- Gil Seon Mi?

330
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:03,170
- Why are you here?
- I came to escort you.

331
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,860
- Escort me?
- I'm planning to escort you to heaven.

332
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,800
Do you think I can avoid that arrow and slash your throat or not?

333
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,500
Before, your younger brother

334
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,120
said the same thing.

335
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,370
Gil Tae Mi withdrew his sword and went back.

336
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,290
Do you think you will be different?

337
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:40,160
I am quite different from my brother.

338
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,440
Hyung-nim! Where are you?

339
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,090
Isn't this Hyung-nim's horse? How is it that only the horse is here?

340
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,750
General, could it be...

341
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,830
Come with me.

342
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,390
Hyung-nim! Where are you?

343
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,270
Hyung-nim!

344
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,290
Hyung-nim! Hyung-nim! What are you doing? Take Hyung-nim.

345
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,750
What did you say? What happened to General Lee Seong Gye?

346
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:13,530
General didn't get hit by the arrow but while evading the arrow he fell off the horse. In that high hill he went rolling down.

347
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,030
He might even be dead.

348
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,450
Calm down.

349
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,990
You must never tell this to anyone.

350
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,810
Yes.

351
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,050
Do you understand?

352
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:29,410
Yes. Yes. Yes!

353
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,410
The General's life is in danger?

354
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:36,590
He fell off his horse and he is in a critical situation. He might even die.

355
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,630
But how did you know about that?

356
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,770
- About that...
- Say it properly. What did you do?

357
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:51,330
I didn't do it. Actually, Lord Jo Sang Goon...

358
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,470
Did an opportunity come to us?

359
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,030
Byeokrando

360
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,510
It doesn't look good.

361
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:19,250
I've done all the treatment I can, but stabilizing him is important.

362
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,670
Until when?

363
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,950
It's hard to say anything right now.

364
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:38,790
Just who shot an arrow?

365
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,570
Could it be someone sent by Teacher Po Eun?

366
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,490
It's probably one of the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok.

367
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,710
They would be in a foul mood because their lands were taken.

368
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,670
It's something that can obviously happen.

369
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,470
Lee Seong Gye fell off his horse and is in a life or death situation. Are you the one who did it?

370
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,730
It wasn't me.

371
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:06,170
Whoever it was, the Heavens helped us. What should we do?

372
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,790
Po Eun will probably do as he sees fit.

373
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,250
Isn't he supposed to save Sam Bong? Why is he doing this?

374
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,330
Could it be that Father-in-law has changed?

375
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:28,940
Young Master! There's an urgent message from the Gaegyeong residence.

376
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,770
Ji Ran has sent someone.

377
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:39,270
The General went hunting and fell off his horse.

378
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,170
How critical was it?

379
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,850
It doesn't seem like a light injury.

380
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,720
He needed treatment so they brought him to Byeokrando for now.

381
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,660
In-law... General Lee Seong Gye fell off his horse?

382
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,530
How can this happen?

383
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:06,560
Hyung-nim. Can you put the Investigation Bureau in command?

384
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,090
Investigation Bureau? Why?

385
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:16,640
Lord Po Eun will now get rid of Lord Jo Joon and Father's other followers.

386
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,620
Will he really go to that extent?

387
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,410
If he finds out about this, there's no way he'd let this chance go.

388
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,250
An opportunity has come.

389
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,110
Minister Lee fell off his horse and is now in a life or death situation.

390
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,610
Is that true?

391
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,200
Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,970
With this opportunity, we need to get rid of Minister Lee's followers along with Sam Bong.

393
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,030
Please allow it.

394
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,200
Are you telling me to get rid of all these people?

395
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,910
Yes. You must do it quickly.

396
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,440
It's only a matter of time until they find out about the falling accident.

397
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,900
Bring me the Royal Seal.

398
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,420
Is Lord Jo Joon inside?

399
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,360
Yes. I will...

400
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,650
Is that true?

401
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:50,270
At a time like this when Teacher is in exile, if they also find out about Father falling off a horse,

402
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,460
Lord Po Eun won't stay still.

403
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,280
That's right. He probably won't.

404
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,750
We have to quickly escort Father back to Gaegyeong and prepare the army troops.

405
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,620
Teacher, aren't you in charge of the Left Army?

406
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,270
You must prepare the Left Army and get ready for a civil war.

407
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,730
Of course. I will immediately go to the Left Army camp

408
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:12,520
and prepare the army so you should bring General back to Gaegyeong no matter what.

409
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,120
Yes. I understand.

410
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,710
Hurry and go.

411
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,660
Criminal Jo Joon, follow the royal order and receive your punishment.

412
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,610
You bastards! What is my crime?

413
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,650
Along with the criminal Jeong Do Jeon, you gathered rebels and put innocent people in harm's way.

414
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,500
Teacher Po Eun has made a move first. We were one step too late.

415
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,670
What are you doing? Take him with us.

416
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,960
Yes!

417
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,240
What is the matter?

418
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,640
Lee Bang Gwa will be stripped off his title as Head of the Investigation Bureau.

419
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,970
That's the royal command.

420
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,890
What?

421
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,730
What is this?

422
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:47,470
You're not the one in charge of the investigation bureau now, so leave.

423
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:52,590
You guys, what kind of situation is this, without any notice?

424
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:58,450
We can drag you out so just quietly leave yourself.

425
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,770
Your Highness, Left Army's Jo Joon

426
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,620
and all of Sam Bong's followers were arrested and we now have control of the investigation bureau.

427
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:20,310
I understand. You can leave.

428
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,600
Your Higness.

429
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,310
Your Highness, nothing will happen.

430
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,360
Do not worry.

431
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:50,750
If Lee Sung Gyae's injury was minimal,

432
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:57,070
all of us might even die tomorrow.

433
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,870
Didn't Lord Lee Saek say that Lee Seong Gye is not capable of doing that?

434
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:16,060
I'm nervous. Right now, you and I, this Goryeo

435
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,110
are in a devastating state.

436
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,140
Your Highness, if you're that nervous,

437
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,230
I will kill Lee Seong Gye.

438
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:51,620
How can I ask you to assassinate someone?

439
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,260
Father is in a critical state and Teacher Sam Bong is in exile.

440
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,280
All our people were dragged out.

441
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,020
What should I do now? What should I start with?

442
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,300
What are you all doing here?

443
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,520
Leader Boon Yi, what should we do now?

444
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,400
Is something wrong?

445
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,580
General Lee Seong Gye's people are all being arrested.

446
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,440
If something goes wrong with General Lee Seong Gye, aren't we all done for?

447
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,300
It hasn't even been a long time since our stolen lands were returned,

448
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,200
but aren't we supposed to relinquish all of it again?

449
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,130
That's about the land, but we also burned the land registers with him

450
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,430
so are we also going to be arrested?

451
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:59,190
I couldn't even sleep because I'm scared something will go wrong.

452
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,060
Aren't we all supposed to run away for now?

453
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,440
What do you mean that we should run away?

454
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,810
We should at least do something.

455
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,590
Excuse me.

456
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,690
All of you listen.

457
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,340
That will not happen.

458
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,760
What if it happens? What should we do then?

459
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,040
If something like that happens, I will be the first to let you know.

460
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,360
Whether we run away or we fight, we have to do it together.

461
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,400
Go back and wait.

462
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,610
Aigo, I don't know why I went to the Tanhyun gate that day. I regret it so much.

463
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,770
Wow. Everyone's being too much.

464
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,120
They looked like they would offer their lives to General when he said that he would give them their land back.

465
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:52,260
Young Master, the people couldn't help themselves.

466
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,130
They've been trampled on and feel powerless,

467
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,510
so do not be bothered by it so much—

468
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:03,970
As expected, the people are great.

469
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,020
What?

470
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:10,500
Even in a situation like this, they know exactly what they have to do.

471
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,100
Moo Hyul, gather everyone now.

472
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,320
From here on, all of you must move according to my orders.

473
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,410
First of all, Teacher Hong, lead my trained soldiers and guard Gyung Duk Palace, and

474
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:29,200
Mok Cheong and also my father-in-law's house.

475
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,530
Yes.

476
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,310
Also, Boon Yi, gather all your people

477
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,210
and find out the movements of all the soldiers in Gyaegyeong and report back to me.

478
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,450
Yes.

479
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,520
Lady Yeon Hee, assemble the spies

480
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,980
and find out about Lord Po Eun and the King's actions.

481
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,990
Yes. I will.

482
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,180
Please give me the document that orders

483
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,060
the execution of Jeong Do Jun and his group.

484
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,580
Execution is not the problem.

485
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,720
The problem is Lee Sung Gye's health.

486
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,230
Your Majesty.

487
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,130
We have taken control of the left and right army and even the investigation bureau as well.

488
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:13,440
If Lee Sung Gye returns alive, those things do not matter at all.

489
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,300
Then...

490
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:24,300
For now, bring Jeong Do Jeon and his people back to Gaegyeong.

491
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,660
When we find out about Lee Sung Gye's health,

492
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,640
even if we execute them, we'll have to do it right away without giving them time.

493
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,060
That is the correct decision,

494
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,540
When the execution command is given, we do not know

495
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,480
what one of them will do at the exiled place.

496
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,160
However the problem is, in the end, Lee Sung Gye.

497
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:57,710
Your Majesty, I will go.

498
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,590
You cannot.

499
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:08,230
Your heart, worrying about me, is all I need.

500
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,690
Yeol Yang.

501
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,710
I will go.

502
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,480
Please allow it.

503
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,460
Yeol Yang.

504
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,500
Bang Ji, take this path to the teacher's place of exile and

505
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,700
report everything about this to him.

506
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:55,760
And, if there's a royal command to execute the teacher, then you'll have to immediately hide him safely.

507
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,410
I understand.

508
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:59,520
Young Master, what about me?

509
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,520
You secretly take Ga Byeol Cho and go to Byuk Ran Do.

510
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,000
Moo Hyul and I will go escort my father.

511
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,320
Yes, I understand.

512
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,940
The elders are in this situation.

513
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,940
Right now the only ones who can save

514
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,100
us and our reform is us. I wish all of you the best of luck.

515
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,680
Yes.

516
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,680
I sent a royal guard in disguise, near Byuk Ran Do,

517
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,420
and made him find the location of Lee Seong Gye.

518
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,640
A message will go to you.

519
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,940
Your identity cannot be revealed.

520
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,960
Yes, I understand.

521
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,520
Older brother, you'll have to ride the hors a long way,

522
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,600
so you mustn't lose your concentration because of mother, okay?

523
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,900
Right now let's only concentrate on the work in front of us. I'll do that as well.

524
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:19,780
Mom is right. Without that kind of determination, we shouldn't get involved in these kinds of matters.

525
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,940
Don't worry about it, Boon Yi.

526
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,070
Lady!

527
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,790
Byuk Ran Do

528
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:09,810
Young Master.

529
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,790
What about Father?

530
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,930
- Nephew!
-Yes Uncle.

531
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,500
Father!

532
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,020
Why are you here?

533
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,700
We have to hurry and go to Gaegyeong!

534
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,800
That's not possible right now.

535
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,540
He's has a lot of fractures and there are internal injuries.

536
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,830
He can only move once he recovers.

537
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,370
It's dangerous if he stays here.

538
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,790
Dangerous?

539
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,890
Lord Po Eun

540
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,090
has arrested, including Lord Jo Joon, General Nam Eun, and Official Lee Shin Juk,

541
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:47,650
all the high officials and

542
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,610
has removed Brother Bang Gwa from his office in the investigation bureau.

543
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,450
What?

544
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,920
Brother.

545
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,200
We were fooled.

546
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,800
If Father doesn't go, they'll all die.

547
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,180
There will be an execution order for Teacher Sam Bong as well.

548
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:16,180
Po Eun... This son of a...

549
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,250
Help me up...

550
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,230
- Father!
- Brother!

551
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,790
We have to return to Gaegyeong no matter what.

552
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:36,470
If we do that, your father

553
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,440
will pass away.

554
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,590
We might all end up dying anyway.

555
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:50,290
- Something's weird.
- What is it?

556
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,890
There's something weird in the mountains.

557
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,530
What are you saying?

558
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:01,290
If Po Eun made a firm decision, then he wouldn't have missed this opportunity and would have sent someone.

559
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,790
That son of a bitch.

560
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,490
There is no safe place. We have to go!

561
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,730
Find out his whereabouts and send a message to the town post.

562
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:18,710
The town post?

563
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,650
There will be an assassin waiting.

564
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,690
Lee Seong Gye...

565
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,920
Brother.

566
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,400
Father. Please wake up.

567
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,840
We have to leave!

568
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,930
Bang Won. How should we leave?

569
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:41,300
If we are surrounded, then we will be outnumbered.

570
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,890
Breaking through won't be a problem.

571
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:51,950
But how can we escort him back?

572
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,350
Chung Gil!

573
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,270
Yes, Young Master.

574
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:05,270
The backyard cannot be seen from outside, right? Prepare two palanquins there.

575
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,810
Yes.

576
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,440
There are two palanquins.

577
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,040
What should we do?

578
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,400
I don't see Lee Bang Won. One would be Lee Bang Won and the other one would be Lee Seong Gye.

579
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:32,760
That man is Do Hwa Jeon's Yacha Moo Hyul and Lee Ji Ran on the other side.

580
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,070
They split up. Hurry!

581
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:45,130
If we split our forces, then we'll be weaker than them. So we'll choose Lee Ji Ran.

582
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,200
And you, tell the current situation to the town post.

583
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,830
And you, follow the blue palanquin and report back.

584
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,230
Yes.

585
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,370
Hurry.

586
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:10,140
You all probably know this but we are bandits. If we get caught, you have to say that we are bandits.

587
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,580
Do you understand?

588
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,610
Take out your swords.

589
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,970
So it was the blue palanquin...

590
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,710
Murder. I have to kill again.

591
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,870
Let's end this fast.

592
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,250
What is this?

593
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,070
My goodness.

594
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,760
Lee Seong Gye is not here.

595
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,740
I lost to the unsharpened edge.

596
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,240
Could she be...

597
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,500
I have to find Lee Seong Gye.

598
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:13,930
Bang Won, let's rest for a bit before continuing.

599
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:23,870
Father, you need to be strong.

600
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,570
We definitely have to go back to Gaegyeong.

601
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:41,830
Did Po Eun really do that?

602
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,410
Yes.

603
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:48,090
I think it was all planned.

604
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:58,050
On the night before I went out to hunt, I had a nightmare.

605
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:05,090
A certain man came charging at me with a sword.

606
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:09,750
He looked like a general and looked like a king as well.

607
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,110
I shot an arrow but

608
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:18,590
that man, with an arrow stuck in his neck, cut off my arms and legs

609
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:23,690
and I died on that mountain.

610
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,650
Don't talk too much, Father.

611
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,950
I thought

612
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,980
really hard about who that person could be,

613
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,290
but now that I think about it,

614
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,880
I think it was Wang Geon.
(Taejo Wang Geon: Goryeo's 1st King)

615
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,080
What?

616
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,800
The blue palanquin wasn't it either. It must Lee Bang Won's trick.

617
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,080
Search the mountain. He couldn't have gone far.

618
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,620
Yes!

619
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,160
Falling off my horse

620
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:12,380
and facing these problems at the same time must be Wang Geon's curse.

621
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:16,020
Don't say such weak words, Father.

622
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:22,530
How is that possible? Everything is done by humans.

623
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:29,980
The Heavens don't change so how can Po Eun change?

624
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,640
Great Confucian scholar Po Eun.

625
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:41,430
How can he think of such a scheme and do this?

626
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:42,550
Because it's ruthless domination.

627
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:56,210
This is all just ruthless domination. And we are already in the middle of it all.

628
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,110
Ruthless domination...

629
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:02,330
Whether it's a new establishment or founding a new country,

630
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:05,630
they're all just things that sound good to hear.

631
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:15,990
It was only natural that blood would be shed. "Revolution without blood" was just an illusion.

632
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:20,550
Ruthless domination is, in any case, an ulterior motive.

633
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:27,230
Since we held such a terrible motive as our life cause, it's only natural.

634
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:34,830
Even though we are the ones that plan for the domination, we are still lost in our thoughts.

635
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:44,010
It was actually Teacher Po Eun, who was trying to stop the domination, who knew everything.

636
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:49,750
So I will surely win. I, Lee Bang Won,

637
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:58,640
in that fight for domination, will not lose

638
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:04,580
to that great Confucian scholar Po Eun.

639
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,840
It's not time for Young Gyu to arrive yet.

640
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,580
Father.

641
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,940
Father.

642
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,450
Six Flying Dragons

643
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:40,030
He wouldn't have been able to escape this mountain with an injured man.

644
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,290
- We must find them!
- Yes!

645
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:44,240
This country's fate lies on Lee Seong Gye's health.

646
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,010
Proceed with Sam Bong's execution at myoshi (5am-7am) tomorrow.

647
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:49,480
The execution seems to be drawing near.

648
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,460
Aren't we supposed to get the Ga Byeol Cho ready?

649
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,260
I'd have to kill Teacher Po Eun.

650
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,600
I will have to do it. I, Lee Bang Won.
