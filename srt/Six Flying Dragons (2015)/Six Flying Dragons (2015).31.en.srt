This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,920
The last one is that none of the royal family
Episode 31

3
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,000
will be allowed to participate in politics under any circumstances.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,360
Once the country is founded, all the rights and power will be taken from the king's kindred they will become unable to do anything.

5
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,200
By doing so, we'll stop them from doing things on their own authority.

6
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:21,760
Making people smile and making your dreams come true.

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,910
How?

8
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,060
Through politics. Politics that will protect your dreams and will make the people smile.

9
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,940
Right. Make sure to practice politics that will give the people happiness in their lives.

10
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,300
Being helpless. That's something you just can't stand.

11
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,620
Let's go.

12
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,330
No power will be inherited?

13
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,980
Right. It will also will be checked and verified by the other Sadaebu.

14
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,970
That kind of prime minister will be the focus, and the king will only have the authority to choose a prime minister. Is that what you are saying?

15
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,990
Yes.

16
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:16,420
That's why I believe that only you can be the prime minister of the country we're going to establish.

17
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,950
Also, the success or failure of the country

18
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,160
will not be decided by the king Lee Seong Gye but by you, the first prime minister.

19
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,900
Will the current king of Goryeo accept a system like this?

20
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,830
Yes. Even if the king accepts it, tradition is more scary than the system.

21
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,170
The tradition of the king holding power, that has been passed down for hundreds of years, won't be destroyed that easily.

22
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,540
General Lee Seong Gye is different from Goryeo's kings and will accept the job.

23
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,850
He knows shame, sees the importance of command,

24
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,260
and cherishes the people. He's more of a Confucian scholar than any other.

25
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,950
That's right. He's that kind of person.

26
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:07,100
In any case, after a country is founded, there comes a period of invasions, and after a road of death comes turbulent times.

27
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,590
Goryeo's system, which is already nearing the end, is at the point of killing many people.

28
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,910
The system only remains by name but it's been a long time since it disappeared.

29
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,550
It's been long since we've been in this turbulent age, and the people are crying for a new country.

30
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,930
If this isn't the heaven's command that been spoken of in Confucianism, then what is?

31
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,570
Please...

32
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,850
Please be the first prime minister of this new country.

33
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,670
Please, please...

34
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,960
Please accept this lacking student's sincerity.

35
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,460
If I hadn't thought of Po Eun as the first Prime Minister to start with,

36
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,900
then I might not have been able to even materialize this new system.

37
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,450
Please... Please accept my thoughts.

38
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:48,090
Sam Bong, why are you doing this to me? Just why me?

39
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,570
You can just do it yourself.

40
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,300
Don't you already know?

41
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,590
I...

42
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,280
I have already used too much military power and too many tricks.

43
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,640
I have too many faults to be considered a Confucian scholar.

44
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,180
So in the perfect country of Sadaebu that you planned,

45
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,010
you want me to be the last flawless stone.

46
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,030
It's indeed a sweet offer.

47
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,090
Teacher, we caught her.

48
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,770
- Caught?
- Cho Young is Nameless' Ji Cheon Tae.

49
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,010
So, it really was like that?

50
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:50,040
She knew about your meeting with Teacher Po Eun so we arrested her when she went to Jangyeonggak.

51
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,800
Right. You did well.

52
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,340
Did you have a good talk with Teacher Po Eun?

53
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,120
I spoke with all my sincerity so let's wait.

54
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,820
Where is Cho Young?

55
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,440
Knowing that it's dangerous to leave Cho Young to the Investigation Bureau, General Nam Eun took her to interrogate separately.

56
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,480
We don't know how big an organization Nameless is, but this means that they lost Hwa Sa Dan.

57
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,030
This will also do great damage to them. You really did well.

58
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,260
Thank you.

59
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,920
Whether it's something related to Cho Young or Nameless, you will be in charge of it from here on.

60
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,730
With your resourcefulness, everything can be achieved.

61
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,440
Yes. I understand.

62
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,960
I will make sure to get it done.

63
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,970
Thank you.

64
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,260
We got tricked by Lee Bang Won?

65
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,170
He heard about Cho Young being our member and arrested her.

66
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,190
Were we really had by that kid, Lee Bang Won?

67
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,520
Did they go to the Investigation Bureau?

68
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,720
No. It seems that they secretly moved her to a separate place.

69
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,140
In a time like this, when Baek Geun Soo has died and it's difficult for us to watch over the king, to think that Cho Young was taken...

70
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,940
Your priority is to find Cho Young's whereabouts.

71
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,090
This is not a simple matter. Report it.

72
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,710
Just wait a bit.

73
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,510
Ji Cheon Tae being exposed is the same as losing half of our information

74
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,070
because of your mistake!

75
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,710
Cho Young has to be in Hwa Sa Dan for us to move the Gwon Moon Sae Jeok and the Sadaebu, hence moving the king as well.

76
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,480
It has now become difficult to move the king.

77
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,870
Is it just that?

78
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,390
Even though we found out Jeong Mong Joo's thoughts, we still need more steps.

79
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,190
How would I not know the problems that it causes?

80
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,960
How about finding a different sword? I don't think Jeong Mong Joo will do.

81
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm already deliberating on that so just wait.

82
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,360
Do you admit that you are a Nameless?

83
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,580
Was it Lee Bang Won?

84
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,170
Then the Maengdo Chilyak that Lee Bang Won was talking about...

85
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,160
It didn't mean anything.

86
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,660
There was indeed a reason that Lee In Gyeom and Hong In Bang paid special attention.

87
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,820
That young man is amazing.

88
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,950
Have you given him lots of compliments? I think you should.

89
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,910
He's probably in a foul mood right now.

90
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,100
What do you mean by that?

91
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,450
New Joseon

92
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,940
Who are you?

93
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,400
I waited for a long time.

94
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,240
For me?

95
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,080
You don't have a place here.

96
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,620
What happened?

97
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,880
Did Cho Young talk?

98
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,120
No. She just said strange things.

99
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,300
Strange things?

100
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,040
She said she will only tell Bang Won.

101
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,370
Just to me?

102
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,640
Wow. The moment that you caught Hwa Sa Dan's Owner, Cho Young, I confirmed it again.

103
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,910
I chose the right man! Didn't you say so at Do Hwa Jeon last time?

104
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,850
That you wanted to practice politics that will protect our dreams.

105
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,600
I think you can really practice that kind of politics.

106
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,600
No, I don't just think that you can. Just do it. Do it! I'm really sure of it.

107
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,330
It's my first time seeing people gathered like that and smiling.

108
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,420
You were the one who made that happen.

109
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,020
Young Master, what's wrong?

110
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,100
That dream.

111
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,140
Do you know when I started dreaming of it?

112
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,300
- What?
- The day when Gil Tae Mi died. It started on that day.

113
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,550
It was on that day when I was acknowledged by you.

114
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,090
Because of me?

115
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,450
Actually, at that moment, in my heart,

116
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,150
I was very proud.

117
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,000
You said so,

118
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,130
that it was your first time seeing people smile like that,

119
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,220
that you knew that I was the one who made it happen.

120
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,790
Those words made me so happy,

121
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,500
I thought I was going to die.

122
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,540
Politics that will make people happy and smile.

123
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,980
That became my dream from that moment on.

124
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,520
Then, what's wrong?

125
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,260
You can just do it. It will happen if you do it.

126
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,140
I'm just saying.

127
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,650
I heard you wanted to see me.

128
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,080
Yes.

129
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,370
If Jeong Mong Joo doesn't move according to our plans, we have to find a new sword.

130
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,280
Like that time with King Gong Min,

131
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,210
a useful sword like Hong Ryun.

132
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,140
I need to bet on this fight.

133
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,400
Please send your bodyguard out.

134
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,950
Please send the soldiers outside farther.

135
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,440
Send the bodyguard out? Why?

136
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,500
What kind of trick can I do here?

137
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,220
I just want to appease your curiosity.

138
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,950
Go out for a while and take the soldiers a little farther away.

139
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,430
Yes.

140
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,600
While thinking about it, it seemed quite strange.

141
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,460
Why didn't General Nam Eun ask me

142
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,330
about what I heard at Jangyeonggak?

143
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,360
He was supposed to confirm that.

144
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,710
It's probably because you didn't say anything.

145
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,470
What do you want to say?

146
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,520
I heard the beginning of what Sam Bong and Po Eun were talking about.

147
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,000
You probably heard the other half.

148
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,400
What about exchanging information?

149
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
Why?

150
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,450
I can just ask Teacher.

151
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,310
So why do I have to exchange that with you?

152
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,660
General Lee Seong Gye

153
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,010
will be kept in a prison called King.

154
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,170
General Lee Seong Gye's family will be imprisoned there with him.

155
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,820
It's not a country ruled by the king

156
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,770
but a country ruled by a prime minster that

157
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,490
oversees the law, the system and the ordinance.

158
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,180
General Lee Seong Gye will be kept in a prison called King.

159
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,630
Sam Bong, you have thought of something big.

160
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,760
Someone said that turbulent times are hell for the weak.

161
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,690
Because during turbulent times, the desires of the strong rise without limits.

162
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,230
If so, what are peaceful times?

163
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,640
It's hell for the strong.

164
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,700
Locking up all the strong ones.

165
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,060
A world where the weak can live safely and at the least enjoy some abundance.

166
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,360
Isn't that what peaceful times is all about?

167
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,950
What are we going to use to lock up the strong people?

168
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,320
With law, system, ordinance, and those checking on each other.

169
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,120
The most important system to raise a new country

170
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,370
is to have the strongest king and royal family

171
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,240
kept in the most secure prison.

172
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,930
A secure prison...

173
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,440
The king and the royal family

174
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,110
will be placed in a secure prison.

175
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,600
The next part is probably no different from what I heard.

176
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,000
They are people that saw even the great King Gong Min

177
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,450
collapse due to self-righteousness.

178
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,850
Instead of entrusting the country to a sole king,

179
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,780
entrusting it to the law, the system, and the ordinance

180
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,960
is an obvious and right choice.

181
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,360
Still, you don't like it, right?

182
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,980
No matter how good the country is,

183
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,550
if it's a country where you can't do anything, then there's no way you'd like it.

184
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,040
Also, there's no saying that the chosen Prime Minister

185
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,140
will actually do well.

186
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,440
Sadaebu has always made fools out of people.

187
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,950
Our Nameless is not against establishing a new country.

188
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,540
We are thinking of supporting General Lee Seong Gye as king.

189
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,280
This is a fact.

190
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,600
We tried to attack Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi as well,

191
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,410
and tried to stop Choi Yeong's reckless war.

192
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,430
We are on the same side.

193
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,150
Except for one thing.

194
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,300
What is it?

195
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,310
Land reform.

196
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:32,080
So you were actually a bunch of petty people trying to protect their lands...

197
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,080
I thought Nameless had some sort of great cause.

198
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,830
Nameless' great cause,

199
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,890
don't you want to know more about it?

200
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,890
Think about it.

201
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,730
We match well with you.

202
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,400
We don't like the land reform, and

203
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,210
you probably don't like the existence of a Prime Minister's total control.

204
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,440
Without those two,

205
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,270
a country can still be established.

206
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,540
Stop fooling around.

207
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,090
What did Cho Young say? Why did she want to see you?

208
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,080
Did she talk about Nameless? Perhaps...

209
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,750
Did you ask about my mom?

210
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,310
Nothing special came up?

211
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,280
Tell me.

212
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,310
I'm sorry. I need to sleep.

213
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,320
- Did something happen?
- I'm very tired.

214
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,290
Now the only road left for you

215
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,430
is to hold my hand and get the power you've always wanted.

216
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,910
I already found a way.

217
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,840
You'll probably lose it again, like always.

218
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,140
In this place, in this room,

219
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,730
there's no place for you.

220
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,600
Do I really not have a place in that country?

221
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,450
Did I lose my way again?

222
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,750
Teacher.

223
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,680
In this new country,

224
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,930
please become the first prime minister.

225
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,470
Thank you, Sam Bong.

226
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,760
Now, I understand that persuading you is impossible.

227
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,790
After planning that perfect country, how can you give it up?

228
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,930
I will make it so that you don't give up.

229
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:00,190
However, I won't be that new country's first prime minister,

230
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,970
but I will be this Goryeo's last subject.

231
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,710
If the heaven's haven't abandoned Goryeo, then I should be able to protect it from you

232
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:22,170
If this country's luck is all used up, as a Confucian scholar, I will have my end with my country.

233
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,440
Before I die, Goryeo will not end.

234
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,300
Right. What is it that caused you to come in so late at night?

235
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,440
I have something urgent to talk to you about regarding the land reform.

236
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,360
We won't be able to do the land reform like this.

237
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,100
The land survey is underway so what are you saying?

238
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,230
There are reports saying that things aren't going well.

239
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,280
Even if an official from the Central Office goes, in the end the help from the local offices

240
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,060
is desperately needed.

241
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,180
Yes. But the majority of them are people that received support from the Gwon Moon Sae Jok.

242
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,670
So they are always trying to interfere instead of helping.

243
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:24,350
Interfering? How can they do this without looking down at us?

244
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,110
Why do you think so?

245
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:32,660
Since Lord Lee Saek is still sitting in Do Dang, they have someone to put their trust in.

246
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,380
Lord Lee Saek needs to be impeached.

247
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,150
But one of Po Eun's conditions was to be allied with Lord Lee Saek.

248
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,910
Without Po Eun's agreement, we can't do that.

249
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,420
We have to do the land reform? How come that even you are being like this?

250
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,910
How can we still call it Goryeo if we destroy the government laws that have been passed down for hundreds of years?

251
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:09,940
If you don't do the land reform, Your Highness will not be able to protect this country.

252
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,010
How can we collect taxes when there are no people with land?

253
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,140
The state treasury has already hit bottom.

254
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,190
At this rate, we can't protect Goryeo from those people.

255
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:30,740
By those people, do you mean General Lee Seong Gye and Sam Bong?

256
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,750
It's not General Lee Seong Gye but Sam Bong.

257
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,540
If you make Lee Seong Gye into an enemy, then in the current situation, there is no way we can protect the country.

258
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,640
How are we going to deal with his massive military power?

259
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,500
Then,

260
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,100
you are going to separate the two?

261
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:56,410
Please wait. I will separate the two and attack Sam Bong.

262
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,960
Your Highness should approve the land reform and gain the people's sentiments.

263
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,490
Those people will surely impeach Lord Lee Saek.

264
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,840
Yes. They probably will. That's what will happen.

265
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,730
No, you have to.

266
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,060
Po Eun!

267
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,310
If I act against them right now, then it's hard to see what will happen to me.

268
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:27,590
So I will survive this time and find a next opportunity.

269
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,800
Your Majesty. Please understand.

270
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,060
I understand.

271
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,750
Yoon Rang, come closer.

272
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,310
Yes.

273
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,310
If something were to happen to Po Eun, then there will be no more option for me.

274
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:58,200
So, from now on, think of Po Eun as me and protect him.

275
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,870
But, Your Highness.

276
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,620
Those people don't have a reason to kill me.

277
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,560
If they did, they wouldn't put me on the throne.

278
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,020
Your Highness, your grace is immeasurable.

279
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,060
Those people are probably watching so from now on all communication

280
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,180
will be sent through this woman.

281
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,760
Cheok Sa Gwang

282
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,400
Are you really going to do that, Po Eun?

283
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,760
Yes.

284
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,330
The land reform must be approved.

285
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,390
I will support you with what little I have.

286
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:46,900
I heard that it will be hard to proceed without Lee Saek's impeachment.

287
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,060
I know.

288
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,850
Do that.

289
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,470
Are you serious? Will you join our cause?

290
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,120
Thank you, Po Eun.

291
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,370
Thank you so much.

292
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,730
Why are you being like this? I haven't decided yet to completely follow your plan.

293
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,970
Yes. Take all the time you need to think about it.

294
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:22,090
The more I think about it, your plans are really great.

295
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,310
As another Confucian scholar, I think I almost feel inferior.

296
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,250
Why are you like this?

297
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,880
However, please wait for my answer.

298
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,460
Yes. Of course.

299
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,800
Of course!

300
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,610
Here.

301
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,410
I'm sorry, Sam Bong.

302
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:55,250
For this collapsing country, I needed to fool the world and you

303
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,060
since you will not be able to give it up...

304
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,590
Lee Bang Ji

305
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,990
What is this feeling?

306
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,060
Take care, Po Eun.

307
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,570
Right. I'll see you tomorrow.

308
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,790
Let's go.

309
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,180
Husband, are you okay?

310
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,100
What do you mean?

311
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,280
You look very unwell.

312
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,990
It's nothing now.

313
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,090
But why are you wearing a topknot all of a sudden?

314
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,720
It was actually more weird that I hadn't all this time.

315
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,730
His Majesty has accepted Lord Lee Saek's impeachment.

316
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,290
Is that so?

317
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,700
Then, was there an order from the Investigation Bureau to arrest him?

318
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,200
Yes. I will deliver the royal command.

319
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,120
Teacher! This is Bang Won.

320
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,830
Come in. You can go out now.

321
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,790
Yes!

322
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,590
Are you wearing a topknot?

323
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,870
Yes.

324
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,190
Right. What happened to Cho Young?

325
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:54,860
If we are to eradicate the Nameless, I think we'll have to go at it a different way.

326
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,620
A different way?

327
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,410
I will try to be bait and see.

328
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,490
Bait?

329
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,490
Cho Young is trying to win me over.

330
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,480
Win you over?

331
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,080
She said the equal land division will never come true.

332
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,910
Saying that not only will it never work, but also cause many sacrifices along the way.

333
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,280
So?

334
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:23,120
She said that if I help stop the land reform, then they will help me with anything.

335
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,170
They say that they will be my strength.

336
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:32,270
It's like what Nameless will do. They are trying to make you turn against us like they did with Po Eun.

337
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,270
As expected. Hwa Sa Dan also knows about the trouble you made before.

338
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,400
Yes. So I'm thinking of going over to their side.

339
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,080
What about pretending that I'm wavering and then tricking them?

340
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,410
How?

341
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:55,900
I'll pretend to be won over by Cho Young's suggestion and look like I'm having other thoughts.

342
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,070
Then they are going to contact me.

343
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,950
Having different thoughts?

344
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,820
First of all, I'm thinking of training soldiers separately.

345
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,890
Don't you think they will believe me then?

346
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:20,460
Yes. Try that. Nameless is an organization that's hard to understand even if we capture one of the members.

347
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,500
I wish for your plan to succeed.

348
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Yes, Teacher.

349
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,070
You look good in a topknot.

350
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,740
Yes.

351
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,450
Because I'm not a child anymore.

352
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:46,290
I think it's a good plan. As expected, our Young Master is smart.

353
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:51,800
Teacher! Teacher! Jo Joon finally sent an impeachment--

354
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:59,300
Lee Saek and Ha Ryun, receive His Majesty's decree.

355
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,270
Just what is my crime?

356
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:09,010
With Jo Min Soo, you enthroned Wang Chang, who is not of the king's bloodline,

357
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:14,590
and gathered up Lee In Gyeom's followers to disturb the country.

358
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,830
Did you know about the matter with Teacher Lee Saek?

359
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,630
Teacher Lee Saek will have to face the consequences of his mistakes.

360
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,420
And this is inevitable for the land reform.

361
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,390
Even so.

362
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:37,350
Didn't you guys also say it as well? That the land survey is difficult due to the interference of Gwon Moon Sae Jok that's sided with Teacher Lee Saek.

363
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,280
That is indeed true, but...

364
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,140
Secretly relay this to all the people who follow me.

365
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,000
Until the land reform is done, we'll lie low,

366
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,140
but during that time we'll have to take control of all the government positions related to remonstrating the king.

367
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,960
Act carefully and discreetly so as not to arouse suspicion by Lee Seong Gye's group.

368
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
Yes.

369
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,280
Ten or so people, including Lee Saek and Ha Ryun, have been impeached and arrested.

370
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,820
What about Po Eun?

371
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:16,400
He didn't do anything.

372
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,800
It's now confirmed.

373
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,240
We failed with Jeong Mong Joo.

374
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,270
Now they will proceed with the land reform as quick as possible.

375
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,410
Let's report this to that person.

376
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:34,310
That person is coming here anyway.

377
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,680
That person is coming here?

378
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,990
Then, am I finally going to see that person's face as well?

379
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,760
Monk, this is Nam Cheon.

380
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,680
Monk, we found Cho Young's location.

381
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,090
On the West outskirts, near the Ongnyo Temple.

382
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,420
How many soldiers were there?

383
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,280
I think they were trying to avoid been seen, so it's less than ten or so.

384
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,170
We'll go take them out and rescue Cho Young.

385
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,360
I will go myself.

386
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,370
Who are those people?

387
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,990
Just what is...

388
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,660
Have a seat. It's cold.

389
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,890
What are you doing?

390
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:38,010
What do you think? It's my answer to your question.

391
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,140
- Then...?
- Do you know what Sal Saeng Mok is?

392
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,390
If you want to kill someone or win against them, plant their names as trees.

393
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,800
When I was young, I planted them.

394
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,030
The first one that I planted was Lee In Gyeom.

395
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,610
Why Hap Ha?

396
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:08,450
He stole Father's power and opportunity.

397
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,860
The second one was Hong In Bang.

398
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,990
I know that you have a lot of stories with Hong In Bang.

399
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:24,640
Among those, there is only one important thing.

400
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:35,170
He made me powerless and told me to join hands with him.

401
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:45,940
I'm saying this for the first time. I almost got caught.

402
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,950
I lost my way and wandered for a long time.

403
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,020
If I had grabbed onto his hand, I would've led a different life.

404
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:07,830
However, what came to me at that time

405
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,830
was Sam Bong, that person.

406
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:15,170
You found your way.

407
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,290
I did.

408
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:24,870
Even just thinking of participating in that person's great cause made my heart feel like it was going to explode.

409
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,940
Getting rid of this rotten Goryeo

410
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:36,210
and establishing a new country where the people can enjoy life.

411
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:47,930
But he said that I don't have a place in that country.

412
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:56,940
I realized that I don't have anything I can do in that country.

413
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:04,330
No, from the beginning, in that person's great cause,

414
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:11,660
I now know that there was no such thing as a place for me.

415
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,700
It's enough reason for you to accept my offer. I understand.

416
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:30,350
You people took Hong Ryun to kill King Gong Min and raised Lee In Gyeom to that position.

417
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,270
Just remember this one thing.

418
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,940
I am not Hong Ryun.

419
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,660
If you're thinking of using me like Hong Ryun,

420
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:56,390
that will really be the worst mistake in the whole existence of Nameless.

421
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,350
I will keep it in mind.

422
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,200
Go.

423
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,860
I will go and relay your will.

424
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:15,930
About the five Rules...

425
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,680
By any chance, do you know a woman called Yeon Hyang?

426
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,460
I heard that she was captured by Nameless a long time ago.

427
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,210
What about returning Yeon Hyang as a proof of our alliance?

428
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:50,040
How did you know Yeon Hyang?

429
00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:02,350
So you do know her. Her children are looking for her.

430
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,760
I put my trust in you.

431
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,880
Yeon Hyang's children are alive?

432
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,460
Master.

433
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,310
Are you okay?

434
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:42,210
Yes. I was unexpectedly thrown into a troubling situtaion,

435
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,070
but unexpectedly there was also a profit.

436
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,420
Lee Bang Won. Lee Seong Gye's fifth son.

437
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,310
What about using him as our new sword?

438
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:05,340
Back then, you were talking with such redness in your face that I was almost fooled.

439
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,210
Who would think that it was just all planned? Right?

440
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:15,150
That's what I'm saying. I've seen Young Master lie so many times but today was the best!

441
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,440
Looking at it earlier, Cho Young also got tricked, right?

442
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,020
Yeah!

443
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:24,090
Young Master, how can you say such things as if you're being sincere?

444
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,500
I thought it was true. I almost got fooled.

445
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,310
The more I spoke, the more I became sincere.

446
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:38,140
As expected, you weren't called Ji Cheon Tae for nothing. Even in a critical situation, you made a good opportunity.

447
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,250
Yes.

448
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,880
As soon as I return, I will explain--

449
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,440
But...

450
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,040
I'm thinking that you shouldn't have talked about Yeon Hyang.

451
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,430
Did you hear everything?

452
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,770
I heard and saw everything.

453
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:06,030
Then, I'm going to ask you.

454
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:12,620
How is it that those children are still alive?

455
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,270
What were those corpses that you brought before?

456
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,410
There were a lot of corpses of little children in this country.

457
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:31,290
I just took unrecognizable corpses of a boy and a girl.

458
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:35,270
How can you do such a thing...

459
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:39,820
There was no reason to it. I just couldn't find them.

460
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,720
In any case, if this becomes known we don't know what will happen.

461
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,160
Perhaps, like in 1378, there could be an internal war.

462
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,880
Let's keep our mouths shut, Ji Cheon Tae.

463
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,940
Until when are you going to keep this a secret?

464
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,750
The children are alive and they're even looking for her.

465
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,390
How did this happen? Cho Young disappeared.

466
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,560
Yes. The warriors who were guarding Cho Young had all collapsed and there was no one in the storage.

467
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,210
No matter how I look at it, it's definitely Nameless.

468
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,080
It's a trap made by us.

469
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,180
It's Bang Won's plan. It has to be done secretly, so make sure not to tell anyone.

470
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,360
Also, starting tomorrow, Bang Won will do something to deceive them.

471
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,220
So, Boon Yi, just do as Bang Won tells you to.

472
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,780
Yes. I understand.

473
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,820
That's everything.

474
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,630
Did you not see any trace of lies?

475
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,270
No.

476
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,590
Don't worry.

477
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:57,730
In order to make Hwa Sa Dan, how much money, time and people were invested

478
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,480
you probably know best.

479
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,380
But it's not just that the organization was destroyed.

480
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,940
They went over to Jung Do Jeon's side. How are you going to take responsibility for this?

481
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,650
I will follow that person.

482
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:16,590
You won't even be able to pay for it with your life. What are you going to do?

483
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,300
Will you at least commit suicide?

484
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,070
I am Ji Cheon Tae.

485
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:32,820
If there's an order for it, I will definitely do so but the only one who can tell me to kill myself is that person.

486
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,390
That is right.

487
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:47,830
Also, because you brought in Lee Bang Won, wait for that person's judgement.

488
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,580
Yes.

489
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,750
Overseer of all the government positions...

490
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,160
It seems that Jeong Mong Joo has joined that side.

491
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,360
Did this person, Jeong Do Jeon, really

492
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,390
create a perfect Confucianist country?

493
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:07,370
This could be more dangerous than the land reform.

494
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,890
What are we going to do?

495
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,210
Lee Bang Won.

496
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,430
In order to see whether he is the right man for our new sword,

497
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,950
let's watch over him a bit more.

498
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:25,850
From now on, watch closely over Lee Bang Won.

499
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,270
Yes. I understand.

500
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,570
You're moving out?

501
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,390
Yes.

502
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,560
Well, it's about time for you to do so.

503
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,650
You do look like an adult now.

504
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,110
Does Father know?

505
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,270
I heard that you have achieved something big this time.

506
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,360
Lady Yeon Hee has given me a lot of help.

507
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,000
Sam Bong told me that your problem solving and wisdom are excellent.

508
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,160
He told me that you will be in charge of big things in the future.

509
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,480
I heard that you're working on catching Nameless this time.

510
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:09,220
What kind of country the new country is going to be, what kind of position being a king is.

511
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:15,240
Does he know what will happen to the royals (in the new country)?

512
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,060
However,

513
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,620
don't work while expecting something in return.

514
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:28,100
That will also be the same after achieving our great cause.

515
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,370
How come you're not answering?

516
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,760
There's no way that would happen.

517
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,200
What else would I want?

518
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,920
I've emptied the Gyeong Duk Jeon.

519
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,710
Yes, father. I am moved to tears for your generosity.

520
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:55,900
However, why are you moving out all of a sudden?

521
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,670
It seems that something changed in my husband.

522
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,770
Isn't this a good thing?

523
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:04,970
He'll be here soon so you can personally ask him.

524
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,150
Your husband is here.

525
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,620
Father-in-law, are you doing well?

526
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,630
I heard from Da Kyeong.

527
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,330
You can just move into Gyeong Duk Jeon right away.

528
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,990
Yes.

529
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:27,260
Before I give you my thanks,

530
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,300
I want to ask for a difficult favor.

531
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,370
What is it?

532
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,250
I need to take soldiers with me.

533
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:44,930
Not Ga Byeol Cho but my own soldiers.

534
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,430
Are you going to help me?

535
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,690
Gyeong Deok Jeon

536
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,070
This house is great!

537
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,590
It's a lot better than Ga Byeol Cho!

538
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,100
Aigoo.

539
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,770
How can you be so lazy? Just hurry and move the stuff.

540
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,430
Okay, I get it.

541
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,580
But why is he moving out all of a sudden?

542
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,070
It's about time for him to be independent.

543
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,450
Moo Hyul and Master Hong, follow me.

544
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,730
M-Master?

545
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:57,290
Master? Master Hong?

546
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,600
Yes! Master Hong. I am a Master!

547
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,560
Yes!

548
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,370
Boon, can you come see me for a bit?

549
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,380
Stop!

550
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,310
This is the first round of soldiers that were recruited.

551
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:35,350
They're not so good yet.

552
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,440
You.

553
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,680
Train them.

554
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,410
Not me?

555
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:55,900
Are you talking about me?

556
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,700
More soldiers will come in the future.

557
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,250
Please make them like Moo Hyul. A hundred more Moo Hyuls.

558
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,590
Do you understand?

559
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:14,730
Ah, yes... It'll be hard to make them into Moo Hyul, but...

560
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,790
Young Master!

561
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:30,870
I knew that the day would come when you would acknowledge me like this.

562
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:35,590
- Please don't kneel like this in front of your students.
- Yes.

563
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,520
Gently, gently.

564
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,390
What?

565
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,900
The funds for operating the marketplace messenger network will be provided by the Min family.

566
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,800
They will be given more abundantly than what was given by the Ga Byeol Cho.

567
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,310
Managing it will be your responsibility.

568
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,620
I am moved to tears for your generosity, but why so suddenly?

569
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:13,130
Didn't you know that my husband is planning on tricking Nameless?

570
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,220
Yes. I heard about it.

571
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:22,020
So don't take orders directly from Elder Sam Bong, but take Husband's orders.

572
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,010
Yes.

573
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,750
Also.

574
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,290
Take these.

575
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,820
What are these?

576
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,540
You have read a lot of the things that Sam Bong has written, right?

577
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,900
I have but it's not like I read and understood all of them.

578
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,250
Yes that probably is so.

579
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,880
Read these books.

580
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:52,560
From here on, we have to put together all our strength for my husband.

581
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,120
Yes.

582
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:59,310
He moved out and assembled soldiers?

583
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,450
It's not strange for his age.

584
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:07,420
Among the siblings, it was only Lee Bang Won who didn't have his own soldiers so this is actually quite late.

585
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:14,050
I think what Cho Young said was right. Don't you think that Lee Bang Won is having different thoughts?

586
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:18,840
That person also thinks that way.

587
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,350
Ah! You scared me!

588
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:34,660
I haven't done anything yet so how come you're screaming already?

589
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:40,280
I mean, I already told you everything I know. So why are you heating up that metal?

590
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,280
I told you everything without missing one.

591
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,910
I told you everything that happened when we enthroned Wang Chang. And I already asked for forgiveness.

592
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,830
Please put down that beating stick!

593
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,120
Ah, you're too loud.

594
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,500
Please save me, please.

595
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,400
What's the matter?

596
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,830
I want to have a talk with this person. I'd be grateful if you would leave us be, Hyung-nim.

597
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:19,860
Go ahead.

598
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,860
Let's go out.

599
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,960
Did you find out?

600
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,920
About Nameless.

601
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,720
Did you find it? Did you catch them?

602
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,330
Who is Ji Cheon Tae? Cho Young?

603
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,580
Or was it Jeok Ryeong?

604
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:48,510
You will be sent into exile

605
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:55,000
along with Teacher Lee Saek and many Sadaebu that enthroned the false king.

606
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,050
Ah, that will probably happen.

607
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:05,810
I don't know how my life could be so shitty. I was exiled while staying around Jang Pyeong Gate.

608
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:13,410
Also exiled after opposing the Liadong conquest. And this time I ambitiously helped enthrone a king.

609
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,210
Who would've thought that king would be so useless.

610
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,100
Make sure to survive again this time.

611
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,510
I will be waiting.

612
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,830
And if I come back?

613
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:28,440
I will take you in.

614
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,230
You told me to find one. A person to take in.

615
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,180
What are you going to do after taking me in?

616
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,100
I will attack two enemies.

617
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,710
Two enemies?

618
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,320
One is Nameless.

619
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,570
I will shatter them to pieces. They offer no benefit to the world.

620
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,650
What about the other one?

621
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,450
I'm not decided yet so let's talk again when you come back.

622
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:12,080
But look here. I don't serve someone who serves another. Don't you serve someone?

623
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,110
Or are you not like that now?

624
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:28,330
If that is so, then until I return lay low.

625
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:32,890
Until you gain power, don't do anything.

626
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:37,430
You know what hiding your true self to your enemies is, right?

627
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:44,200
For right now, you must act polite and quiet as if you're dead, no matter what.

628
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,350
Everything about your physiognomy is good, but

629
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:57,880
you are too quick to act. If being hasty is met with power, it turns into taking initiative. But if it meets with desire,

630
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,110
it's death.

631
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,560
Unni!

632
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,170
Yes?

633
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:24,020
Young Master Bang Won told you to come to the cave. He said you'll understand what it means.

634
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,200
Young Master Bang Won?

635
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,540
Hey! Where are you? Stop playing around.

636
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,820
Hurry and come out instead of playing around.

637
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,250
Don't do it.

638
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:58,940
I said don't do it. Stop!

639
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,830
You!

640
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,970
Hey!

641
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,600
I said stop!

642
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,050
You!

643
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,760
You!

644
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,030
Be careful!

645
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,110
Come here!

646
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,150
Oh, wait!

647
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,170
There!

648
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,490
This...

649
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,360
Stop!

650
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:24,110
Why did you suddenly do it?

651
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,310
You haven't had many snowball fights, right?

652
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:32,470
I'm someone who had snowball fights back in the Western district.

653
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,710
But you...

654
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,540
Hey.

655
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,420
What's wrong?

656
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,860
Why are you being like that? Did something happen?

657
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:27,320
Boon.

658
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,400
Speak.

659
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,190
Now...

660
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:38,450
Now...

661
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,080
I'm done playing now.

662
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,130
I don't think I can

663
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,540
have fun with you like this anymore.

664
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,860
Six Flying Dragons

665
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,630
Bang Won. Lee Bang Won.

666
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,790
Don't call my name from now on.

667
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,550
Are you Young Master Lee Bang Won?

668
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:36,190
What are the king's Five Rules?

669
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,720
I already told you!

670
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,610
Isn't it enough reason to not continue with Sam Bong?

671
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,500
We have to do the land survey again.

672
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,760
The land that will be divided among the people is not enough.

673
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,350
Are you telling us to delay the land reform?

674
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:49,300
Then, what happens to my promise with the people?

675
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,160
I, Jeong Do Jeon, will practice politics from now on.

676
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,260
This country's land will be reborn!
