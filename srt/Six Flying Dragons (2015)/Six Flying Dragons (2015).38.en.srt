00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,180
This is my way and my place.
[Episode 38]

3
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,860
How would I rise up without touching this field of shit when it's a field of shit I've fallen in?

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,560
You'll see.

5
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,040
I will build power in my own way.

6
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,500
Even if I were to die and live again, I believe I'm right.

7
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,980
I might find my way by doing this.

8
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,740
What are you doing?

9
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,960
Set it on fire! Right now!

10
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,020
What are you doing?

11
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,920
Are you in your right mind?

12
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,320
First line of archers! Forward!

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,880
Take aim.

14
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,220
Fire!

15
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,670
What are you doing right now?

16
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,130
Are you just going to stand there and watch the fire show?

17
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,850
Immediately run back in and tell them that a crazy bastard, Lee Bang Won, has set everything on fire.

18
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,030
You should at least scream together,

19
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,530
"Long live Goryeo! Let's all die!"

20
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,740
Second line of archers, forward!

21
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,230
That crazy man, Lee Bang Won, has set the village on fire.

22
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,950
What did you say?

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,430
Let's just all

24
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,820
die in here together.

25
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,500
That would be useless death.

26
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,220
Teacher.

27
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,640
Everyone, go out.

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,380
I am going to remain here.

29
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,480
It looks like it's starting to burn now.

30
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,850
Should I shoot some more?

31
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:27,770
I think they've been threatened enough so please stop.

32
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:33,010
Why? You've calmly looked at my physiognomy all this time,

33
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,070
but you can't look at the things that I do?

34
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,170
Moo Hyul.

35
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,830
Yes, Your Highness.

36
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,830
There will be people coming out now because they couldn't endure the fire.
(Lee Bang Won, Prince Jeong An, Lee Seong Gye's fifth son)

37
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,620
Arrest everyone and lock them up.

38
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,240
Yes.

39
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,970
Arrest everyone!

40
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,550
Yes!

41
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,220
Go back if you don't want to see my pitiful state.
(Lee Bang Woo, Prince Jin Ahn, first son)

42
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,720
I have something to say so I came, Prince Jin An.

43
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Your Highness, I came to escort you as this country's foundation, Crown Prince.

44
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,780
What?

45
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,770
You will get hurt. Please stop.

46
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,900
Slash me. You're the best swordsman of the Three Kingdoms.

47
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,940
Stop it.

48
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,680
Stop.

49
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,970
I don't care about my life now.

50
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,770
I!

51
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,910
I also don't care about what you think, Your Highness!

52
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,390
The only important thing is

53
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,400
that the person in front me is the one who will guide the great future of this new country,

54
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,600
the first born of the Jeonju Lee family!

55
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,660
You bastard!

56
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,460
Behead me and make sure to ascend as the Crown Prince.

57
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,040
Do you think I can't do it?

58
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,060
The country is already a mess so what is there to fear?

59
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,810
Fine. If you want to die, then I will do it.

60
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,710
Bang Woo!

61
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,000
I need you.

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,420
For what?

63
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,320
You have to be the Crown Prince.
(Taejo Lee Seong Gye, First king of Joseon)

64
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,240
Please leave.

65
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,160
How can you not know what your father is feeling?

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
I already told you.

67
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,380
I will be the Crown Prince, and then the King and then find the Wang family.

68
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,980
Is it okay for me to give them the throne?

69
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,600
You bastard!

70
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,960
You've already achieved many of your dreams,

71
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,130
but...

72
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,000
Your dream regarding me will never come true.

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,090
You bastard!

74
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:18,080
Yes! I am Lee Seong Gye's son,

75
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,860
but...

76
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,830
I am not a person of the country where Lee Seong Gye is king.

77
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,060
Although I won't be able to break our father-son ties,

78
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,760
I will never become a person or a subject of this country that was founded after beating Po Eun to death,

79
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,360
let alone become the Crown Prince!

80
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,780
The one who beat Po Eun to death with an iron mace,

81
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,040
isn't there that greatest hero called Lee Bang Won?

82
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,460
You can just make Bang Won do it.

83
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,040
Prince Jin An (Lee Bang Woo) has to do it.

84
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,740
What should I do with that child?

85
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,800
Didn't you hear him earlier?

86
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,700
Prince Jin Ahn is the first-born son, and

87
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,130
it is widely known that he is a loyal subject of Goryeo.

88
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,870
We can get more people's approval if he becomes the Crown Prince,

89
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,050
and that by itself will become a symbol of harmony.

90
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,160
It's not like I didn't know that.

91
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,640
I will come visit him every day.

92
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,250
We should all just die together.

93
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,510
You bastard! Do you not even fear the heavens?

94
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,610
What have you done to Teacher Moonam Chookjae?

95
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:22,130
The thirteen people including the Teachers Moonam, Chookjae, Seongmoon, Saeun, that didn't come here

96
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,800
did not come out of the fire

97
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,900
and have proven their loyalty.

98
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,040
In the fire, they showed their determination that they won't serve two heavens,

99
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,660
unlike those of you who are here.

100
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,700
I, Prince Jeong An Lee Bang Won,

101
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,230
I will praise the thirteen's loyal spirits,

102
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:53,700
and I will put each of their names deep in my heart.

103
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:01,450
Just like what I did with Teacher Po Eun's name.

104
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,380
How dare you, you bastard, speak his name?

105
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,290
Why don't you do the same thing to me too!

106
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,860
Are you okay?

107
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,940
So you are still overflowing with strength.

108
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,930
Are you okay?

109
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,150
Starve them for three days.

110
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:07,110
After three days, give them food and release two hours later.

111
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,550
Yes. I understand.

112
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,190
Just what are you going to do?

113
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,710
Didn't I say I will persuade them?

114
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,470
Is starving them same as persuading?

115
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:35,090
After Your Highness killed thirteen scholars, they will only have hatred towards you.

116
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:42,170
That's not all. By speaking Po Eun's name, I poured gas on the that rage.

117
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,450
Open the door!

118
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,310
Lee Bang Won!

119
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,310
I will surely get out of here and rip you apart!

120
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,170
Lee Bang Won!

121
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,530
But what do you think will happen after the rage inside of them calms down?

122
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,330
Perhaps,

123
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,970
it will become deep sadness and desperation.

124
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,470
At first, they will be in a rage

125
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:21,330
because of the shame of not making the same choice as those thirteen people who died.

126
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,170
And then?

127
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,430
After one more day passes, they will realize.

128
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,730
What?

129
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,810
That they haven't eaten for a while.

130
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,070
What?

131
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,950
Being human is being powerless.

132
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,930
No matter how sad, how enraged, how desperate,

133
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,970
they will be hungry if starved and will be sleepy when kept awake.

134
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,650
After three days, food will go in.

135
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,550
At first they will hesitate,

136
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,970
but at some point they will eat like crazy.

137
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,750
Then, they will be persuaded.

138
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,030
Do you think they will be persuaded like that?

139
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,450
Before that, what about those who will endure and not eat?

140
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,310
In this world, there are people who think that their beliefs are more important than their lives.

141
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:29,070
Yes. But not in that storage.

142
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,670
How can you be so sure?

143
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,850
Why do you think I set the village on fire?

144
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,770
There were thirteen people like that and they all died in the fire.

145
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,810
Yes. People who think belief is more important than their lives,

146
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,390
those like Po Eun.

147
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:06,890
I cannot waste time trying to persuade people like that now.

148
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,750
That's something that Teacher Sam Bong and Father couldn't even do.

149
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:19,690
Like someone mistaking a man, saying he will persuade that person

150
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,090
while hesitating and

151
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,310
making a life-long great cause into this.

152
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:34,350
- It is pathetic.
- Is this person really...

153
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,430
Your Highness, then what will happen to them?

154
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,550
After filling their stomachs, they will probably quietly go out of the open door

155
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,130
with thoughts of revenge on me and

156
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,610
a desire to gain power.

157
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,530
How can you be confident that it will be that way?

158
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,410
Because I experienced the same thing.

159
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:13,870
In comparison, I was younger and I wasn't starved for three days but four.

160
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,270
And it wasn't in that kind of storage, but a much smaller rice bin.

161
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:26,390
And Hong In Bang was much more sly than me.

162
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,590
Second Minister of State Affairs, Lee Ji Ran, requests to enter.

163
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,130
Let him in.

164
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,190
What's the matter?

165
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,310
Bang Won... Ah, Prince Jeong An...

166
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,590
What about Bang Won?

167
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:01,550
He set Doomundong on fire.

168
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,050
What? Didn't he say he went to persuade them?

169
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:18,830
Also, thirteen people couldn't come out and they all died.

170
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,850
What? Doesn't this mean that he's going to disobey?

171
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,450
Instead of repenting his wrongdoings, isn't he just announcing that he's going to do whatever he wants?

172
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,050
What?

173
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,950
So thirteen people died and the rest were arrested?

174
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:53,950
Yes. He fed them after starving them for three days before they were released.

175
00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:01,490
How can Prince Jeong An do such thing? Wouldn't this only worsen their hostility?

176
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,110
Will it be okay to leave Prince Jeong An (Lee Bang Won) like this?

177
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:12,230
The Doomundong problem has at least been resolved.

178
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,690
All of you can go.

179
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,410
Where?

180
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,030
I don't know. You can go where ever you wish to go.

181
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,850
Everyone went about their way once we opened the storage doors.

182
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,750
No one said anything and nothing seemed unusual.

183
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,170
You've worked hard.

184
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,710
What's wrong?

185
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,370
Is this right?

186
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,250
Why would you think such thoughts?

187
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,290
Have you never thought if it was right or wrong?

188
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,090
I personally do,

189
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,210
but why would you think of something like that when it's His Highness's business?

190
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,690
- Is that so?
- Hey!

191
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,030
People like us don't have great cause and belief.

192
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,050
Since we don't have such things, we instead serve a person.

193
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:56,210
Ah! It has to be that person! Someone that I can trust, serve and such.

194
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,490
Just believe. Is there anyone else in this country as trustworthy as His Highness?

195
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,590
There's a great meaning behind it that we don't understand. Don't you think so?

196
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,770
Yes. That's probably the case.

197
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:19,030
Of course! We only have to follow after them. People like us don't have beliefs or principles, except for what?

198
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,090
We just need to keep one thing. Loyalty!

199
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:30,350
Yes. That's right. Loyalty.

200
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,650
Loyalty.

201
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,030
Let's do that. Let's just believe in him.

202
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,610
Lord Sam Bong.

203
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,750
What's the matter?

204
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,990
I heard that you rejected the government offer and went to Doomundong.

205
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,810
Please give me a government post.

206
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,150
You threw away everything and was living in seclusion. But why, all of a sudden?

207
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,210
I can't trust something that I can't understand.

208
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,110
If you want a government post, then make me understand.

209
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,710
Make a guess.

210
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,490
Was it because of Prince Jeong An?

211
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,330
That's right.

212
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,150
I...
(Hwang Hee)

213
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:31,890
cannot forgive Prince Jeong An Lee Bang Won.

214
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,550
Please give me a government post!

215
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:42,910
I need power. I will wait.

216
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,800
Wasn't that Hwang Hee who just left?

217
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,010
Is that person back as well?

218
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,250
Is there someone else who came back?

219
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,530
Yes.

220
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,840
Ryu Moon Sang and Park Chan Hyun, who were Po Eun's right hands, returned

221
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,060
and were reinstated to their posts.

222
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,580
It seems that the Sadaebu and scholars

223
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,320
who have changed their minds are all coming back.

224
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,910
This is...

225
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:22,110
Prince Jeong An is indeed amazing.

226
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,670
Even if they are reinstated,

227
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,230
won't they become your enemies?

228
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,200
You were also our enemy in the beginning.

229
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,370
Firstly, do not kill.

230
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,910
Second, do not covet other people's belongings.

231
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,520
Third, don't think immoral thoughts.

232
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,910
Fourth, do not lie.
(Lee Bang Seok: Prince Ui An, Lee Seong Gye's 8th son)

233
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:05,290
Lastly, do not drink excessively.

234
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,790
Next, we'll proceed with the Yeonbi Ritual (Buddhism ritual of burning one's arm with incense).

235
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,200
M-Monk. It's not leaving a mark.

236
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,360
Why is it like that?

237
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,250
Sir Monk.

238
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,580
Why did you become so pale just before?

239
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,010
About that...

240
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,420
You once said that Bang Seok's physiognomy and destiny

241
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,710
showed that he will make a beneficial world.

242
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:44,620
Does not leaving a mark mean something else?

243
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,580
I will tell you.

244
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,210
In front of Prince Ui An

245
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,670
is a bright and great road.

246
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,220
Yes. And so?

247
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,060
If

248
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,380
if that path becomes blocked,

249
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,610
he will be broken.

250
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,090
What do you mean?

251
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,120
He will die at a young age.

252
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,140
His path will be blocked? What does that mean?
(Queen Seon Deok, Lee Seong Gye's second wife; Bang Bun and Bang Seok's mother)

253
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,190
He must

254
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,650
become the king.

255
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,210
I have something to check.

256
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,860
Put the guards on alert and go on without me.

257
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,310
Yes.

258
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,150
Seems like a really high person.

259
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,370
Ajussi Sang Man is missing?

260
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,230
It's strange.

261
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,010
Something must have happened.

262
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,580
Isn't Ajussi Sang Man keeping an eye on that temple?

263
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,220
He was.

264
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,460
Because it seems to have a connection with Nameless,

265
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,520
we were watching over it the whole day.

266
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,610
We were also watching over the whole mountain,

267
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,710
but Sang Man suddenly disappeared today.

268
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,060
Leader Boon Yi! Leader Boon Yi!

269
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,100
You have to come out.

270
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,350
Ajussi!

271
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,100
What happened?

272
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,370
Boon. Did you ask for the Queen to be followed?

273
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,610
Queen?

274
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,020
This person was caught while following the Queen.

275
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,730
Hey aren't these the Hwa Sa Dan?

276
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,140
Who are you to make a person into this?

277
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,600
That's right. What did our Sang Man do for you to beat him up like this?

278
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,430
Following the Queen can become a serious crime.

279
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,300
He probably didn't know it was the Queen.

280
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,710
He has to figure out the identity of everyone going in and out, but since he couldn't tell from just looking,

281
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,580
that's why he followed her, to know from which household she came.

282
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,400
Whatever the reason, following the Queen—

283
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,880
So?

284
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,550
You didn't even check properly

285
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,220
and did this to a person?

286
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,960
Everyone knows about Prince Jeong An being in charge of the Nameless case.

287
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,800
And for past few years, from which house key persons come out of and where they go,

288
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,090
who's meeting who, and how long they're seeing each other.

289
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,480
It has been our job to check these things.

290
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,490
I believe that was a great help in creating the new country.

291
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,290
Okay. You're right, Boon.

292
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,470
I'm sorry for laying a hand on your member. I apologize.

293
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,430
I'm sorry, Unni,

294
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,490
for getting all serious...

295
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,070
But Boon...

296
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,330
Now,

297
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:23,300
how about sending your members back to their hometowns?

298
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,780
The country has now been established

299
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,520
and Nameless can be taken care of by us or the investigation bureau.

300
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,850
Prince Jeong An now holds prince status, so he has to stop doing these kinds of things.

301
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,460
You also can't receive permission from Prince Jeong An

302
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,610
to do things like watch over key persons.

303
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,730
Things like that can be done by us...

304
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,270
What...

305
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,680
What do you mean by that?

306
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,880
Is what you're doing different from what Prince Jeong An is doing?

307
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,330
It will be different from now on.

308
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:59,170
If you're doing this because Prince Jeong An killed Po Eun,

309
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,800
you also know that he didn't have any options back then.

310
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,280
Everyone was desperate.

311
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,740
It is true that there is now a gap between Lord Sam Bong and Prince Jeong An because of that,

312
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,830
but it's not only because of that.

313
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,820
Then?

314
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,220
It seems that Prince Jeong An had different thoughts from the start.

315
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,180
Different thoughts?

316
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,960
Using tricking Nameless as an excuse, he raised his own soldiers

317
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,090
and even absorbed your organization.

318
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,960
It was an organization originally made by Lord Sam Bong.

319
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,750
So what kind of thoughts is

320
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,140
Prince Jeong An having?

321
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,810
I don't know about that.

322
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,480
But I've seen countless numbers of times, while in Hwa Sa Dan,

323
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,080
people who once were like brothers fighting each other and ripping each other apart.

324
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,880
Will it be like that between Lord Sam Bong and Prince Jeong An?

325
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,400
I desperately hope it won't happen

326
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,090
But Prince Jeong An's actions worry me.

327
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,000
It's the same for the Doomundong issue.

328
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,770
He didn't do anything wrong.

329
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,430
He is a talented person and made many contributions to founding of the new country.

330
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,750
Right. That's why he's dangerous.

331
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,260
Because he's talented and bright on all sides.

332
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,840
Right now, it's just the beginning of founding of the country.

333
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,000
We have to work in unison and form the groundwork.

334
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,700
There must not be any another influential forces besides His Highness and Lord Sam Bong.

335
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,880
What do you think about having some distance from Prince Jeong An?

336
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,070
Boon, now...

337
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,950
Playing is over now.

338
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,560
Your Highness.

339
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,840
A great number of government officials and scholars who went to Doomundong are being reinstated.

340
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,330
This is because of Prince Jeong An.

341
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,520
Yes, Your Highness.

342
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,940
Covering up Prince Jeong An's big contribution,

343
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,670
and questioning his crime in a small disaster, is not the right way to handle it.

344
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,410
Look at them.

345
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,710
Lee Shin Jeok, Jo Joon. How can these people...

346
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,550
Your Majesty, please understand.

347
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,590
Your Highness, there has been a big problem.

348
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,700
Prince Jin An (Lee Bang Woo)

349
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,920
has disappeared.

350
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,910
Disappeared?

351
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,490
I went to the village where he was staying but nobody is there.

352
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,170
There was something written in the yard:

353
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,100
"If you look for me,

354
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,770
I will die."

355
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,950
Bang Woo...

356
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,780
Bang Woo, you...

357
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,520
What should we do now?

358
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,910
The rule of primogeniture has been broken!

359
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,970
If this goes on, all the princes

360
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,460
will have a chance to be Crown Prince.

361
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,920
Don't you think a path has opened up for you as well, Husband?

362
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,650
Also, nobody can disregard your great contribution.

363
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,570
You also resolved the Doomundong problem

364
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,690
since so many young people returned.

365
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,630
Please, you're flattering me.

366
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,940
If Bang Woo Hyung-nim won't do it, then Bang Gwa Hyung-nim has to do it.

367
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,280
This is because of Prince Jeong An.

368
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,670
Covering up Prince Jeong An's big contribution,

369
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,460
and questioning his crime in a small disaster, is not the right way to handle it.

370
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,290
What are your thoughts?

371
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,420
If Prince Jin An doesn't come back,

372
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,750
it is the natural order to choose

373
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,770
the next eldest, Prince Young An (Lee Bang Gwa).

374
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,630
Excuse me for saying this, but it can't be Prince Jeong An (Lee Bang Won).

375
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,530
Doing so would an act of abandoning

376
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,540
the Sadaebu and scholars who followed Po Eun.

377
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,130
For 50 years after founding a country,

378
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:06,980
It's an important time that will decided what kind of country this will become.

379
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,320
During such a time, we cannot make Prince Jeong An, who stabbed that Confucian scholar to death,

380
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,040
the foundation of the new country.

381
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,470
Crown Prince.

382
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,160
Crown Prince...

383
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,670
With what plan,

384
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,570
did you make Doomundong into that?

385
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,520
Plan...

386
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,260
Well...

387
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,280
I should just repent until father forgives me,

388
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,960
or...

389
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,990
I just wanted to cause more trouble.

390
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,420
I just did it.

391
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,380
Just because...

392
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,320
Left Minister Jo Joon

393
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,460
seems to be seeing you in a different way.

394
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,750
Also, Lee Shin Jeok

395
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,410
had a different attitude towards the Doomundong case.

396
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,680
Is that so?

397
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,840
That's actually odd for Shin Jeok.

398
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,340
That's not all.

399
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Because of this incident, you will have left a deep impression

400
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,870
on the politicians in Gaegyeong.

401
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,340
Then

402
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:32,390
will I become Crown Prince this time?

403
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,620
You probably already know that, Your Highness.

404
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,650
In the end, it depends on His Majesty the King.

405
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,150
It's Prince Jeong An.

406
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,160
Prince Jeong An?

407
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,460
Why?

408
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,710
During peaceful times, it's the first born son.

409
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:04,620
During chaotic times, the one with the most contributions shall be Crown Prince.

410
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,120
Also aren't these days the restless days of the early period of founding a country?

411
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,530
I heard that the first 50 years after founding a country

412
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,900
is an important period that decides what kind of country it will become.

413
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,690
No, Your Highness.

414
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,510
The first 50 years after founding a country

415
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,070
is not the time that will decide what country it will become,

416
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:29,200
but it will decide whether the country will survive or not.

417
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,590
So I think it is right for Prince Jeong An

418
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:38,410
to ascend as the Crown Prince.

419
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,260
It's been a while.

420
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,650
Nameless.

421
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,200
What's the matter?

422
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,740
I was curious if our alliance is still in effect, so I came.

423
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,220
When were we in an alliance?

424
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,520
Do you want to be the Crown Prince?

425
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,540
I don't think you're an amazing enough organization

426
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,790
to make it possible for me to be Crown Prince.

427
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,860
Yes.

428
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,450
In the end, choosing the Crown Prince

429
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,520
will be decided by His Highness and Sam Bong.

430
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,040
But

431
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,290
we have prepared for the next sequence.

432
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,540
It must not be Prince Jeong An.

433
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,230
It is true that Prince Jeong An has the greatest merit.

434
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,010
What use is having great achievements?

435
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,270
But after Prince Jin An did that to Lord Han Goo Young

436
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,120
you also thought of Prince Jeong An as the Crown Prince.

437
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,040
I did.

438
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,010
Just like how I thought of Po Eun as this country's Prime Minister,

439
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,410
I thought of Prince Jeong An as this country's foundation.

440
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,650
But...

441
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,530
Both of them

442
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,060
came to an end on that Seonji bridge.

443
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,210
Prince Jeong An has to be the Crown Prince for the country to be stable.

444
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,570
I am also thinking

445
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,840
about Bang Won becoming Crown Prince.

446
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,200
Then you should say something to His Maje—

447
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,910
Please stop.

448
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,140
I know Hyung-nim's thoughts more than anyone else.

449
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,100
It cannot be

450
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,770
Prince Jeong An.

451
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,480
Hyung-nim is thinking...

452
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,530
There's not much time left until the Crown Prince is chosen.

453
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,130
It will be Prince Yeong An, right?
(Prince Yeong An, Lee Bang Gwa, second son)

454
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,220
Bang Gwa...

455
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:11,300
He went through many life and death situations with me on the battlefield.

456
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,750
And he also likes to follow after me.

457
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,070
Jeong Do Jeon

458
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:57,490
The country cannot become as he wishes.

459
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,680
If that happens, our Nameless...

460
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,150
No, the basis of our organization, the merchant power we have will all be over.

461
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,510
Ideas like the equal land division

462
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,390
aren't something that only applies to land.

463
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,910
Could it be that Jeong Do Jeon

464
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,090
is also trying to do something to the merchants?

465
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:23,310
He is trying to put commercial business under the government's control.

466
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,770
Is that what you mean?

467
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:29,920
A system where only those permitted by the government will be able to buy and sell.

468
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,720
He is probably thinking of something like that.

469
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,980
As you know, when we enthroned Sook Jong (Goryeo's 15th king),

470
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,010
we made the majority of the merchants

471
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,610
subjects of the court.

472
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,140
That's not all.

473
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,150
We made many of the Buddhists and royal family members into powerful forces, as our protective power,

474
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,610
and made daughters of the merchants like queens.

475
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,650
King Choong Hae and King Gong Hae used to be merchants themselves.

476
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,000
But that man, Jeong Do Jeon.

477
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,780
He is thinking that the cause of corruption in Goryeo was only from the pursuit of profit.

478
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,980
So he is looking for it there.

479
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,030
We can't ever coexist.

480
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,260
Then...

481
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,130
So

482
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:21,040
Using the Hwa Do Inn, we will recreate the collapsed information system.

483
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,140
The Hwa Do Inn?

484
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,820
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:32,010
Because of my fault, Hwa Sa Dan went over to Jeong Do Jeong...

486
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,460
With the current situation, where we even have to use the Hwa Do Inn,

487
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,670
I am also dismayed.

488
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,810
But right now we must only think about surviving.

489
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,830
Teacher Yook San and Cho Young will be in charge of this.

490
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,630
Yes.

491
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:56,290
Next, I will tell you about something we were working on.

492
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,410
Let Cheon Ji Bi in.

493
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:06,890
Your Highness, are you not thinking about Bang Seok (8th son) and Bang Beon (7th son)?

494
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:12,690
Aren't you already thinking about Bang Seok?

495
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,190
Why do you think so?

496
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:22,310
After what happened with Prince Jin An, in order to avoid any misunderstandings about choosing the crown prince,

497
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,990
I never said said anything.

498
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:31,450
But because I know your worry, I'm selflessly saying this.

499
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,910
Please speak.

500
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:37,110
Today, I met with Monk Geolji.

501
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:43,910
He will die at a young age. He has to be king.

502
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,530
What did Monk Geolji say?

503
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,590
The one who never existed, will always be there.

504
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,410
A nameless person

505
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,190
will not disappear.

506
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:14,830
Cheon Ji Bi is meeting Mugeuk.

507
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:19,530
Did you tell Her Highness?

508
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:23,790
Yes. I did.

509
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:29,490
She probably couldn't stay still.

510
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:36,830
Our spy who is watching over General Lee Ji Ran also thinks it's possible.

511
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:44,610
If it doesn't work, we have another option, and another one.

512
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,330
Let's go from here.

513
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,570
Jeong Do Jeon.

514
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:56,290
Monk Geolji says that the bloodshed from founding the new country,

515
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:02,530
and the reproachful remarks about that blood, are preventing the country from having a thousand-year history.

516
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:07,350
Your Highness, actually, whether it is Prince Yeong An or Prince Jeong An,

517
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,410
they've already spilled too much blood.

518
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,290
Aren't you conflicted by that?

519
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:21,750
Monk Geolji lastly said that Bang Seok was born with the physiognomy of saving the world.

520
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:28,510
You already know of Bang Seok's brightness.

521
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:34,130
Please follow your heart.

522
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,710
In the end, choosing the crown prince

523
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,310
will depend on His Highness and Sam Bong.

524
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,090
Your Highness.

525
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,210
What?

526
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,750
I have something to ask you.

527
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,950
Tell me.

528
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:27,830
Now that the new country has opened, the work that we do can be done by the investigation bureau—

529
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,910
Was it Lady Yeon Hee?

530
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:37,030
Lady Yeon Hee told you to close the organization and leave this place.

531
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,810
No, it's not that.

532
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,190
Yes. That was right.

533
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:59,190
Have you really decided to separate ways with Elder Sam Bong?

534
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:05,330
There's nothing to decide. We have different paths.

535
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,670
"Playing is over."

536
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:18,230
Was it from that day that you have changed?

537
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:23,810
Is it strange for a person to change? It's a given.

538
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:28,350
- You did change.
- Did you not change?

539
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,950
Think about it.

540
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:38,750
When Father fell off his horse and your members gathered and asked what they were going to do,

541
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:43,050
when they asked whether they'd have to run away or if they will die,

542
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:48,690
at that time you talked to them as if scolding them,

543
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:56,250
and you actually tried to comfort me and console me.

544
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,530
That means I changed?

545
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:04,050
Would you have done something like that in the past?

546
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,810
You would have come running to me asking what to do about your members

547
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:14,450
and pressured me to come up with a solution.

548
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:20,590
No. Before that, you might have even taken everyone and run away.

549
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,930
Doesn't that mean that you've changed?

550
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,850
That might be true.

551
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:36,770
Your resolve to do something as long as you're alive, is it still there?

552
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,970
It is.

553
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:43,610
Then, listen to what I will say.

554
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:53,790
In the new country, a member of the royal family like me cannot do anything, even when I'm alive,

555
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:57,450
whether it's politics or anything else.

556
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,910
Even Your Highness?

557
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,490
That's the country that Teacher Sam Bong wants to make.

558
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:07,250
He is right. The royal family and relatives shouldn't be left to run wild.

559
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,050
But I

560
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,870
can't stand it.

561
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:21,450
That's why, in order to be able to at least do something, I would have to be the king.

562
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:29,350
But Teacher Sam Bong and Father have no such thoughts.

563
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:37,770
That's why I need power. I need you and I need your organization.

564
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:47,650
You make the decision. Even if I have changed, I'm sure

565
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,110
that I've never hidden anything from you.

566
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:55,630
Though I myself am not sure of the future.

567
00:47:56,810 --> 00:48:00,290
Because I don't know how I will change.

568
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,910
The monk in that temple

569
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:16,790
said some strange things to Her Highness.

570
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,010
Strange things?

571
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,510
That if Prince Ui An (Lee Bang Seok) doesn't become the king, he will die at a young age.

572
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:34,590
It's the temple you told us to watch, thinking it might be connected to Nameless.

573
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:42,470
But we are prepared for the next sequence.

574
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,490
This is slowly becoming interesting.

575
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:50,670
You...

576
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:55,970
I still haven't made a decision.

577
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,730
Please call Moo Hyul.

578
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,710
Prince Jeong An is looking for you.

579
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,470
Yes.

580
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,770
He's looking for you so why are you not going?

581
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:38,050
I will... But I just feel restless.

582
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,290
Why, Warrior-nim?

583
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,750
It's because of the Doomundong incident, right?

584
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:54,030
I thought that it would get better once the new country was established.

585
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,810
It only became more complicated.

586
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,230
What do you mean I'm politicking behind the scenes?

587
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:08,450
If that's not it, then why are you talking with General Lee Ji Ran about choosing the crown prince?

588
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:13,170
General Lee Ji Ran is a subject of the court and a person close to His Majesty, so what's the problem?

589
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,330
That's why it can't be.

590
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,310
Because every public matter, small or large,

591
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,910
needs to be dealt with in a public discussion in a public place.

592
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,890
That is where this country differs from Goryeo.

593
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:30,190
If a person like you meets secretly with a close acquaintance of His Majesty regarding small or big matters,

594
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,590
how would we be able to achieve the total administration of the Prime Minister Plan and the Five Rules of the King?

595
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:39,010
I have something I've been wanting to say for a while.

596
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:43,790
Let's work on those after the groundwork of this country becomes stable.

597
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,730
The Total Administration of the Prime Minister and the Five Rules of the King.

598
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,730
What do you mean?

599
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,470
The early period after founding a country is always unstable.

600
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:55,030
Right now, instead of the rules, debates and discussions,

601
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,630
it's a time that needs strong power.

602
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:04,190
So the country needs to be lead by a Crown Prince like Prince Jeong An.

603
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,230
He would probably lead well.

604
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:11,730
By ignoring all his subjects' discussions and doing everything as he decides, he would lead very well.

605
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:15,810
But the country that Prince Jeong An would make

606
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,700
would not be the country that we're thinking of.

607
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,090
Jeung Ja said,

608
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:29,890
"Every day, I self-reflect on the following three things.

609
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:35,670
"Have I tried to help others with sincerity?

610
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:40,490
"Have I kept my loyalty and faith in my friends?

611
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:44,890
"Have I fully understood the things I have learned?"

612
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:52,470
Your Highness, why all of a sudden?

613
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,480
You're a Nameless, right?

614
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,840
What do you mean?

615
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,380
I've always had a compelling personality but it has become more pressing these days.

616
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,140
You have to properly answer or you will die here.

617
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,010
Young Gyu.

618
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:10,970
Yes, Your Highness!

619
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:22,580
Am I going to die here?

620
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:32,240
If your warrior and Your Highness came here to kill me,

621
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,660
do you think I will sit still?

622
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,390
You're quite skilled in martial arts,

623
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:45,600
but why couldn't you avoid that slap earlier?

624
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,260
Was my hand too fast?

625
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,620
That couldn't be it.

626
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,650
No matter how skilled you are in martial arts, if I want you to die,

627
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,800
you will die.

628
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:09,430
That's why you have to answer properly.

629
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:17,280
Is Nameless planning to make Bang Seok the Crown Prince?

630
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,810
Even if you're not a Nameless, if you couldn't find that information out after receiving payment from me,

631
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:25,130
then you'd have to die.

632
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,790
You're a Nameless, right?

633
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,760
What do you think of Prince Ui An Bang Seok?

634
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,460
What do you mean?

635
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,860
Your Highness.

636
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:49,120
What about making Prince Ui An the Crown Prince?

637
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,460
Do you think I am Nameless?

638
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:02,100
I don't think. I'm just asking you.

639
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,540
Are you Nameless or not?

640
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:10,060
If you're not Nameless, I'll kill you.

641
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,900
Please stop.

642
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,470
So you've appeared.

643
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:27,280
Send the other people out and let's have a talk.

644
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,160
Prince Young An (Lee Bang Gwa) has made many contributions,

645
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,640
from the Battle of the Mount Hwang to the battle in Gaegyeong to the Wihwa Island army withdrawal.

646
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,840
So why?

647
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,870
That is why.

648
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:42,470
The blood that has stained my hands,

649
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:47,610
and also Prince Yeong An Bang Gwa's hands, is still there.

650
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,730
After I stabilize the groundwork of this country,

651
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:57,510
shouldn't the king after me be different from someone like me?

652
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,670
But Your Highness, Prince Ui An—

653
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,750
Sam Bong, you can just

654
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:09,030
make Prince Ui An Bang Seok the Crown Prince.

655
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,500
Your Highness.

656
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,750
I have made up my mind.

657
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:21,950
His Highness the King will not give the crown prince position to Your Highness.

658
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:25,010
That is what we have already deduced.

659
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:32,150
So you have decided on Prince Ui An.

660
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:35,750
To that young child without any achievements!

661
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:44,300
Please stop. I will tell you even if you don't force me.

662
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,850
You already have a guess as to why we did that, right?

663
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:53,110
That's why you came here, to confirm it.

664
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:57,790
Try to convince me well.

665
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,630
Who established this country?

666
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:04,260
Stop saying useless things and get to the point.

667
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:10,780
Yes. This country was established by His Highness, General Lee Seong Gye.

668
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:15,100
But what do you think it would've been like, if King Gong Min's reformation had succeeded?

669
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,780
If Shin Don's plan of land and slave reformation had worked

670
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,480
and eliminated the immoral wrong doings in Goryeo, what would it have been like?

671
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,720
This country probably wouldn't have been founded.

672
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:37,020
Do you know what I'm talking about?

673
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,460
So the one who established this country...

674
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,240
So you're talking about Hong In Bang.

675
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,110
That's right.

676
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:51,580
Because there was Hong In Bang who brought down Goryeo with his greed and even more greed,

677
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,320
Sam Bong's land reform came to light.

678
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,760
Also because of Choi Young, who tried to start a reckless war with his stubbornness and self-righteousness,

679
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,600
giving 50,000 children back to their parents

680
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,940
and dominating the whole country after the Wihwa Island retreat became possible.

681
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:12,740
So Prince Ui An Bang Seok,

682
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,640
who doen't have any achievement and is the youngest,

683
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,760
who is not even a child of the primary wife.

684
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,590
The youngest son.

685
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:34,060
The most unusual, imprudent, and nonsensical crown prince.

686
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,350
Yes.

687
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:41,900
This impossible decision on the crown prince will become your Hong In Bang.

688
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,980
Your Highness.

689
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,300
I said I've made my decision.

690
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,450
Sam Bong.

691
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:57,770
Your Highness, if I do that, I have a condition.

692
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,340
What is it?

693
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,450
Will you give me control over all of this country's military,

694
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:08,270
and authority over treatment of the princes?

695
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,070
It's exactly that.

696
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:14,490
Such instability and discord will cause the world too react

697
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:18,170
and will create the opportunity for change

698
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:24,350
and (an opportunity) for Your Highness as well.

699
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:27,350
An opportunity will come.

700
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:36,550
Sam Bong, who is holding all the power and is ruling above all.

701
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:42,830
An opportunity to make Sam Bong collapse.

702
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:45,010
If you do that, then I

703
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,490
will protect Prince Ui An with my life

704
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:52,700
and make him this country's foundation.

705
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,160
Six Flying Dragons

706
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,900
Prince Ui An will be the Crown Prince.

707
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,400
This country is now in Sam Bong's hands.

708
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,350
Are you going to give me the power?

709
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,770
Please protect Prince Ui An Bang Seok.

710
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:32,050
The time has come faster. The time for you to make a choice.

711
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,820
Are you really going against Sam Bong from now on?

712
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,270
That side already thinks of us as enemies.

713
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:39,230
Now that youngest has become the crown prince,

714
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:40,880
regardless of our actual thoughts,

715
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,190
we will seem like a threat to them.

716
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,970
It will happen like that.

717
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:48,600
From here on, it is a war of life and death.
