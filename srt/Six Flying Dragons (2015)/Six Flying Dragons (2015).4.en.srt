1
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,290
What's wrong with this? Why is this suddenly... This is the first for something like this.

2
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,240
First?

3
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,320
From now on, it's the start.

4
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,880
Goodness is something that will even accept and embrace evil.

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,110
But justice will never tolerate evil.

6
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:33,080
Only by purging evil, will justice be

7
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,260
righteous.

8
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,090
It can't be. Did that child really...

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,850
Episode 4
What are you doing here this late at night?

10
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,730
Was it you?

11
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,490
That night, was it your doing?

12
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:11,170
That night, was it you, teacher, that left Colleague Heo Gang's piece of clothing?

13
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,450
You do still call me teacher.

14
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,870
Whether it be goodness or evil, I still received your teachings.

15
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,330
That night, teacher, you performed an act of evil, while I performed an act of justice.

16
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,730
Justice... You think that's justice?

17
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,340
If the world adopts your way of justice, it will be so horrendous.

18
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,150
It's not something to be hearing from an evil man, but I guess it will be so.

19
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,890
Yes. Right now I'm still lacking.

20
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,270
Let's just say I'm still in the process of learning justice. Since I'm... young.

21
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:58,990
Yes. Regardless of whether I'm an evil man, we have something in common.

22
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,650
Yes.

23
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,500
Now at least...

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,930
You have to continue to be virtuous.

25
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,590
The General and his son as well.

26
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,270
Neither of us is good-hearted.

27
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,160
Until I gather more power, I will never be good-hearted.

28
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,710
I've already seen goodness without power.

29
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,940
Ddang Sae (Later Lee Bang Ji)

30
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,880
There was a bodyguard protecting Princess No Gook.

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,960
The Princess would always take him and Yeon Hyang, with her.

32
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,630
It is Gil Sun Mi.

33
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,310
He is the twin brother of Gil Tae Mi, who is currently the Ji Mun Ha Boo Sa (name of a political position).

34
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,890
It's been said that he sometimes visits the temple of Chung Ak mountain.

35
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,670
Is that child really looking for Gil Sun Mi?

36
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,770
But, why is that kid looking for him ?

37
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,210
The symbol in this letter! The person with this symbol took our mom away.

38
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,730
He knows our symbol.

39
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,690
What? What are you saying?

40
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,120
There is someone else who is also looking for Gil Sun Mi.

41
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,240
Some old guy came and looked for Gil Sun Mi about a month ago.

42
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,830
Now he's set up a camp down by the stream and is waiting.

43
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,860
Oh... Gil Sun Mi isn't here?

44
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:59,090
He comes by from time to time, but you can't tell if that will be today or tomorrow.

45
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,550
You know this right?
I'm curious about how you know about this.

46
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,890
How did you come to know this symbol?

47
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,670
My mother... My mother was taken by him.

48
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,930
That ajussi had that tattoo.

49
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,470
You guys are in the same gang right? Where is my mother?

50
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,090
Who is your mother?

51
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,760
Yeon Hyang. They say that my mother was once a palace maid called Yeon Hyang.

52
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,990
Who did you say? Yeon Hyang?

53
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,930
Yes.

54
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,420
Save me, please save me.

55
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,440
Gil Sun Mi.

56
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,680
He's Gil Sun Mi?

57
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,410
Are you okay?

58
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm so thankful.

59
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,170
But you really look exactly like Gil Tae Mi.

60
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,610
Aside from looking exactly the same, we are totally different.

61
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,680
As expected of Gil Sun Mi.

62
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,310
I can feel his presence even under this cliff.

63
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,900
What did you say?

64
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,880
I am palace maid Yeon Hyang's son.

65
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,890
How can this be...

66
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,560
What I'm about to say right now, keep it in mind.

67
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,460
From today till the day you die, you must not have any interest in your mother.

68
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,510
You must never say the name Yeon Hyang.

69
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,160
Why not?

70
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,390
Your mother is a great traitor against Goryeo.

71
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,520
What?

72
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,580
Because of a mistake your mother made, Princess No Gook died.

73
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,940
Don't try to learn anything else. Just forget it and live.

74
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,170
Is she... even alive?

75
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,170
I don't know, but

76
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:15,260
if you continue to search for your mother, you will die.

77
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:21,120
It will bring a calamity not only to your mother, but to you and all your family.

78
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,130
Everyone will die!

79
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,350
Why? What did we do wrong?

80
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,630
What did my mother do to deserve that?

81
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,990
Is that why those people were trying to kill me?

82
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,580
What? Those people weren't just robbers?

83
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,780
They followed you because they knew about your situation and name?

84
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,720
Yes! They were chasing me.

85
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,100
I told them my name and everything.

86
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,960
You're

87
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,020
already in danger.

88
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,000
By looking for mother, she and Boon Yi are going to die?

89
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,600
What am I supposed to do with this child, Yeon Hyang?

90
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,550
Your swordsmanship is on par with your best-swordsman-in-the-three-kingdoms brother, Gil Tae Mi.

91
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,090
I don't recognize your face. Who are you?

92
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,880
I've come from afar to look for my disciple and I'm...

93
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,650
Seriously?

94
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:43,270
Since we've sparred, it should be believable. Is it not?

95
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,100
Oh no. I give my greetings to my senior.

96
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,990
I'm Gil Sun Mi.

97
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,540
By any chance, do you know this person?

98
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,200
Who is this?

99
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,070
He is my disciple. He came into Goryeo, dueled with someone, and died.

100
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,350
So I suspected your brother and you. But it does not seem so.

101
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,590
If it was a fair duel, then that is just a consequence of being a warrior.

102
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,450
Why are you chasing him with a petty grudge?

103
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,400
It's not to get revenge.

104
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,760
It's just because I'm curious.

105
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,000
I was told that his sword was so fast that without even trading many hits, in one strike,

106
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,040
he (the disciple) lost his life, unable to even scream.

107
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,590
If you are truly the owner of the name that I know,

108
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,180
I heard that you would put your life on repaying one's kindness and keeping a promise.

109
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,390
Of course. Why do you ask?

110
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,960
I think I have an idea who the person your disciple dueled with is.

111
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,000
If I tell you about that, will you listen to my request?

112
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,990
Really. Do you really know who it is?

113
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,130
Will you promise me?

114
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,120
Of course. Tell me. Who is he exactly?

115
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,160
Cheok Sa Gwang

116
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,230
Cheok Sa Gwang?

117
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,970
Do you know the name Cheok Joon Gyung?

118
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:21,410
Of course I do. Even though I came from China, how would one that practices martial arts not know who he is?

119
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,500
Cheok Joon Gyung's Gok San sword art was passed down to his descendants,

120
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,570
and by the fourth generation descendants, that sword art was revived.

121
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,950
That descendant Cheok Sa Gwang disappeared after killing a master in China.

122
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,760
It is only a rumor among warriors, but

123
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,860
I think there is a good chance of it being true.

124
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,360
Thank you so much.

125
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,490
But what was the request you were going to make?

126
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,580
That kid, please take care of him.

127
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,560
Take care of him?

128
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,660
Just for today?

129
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,010
Then, maybe like a month?

130
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,360
Please protect him until he is safe.

131
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,980
Or until he becomes an adult.

132
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,520
I can trust your name, right?

133
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,230
Hey, I'm someone who keeps his promises, but

134
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,800
I don't really have the time to stay in Goryeo for too long.

135
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,640
So, there are two methods.

136
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,150
First option. Learn martial arts from me.

137
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,580
Then you can protect yourself.

138
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,690
I've no interest in that.

139
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,250
Then how in the world am I going to protect you forever?

140
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,650
I have to return in three years.

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,090
Ugh. Why did I even bring up my name?

142
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,450
What kind of kid doesn't understand what I'm trying to tell him?

143
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,510
Sigh. Just my luck.

144
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,640
Eh? No this can't be.

145
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,210
I have to keep my promise.

146
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Moo Hyul

147
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,340
Yes!!

148
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,110
This is a troubling age...

149
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,650
It's been a troubling age since I was born...

150
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,510
It's getting even more troubling.

151
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,670
Well that's because of the Mongols, the Red Turbans, and the Japanese.

152
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,450
Father and Mother passed way in the midst of it all.

153
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,010
That's why I've come to a conclusion.

154
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,370
Moo Hyul, you need to learn martial arts.

155
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,600
Martial arts?

156
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,150
You've heard of the Gil Tae Mi brothers right? They had nothing,

157
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,500
but with just one sword, now they are living life while farting (living in luxury).

158
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,440
Yes.

159
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,110
That is it.

160
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,510
Other than this, there is no way that all eleven of us can live in these troubling times.

161
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:23,180
But he's only strong. He can't even hold a kitchen knife.

162
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,980
That's why we need that pig.

163
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,010
There's something that I heard.

164
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,830
So take everything you guys have and meet in the front yard.
( Myo Sang, Moo Hyul's Grandmother)

165
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,860
If you hide anything to eat by yourself, you'll be kicked out of this house!

166
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,140
Master!!

167
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,580
We respect you, Master!

168
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,010
Master Hong, you... Former best-swordsman-in-the-three-kingdoms Hong Yoon...

169
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,710
Current best-swordsman-in-the-three-kingdoms Gil Tae Mi...

170
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,860
And Gil Sun Mi, who is on equal footing with Gil Tae Mi...

171
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,330
I heard you taught all of them.

172
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,990
I thought I said not to spread the word. Who... Darn it.

173
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,010
Please turn our Moo Hyul into one of them too.

174
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,970
When he was ten, he used to grab the horn of an ox and pull it.

175
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,380
I am trying to turn my back on swords.

176
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,150
If I were to take in a student again...

177
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,530
Please accept him.

178
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,220
If you would only accept him, the ten of us will

179
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,940
give you anything.

180
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,610
Ha! What to do...

181
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,710
Hey. This...and this Who's going to eat these?

182
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,700
And this black thing. The black beans. Th-This. Take them away.

183
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,100
Thank you. Thank you.

184
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Those had been taken from my little siblings so...

185
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,170
And, if only white rice...

186
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,710
No! No matter what, it's not happening.

187
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,310
White rice!

188
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,690
White rice. Okay, I'll bring it to you.

189
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,550
[White Ri-]
So please accept...

190
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,070
Just one word. Just say one word.

191
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,490
Fine. Every morning, let's learn how to divide up strength by collecting water and wood.

192
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,090
That means—

193
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,920
Okay, what is your name?
 (Master Hong, Moo Hyul's teacher)

194
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,140
I'm Moo Hyul.

195
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,860
Yanggwang-do, Western District Deokjinhyeon

196
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,620
If you suddenly disappeared like that

197
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,840
did you think I would wait forever for you, Mom?

198
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,340
I'm not going to wait for you. I'm not going to.
 Boon Yi

199
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,220
If brother also...

200
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,400
Brother also...

201
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,800
does not come back soon, I'm just going to have a memorial ceremony for both of you.

202
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,700
Boon Yi.

203
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,420
Brother.

204
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:50,380
Brother, why did you come so late?

205
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,100
Why did you come so late?

206
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,600
Do you know how much I waited for you?

207
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,130
I'm sorry.

208
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,120
I'm sorry, Boon. It's my fault, my fault.

209
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,930
What about Mom? What happened to Mom?

210
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,650
I... think I made a mistake.

211
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,390
I think Mother has passed away already.

212
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,870
What did I tell you? Mother...

213
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,990
I was told that the day Mom left should be set as the anniversary date of her death.

214
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,200
Okay, okay. You did well.

215
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,560
Boon Yi.

216
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,830
Yeon Hee Unni.

217
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,690
Brother is back, Brother is back.

218
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,380
Yeon Hee

219
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,750
Not only your mother,

220
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,760
but you and your whole family will suffer calamity.

221
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,790
All of you will die.

222
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,890
She is Goryeo's traitor.

223
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,520
You will end up dying.

224
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,670
Goryeo's traitor.

225
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:25,050
Why did you prepare so much? There's nothing that great about him.

226
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,010
How can you be so uncaring as his sister? He's become so skinny.

227
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,560
Quickly eat.

228
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,110
Yeon Hee Unni stole them from her house to give them to you, Brother.

229
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,310
Thank you.

230
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,220
No, it's not like that.

231
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,920
When I wasn't around,

232
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,990
you were together with Boon Yi every day.

233
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,070
That... Yeah...

234
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,920
I'm really thankful.

235
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,320
I'll go to your house later and greet your parents.

236
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,790
I'll go gather water and wood every day for your parents.

237
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,010
No. You don't have to.

238
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,440
No. I'm doing it because I'm thankful.

239
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,810
When did you even put an egg in there?

240
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,150
For this year's Seventh Moon Festival, Yeon Hee Unni is the star Vega.

241
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,910
Is that so?

242
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,930
Did you decide on who will be the star Altair?

243
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,690
The person you will give the clothes to.

244
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,610
Not yet.

245
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,630
Have you finished making the clothes for Altair yet?

246
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,220
Not yet.

247
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,280
I hate it when the sleeves are too long, so keep that in mind.

248
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,360
What are you talking about?

249
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,930
The person who will get it from Yeon Hee is me.

250
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,810
What are you talking about? I've been water carrier since last month.

251
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,450
It's me.

252
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,200
I told you not to do this.

253
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,960
Yeon Hee. Where are you going?

254
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,670
Yeon Hee, where are you going?

255
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,200
Ddang Sae.

256
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,290
You are thinking about your mother, right?

257
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,330
Boon Yi thinks that you told her everything, but

258
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,850
I knew you would be like this

259
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,050
because you are very affectionate.

260
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,370
I'm...

261
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,270
a coward.

262
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,710
Actually, I...

263
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,250
My mother...

264
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,710
I gave up on her.

265
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,250
No, Ddang Sae. You are not a coward.

266
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,130
It's not your fault or your wrongdoing.

267
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,220
It's just that this world is strange.

268
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,290
During the Seventh Moon Festival,

269
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,440
if you don't accept clothes I make...

270
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,510
I'm not going to be the Vega.

271
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,890
Do Dang (Highest institute of state affairs during late Goryeo era)

272
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,250
Look! Look! Look!

273
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,750
Have you seen anyone so shameless?

274
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,370
For someone low in class,

275
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,580
how are you so shamelessly sitting there?

276
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,340
I got promoted to a higher ranking.

277
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,240
Is class everything?

278
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,860
You are just a lowly being who used to translate the Mongolian language.

279
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,700
What!?

280
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,050
- Lowly being!?
- Yeah, lowly!

281
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,660
If you feel wronged, you should have used more bribes!

282
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,720
Do you know how much th-th-that position costs?

283
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,780
What?

284
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,500
You should all be embarrassed.

285
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,250
The Japanese have invaded Yangkwang-do.
(Baek Yoon)

286
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,270
I don't know about a Japanese invasion... I ought to just...

287
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,810
Stop!

288
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,980
What are you guys doing?!!

289
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,590
The Japanese have crossed the West coast and have pushed up to Yanggwang-do!

290
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,540
As you all know,

291
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:47,280
we need to send soldiers to Yangkwang-do soon as possible.
(Lee In Gyeom)

292
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,510
So, who should go this time?

293
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,000
Since Minister Soong Rok has a long lineage of strong warriors,

294
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,230
this will be an excellent opportunity for him to render great service.

295
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,390
Minister Yeong Rok's soldiers are known for their speed, so

296
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,950
I will pass on this great opportunity to him.

297
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,320
Judging by the size of the Japanese army,

298
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,960
your forces put together won't be enough to face them.

299
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Therefore, you will both have to send out your soldiers

300
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,810
Look here, Prime Minister.

301
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,480
We were deployed last time, during the Japanese invasion in Namjoo.

302
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,670
I have 17 men that were injured.

303
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,910
I, also, in the fierce battle four months ago,

304
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,430
had about half of my men run away.

305
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:43,450
So are you saying you cannot contribute any soldiers?

306
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,780
Ah, well. I'm just saying it should be done fairly.

307
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,380
Fairly.

308
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,850
Here.

309
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:00,170
He, who excels in martial arts, has mighty soldiers, and has abundant wealth,

310
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,600
is right here.

311
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,650
- Me?
- Yes.

312
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,110
Me?

313
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,280
You see, I...
 (Gil Tae Mi)

314
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,470
Recently, there was a flood in my land.

315
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,450
We can only eat porridge!

316
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,960
Why are you like this?

317
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,260
Oh, you!

318
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,990
You own a lot of land around Yanggwang-do, and

319
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,590
that whole area is your base of operations.

320
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,990
I am sorry, but I have nothing to give.

321
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,030
What?

322
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:44,060
When I entered this court, to contribute to my country,

323
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,090
I have already given all of my land and soldiers.

324
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,550
Then, those who received my property should be the ones to go.

325
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,230
I contributed for times like this.

326
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,870
Right? That's what I did.

327
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,010
You are correct.

328
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,770
The national treasury is already depleted,

329
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,420
and the land that should be rewarded for accomplishments

330
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,100
is now gone.

331
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:32,070
If this is not solved, it is the end for both of us.

332
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,240
In-law!

333
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,230
Why don't you start a business?

334
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,180
Business?

335
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,160
A war business.

336
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,490
A war business? What are you talking about, in-law?

337
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,820
Whose nation is this?

338
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,530
Well...

339
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,590
Our nation?

340
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,290
Goryeo, is a nation that belongs to the people.

341
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:11,230
Ah! Brother in-law's old habits are coming back. That's what a scholar usually says.

342
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,870
This war would protect the people from Japanese. Why must this nation carry all of the burden.

343
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,180
If state land is exhausted, you still have land that belongs to the people.

344
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,600
In any region Japanese invade, you can give out land that once belonged to the people

345
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,260
to those men who volunteer.

346
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,490
Since people were saved from the Japanese, there is justification.

347
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,260
If you do that they will be fighting to give you soldiers

348
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,100
for the war effort.

349
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:48,140
Trading the people's land for the war?

350
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,850
Yes, that's right.

351
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,750
Each would competitively want to contribute soldiers.

352
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:59,490
And if that happens, who do you think will make the decisions?

353
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,180
How about you meet them first?

354
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,890
Hong In Bang

355
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,840
This nation was hopeless.

356
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,400
I hope you'll give me a chance to serve Goryeo.

357
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,280
I am thankful, but many have already applied. Yes.

358
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,040
It's getting tiresome now.

359
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:41,500
Yes! Yes! If you can work that out,

360
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,510
out of the land I receive...

361
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,710
This much,

362
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,400
I will give to the Prime Minister to continue the nation's work.

363
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,660
Youngnok Minister who just left...

364
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,640
offered this much.

365
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,270
Then,

366
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:25,840
I'll add this to that.

367
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:34,860
I'll make sure to pass on to the Prime Minister your efforts to contribute to the country.

368
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:11,770
I think we should choose Minister Yeong Rok, Minister Soong Rok, and Minister Gwang Rok.

369
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,750
You may do so.

370
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,750
Indeed, you're awesome.

371
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,210
How is it, Elder?

372
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:26,090
Continue to help us out in the future.

373
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,410
Of course, I will do that.

374
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,690
Hurry and put up stakes and let's go.

375
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,070
Yes, I understand.

376
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,830
Hold it like this.

377
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,670
This land belongs to Soon Yi's family.

378
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,100
You will find out later, but this now belongs to the Prime Minister.

379
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,000
Excuse me? What are you saying?

380
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,140
That, what it means is,

381
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:59,870
from now on you will have to treat me nicely.

382
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,060
Why are you like this?

383
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,400
Well, well. Aren't you growing to be a fine young lady?

384
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,030
What are you doing?

385
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,060
Who are you to come into other people's land and put up wooden posts?

386
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:18,950
From now on this land belongs to Prime Minister Lee In Gyeom.

387
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,140
What? Why would our land suddenly belong to the Prime Minister?

388
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,960
Look here. The Japanese are invading, so the soldiers need to come here.

389
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,410
This is all for paying our soldiers who protect us!

390
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,630
I thought the foreign invaders intruded into another village.

391
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,400
What does that have to do with us?

392
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,470
What?!! This person...

393
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:46,490
Wow, thank you. When did the government help keep out barbarians? Why put on a show now?

394
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,940
You bastards. We'll protect our own village.

395
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,520
Get lost!

396
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,840
You little rascals...

397
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,600
Hey, get them!!

398
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,590
R-R-Run!

399
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,890
Get them!!

400
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,590
Yeon Hee

401
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,450
Wow. It's really good.

402
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,840
What's so good about my stupid brother?

403
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:31,110
Brother!! The clothes came.

404
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,320
Come out quickly!!

405
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,790
Hey, you give them to him. Okay?

406
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,530
You are so lucky!

407
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,190
You are going to wear it nicely.

408
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,340
What? What happened?

409
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:04,320
The workers we sent to the village got attacked and chased out. Also...

410
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,190
So what? What do you want me to do?

411
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,570
You should take care of those things instead of reporting to me!
I've been too lenient.

412
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,420
I'm sorry.

413
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,030
Just go take some of our guys and show them who the boss is.

414
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:26,910
Also, don't report those kinds of things to me. You made me lose appetite for alcohol. Go!

415
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:41,890
After today's Seventh Moon Festival, let our households be peaceful and our children prosper.

416
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,320
Let it rain nicely for a fruitful harvest.

417
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:52,140
And pray that everyone in the village stays safe, without any misfortune.

418
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,790
Put it on her already!

419
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,460
What are you waiting for?

420
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,570
Hurry up!

421
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,090
Put it on her already!

422
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,450
Let's run away, Yeon Hee. Let's run away.

423
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:45,600
Ddang Sae, Ddang Sae, Ddang Sae.
You will be in trouble if you get caught.

424
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,480
Ddang Sae, come quickly. You will be in trouble if you get caught.

425
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,810
You go first. Go first!!
You go first!!

426
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,130
How's it feel? Suits you well after being so bothersome.

427
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:13,080
Ajussi...! Pal Mo Ajussi!

428
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,360
Dude! We were told to teach them a lesson, not kill them!

429
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,540
No, killing them is teaching them a lesson.

430
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,950
Ajussi! Please!

431
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,440
Pal Mo Ajussi...

432
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,910
Oh oh. Don't worry. Don't worry.

433
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,110
As long as you don't resist, I won't kill you.

434
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,230
Hey, hey, hey... What are you doing?

435
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,650
I will be first!

436
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,910
Go.

437
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,470
I said to go.

438
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,770
I don't want to see your face, go.

439
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,750
If I interfered, both Yeon Hee and I would have been killed.

440
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,830
They stabbed Pal Mo Ajussi and killed him!

441
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,980
They were so brutal!

442
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,920
You should've just died together.

443
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,860
Sister Yeon Hee really liked you a lot.

444
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,950
Asleep or awake, she only worried for you!

445
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,400
Hoping you returned safely,

446
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,490
she prayed and prayed!

447
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:06,700
But you wore Yeon Hee's clothes and hid?

448
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:12,410
You should've just died. You should've just died together, you fool!

449
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,200
What are you going to do now?

450
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:40,320
No... Why is this happening?

451
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,590
My child...

452
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,660
Hey kid. Why are you just lying there...

453
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,060
How can this happen?

454
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,690
How are they any different from the Mongols and the Japanese?

455
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,340
What kind of country is this!?

456
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,060
What is this...

457
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,770
Who are you? Why?

458
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,210
Why are you like this?

459
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,580
Who is it?

460
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,280
Mother, run away quickly.

461
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,060
Father...

462
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,990
Mother!! Go and take her away.

463
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,460
I...

464
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,120
There's nothing that I can do.

465
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,300
Whew. Finally, I've found you.

466
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:35,360
Hey kid, what are you doing over there?

467
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,880
You aren't thinking about killing yourself right?

468
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,590
You are trying to kill yourself? Th-That can't happen. With whose permission are you dying?

469
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,060
How dare you try to taint my reputation--

470
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,240
Don't come closer. I'm going to die!

471
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,410
You can't kill yourself. I made a promise to look after you.

472
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,910
That's your thing. It has nothing to do with me!

473
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:04,310
I! I'm going to die!

474
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,540
I wasn't able to protect anyone.

475
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,880
I couldn't protect my mother.
I couldn't protect Yeon Hee either!!

476
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,270
I'm just an idiot who can't do anything!

477
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,720
Then you can't die either.

478
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,340
Do you think it's easy? I'll guarantee you,

479
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,420
you won't die.

480
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,950
Why?

481
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,240
Because you are an idiot.

482
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,090
I told you, right? You won't die.

483
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:04,120
Grandpa, who are you?

484
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,090
Jang. Sam. Bong.

485
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,110
How much can you teach me?

486
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:14,250
A lot!
(Creator of Tai Chi and sword arts and leader of Wudang Sect.)

487
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:46,640
Heo Gang left, and everyone left.

488
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,880
Everyone, while being good and weak,

489
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,660
left.

490
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,600
A poster?

491
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,900
You guys... You guys have lost your minds.

492
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,350
Only the shameless ones remained,

493
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,400
and they won.

494
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,510
When everyone left,

495
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,140
I lost my strength

496
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,350
and I lost my way.

497
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,730
It's tiring.

498
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,140
Stop what you are doing!

499
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,690
I figured they would have understood by now, so I was just about to stop.

500
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,350
Should I return to Ham Ju?

501
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,810
What is that? A person?

502
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,840
Are you Lord Baek Yoon?

503
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,190
I'm Baek Yoon. So what's the matter?

504
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,260
Are you... Lord Baek Yoon?

505
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,500
I said I'm him.

506
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,310
Who are you?

507
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,010
Then, that's fine.

508
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,330
You should've died, you fool.

509
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,950
- Please don't kill me!
- Ah!!!

510
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,840
Lee Bang Ji

511
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,880
What did I just see? What was that?

512
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,860
There's no way.

513
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,080

514
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,830

00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:37,250
Th-This is not Goryeo's map.

518
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,130
No.

519
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:01,160
But, why do you want to kill Baek Yoon?

520
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:07,110
I will end Goryeo.

521
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,580
Assassinate Baek Yoon when the time is right.

522
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:16,010
Kill Baek Yoon and end this rotten Goryeo.

523
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:20,930
New Joseon

524
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:22,930
Just

525
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,110
who made this?

00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,880
Sam Bong, where are you?

529
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,500
Now, who should I kill?

530
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,370
Fourth dragon

531
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,940
Lee Bang Ji: later best-swordsman-in-the-three-kingdoms

532
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:21,790
SIx Flying Dragons

533
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:24,510
Where were you last night? Please reveal the truth!

534
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,430
Are you saying I killed him?

535
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,890
It's a mamushi. It's definitely a mamushi (pit viper).

536
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,450
People say he shows up wherever the Japanese are.

537
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,960
Don't you recognize me? I'm your father.

538
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,920
- What?
- You called me your father.

539
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,320
We cultivated the wastelands but had all of our crops taken.

540
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,360
People were injured and died.

541
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,630
- Are you saying such a horrible thing happened in the village?
- This is against the national law.

542
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,760
It's wrong to break the national law.

543
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,020
I'm going to do something, because as long as I'm alive I have to do something.
