1
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,420
I already informed the Yuan. Our Goryeo soldiers will be crossing the Yalu River.

2
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,680
Let's conquer Liaodong.

3
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,950
Choi Yeong

4
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,680
is going to conquer Liaodong.

5
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,650
Conquering Liaodong? It's impossible.

6
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,340
That can't happen.

7
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,610
Every citizen of Goryeo has dreamed of conquering Liaodong.
(Sam Bong: Jeong Do Jeon)

8
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,760
The previous king was like that, even I was like that.

9
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,670
General Choi Yeong is probably like that too.

10
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,390
But didn't you say that you will do it in the future once you have raised the military power?
(Nam Eun)

11
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,390
An expedition when it's too much to even protect (the country)?
(Lee Bang Won)

12
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,330
This is crazy.

13
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,920
Just what are you saying?

14
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,120
Are you telling me to go on an expedition war in Liaodong?

15
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,410
That's right.

16
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,650
His Highness and I are set on this.

17
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,910
No matter how I think about it, it's impossible.

18
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,480
If all the soldiers get drafted, then what will we do about this year's farming?

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,180
The military provisions are the same. What are we going to do when the first wheat harvest hasn't come yet?
(Moo Hyul)

20
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,530
Yes. Even during the first Liaodong expedition done by General Lee Seong Gye,

21
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,240
all the wars that have been won still failed because of the lack of military provisions. Military troops were discharged in the fall season.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,660
Then, in the fall... Please push it to fall.

23
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,100
After the harvest when there is an abundance of provisions for the army.
(Lee Seong Gye)

24
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,630
It has to be right now when 150,000 of Ming's soldiers are away at Great Yuan.

25
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,330
What about the military provisions?

26
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,360
Say that we seize Liadong. Will there be enough supplies for 50,000 soldiers?

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
For now, take possession of Liaodong and provisions will be obtained on site.
(Choi Yeong)

28
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,310
The military's march will be hard, and the glue on the bows will melt.

29
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,750
And a contagious disease will take over the army.

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,650
Isn't that the same for the Ming?

31
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,170
They are in their home town and it's a military expedition for us.

32
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,670
Yes, yes. I heard your words well. General Lee's words make sense as well.

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,210
However,
(King U; 32nd ruler of Goryeo.)1

34
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:25,320
Because of the Ming's unfair requests, the people are outraged as well.

35
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,790
If we fight with the same heart right now,

36
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,650
won't we be able to stop the tedious submission we've been forced into?

37
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,990
So, please follow my intentions, General Lee.

38
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,470
General Lee, the King is asking you a question. Give him an answer.

39
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,400
Your Majesty.

40
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,200
This... cannot happen.

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,900
What?

42
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,990
I, Lee Seong Gye, am fearlessly speaking

43
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,640
with my head bowed down to you, Your Majesty.

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,110
Above all, it does not make sense for a small country to strike back at a bigger country.

45
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,340
What?!

46
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,370
No matter what the outcome is, General Lee will receive tremendous damage.

47
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,870
Even if he wins?

48
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,850
Even if we win, we will lose half of the army.

49
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,510
No, even a half will be a relief.

50
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,780
Also, if we win we will be stuck in Liaodong.

51
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,230
That's correct. Liaodong is a land that is harder to defend than to overtake.

52
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,070
Truthfully, the war will not end in any circumstances.

53
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,110
Yes, unless we are trying to conquer the Chinese continent.

54
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,010
General Lee will be the Ming's enemy and will be harassed for his entire life.

55
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,020
Is that what General Choi was aiming for?

56
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,160
No, for General Choi Young it's only a strong belief he has.

57
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,690
Therefore, there would be no compromise at all.

58
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,320
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?!

59
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,280
A small country cannot attack a bigger country?

60
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:25,350
Although we are smaller to the Ming, we are the great Goryeo that has received vigor from Goguryeo.

61
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,710
We are the descendants of the Goguryeo that made the Sui and Tang countries, that unified the continent, fear them.

62
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,760
When did Goguryeo conquer the Sui country?

63
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,890
When did Goguryeo conquer the Tang country?

64
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,080
To that big country, Goguryeo's spirit and vigor

65
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,090
will not surrender even a foot's distance of the country.

66
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,130
Isn't this just putting the people in misery through a thoughtless conquest?

67
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,850
What?!

68
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,820
General.

69
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,980
Then are you saying that I am a king that put his people in misery with my thoughtless conquest?

70
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,620
Your Majesty, if the Ming do take over the northwest part of Goryeo,

71
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:28,080
I, like Yang Man Choon and Eul Ji Moon, with my life will defeat the enemies.
(Yang and Eul-great generals that stopped the Sui and Tang country)

72
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,210
- But the conquest of Liadong...
- This man still!

73
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,710
Your Majesty, please calm down.

74
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,860
General Lee, how is a general who has never lost showing such a weak side?

75
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,190
I have not won all my fights.

76
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,600
What do you mean? You have never lost.

77
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,270
At the year 1370. Yes, I have conquered Liadong.

78
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,820
We crossed the Yalu river and from Pasabo

79
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,120
to Yoyang Haengsung, we won all our fights.

80
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,110
But, what happened after the conquest?

81
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,650
Because of the cold in Liaodong, we ran out of provisions and the supplies stopped coming over.

82
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,120
We had to make an absurd retreat.

83
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,800
Therefore, there were only 60 men who died in the war, but

84
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,920
while retreating there were more than four thousand men who died from hunger.

85
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,410
Men who should have gone home to their mothers as decorated heroes after winning the war,

86
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,230
I had to give them back as thousands of corpses.

87
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,110
How can that be considered a victory?

88
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,220
For a great achievement, there has to be sacrifice.

89
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,730
Do not think of the soldiers who will be sacrificed in the Liaodong conquest.

90
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,870
Think of the many more descendants who will live on after we conquer Liaodong.

91
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,230
There is truly no greed in General Choi's heart, but

92
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,630
he also has no concern for the people. He has no heart for

93
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,990
each and every soldier.

94
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,720
By this, Is my dream going to end?

95
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,760
If not...

96
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:33,300
By this, is this the beginning of a terrible disaster for the people?

97
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,770
Finally, is this how a revolution is going to start?

98
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,730
Park Ui Joong was nominated to go to Ming as an envoy.

99
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,340
There was also a message that an envoy from the Ming is coming to Gaegyeong right now.

100
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,960
You take care of it, but before that,

101
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,390
there is an important announcement.

102
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,110
Right now, the King of Ming, is insisting on

103
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,040
holding the authority over the Northern land of Cheollyeong.

104
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:39,700
Our Highness' decision is that he will not accept any disrespectful request from the Ming.

105
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,400
Therefore, from this point on, the Ming

106
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,570
will be declared Goryeo's enemy.

107
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,340
Also, we are chastising the confident Ming,

108
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:56,240
and in order to gain our sovereignty and status,

109
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,890
we are going to conquer Liaodong.

110
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,390
- Wait, what?!
- What are you talking about, Lord?

111
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,480
You said an envoy is coming from the Ming!

112
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,540
- What kind of nonsense is this?! 
- What..

113
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,250
What do you mean about a war with the strong Ming country?

114
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,720
That is nonsense!

115
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:22,610
General! What is all this without any discussion in the Do Dang?

116
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,180
Conquering Liaodong? A war?

117
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,780
Messages were already sent to the five cities, and soon there will be 50,000 soldiers gathering in Seogyeong (today's Pyung Yang).

118
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,800
How can you secretly make a national decision like this?

119
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,780
In any time or place, where would you find a war that has not been secretly prepared?

120
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,500
What about the provisions? What about all those military provisions?

121
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,120
We are going to use the money we took from Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi for the military.

122
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,240
What about the food supplies?
It's a war that is happening far away.

123
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,780
Yes, there is still a long time until the harvest.

124
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,980
If there is a shortage of food supplies, we can just get them on the spot.

125
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,440
We just have to quickly conquer the Liaodong fortress and then take care of the public sentiment.

126
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,960
On top of that, 50,000?

127
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,180
If you take all of the strong young men in the country,

128
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,060
who is going to farm

129
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,840
and who is going to stop the Japanese pirates?

130
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,160
How dare you complain about His Majesty's orders?!

131
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,420
The preparations for conquering LIaodong have already been completed.

132
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,540
There will be not another discussion about this matter in the Do Dang again.

133
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,960
I mean, what kind of ruckus is this?

134
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,100
Truthfully, this doesn't make sense at all.

135
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,550
The saved food supplies will be gone even before the 50,000 soldiers reach Liaodong.

136
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,880
This cannot happen.

137
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,590
We'll quickly gather the Confucians and discuss this and send up a memorandum to the king.

138
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,960
If General Choi is not senile, how can he make a decision like this?

139
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,860
Hong In Bang and Gil Tae Mi's property is not even close to being enough for the military.

140
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,430
After that, who is he going to get more money from?

141
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,240
Well that, probably from the people.

142
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,940
Where do you think our possessions come from?

143
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,700
This is not the time for us to be here like this.

144
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,540
Quickly send a message to Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom.

145
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,120
Aigo, what help can we receive from someone who lost his position?

146
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,760
General Choi's earlier threat to us

147
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,460
was not exaggerated.

148
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,760
Ah, aish...

149
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,180
I thought General Choi was someone who knew about war, so how can he do this?

150
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,290
How can we take away 50,000 soldiers when the Japanese pirates are finally quieting down?

151
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,370
We will be stepped on by the Japanese pirates who have been saving their strength.

152
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,540
Even during King Gong Min, when there were less Japanese pirates, it was a conquest we gave up.

153
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,720
But a conquest while we have Japanese pirates at our backs?

154
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,090
Older brother, this is too much.

155
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,960
Also, back then, Liaodong did not really have a true owner.

156
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,270
But now our opponent is the Ming. We cannot do this, Father.

157
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,240
I have already said everything I could.

158
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:28,240
But, a soldier has to take a command if it's given.

159
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,860
And you men and I are this country's soldiers.

160
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,470
There is no words from Sam Bong yet?

161
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,890
No, not yet.

162
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,330
Do you know Tai Gong Wang Lu Shang?
(A strategist who met King Wen while wishing and then raised a country)

163
00:13:53,330 --> 00:14:00,280
Isn't he an angler? You think I do not know that you were imitating him these past days?

164
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,800
He is first man in history to change the king.

165
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,840
Twenty-five hundred years ago he was passing the time with his straight fishing hook,

166
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
even past his seventies.

167
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,130
So what?
(Lee Bang Ji)

168
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,880
"Because of this war everything we have been preparing for has gone back to zero.

169
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,060
So now I am going to wait for the time."

170
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,620
Is it something like that?

171
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,320
No.

172
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,170
The longer I hold this fishing rod,

173
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:40,460
I only gain the thought that I am not even close to that angler.

174
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,620
But why did the angler use a straight fishing hook?

175
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,220
He said that a bent fishing hook only tricks the world.

176
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,120
Then, how many did he catch with the straight fishing hook?

177
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,080
He probably could not catch any.

178
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,820
Even 2500 years ago or right now,

179
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,140
isn't the outcome the same? You cannot catch anything with this.

180
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,140
Tell everyone to gather immediately.

181
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,570
So?

182
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,330
Our general's voice was loud and clear ,even outside the tent,

183
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,850
that conquering Yo Dong cannot happen.

184
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,840
It even seemed like His Majesty wielded his sword.

185
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, from outside I was like, "Do I have to go in?"

186
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,370
Oh, then it's a treason. What do I do?

187
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,310
Ah, our general... What to do?

188
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,120
Uh, oh, uh... I was like that and

189
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,960
got ten years older.

190
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,860
Anyhow, our general's family's archery skills are amazing.

191
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,580
What about the teacher? Is he still at the fishing place?

192
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,490
Yes, it is already been five days.

193
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:23,090
What the... Even if he loves fishing that much, how can he in a situation like this?

194
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,350
- Let's go.
- Pardon?

195
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,600
Call brother Nam Eun and Lee Shin Jeok for me as well.

196
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,680
Where are you going?

197
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,490
Yo. (added formal ending)

198
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,760
The time is finally coming.

199
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,060
We have all come from to your call.

200
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,950
Did you catch a lot of fish?

201
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,670
Bang Ji was saying that the angler seems like a crazy person.

202
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,860
So? Did you make up your mind?

203
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,390
I could not catch anything with a straight hook.

204
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,710
In the end the angler could not gain anything from fishing.

205
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:27,370
He got up from the fishing place and met the king and raised the country.

206
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,540
So are we carrying out our plan?

207
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,580
Yes, it's revolution.

208
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,640
You guys gather all our men and announce my words.

209
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,280
Yes.

210
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,420
Boon Yi with all the messengers get ready for the things that will happen later on.

211
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,520
Yes.

212
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,380
Bang Won you make sure you bring General Lee Ji Ran and Bang Gwah in on this and move all the soldiers.

213
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,760
Yes, Teacher.

214
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,660
But, the result of this depends on General Lee.

215
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,900
In any situation, the general has to be determined.

216
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,320
Everyone be perfectly prepared.

217
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,340
Without General Lee's cooperation we are not taking a single action.

218
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,410
Do you understand?

219
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

220
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,810
This is what you mentioned.

221
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,510
I have gathered information on the people who can lead an army from General Lee's people.

222
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,970
If you give this to Boon Yi, she will get their whereabouts.

223
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,020
Yes.

224
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,880
You will have to do the finishing.

225
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,950
Are you talking about Choi Young?

226
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,020
In an situation l like this, talented soldiers will protect him.

227
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,480
You will have the soldiers behind you so you surely have to catch him alive.

228
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,500
Please do not worry.

229
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,210
A revolution?

230
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,660
So? What do you want me to do?

231
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,560
We''ll have to to catch General Choi and get the king's document

232
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,240
and stop the war.

233
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:30,080
If we attend this war, Ga Byeol Cho and father is definitely done for.

234
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,950
It's not only the older brother.

235
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,670
This country, this country is going to done for.

236
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:43,270
So the two of you have to move the soldiers in Ham Joo.

237
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,310
There was already a message sent Suh Kyung so there won't be any suspicion.

238
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,350
Gather the soldiers, pretend to go back to Suh Kyung, and stay on Gok mountain.

239
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,910
When you receive the signal move southwards to Gaegyeong

240
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,010
and drive into to the Man Wul fortress.

241
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,930
Bang Won ah,

242
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,210
did older brother decide on this?

243
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,510
Please do not worry about that.

244
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,710
We are not moving at all without Father's confirmation.

245
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,530
That is the decision of teacher Sam Bong.

246
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,050
Teacher Sam Bong is probably on his way to meet father.

247
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,430
For a great achievement, sacrifices must be made.

248
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,520
Do not think about the soldiers who will be sacrificed in the Yo Dong conquest, but

249
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,840
think about the many descendants who will live on after we conquer Yo Dong.

250
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,380
He's not the General Choi Young that I know.

251
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,170
The country we're trying to make is a country that General Choi Young can not be a part of.

252
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,880
General Choi Young is part of a strong family.

253
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,580
Is what Sam Bong said really true?

254
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,010
Do I have to stand as the leader in a war in which

255
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,020
numerous people and soldiers will die?

256
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,040
What should I do, Sam Bong?

257
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,870
Mister Sam Bong.

258
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,880
Where are you coming from?

259
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,710
Father has been looking for you.

260
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:36,010
I just went to clear my head for a moment.

261
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,320
In this country a big disaster has happened.

262
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,530
What am I suppose to do?

263
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,940
You do seem to be urgent.

264
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,410
How can you laugh right now?

265
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,830
Do you not understand the situation?

266
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,310
Is there really no way to stop this terrible disaster?

267
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,380
Please speak. Do you have a strategy or not?

268
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,290
No, did you have me hold on to a strategy?

269
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,010
It seems like you have a strategy.

270
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,500
Yes, I do have a strategy.

271
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,320
No, it's not even a strategy but something very simple,

272
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,860
since it all depends on your determination.

273
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,510
What is that?

274
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,300
If I can stop this terrible disaster, what resolution can I not make?

275
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,650
Will you become the

276
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,810
king of a new country?

277
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,430
If you decide not to be the new king, this strategy is of no use.

278
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,500
If you do not decide to become the new king, this strategy will just remain history

279
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,480
and give us a bad reputation.

280
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,800
Please speak up.

281
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,890
What is that strategy?

282
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,960
It's rebellion.

283
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,570
We'll mount a surprise attack against General Choi Young and capture him.

284
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,360
You will have to meet the king with your soldiers,

285
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,220
and you just have to get his letter that states Choi Young's crime.

286
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,150
If we catch Choi Young, in this country

287
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,170
there is no other person who has the willpower to start a war like this.

288
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,680
Yes...

289
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,540
There will be some blood lost.

290
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,040
That is why I said we have to take General Choi's position away from him.

291
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,040
That's what I told you.

292
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,750
But, the blood we will lose from this is

293
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,750
very minimal compared to the amount we'll lose in a war.

294
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,490
So in the end, it's rebellion?

295
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,870
If you become the king of the new country, it's an establishment.

296
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,200
What will you do?

297
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,000
Give me some time.

298
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,130
You'll have to give me an answer before we leave to Suh Kyung

299
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,500
I...

300
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,950
have not seen any other man in Goryeo who has the potential to be a king more than you.

301
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,290
You have power, are righteous,

302
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,070
and care about the people.

303
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,590
Will you become the king of the new country?

304
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,400
I...

305
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,030
Can I...

306
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,170
The date and time we are going to Yo Dong

307
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,080
is the 18th of April.

308
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,510
Why did you do that

309
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,420
to excellency Lee Ja Sung?

310
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,240
You also know very well who he is

311
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,400
and that he has no connection with Gil Tae Mi.

312
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,920
In order to close everyone's mouth about the conquest of Yo Dong

313
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,200
you chose excellency Lee Ja Sung as an example.

314
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,340
Why don't you do that to me as well?

315
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,110
I, no matter what you do,

316
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:01,740
will have to stop this war that puts everyone in danger.

317
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,090
The war has already started.

318
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,000
We have already slaughtered 21 Ming soldiers who were setting up a place in preparation to take over

319
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,180
the northern part of the land.

320
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,870
A message regarding this is probably already reached the Ming.

321
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,950
I will not surrender to any kind of demand they make, and

322
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,850
if someone tells me to surrender, I'll also consider him my enemy.

323
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:43,400
Goryeo army groups will be assigned to me, Choi Yeong, General Jo Min Soo

324
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,900
and General Lee Seong Gye.

325
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,120
Also, all the recruited 50,000 soldiers

326
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,910
will gather in Seogyeong (Pyeongyang).

327
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,020
Pardon?

328
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,680
What did you just say?

329
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,000
After Lee Seong Gye leaves to Yo Dong

330
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,310
I said do not let any of his people leave the house or communicate with people outside.

331
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,440
But—

332
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,850
It's not an arrest but just a prohibition.

333
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:25,490
So, thoroughly determine the whereabouts of his people.

334
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,380
Do you not trust General Lee Seong Gye?

335
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,410
It's not that I do not trust him.

336
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,920
I am trying to protect him from any temptation he might receive.

337
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,070
In the end, is there no other way?

338
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Aigo, Moo Hyul! Moo Hyul!

339
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,320
Moo Hyul, we don't need any success or anything.

340
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,640
Just take your brothers and run away.

341
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,270
Do you understand? You have to save your life, you rascal.

342
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,400
Grandma, I fight very well and I'm also a Ga Byeol Cho.

343
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,560
I can't leave. I'm not running away.

344
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,670
A man has to have pride. I'm also not running away.

345
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,930
Then, me either.

346
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,540
This rascal, this rascal...

347
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:01,760
Your grandfather, your dad. They all died in the battlefield.

348
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,190
But if you guys also die in the battlefield...

349
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,320
How can you do this to me?!

350
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,400
Just run away no matter what. You cannot do this.

351
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,420
Please calm down.
(Hong Dae Hong)

352
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,200
It's because they are still young that they do not know how scary a war is.

353
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,500
No, No. Just take your brothers and run away.

354
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,930
Grandma, it's okay..

355
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,730
No, please don't go!

356
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,000
That war...

357
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,940
Is everything set?

358
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,490
- Yes.
- Yes.

359
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,640
Moo Hyul and I will go to Choi Young's man, Ahn So's, house

360
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,350
and keep Ga Byeol Cho troop two on standby.

361
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,700
I also will go to Choi Young's man, In Won Bo's, house and have troop 3 ready

362
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,500
and wait for your signal.

363
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,160
Lee Bang Ji.

364
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,070
You will have troop 1 as your support at Choi Young's house.

365
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,830
I will watch over the actions of officials, rank 4 and above, and I will report it back.

366
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,480
If there is any strange or suspicious activity,

367
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,740
I'll report immediately.

368
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,690
Who is in charge of opening the fortress gate?

369
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,600
Young Gyu is in charge of that.

370
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,440
If we open the gate, General Lee Ji Ran's Ham Ju Ga Byeol Cho's army will come inside Man Wyul.

371
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,970
I got it. Then I'll go meet General Lee Seong Gye.

372
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,020
If the plan is canceled, a white horse will run by,

373
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,150
and if it's a go, a black horse will run by.

374
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,980
Without the general's confirmation nothing can happen.

375
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,120
If the white horse runs by

376
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,150
You guys cannot do anything.

377
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

378
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,540
Ahn So's house

379
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,160
In Won Bo's house

380
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,230
Choi Young's house

381
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,420
Did you make up your mind?

382
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,220
In general Choi's house, Ahn So's house, In Won Bo's house,

383
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:48,150
the market, the gate, and in other places in Gae Kyung. All these places are stationed with people.

384
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,650
What do you mean about that?

385
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:56,520
Didn't I tell you? The strategy is frontal attack. Everything is ready.

386
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,490
Why when I did not make any decision?

387
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:04,620
Yes. If you do not decide everything will be canceled.

388
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,540
If you agree on it tonight a black horse will run by, and

389
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,220
if you do not agree on it, a white horse will run by and will let them know your decision.

390
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:21,600
If you nod your head, today, this country's history will change.

391
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,240
What is your decision?

392
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,530
Is it the black horse or the white horse?

393
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:41,180
Is it going to be a new establishment or conquering Yo Dong?

394
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,250
My decision is...

395
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,490
Father, the conquest of Yo Dong cannot happen.

396
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,400
Please, it has to be the black horse.

397
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,930
How did it go?

398
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,870
It's that horse.

399
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,490
- Master.
- What?

400
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,290
They're coming, close.

401
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:27,990
Sam Bong, when you talked about the country you were trying to make

402
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,580
my heart also started racing.

403
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:37,010
But, if I become that country's leader and protect that country,

404
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,070
I wonder how happy will I be.

405
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:45,880
Yes, I am a person only up to that caliber.

406
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,230
More than the cause, and the people,

407
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:53,020
I treasure my family and the people inside my boundaries more.

408
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,680
I'm just a regular person.

409
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:04,970
A king is suppose to take care of his people first.

410
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,750
But, my decision will always be my family.

411
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,840
Sam Bong you will probably say that other Kings are like that as well.

412
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:21,040
However, if everyone was like that, what a revolution would that be?

413
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,840
I'm sorry, Sam Bong.

414
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,960
Grandma, I'm alright! Please don't worry so much.

415
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,620
Take care of your younger siblings.

416
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:50,850
Grandma, don't worry. I'll take good care of them. I will also be back with more merits.

417
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,440
Moo Hyul! You have to come back alive.

418
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,260
Take care of your younger brothers! Take care of them!

419
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,420
Seo Kyung

420
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,990
After King Tae Jo built this country,

421
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:33,250
for this past 100 years there was no other time in history where we were as submissive and such a disgrace to the country.

422
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:39,840
But history, in the end, is not written by the times but by the people.

423
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,690
Our Goryeo's 50,000 soldiers,

424
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:54,020
in the year 1388, in April, from this point on

425
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,580
will write a new history of the great Goryeo.

426
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,230
Long live Goryeo!

427
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,690
Long live for the Goryeo soldiers!

428
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,040
Long live!

429
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,610
- Long live!
- Long live!

430
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,400
- Long live!
- Long live!

431
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,950
- Long live!
- Long live!

432
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,490
- Long live!
- Long live!

433
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,760
- Long live!
- Long live!

434
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,200
- Long live!
- Long live!

435
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,610
- Long live Goryeo!
- Long live!

436
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,470
What's the matter?

437
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:51,760
There are deserters from the soldiers that are not from Ga Ga Byeol Cho.

438
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,510
What do you mean deserters?

439
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,100
How are they running away even before we enter the battlefield?

440
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,370
Make Ga Byeol Cho clearly aware of everything and form a group to catch the deserters.

441
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,890
Yes.

442
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,980
Brother, I am not afraid of the war. But...

443
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,490
We can win. Speed up the march.

444
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:20,520
If we make our first base in Ahn Ju, and charge on, then we can win.

445
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,390
If we receive the supplies at the right time, it's a war we can win.

446
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,970
Didn't I say I need some time to think?

447
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,690
You have been just thinking for several days already.

448
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,640
The soldiers are already up to the Yalu river.

449
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,220
Then what do you want to do?

450
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,160
Father is someone who can never betray someone.

451
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:51,760
So, whether it is the betrayal of General Choi or Goryeo,

452
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,870
we have to do it for him.

453
00:39:54,870 --> 00:40:00,330
Even if we do everything for him, I already told you that we cannot make the determination for him.

454
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,290
What can we when his determination is only that much?

455
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,260
There's a huge problem!

456
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,960
The people that were left behind in Lee Seong Gye's house have all disappeared.

457
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,650
It seems like they have been arrested and are held in a certain place.

458
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:24,240
I know that you are in shock because we suddenly brought you guys here, but it's not something you have to worry about.

459
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,500
There was a special request from General Choi to

460
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,350
take care of the family of General Lee who is at Yo Dong.

461
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:36,460
It's a hostage situation. The situation over there is not good.

462
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,000
Now we cannot see the future.
(Min Da Kyung-future Queen Wongyeong)

463
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,950
What's happening? What do we do about it?

464
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,420
This place can be smaller and more uncomfortable than your house, but

465
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,080
until General Lee comes back, we will protect you and ensure your safety.

466
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,320
Brother!

467
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,160
The beggar group guys told me that General Lee's family were all taken away,

468
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,900
so I came because I was worried about you and it was like this already.

469
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,120
What about Boon Yi?

470
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,470
They didn't see Boon Yi?

471
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:43,860
Whether it was family or not they took everyone.

472
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,830
There were no movements even in the morning...

473
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:55,420
They said because of the continuous rainfall the Yalu river bloated up so they are stuck in Yi Ha Do...

474
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,820
Choi Young has taken the family hostage in order to move the army.

475
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,860
Why didn't I think of that?

476
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,170
You should not move around like this either.

477
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,350
It's the same for you as well.

478
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,550
What do you mean we cannot return to Gaegyeong?

479
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:27,200
You guys are in the troop to protect His Highness.

480
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,360
Eun Yang is in charge of guarding. What do you mean a different troop?

481
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,480
We have to go to Gaegyeong where our families are.

482
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,470
Nothing will happen if you only do as we say.

483
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,960
Wi Hwa Island

484
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,230
No. Gu Ddol Ah.

485
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,750
Gu Ddol, It's your older brother! Come back to your senses!

486
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,740
Gu Ddol! Gu Ddol!

487
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,540
You're okay.

488
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,160
This really does not make sense.

489
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,560
How can we put a stake in the river in a situation like this?

490
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,340
How can we put up a temporarily bridge?

491
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:47,860
I said they already sent them the message twice that the march is no longer possible.

492
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,740
But they keep pushing us to do it, what can we do about it?

493
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:00,500
While trying to put a stake on the river, more hundred men in Troop 1 died,

494
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,130
when we did not even see the enemy...

495
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:09,430
We couldn't even retrieve the corpses. They all went down river.

496
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,430
No, what are you saying?

497
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,000
They still haven't crossed the Yalu river yet?

498
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,220
Because of daily torrential rain that causes the water in the Yalu River to flood, the river-crossing attempts continue to fail.

499
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,000
Didn't we already expect all of that?

500
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,120
Every time we get a report, there's always a serious problem appearing. They must cross the river.

501
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,200
But if the soldiers will suffer from unreasonably crossing the river...

502
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:40,380
If it gets too late and they can't secure a supply line, they will suffer more than that.

503
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,520
Damn it!

504
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,640
Could Lee Seong Gye be having different thoughts?

505
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,320
This won't do. I need to see the king.

506
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,760
I need to send the royal command to the inspector to encourage them to advance.

507
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,620
We failed again.

508
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,770
The others were the same.

509
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:11,060
The current is too strong so we couldn't drive in the posts.

510
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:14,200
And yet, the number of soldiers who have fallen into the water...

511
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,800
The number of soldiers... is unknown.

512
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,350
Even now, the numbers keep on changing.

513
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:32,560
Isn't military provision a problem? The deadline for us to cross the river has already passed.

514
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,840
Wasn't the original plan to seize Liaodong and gather provisions on site?

515
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:45,160
At this rate, even if we cross the river, it will be hard to get supplies.

516
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,210
Because we were dispatched at a time when the harvest is not yet ripe,

517
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,750
isn't that obvious?

518
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,150
Genereal, an epedemic is going around.

519
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:00,170
For now, we have found those who are affected and isolated them

520
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,030
but it is spreading at an alarming rate.

521
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:09,490
Can you not request a withdrawal?

522
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,210
What is it this time?

523
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,910
Why are you doing this?

524
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,510
General. You need to withdraw the troops.

525
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,590
We tried to withdraw twice

526
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,090
but the king said we could not.

527
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:41,040
Without acknowledging the royal command, please withdraw the troops, General.

528
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:50,720
At this rate, even if we succeed to cross the Yalu River and arrive into Liaodong, among the 50,000 soldiers,

529
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,180
there will be only half of them left to fight.

530
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,810
Even before we start the battle, we will lose.

531
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:58,780
We can't!

532
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,190
All of the general's family members

533
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:08,970
in Gaegyeong and Seogyeong are held hostage.

534
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,360
If we disobey the royal command,

535
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:22,200
all of the general's family members will die. That's what I'm saying.

536
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,980
Han Nom, Han Nom. Han Nom!

537
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,950
Han Nom!

538
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,920
Han Nom...

539
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,430
Han Nom...

540
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,920
Han Nom!

541
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,110
Are you crazy? Move!

542
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,690
He's my brother. My brother...

543
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,300
Do you also want to catch the plague?

544
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,370
I don't care. Han Nom!

545
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:05,290
We all appear to be thinking that each of us is dying.

546
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:10,410
Move back. There are a lot of people here who feel the same way you do.

547
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:19,310
Hyung... Don't worry. They said they will give me medicine.

548
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:26,000
If I take the medicine, I'll get better. Don't worry.

549
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,090
But Han Nom...

550
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,980
What is this...

551
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,680
Something like this...

552
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,260
Why is something like this called war?

553
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,390
It is war.

554
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:49,260
This here is war.

555
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:00,050
Aren't you Hanbusa Kim? Are you here with the royal command?

556
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,470
Do you have an answer from His Highness?

557
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:11,010
That's right. General Lee Seong Gye, receive the royal command.

558
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:25,170
His Higness ordered that you must immediately cross the Yalu River

559
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,150
and advance to Liaodong.

560
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:33,730
To send you the King's encouragement for your advancement to cross the river, I came all the way here.

561
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,250
How is it that you're still doing nothing here?

562
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,330
You were supposed to cross the river before the 7th,

563
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,200
so if you are not having different thoughts

564
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,980
why are you being like this?

565
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,610
Go out and look at the condition of the Yalu River before you say that.

566
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:59,600
Because of the plan to cross the river, many soldiers have already died.

567
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,940
General Choi Yeong told me to relay this to you.

568
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:11,280
"There's no battlefield with no hardships."

569
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,300
General.

570
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,130
General.

571
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:22,150
What happened?

572
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:26,460
The Ga Byeol Cho has caught deserters again.

573
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,800
The number of deserters is increasing.

574
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,460
I think you should make a decision now.

575
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,200
You bastards!

576
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,330
Leaving your comrades behind,

577
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:17,090
did you escape to just save yourselves?

578
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,670
You will be punished...

579
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,440
You will be punished

580
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,780
and it will be an example of stern the royal command is.

581
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,040
Execute them!

582
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,320
I got dragged while boiling porridge without knowing the reason why.

583
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,610
Please send me back to my hometown.

584
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,810
Forget it! Just kill me!

585
00:51:55,810 --> 00:52:01,080
Anyway, whether it's from the plague or from running away,

586
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,250
it is obvious the we will die without even fighting the enemy.

587
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,330
To get rid of the Yeojin tribe or the Ming, I volunteered and came here

588
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:12,720
but what is this?

589
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:32,450
What are you doing?

590
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,320
Hurry and execute them according to the military law.

591
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,360
Hurry and cut their heads off!

592
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,230
Look at this bastard.

593
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,970
You bastard! Just what are you doing?

594
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,660
Put down your sword this instant!

595
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,720
I can't.

596
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,840
Why are we traitors?

597
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,150
Those honorable bastards are not traitors so why

598
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,080
am only I, who is powerless, the traitor?

599
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,910
Chung Gil, you!

600
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:17,670
Are you going to betray me after disobeying the army?

601
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,020
The betrayal

602
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,560
is by you, General

603
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,690
What?

604
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:31,030
When you saved me who pretended

605
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:34,190
to be a Japanese pirate to save my son,

606
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,780
what did you say, General?

607
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,930
Not just my own children but other people's children and families as well.

608
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:45,330
You told me to stay in the Ga Byeol Cho to save them all.

609
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,040
But what is this?

610
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,000
The 50,000 people here are someone else's sons.

611
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,820
To these people, there are a a total of 100,000 mothers and fathers.

612
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:05,870
If we continue this war, you will take 50,000 children to those 100,000 parents.

613
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:08,330
What are you going to do with the blood and tears

614
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,870
that you're being like this?

615
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,430
Kill me.

616
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,980
I cannot

617
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,730
kill these people.

618
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:38,920
What are you doing? Immediately arrest this person!

619
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,410
General.

620
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:56,230
I honestly didn't know that night.

621
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,440
But now I do.

622
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,910
On that night!

623
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:07,130
The horse that you set out in Gaegyeong

624
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:10,370
should not have been the white horse

625
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:12,800
but the black horse.

626
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,580
General.

627
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,140
My siblings...

628
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,920
Please save my siblings.

629
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,650
The younger and older brothers who came here to Wihwa Island,

630
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:49,520
please save them, General!

631
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,340
Just what are you doing?

632
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:05,900
Arrest these people and immediately kill them.

633
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,560
How can the army, that is supposed to lead, be doing this?

634
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:15,700
General, the 'Guk' character in country

635
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:20,460
is made up of the characters, spear, land, and people.
(protecting the land and people with a spear)

636
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,710
This is a country.

637
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:27,650
If you put the 'Guk' character of country with this one,

638
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:32,420
it transforms into 'by protecting the land and the people with a spear, you gain family.'

639
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,850
This is a nation.

640
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,500
General!

641
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,710
Immediately enact military discipline and execute them. Hurry!

642
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,660
Wife,

643
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,950
Hyung-nim...

644
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:59,540
Bang Woo, Bang Gwa, Bang Ui,

645
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,110
Why are you being like this?

646
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:05,690
Bang Gan, Bang Won, Bang Beon, Bang Seok...

647
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,620
My children...

648
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,970
Hyung-nim...

649
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:20,020
If we disobey the royal command, all of the General's family members will die.

650
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,920
That's what I'm saying.

651
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,850
Isn't a king supposed to take care of the people first?

652
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:32,770
But my choice will always be my family.

653
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,100
I'm sorry...

654
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,930
I

655
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,310
will do it like this.

656
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,920
If you can't do it, then I will!

657
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,500
Stop!

658
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,720
Immediately arrest Kim Hwan,

659
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,610
Yes!

660
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,050
What?

661
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,650
I, Lee Seong Gye!

662
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,540
If you spread your fence around the whole country,

663
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,590
that is a nation

664
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:30,770
and that's also being a king.

665
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,960
I, Lee Seong Gye,

666
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:38,460
will not cross the Yalu River!

667
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,510
Joseon's first king

668
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:56,050
Tae Jo Lee Seong Gye

669
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:07,050
Your whole family is being held hostage right now but you're withdrawing the troops?

670
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:10,720
Do I look like someone who can live after killing 50,000 soldiers?

671
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,240
You're not going to cross the Yalu River? Are you going to commit treason?

672
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,740
Whatever method you use, you must save Sister-in-law and the children.

673
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,360
What do you think is the most important choice?

674
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,220
It's a matter of choosing your enemy.

675
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,200
My 50,000 sons!

676
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,460
Today, to our families, who are waiting for us,

677
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,030
we are going back!
