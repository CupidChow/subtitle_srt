00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,190
This program was created with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea's Creative Content Agency, and Media Content.

2
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,890
Who changed the letter?

3
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,070
Who would do this?

4
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,290
Could it be... Could it be the shadow?

5
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:09,370
Hap Ha Lee In Gyeom, will you accept my move this time?

6
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,590
So I, since new evidence came to light...

7
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,750
Will that guy still investigate it in this situation?

8
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,430
...will interrogate Lee Bang Won again and get a confession.

9
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,290
Of course, he would. He's someone who moves according to his temperament.

10
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,400
No. No!

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,180
He will try to deny the letter himself.

12
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,610
If the letter was the right one, then they would have to arrest Lee Seong Gye for killing Baek Yoon.

13
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,910
Will Lee Seong Gye really be struck out?

14
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,650
What if a civil war breaks out with Lee Seong Gye, who commands a military army of 20,000 soldiers?

15
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,930
It's something that's too bothersome for them and they hate dealing with it.

16
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,660
At a time like this, it would be easier to be suspicious of Lee In Gyeom than of Lee Seong Gye.

17
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,400
Warning! General Lee Seong Gye

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,020
has crushed Ho Bal Do!

19
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,190
What? What?

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,920
General Lee Seong Gye

21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,670
Look here.

22
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,600
Didn't you hear General Lee Seong Gye won a battle?

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,860
But an investigation?

24
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,900
An investigation is just that.

25
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,370
First, look at this letter.

26
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,290
Is Lee Bang Won's name in here? Is Lee Seong Gye's name in here?

27
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,880
No matter how long I wait, you don't appear. According to your plan, I killed Baek Yoon first. Who do I kill next?

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,610
Something like this can be said anonymously.

29
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,120
How can something anonymous be evidence?

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,170
To a person who brought victory, can you take this anonymous letter to him and ask,

31
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,170
"Did you kill Lord Baek Yoon?"

32
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,900
- But...
- That's right!

33
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,200
Thinking about it, this has been a problem since the beginning.

34
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,260
An anonymous letter appearing definitely means there's a basis for destruction.

35
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,350
- That's what I'm saying!
- From the start, the direction of the investigation has been wrong.

36
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,910
Yes! We have to catch the person who wrote the anonymous letter.
(Han Goo Young)

37
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,720
All the talk about the An Byeon Book has disappated.
(Lee In Gyeom)

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,380
In this situation, only absurdity and fear are left.

39
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,810
Yes. "What if Lee Seong Gye starts a civil war?"
(Po Eun: Jeong Mong Joo)

40
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,670
"What if those people are just trying to escape?" You can only think about such concerns.

41
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,200
What came out of my room?
(Lee Bang Won)

42
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,750
Didn't you hear? The letter left by your leader.

43
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,650
The letter that says Lord Baek Yoon was killed and asks who to kill next.

44
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,610
How did this happen? Why that?

45
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,960
Could it be...

46
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,770
There's no way that you did such an enormous thing yourself.

47
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,290
Does... Does Sam Bong really want to kill me?

48
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,420
No, no. Even so, this is not right.

49
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,010
This will put Father in danger as well...

50
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,160
Your father is probably connected.

51
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,830
Stop!

52
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,970
Stop the interrogation?

53
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,310
Yes. In this situation, where Lee Seong Gye won the battle,

54
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,190
it will be hard to mention Lee Seong Gye's name as Baek Yoon's killer...

55
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,520
How can he push Lee Seong Gye as Baek Yoon's killer?

56
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,660
If he's going to strike Lee Seong Gye, he would call him to Gaegyeong and hit him.

57
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,980
Is he going to go into war with the commander of an army of 20,000 soldiers?

58
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,400
Does he have dementia?

59
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,600
I think that
(Hong In Bang)

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,100
it was not Hap Ha's scheme.

61
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,800
It was not?
(Gil Tae Mi)

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,000
Then, did Lee Seong Gye really kill Baek Yoon?

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,410
It's not that but either way...

64
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,440
Head of Seonggyungwan Elder!

65
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,370
Monk Jukryong has returned.

66
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,170
Really?

67
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,360
But he came with General Lee Seong Gye's eldest son Lee Bang Woo.

68
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,720
Let's go.

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,030
Lee Seong Gye is being accused of Baek Yoon's murder?

70
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,700
How could the letter have such content?

71
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,190
That's what I wanted to ask you.

72
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,620
Did you place the letter I gave you at Lee Bang Won's residence?

73
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,750
I heard the report and confirmed it two, three times.
(Cho Young: Hwa Sa Dan's Owner)

74
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,480
There was no mistake from our side.

75
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,750
If so,

76
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,060
it's that shadow.

77
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,210
It was that shadow's trick.

78
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,210
Then, what should we do? If the interrogation continues and Lee Bang Won confesses that his father instructed him to do it,

79
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,200
the future will be uncertain.

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,720
For now, I ordered it to be stopped.

81
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,860
The interrogation and the investigation.

82
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,190
Follow me.

83
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,740
But isn't the problem here the one in charge of the investigation?

84
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,150
That person doesn't listen and I heard that he's stubborn and headstrong.

85
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,600
If that kind of person is in charge of it, do you think he will stop?

86
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,090
If not, why else would General Choi Yeong call him a dumb head?

87
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,800
That dumb head also got sent into exile numerous times while trying to impeach you.

88
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,780
Will he obediently listen to you?

89
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,610
He's been sent to exile numerous time and yet he neglects that.

90
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,890
Why do you think he is has remained in his position up to now?

91
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:47,960
Will I think highly of that person's backbone?

92
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,170
I'm sorry, Hap Ha.

93
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,020
I should have checked the contents of the letter before entering the Do Dang.

94
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,100
It was my carelessness.

95
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,140
Say your greetings.

96
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,740
This is the one in charge of the investigation office, Nam dumb head.

97
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,390
This is Cho Young.

98
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,740
As expected of you, Hap Ha.

99
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,290
So you say it was definitely in the place it was left in,

100
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,590
but the letter that you took out was a different letter?

101
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,810
Does anyone come to mind?

102
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,580
During the time that I was in politics,

103
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,220
there was only one time that I got tricked like this.

104
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,390
That's why I made it so that he could not enter Gaegyeong.

105
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,880
But that person keeps being fishy.

106
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,800
Are you talking about Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeon?

107
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Why did you think so?

108
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,690
A while back, Bi Guk Temple's Jukryong mentioned Jeong Do Jeon's name.

109
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,140
Because of what?

110
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,190
He was looking for Jeong Do Jeon on someone's orders.

111
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,930
Who do you think that someone could be?

112
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,280
Everybody knows that Hong In Bang puts Jukryong in charge.

113
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,710
It is possible that the shadow behind Hong In Bang is Jeong Do Jeon.

114
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:08,830
Anyway, Lee Bang Won is connected to that shadow.

115
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:15,510
That's not all. I think he's also connected to the assassin who killed Baek Yoon.

116
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,670
Next time, do an interrogation regarding that shadow.

117
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,740
You must only report to me.

118
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,030
Yes, Hap Ha.

119
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,460
Also, about the movements of Ham Joo's Ga Byeol Cho,
(Ga Byeol Cho: Lee Seong Gye's secret private army)

120
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,840
observe them closely.

121
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,780
Yes, I have already made preparations.

122
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,240
As soon as the Ga Byeol Cho moves, I will immediately receive information.

123
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,970
Also,

124
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,030
we need to detain the person who placed the letter.

125
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,930
The one I sent, called Yak San, is someone who is tight-lipped.

126
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,070
Even if he is tight-lipped,

127
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,950
it's not like a dead body.

128
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,590
Yes. I understand.

129
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,050
What? Bang Won commanded Baek Yoon's killer?

130
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,770
What an impossible accusation!
(Lee Bang Woo)

131
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,590
This is way too much for Hap Ha.

132
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,450
Our family is ready to fight.

133
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,990
We have to save Bang Won.

134
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,850
Elder, Monk Nam Cheol has arrived.

135
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,550
Open it.

136
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,570
I secretly placed someone at Hwa Sa Dan when I went to Ham Joo.
(Jukryong: Bi Guk Temple Head Monk)

137
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,950
Did anything happen during that time?

138
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,330
Isn't there a Yak San from a distinguished family of robbers?

139
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,490
That person was requested for something at Hwa Sa Dan.

140
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,590
Since then, he often goes around prostitute houses and appears to have gained a fortune.

141
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,570
It's that bastard! That person left the forged letter.

142
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,530
Then, catching that person and handing him over to the investigation office is top priority.

143
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,990
How can you believe the investigation office? Hap Ha's people are spread throughout that place too.

144
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,590
The one in charge of the investigation is a man of integrity, right?

145
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,110
That is true but...

146
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,190
First, secure that person called Yak San.

147
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,750
Yes.

148
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,270
It wasn't Hap Ha but Sam Bong?

149
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,230
Sam Bong planned this but why is there no communication?

150
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,810
Did you settle payment with Yak San?

151
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,050
I will meet him today and pay him.

152
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:42,130
Send him far away. It would be better if it's Book Mang San.
(Book Mang San: a place where dead people go)

153
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,130
I understand.

154
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,550
Are you Yak San?

155
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,910
Right?

156
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,890
W-W-Who are you?
(Yak San)

157
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,470
Let's go quietly.

158
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,510
Aigoo. Thank you.

159
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,470
Ah, this makes me tremble...

160
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,250
I won't show myself in Gaegyeong for the time being.

161
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,430
Just hurry and give me my payment.

162
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,730
I'm sorry. I will bury your corpse.

163
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,470
Please save me. Please save me!

164
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,350
If you are the person called Yak San, I will save you.

165
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:23,230
Yes. Yes. I am Yak San. I am Yak San.

166
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,010
Since stopping the interrogation, we haven't fed him or let him sleep for four days.

167
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,910
He's firm but he will collapse soon.

168
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,690
Now, you will be in charge.

169
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,210
Yes.

170
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,770
You've worked hard.

171
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,850
It's a shame that I have to relay this sad news to you.

172
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,670
The Northeastern region's Ga Byeol Cho was defeated by Ho Bal Do.

173
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:49,110
Your father, General Lee Seong Gye, is also in a life and death situation.

174
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,930
Right now,

175
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,110
what are you saying?

176
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:01,220
The Ga Byeol Cho was defeated and General Lee Seong Gye seems to have been killed in battle.

177
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,960
I'm sorry.

178
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:14,480
Ga Byeol Cho... Ga Byeol Cho...

179
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,280
was annihilated and Father...

180
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,340
My Father...

181
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:42,170
He only trusted his father so his shock must be great.

182
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:47,620
Make every situation hopeless and after he gives up on his own,

183
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,300
I will get the truth out of him. When he wakes up, I will continue with the next step.

184
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,490
Watch him carefully.

185
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,780
It will be difficult if he really dies.

186
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,020
Does that mean that he hasn't fainted?

187
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,930
Even when you said his father is dead?

188
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,320
On that day, in our Bang Won's room,

189
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,870
he confessed to placing a letter secretly.

190
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,840
Please investigate this person.

191
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,710
You are the only one who will do a fair investigation.

192
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,130
What is your name?

193
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,050
Ya-Ya-Ya... Yak San. My name is Yak San.

194
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,940
Just how... How did this happen?

195
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:18,680
So on the seventh day of the month, you secretly infiltrated General Lee Seong Gye's house

196
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,190
and left the red envelope with the letter in Lee Bang Won's room?

197
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,210
Yes, yes, yes.

198
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,950
I was told that I would be given some silver coins for just putting it in there.

199
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,160
And the person who ordered you to do that is a girl from Hwa Sa Dan?

200
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,840
That girl didn't personally say it, but

201
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,620
I've also lived my life on the ground for thirty years.

202
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,420
There's no doubt that she's from Hwa Sa Dan.

203
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,640
From here on, listen carefully.

204
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,470
If I keep you alive, the things that you said now,

205
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,790
you must not say to anyone except me.

206
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,620
Yes?

207
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,960
This is something that has a complicated relationship to the Do Dang.

208
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,760
So you can only live if you trust me and follow what I say.

209
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,940
Yes, yes!

210
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,140
I think it was intended. Even Hwa Sa Dan was mentioned.

211
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,250
I've shut his mouth but what should we do?

212
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,670
What's with you?

213
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,320
We came because we heard that the person who slandered General Lee Seong Gye was arrested.

214
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,600
Pressure from outside forces. We were worried about that.

215
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,150
It seems to be a useless concern now that I see you came here first.

216
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,600
What are you implying?

217
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,250
I also only heard the news and wanted to understand the situation better, so I came here.

218
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,770
Hap Ha wasn't threatening you or bribing you, right?

219
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,270
Then, you must stick to us. We will definitely guarantee a fair investigation.

220
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,170
Whether it's this side or that side, there's no reason for me to stick on either side.

221
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,740
Investigating is my job.

222
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,520
Since you said that, you look more trustworthy. Go ahead.

223
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,830
By the way, about the forged letter that came out of Lee Bang Won's room.

224
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,560
is there no way to see it again? It would be nice if you could show me.

225
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,270
There was no particular movement from the Ga Byeol Cho.

226
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,550
Are you sure?

227
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,100
An army of that size cannot move secretly.

228
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,920
We will receive a message if there's even a slight action.

229
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,190
Continue watching them and notify me of everything.

230
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,780
Yes.

231
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,670
They are...

232
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,630
They are all your family?

233
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,230
Yes, our family is kind of blessed.

234
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,270
What are you doing? Quickly greet them!

235
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,980
- I am Han Nom.
- Du Shik
(all their names start with a number)

236
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,530
- Suk Sam
- Nuh Gu Ri!

237
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,980
- Oh Sori
- Yuk Son!

238
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,600
- Chil Taek
- Pal Pal!

239
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,880
- Gu Teol!
- I am Hong Dae Hong!

240
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,230
Its Hong Dae Hong, and Hong Dae Hong in reverse as well.

241
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,030
End of numbers!

242
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,610
Is he your father? Didn't you say he passed away?

243
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,930
What? N-No.

244
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,600
Oh. If I can explain myself, I am the creator of the 24 moves of Dong Bang Double Dragon,

245
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,890
the teacher of Mu Hyul and the best swordsmen of Goryeo.

246
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,810
Stop it!

247
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,200
I will not forget this debt, even after death,

248
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,530
for accepting our family.

249
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,640
We will do anything you command.

250
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,840
Lead them to the residence for now.

251
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,570
See me after.

252
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,500
What? Young master Bang Won?

253
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,030
Yeah, that is why he is imprisoned there.

254
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,920
Likewise, that happened because I was not there.

255
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,740
I will definitely save him even if I have to break in.

256
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,300
Don't overreact!

257
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,610
Older Master already took care of it so he will be free soon.

258
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,380
I'll have to do something so my family does not have a rough time.

259
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,150
If that's so that's a relief.

260
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:50,460
Oh yeah. Did you learn martial arts from that round guy that said something about 24 moves of double dragon?

261
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,280
No.

262
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,610
What do you mean the 24 moves of the Twin Dragons of the East? That person is the 24 levels of Swindler of the East Crap!
(He changed the original characters of the title)

263
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,290
Go to the market with others and give the message I wrote.

264
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,310
This is the way to save Bang Won.

265
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,910
Among the taffy sellers you will see a familiar face.

266
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,630
Do not act like you know him.

267
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,240
Uh... give me a taffy.

268
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,470
B-B-Boon!

269
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,020
What can I give you?

270
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,680
This rice taffy if really good, and this is as well.

271
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,110
Oh no the bean taffy will be the best.

272
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,070
Thank you.

273
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,120
Oh for the pretty lady, I will give you one more.

274
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,230
The back alley, back alley.

275
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,420
I am sorry.

276
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,240
It's okay.

277
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,270
For someone who looks normal, did you not eat for days?

278
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,070
Why are you eating so fast? You are going to get sick.

279
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,070
I have gluttony with food.

280
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,770
Do you guys make good money over here?

281
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,500
Yes, we are the best ones around here.

282
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,030
Is that so? When do you guys do the acting?

283
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,800
Every day.

284
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,340
What are you doing? He's a pitiful guy.

285
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,580
Go inside, and don't act like you know him from now on.

286
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,430
Come again.

287
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,850
Didn't I warn you that I might kill you the next time I see you?

288
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,630
I'm going to forget you, so you forget me as well.

289
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,830
Don't come again.

290
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,610
For what reason are you keep coming here?

291
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,050
I... have something to answer to him.

292
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,400
This is not the time to do this.

293
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,490
General Lee might come here.

294
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,120
The general will not come here.

295
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,710
How are you so certain?

296
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,720
If he brings the army, then that means war,

297
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,650
and if he comes alone it will be the same as suicide.

298
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,870
Lee In Gyeom and General Lee are looking for the right time to negotiate.

299
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,750
Didn't you say that you would save Lee Bang Won?

300
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,420
I said I'm going to save him,

301
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,620
but I never said I'm going to take care of the things he did.

302
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:45,570
Infuriating his father by faking the document or looking for Hong In Bang on his own and getting arrested by Lee In Gyeom.

303
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:50,020
Everything is because of his own actions. Is that the only thing?

304
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:56,070
He will come to learn how all the words he loudly proclaimed were for nothing.

305
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,800
The loneliness he feels being by himself and not knowing what is going on outside

306
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,410
will make him weak, and when that happens

307
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:08,410
he will start to feel defeated and believe that he will never will be able to defeat them.

308
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,660
At that moment, choosing to surrender or not

309
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,060
is something I cannot do for him. Only he himself can do that.

310
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,770
He will learn that it is responsibility.

311
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,850
The Northeastern region's Ga Byeol Cho has been defeated by Ho Bal Do.

312
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,830
We do not even know if your father General Lee is alive or not.

313
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,830
Is that true?

314
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,840
No, father wouldn't do that.

315
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,560
Perhaps, because of me?

316
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,820
Did he do that in the war because of the things I did?

317
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,070
Because of me.

318
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,080
Please take me out! My father passed away.

319
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,720
Take me out!

320
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,550
Let me out!

321
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,630
I...

322
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,580
He will surrender soon.

323
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,640
The only rope he was relying on got cut.

324
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,780
For now he will only cry out and release his anger, but he will soon accept reality and

325
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,220
tell us everything. But the problem is—

326
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,380
The guy Yak San.

327
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,420
Do you have your eyes on Hwa Sa Dang and Do Ha Jun?

328
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,710
We already had our eyes on Hwa Sa Dang.

329
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,580
And as for Do Ha Jun, we have our man there.

330
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,680
But I cannot do anything about the prison.

331
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,600
Do not worry. Boo Man Ho will be very cautious.

332
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,220
He's a man no one can easily touch.

333
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,990
What are you thinking about so deeply?

334
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,560
No. I'm just.

335
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,180
We cannot be certain. Hap Ha is a scary person.

336
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:45,120
We cannot let our guard down before we get a confession from that guy, Yak San.

337
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,900
We don't know what he will do.

338
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,820
Eliminate him.

339
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,390
If Yak San dies, you will be under suspicion.

340
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,360
Not if you make it so that I don't fall under suspicion.

341
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,970
Do as I say.

342
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,020
After the intense battle, the Ga Byeol Cho were defeated and retreated.

343
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,250
General Lee took his leftover soldiers to Ham Joo fortress and was besieged.

344
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,630
But, the enemy soldiers surrounded the castle and

345
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,270
eventually it was overtaken.

346
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,090
This is the only way you can live.

347
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,410
Even if you confess all the things you saw, you will just die here.

348
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,370
Do as I say.

349
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,010
Who are you?! Catch him.

350
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,820
Catch that guy!.

351
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,210
What are you saying?

352
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:32,210
Just as I said. Last night, while criminal Yak San was trying to escape, he was killed.

353
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,210
I am very sorry.

354
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,520
How are you guarding the criminal that something like this can happen?!

355
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,920
If you ask for responsibility, I'll accept it.

356
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,380
What kind of responsibility can you accept?

357
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,620
If you want redeem yourself for this mistake,

358
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,090
you have to double your efforts regarding Lee Bang Won's investigation.

359
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,830
Yes, Hap Ha.

360
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,430
Ha Pa did this.

361
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,520
Hap Ha killed the guy, Yak San.

362
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,270
The one in charge of the investigation is upright

363
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,900
and good at his job. I believed him because of those rumors.

364
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,100
How can we be attacked so helplessly.

365
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,810
Now we don't know if he is on Hap Ha's side.

366
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:32,460
Only if Yak San confessed could we have made Hap Ha to back down.

367
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,580
But, everything is gone now.

368
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,810
It's not over yet.

369
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,370
There is still one thing.

370
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,030
This is the message that came out of Lee Bang Won's room.

371
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,340
I asked them to make a copy of the original.

372
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,400
So?

373
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,430
For swordsmen, their style of fighting is embedded in their writing.

374
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,880
Yes, their sword style and writing are suppose to be similar.

375
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,620
On that night the sword style I saw

376
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,840
was very similar to this writing.

377
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,900
If I am right, this letter is not fake,

378
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,800
but was really written by him.

379
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,960
So?

380
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,910
If its true that Hap Ha put this in Lee Bang Won's room,

381
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,890
and if this is real,

382
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:25,300
then that warrior is someone Ha Pa raised. So, therefore, we have to catch that warrior guy.

383
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,990
Then we can completely turn the tables.

384
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,110
You said you had an encounter with that guy, right?

385
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,160
Yes.

386
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,600
Let's have a duel.

387
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,700
I am certain. It is that guy.

388
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:03,950
The one who killed Baek Yoon, the one who infiltrated Bi Guk Temple, and the one who attacked you, In-law,

389
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,190
is the same guy that wrote the letter.

390
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,630
The look on Hong In Bang's face was so fun to watch.

391
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,770
Then what are you going to do now?

392
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:26,330
In order to save his son, he will try to negotiate.

393
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:31,460
From that negotiation, I will get rid of the An Byeon Book

394
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,420
and destroy his relationship with Hong.

395
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:45,560
Therefore, Lee Bang Won's confession is important.

396
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,420
We have to find out who the shadow guy is

397
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,890
who made this table and challenged me.

398
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:10,430
You must be in a great deal of shock, since your father is like that.

399
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:19,030
But, as I think about it more, I do not believe that your father had any reason to kill Baek Yoon.

400
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:26,370
But, all these happenings around the An Byeon Book are very suspicious.

401
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,940
I believe that there is someone who made this table,

402
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,740
and you seem to know something about it.

403
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,040
I am trying to help you.

404
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:49,000
You know who made this table. Tell me.

405
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,710
Come on.

406
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:04,470
Is it perhaps, Sam Bong Jeong Do Jeom?

407
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:18,980
My father, during the siege.

408
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,190
That is right.

409
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:29,310
General Lee besieged.

410
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,680
General Lee besieged?

411
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:51,240
My father, General Lee, during his 150 wars and fights,

412
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,870
has never been besieged.

413
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,400
What do you really know about them?

414
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:14,490
If Ga Byeol Cho was destroyed by Ho Bal Do,

415
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,550
in four days Ho Bal do should be here.

416
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,860
Then what are you doing here?

417
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,310
Even during the Red Turban invasion and the Mongol invasion,

418
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,220
abandoning the capital, abandoning the people.

419
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:47,280
Isn't that the tradition of the current politicians of Goryeo, who were the first to run away?

420
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,110
That was those people's custom and tradition.

421
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,930
However you guys...

422
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:03,510
While Ga Byeol Cho was defeated you are here with no worry, investigating me?

423
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:21,970
You will never be able to make me surrender.

424
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,610
You will not learn even one thing from me.

425
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,430
Why?

426
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,770
Because I know what a war is

427
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,850
and you don't.

428
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,560
Do you know what a war is?

429
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:51,410
A war is eventually about killing someone.

430
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,630
I already started a war when I was twelve.

431
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,480
That is me, Lee Bang Won.

432
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,140
There is no action in the Ga Byeol Cho.

433
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,710
It is said that after the battle, all efforts are going into reconstruction.

434
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,710
They should be.

435
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,350
Hap Ha! Hap Ha!

436
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,330
What is it? We have a guest here.

437
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:41,230
Uh, Hap Ha. At the front gate...

438
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,500
At the front gate.

439
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,820
What about the front gate?

440
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,350
General Lee is here.

441
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,870
On top of that he is in his combat clothes and is holding a bow.

442
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:10,260
Oh, General Lee. When did you get here?

443
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,100
Congratulations on your victory.

444
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,660
Once again you saved Goryeo.

445
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:24,620
But, did you come back from hunting?

446
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:29,920
What are these soldiers?

447
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:38,960
Because you came holding a bow the servants were worried, I guess.

448
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,490
I am quiet the scaredy cat.

449
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:56,520
Please speak. What is it about?

450
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,200
Please release Bang Won.
(Lee Seong Gye)

451
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,540
That is...

452
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,810
You have to release him.

453
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:11,490
Since you are already coming up strongly,

454
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,090
I also have nothing to hide.

455
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:23,570
Will you withdraw the An Byeon Book and go back to Ham Joo?

456
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:29,700
If I was going to make a deal with you, why else would I come here carrying my bow and arrow?

457
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:35,090
You're being disrespectful. Didn't you pledge your loyalty to me?

458
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,200
I did.

459
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,260
Because then, I was just a dog of Cho Joo Ji Ga.
(Cho Joo Ji Ga: The dog-like family that bit its owner. Refers to Lee Seong Gye who betrayed Jo So Saeng.)

460
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,660
So are you not like that anymore?

461
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,320
Should I tell everyone about it even right now?

462
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,910
After serving as a Boo Won Bae all your life, you saw the tides turning. (Boo Won Bae: The group that betrayed the country to mooch off of the Yuans.)

463
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,820
You betrayed your sworn brother and opened the fortress gate.

464
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,150
The one who surrendered Goryeo

465
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,280
is Lee Seong Gye.

466
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:13,500
The story of how the Ssang Seong Colonial Office was reclaimed in the Year of 1356 being known

467
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,050
scared me, so I lived like that.

468
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:23,960
However, Bang Won turning like this, I understand now.

469
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,590
I am not a dog of Cho Joo Ji Ga,

470
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,430
but a tiger that lost its cub.

471
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,930
The most important thing in a man's life is honor.

472
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:41,250
Why did I hide the truth about Jo So Saeng to protect my honor?

473
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:47,290
It's because if I am not honorable, I won't be able to protect my people.

474
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,950
But Lee In Gyeom,

475
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,610
you did something you shouldn't have done.

476
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,830
How dare you mess with the people who are close to this Lee Seong Gye?

477
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,870
My family, my son at that!

478
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:08,480
I am speechless at how truly arrogant you are.

479
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,960
To the Moon Ha Shi Joong who is above all but one man (the king),
(Moon Ha Shi Joong: highest ranking government position in Goryeo)

480
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,810
in the middle of the night, you dare threaten me with a bow and arrow?

481
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,360
With my one order, even with just this,

482
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,020
you'd be leaving this room dead.

483
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,900
Oftentimes,

484
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,560
people are mistaken about one thing.

485
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:52,210
I'm talking about the prejudice that bows and arrows are only weapons for long distances.

486
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,370
It is usually like that.

487
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:01,050
But not for Lee Seong Gye.

488
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,960
Even with six of you, whatever you do,

489
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,260
you cannot be faster than me shooting Lee In Gyeom.

490
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:29,780
As long as I have a bow and arrow, you cannot save his life.

491
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:08,820
Release Bang Won by tomorrow morning.

492
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:28,970
Let's go.

493
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,200
Yes, General.

494
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,910
Bon Won! Elder Bon Won!

495
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,580
General Lee Seong Gye went into Do Hwa Jeon.
(Do Hwa Jeon: Lee In Gyeom's house)

496
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,210
Without any escorts?

497
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,340
He is only accompanied by General Lee Ji Ran.

498
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,630
Is he still there?

499
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,120
He came out of Do Hwa Jeon a while ago but didn't go to his house.

500
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,920
Was I mistaken about Lee Seong Gye?

501
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,380
We have to find him. We must find him tonight.

502
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,460
Yes. I have ordered people to find him.

503
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,810
Just what is he up to? Where is he going?

504
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,680
Did you receive news that General Lee Seong Gye arrived in Gaegyeong?

505
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,350
You should hurry and look for him too, then report back to me.

506
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,560
Why isn't there any response?

507
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,100
Elder Bon Won.
(Lee Shin Jeok)

508
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,170
It seems that it was really urgent so I escorted him here without permission.

509
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,100
Who?

510
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,740
We need to arrest Lee Seong Gye.

511
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:48,530
At the Do Dang meeting tomorrow,

512
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,780
raise a petition for Lee Seong Gye to be arrested.

513
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,840
But Hap Ha!

514
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,980
Accuse him of being Baek Yoon's killer.

515
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,570
Lee Seong Gye would have the 20,000 soldiers of the Ga Byeol Cho.

516
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,770
Have you thought about a civil war breaking out?

517
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:14,070
Lee Seong Gye came to Gaegyeong by himself.

518
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,120
How could he?

519
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,840
Anyway, it's an opportunity, right?

520
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,260
Another thing.

521
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,380
Tell the person in charge of the investigation.

522
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,760
By tonight,

523
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,820
there has to be a confession from Lee Bang Won.

524
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,250
Yes, I understand.

525
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,500
I will inform our members.

526
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,420
Didn't you tell me to establish a new country with you?

527
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,760
Yes, that's right.

528
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,460
I couldn't do that. The people under me, my comrades, the Ga Byeol Cho

529
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,330
and their families. I can't do anything besides protect them.

530
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:00,950
Then why did you come to Gaegyeong by yourself at this time?

531
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,370
Why did you come to find me in this cave?

532
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:07,970
It's to protect my people.

533
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:11,230
- To save Bang Won.
- Saving Bang Won would be enough?

534
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,260
No. Not just Bang Won,

535
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,970
but to protect my people too. I must go into politics.

536
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,490
I have to enter the Do Dang.

537
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,150
Didn't you say you would serve me?

538
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:32,220
You said you will be my tactician. A plan to save Bang Won.

539
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,000
Do you have it

540
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,110
or not?

541
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,290
Morning will come soon.

542
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,000
Fine. Did you say your people?

543
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,590
I should start from there.

544
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,950
Do you have it or not?

545
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,490
A plan...

546
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,210
Of course, I have it.

547
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,470
Let's go.

548
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:19,490
Where am I going?

549
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,310
You will see when you get there.

550
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,870
That man said so, himself, that he's a storyteller. There's no way of knowing if that is true.

551
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,850
That's the only clue right now.

552
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,890
Ah, excuse me.

553
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:10,390
I heard that the famous storyteller is staying here.

554
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,950
Ah, the storyteller?
(Gab Boon)

555
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,370
You did really good job coming here to find him.

556
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,230
Wait a second.

557
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:23,950
Brother! Brother, we've a customer.

558
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:33,190
Aigoo! You who came looking for a storyteller this early in the morning,

559
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:37,670
who are you? I am

560
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:43,170
the one who can sing! The one who can dance!

561
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,750
The one who does the representative dances for masked performances!

562
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,370
The one who leaves you breathless. I'm the storyteller.

563
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,570
Is that so?

564
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:55,190
Yes, that's right.

565
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:05,010
Can you take off that mask?

566
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,960
General Lee came to see me last night.

567
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,560
He came to Gaegyeong?

568
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,060
Regarding Head of Seonggyungwan Baek Yoon's death,

569
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:28,590
there are a lot of rumors going around, and yet he comes to Gaegyeong. Don't you think he's that confident?

570
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:36,390
But this time, let's do our best in this investigation to reject those accusations.

571
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:43,910
It is true that he is being accused, and in his son Bang Won's room,

572
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:48,690
that something displeasing was found there is also true.

573
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:56,310
If we cannot clearly expose it, what do we need the Do Dang for?

574
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:05,220
Arresting the General, whether he committed the crime or not,

575
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,870
is the right thing to do.

576
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,750
There's no reason to arrest him.

577
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,820
Why are you saying that?

578
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,520
It's because he is here right now.

579
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,310
General, please come in.

580
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:09,310
The letter found in my fifth son's room was fabricated.

581
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,120
Yes.

582
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:20,030
We need to do an investigation to prove whether or not the letter was fabricated and whether or not you are guilty.

583
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:25,470
There is no evidence for either of them.

584
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:29,610
Evidence. I have it.

585
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,470
Oh, I see.

586
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,070
Show us then.

587
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,680
Bang Woo!

588
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:14,420
This person is a thief called Yak San who escaped from the investigation office.

589
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,800
Ah, that person!

590
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,530
Lee Seong Gye, you bastard.

591
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,750
Teacher,

592
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,910
how come you're here?

593
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:41,700
Brother, please recommend that person called Nam dumb head be in charge of the investigation.

594
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,830
You appear after so many years and what are you suddenly saying?

595
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,850
This time, please believe me a little.

596
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,410
There's a stubborn and hardheaded person in the investigation office.

597
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:55,310
Ah, you're talking about the person called Nam dumb head?

598
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:59,140
Then we can just put that person in charge.

599
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,390
Ah, hyu...

600
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,460
I'm sorry.

601
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,340
It's fine.

602
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:31,560
Yak San, the thief, has confessed about everything that happened on that night.

603
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:36,970
He said that he secretly planted the letter in Bang Won's room.

604
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:51,570
Now we just need to find the individual who ordered this person.

605
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,670
What's going on?

606
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:11,460
You've suffered a lot. Your father will be fine too.

607
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,840
This person, too,

608
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,860
was your person?

609
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,960
Until the end, he never mentioned your name.

610
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,790
Say your greetings.

611
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,230
This is the troublesome Pok Doo.

612
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,020
Pok Doo...

613
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,730
This is the one in charge of the investigation office, Nam dumb head.

614
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,550
But Brother, how could you also call me that?

615
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,980
Your nickname was famous. What was your name originally?

616
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,840
Ah, seriously..

617
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,930
Well... My mother used to call me that too.

618
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,470
You worked hard. I am the stubborn guy at the investigation office,

619
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,070
Nam Eun.

620
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,770
Nam Eun: a revolutionary comrade who worked with Jeong Do Jeon until the end.

621
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,030
Nam Eun...

622
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,330
Pok Doo...

623
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:24,620
It's a great chance for you to get rid of me. Why did you make it this complicated?

624
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,360
Why do you think?

625
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,830
If I take the torture and die,

626
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:37,650
the situation with the forged An Byeon Book document will change, and Father will stand up and

627
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:41,780
risk his life to fight Lee In Gyeom.

628
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,940
Is this what you wanted?

629
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,070
That's what I wanted.

630
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,840
But why?

631
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,800
No way.

632
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:58,280
Humane affection, something like that?

633
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,270
I'll be disappointed if that is the case.

634
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:06,760
Crazy bastard. I don't feel anything like that for you.

635
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:11,580
Just one. I wagered on one thing.

636
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:15,670
The fact that you are still young.

637
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:18,960
The fact that you still have opportunity. I put my bet on that.

638
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,670
Aren't you supposed to get rid of a troublemaker while he's still young?

639
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:28,810
This is what being young is. I will get a hold of such thoughts of yours.

640
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:37,040
From now on, call me your teacher.

641
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,400
Six Flying Dragons

642
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,420
Thank you for saving me. Is it possible to drive those people out? We need to win.

643
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,390
- We will win.
- Can you promise me, man to man?

644
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:18,940
Could you be... That's why Boon Yi earnestly pleaded to have you saved.

645
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,240
Why didn't you tell me?

646
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,810
In-law! Now that I open my eyes, the world has changed. You and I are in the center!

647
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:29,530
Relay my congratulations to the person who planned it and won.

648
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,190
Our alliance will end here.

649
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:36,140
Now, bit by bit, I have come to know Lee Seong Gye, who will be the king of the country I will establish.

650
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,940
Brother, what is wrong with you these days?

651
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,660
He has appeared! That storyteller has appeared!

652
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,690
Ja Il Saek... Yeon Hee! Yeon Hee!

653
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,300
You're a Hwa Sa Dan spy, Ja Il Saek.
