=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,520
That day,

4
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,840
it seemed he had a conflict

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,880
with Snowdrop.

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,860
(Floating Cloud Pavilion)

7
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,160
Bravo! Bravo!

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,510
Bravo!

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,840
Bravo!

10
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,480
Excellent, Mr. Meng!

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,230
Come and give the Commander a toast!

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,270
Okay.

13
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,480
I think that's a good idea.

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,280
Commander He,

15
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,870
may you live forever.

16
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,720
Are you a man or a woman?

17
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,400
How can a man

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,830
portray Du Liniang so accurately?

19
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Show some respect!

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,190
Asking for respect as an actor?

21
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,670
You're just a gender-ambiguous actor.

22
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,670
What respect do you need?

23
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,510
You...

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,440
Begonia, what's wrong?

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,080
Mr. Mingting, it's nothing.

26
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,910
I have to go. Something came up.

27
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,320
Talk!

28
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,260
Are you going to talk or not?

29
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,230
You go.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
Enough.

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,320
He Xingzhou,

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
you might as well confess early

33
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,240
to avoid more suffering.

34
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,720
If you dare, just kill me.

35
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,850
Quite the tough guy.

36
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,670
I want to see

37
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,320
how many days you can last.

38
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,270
Only when he confesses

39
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,630
can he get to eat.

40
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,630
If he unfortunately starves to death,

41
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,750
let's just say

42
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,110
he starves himself

43
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,320
to atone for his sins.

44
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,880
This way,

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,390
we can explain it
to the Military Department.

46
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,240
Keep beating him.

47
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,590
Yes.

48
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,190
What about that aide Zhao?

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
Have you caught him?

50
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,750
It's like he's vanished into thin air,

51
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,910
not even a shadow in sight.

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,440
Keep searching.

53
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,000
Once you find him,

54
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,550
execute him on the spot.

55
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

56
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,630
Are you insane?

57
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,910
This is the Commander's Mansion.

58
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,470
The old man is dead.

59
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,550
What's there to worry about?

60
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,800
Besides,

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,080
isn't it more thrilling

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,600
in broad daylight?

63
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,190
(Liang Rufen and Ma Sihai.)

64
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,030
(Could they have been
colluding all along?)

65
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,870
Wait.

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,230
Are you really sure this is foolproof?

67
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,950
What's wrong? Don't you trust me?

68
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,160
It's not that.

69
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,510
I'm just scared.

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Now that Mingting is about
to be the Commander,

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,320
I'm still the Vice Commander,

72
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,780
and you are
the head of the household here,

73
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,780
we three are currently

74
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,100
the most powerful in Yuncheng.

75
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,660
What are you afraid of?

76
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Wait.

77
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,980
Don't forget

78
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,380
He Xingzhou still has influence
in the military.

79
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,660
Plus, his aide hasn't been found yet.

80
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,180
(It's really him.)

81
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,980
It's just a matter of time.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,780
If you're worried about him
saving his master from jail,

83
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,980
I'll just arrange more men

84
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,780
to keep an eye on He Xingzhou.

85
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,900
Focus.

86
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,780
Wait, wait. Someone's here.

87
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,140
Someone's here. Someone's here.

88
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,380
Who's there?

89
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,220
Who is that?

90
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,020
Mother.

91
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,740
Mother,

92
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,100
what are you doing here?

93
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,100
Mingting,

94
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,980
you've come at the right time.

95
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,890
I was just about
to discuss something with you.

96
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,700
(Ma Sihai.)

97
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,580
Are you a man or a woman?

98
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,780
How can a man

99
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,340
portray Du Liniang so accurately?

100
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,020
Show some respect!

101
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,900
Screw you!

102
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,980
(With my current situation,)

103
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,980
(getting close to him for investigation)

104
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,240
(is as difficult as climbing to heaven.)

105
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,940
(For now,)

106
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,140
(I must first rescue Xingzhou.)

107
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,140
(How can I manage)

108
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,020
(to rescue He Xingzhou?)

109
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
Mrs. Xingzhou,

110
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,580
Mrs. He asked you
to work in the laundry room.

111
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,660
The house doesn't feed freeloaders.

112
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,620
Understood.

113
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,820
Please follow me.

114
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,060
Uncle Ma.

115
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,700
Sihai, look,

116
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,540
Mingting is now the Commander.

117
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,180
Isn't it time to hand over
the military authority to him?

118
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,260
It's not the time yet.

119
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,860
Then when is the right time?

120
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,780
Now, He Xingzhou
hasn't been convicted yet,

121
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,220
and the rest of the army

122
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,180
is still watching,

123
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,300
not yet aligned.

124
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,620
Once I've dealt with these people,

125
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
I'll hand over the army

126
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,780
intact to Mingting.

127
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,780
But...

128
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,060
Let's do as Uncle Ma says.

129
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,380
Right now, I'm just a cripple.

130
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,180
Later on, I'll likely need

131
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,420
Uncle Ma's care in everything.

132
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,460
We're all family here.

133
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,300
No need for formalities.

134
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,460
OK, well,

135
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,980
I have other matters,

136
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,980
so I'll be going.

137
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,660
Then let me walk you out.

138
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,460
Are you going to follow me all the time?

139
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,380
I'm sorry, Mrs. Xingzhou.

140
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,700
This is Mrs. He's instruction.

141
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,740
Can you look at where you're going?

142
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,500
Got your eyes set on seducing men, huh?

143
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,020
What are you waiting for?

144
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,940
Hurry up and get the clothes
for me to change into.

145
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,980
Yes, Mrs. Mingting.

146
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,100
What are you looking at?

147
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,860
Did I say something wrong?

148
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,620
If you keep looking, I will...

149
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,540
Do you really love He Xingzhou,

150
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
or do you just love
being the Commander's wife?

151
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,060
What do you mean?

152
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,180
You keep saying

153
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,300
I stole Xingzhou from you.

154
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,700
But now that he's in jail,

155
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,220
I haven't seen you shed a tear

156
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,100
nor seen you rush about for his sake.

157
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,300
Where's your love for him now?

158
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,420
How do you know I haven't...

159
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,620
You don't need to worry about that.

160
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,140
Mama,

161
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,200
I recently got an exotic item,

162
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,990
so I specially brought it
to pay my respects to you.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,940
Come with me and take a look.

164
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,840
Alright, let's go.

165
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,270
Gentlemen,

166
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,860
- what brings you here today?
- My Lady.

167
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,930
Please sit and have some tea.

168
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,700
Mrs. Xingzhou asked us to come.

169
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,540
Where is she?

170
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,140
- She...
- I'm here.

171
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
In Mrs. He's room,

172
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,220
I found this,

173
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,940
so I asked the two of you
to come as witnesses.

174
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,820
What? Who let you into my room?

175
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,980
That's not the point.

176
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,100
The Commander died of poisoning,

177
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,420
and there happens to be
a packet of medicine in your room.

178
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,500
Shouldn't you explain?

179
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,580
What's there to explain?

180
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,180
You little wretch

181
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,300
must be trying to frame me

182
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,090
so you deliberately placed
this medicine in my room.

183
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,620
Proving your innocence is simple.

184
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,140
You just need to try it yourself.

185
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
You and He Xingzhou

186
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,940
are truly a scheming couple.

187
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,500
He poisoned the Commander,

188
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,540
and now you want to poison me too.

189
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,420
I think this medicine

190
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,200
is better for you to drink.

191
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,260
Drink it all.

192
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,580
Mother, let's talk this out.

193
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,860
There must be some misunderstanding.

194
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,100
- Drink it!
- Mother, calm down.

195
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,880
This is definitely a misunderstanding.

196
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,660
You all saw, right?

197
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,460
She came to falsely accuse me first.

198
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,060
She brought this upon herself.

199
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,380
Even if she died, she would deserve it.

200
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,060
She's the one
who tampered with the medicine.

201
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,340
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

202
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,820
(Right.)

203
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,020
(She wouldn't be so foolish
as to keep evidence.)

204
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,140
(In that case,)

205
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,540
(how about...)

206
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,380
How come you're fine?

207
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,940
I only said that
I found a packet of medicine

208
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,140
in your room.

209
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,420
I just wanted to ask about what it's for.

210
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,700
How did you conclude

211
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,220
that this is poison?

212
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,220
I...

213
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,180
Could it be that you feel guilty?

214
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,860
Nonsense.

215
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,540
Gentlemen,

216
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,500
I've already said
this was a misunderstanding.

217
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,940
My mother is just quick-tempered.

218
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,980
Sorry you had to see that.

219
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,940
Since this is a family matter
of the Commander's house,

220
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,420
we'd rather not intervene.

221
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
- We'll take our leave.
- We'll go.

222
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,060
(It seems the Military Department)

223
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,340
(is already under their control.)

224
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,220
No.

225
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,180
I have to check it out.
