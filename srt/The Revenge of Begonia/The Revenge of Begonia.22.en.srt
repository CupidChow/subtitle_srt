00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,020
=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,000
He isn't dead yet.

4
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,370
Why are you in such a hurry to mourn?

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,310
For He Xingzhou,

6
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,000
what a year he's having.

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,840
He just quit smoking,

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,790
and now he's been stabbed seriously
by the woman he loves.

9
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,590
He should really find a fortune teller.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,270
Hypocrite.

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,560
Xingzhou,

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,270
I heard you are feeling better today.

13
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,350
How do you feel?

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm fine now.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,830
By the way, I asked Yongxi

16
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,630
to bring
some rare medicinal herbs for you.

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,040
They're from our own stock,

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,630
better than what the doctor has.

19
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,580
Xingzhou,

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,500
you...

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,540
Thank you, Mrs. Mingting.

22
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,900
Take care.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,020
I'm a bit tired.

24
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,980
You two should go back.

25
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,300
Xingzhou, rest well.

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,620
We'll come to visit you another day.

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,380
Where is Anning?

28
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,300
To prevent you from being alone with her,

29
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,100
we have placed Mrs. Xingzhou
in a guest room.

30
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,700
How is she now?

31
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,660
The doctor said
she suffered a severe shock

32
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,940
and had fallen into hysteria.

33
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,260
She's been given sedatives
and sleeping pills.

34
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,780
She should still be sleeping.

35
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,660
Help me go see her.

36
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,980
Your body...

37
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,020
Anning.

38
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,140
Anning.

39
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,140
Anning.

40
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,220
Anning.

41
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,580
Take it away!

42
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,300
- Yes.
- Give it to me!

43
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,980
Go get the sedative now.

44
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,340
- Why?
- Anning, calm down.

45
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,380
Why don't you let me die?

46
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,020
It's alright.

47
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,100
It's alright.

48
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,220
It's alright. I'm here.

49
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,380
Commander, something happened.

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
A troop from nowhere

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,540
is pillaging

52
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,740
and harming civilians

53
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,580
outside the city.

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
What should we do?

55
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,680
Take the mansion's guards
to check it out first.

56
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,020
If necessary,

57
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,990
signal the Yuncheng Garrison.

58
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,260
Should all guards go?

59
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,900
There's no time. Go quickly.

60
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,900
Yes.

61
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,060
Anning,

62
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,980
you're awake.

63
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Who are you?

64
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,700
Where am I?

65
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,860
Anning,

66
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,780
it's me.

67
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,540
Sir, you're quite handsome.

68
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,820
It's me, Anning.

69
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,220
You're so fierce.

70
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,540
You're hurting me.

71
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,380
Anning, don't scare me.

72
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,500
Don't scare me.

73
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,260
(Why is He Mingting
bringing so many people)

74
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,980
(to Xingzhou's room?)

75
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,340
Let go of me! Let go of me!

76
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,140
Xingzhou, what happened?

77
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,260
Senior, you finally came.

78
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,660
Take me home quickly.

79
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,060
He's a bad man.

80
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,900
He keeps pulling and tugging at me.

81
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,780
Xingzhou,

82
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,140
you really are

83
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,860
having a bad streak.

84
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,260
What do you mean?

85
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,780
What do you want to do?

86
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,660
What do I want to do?

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,220
What I've always wanted to do

88
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,060
has never changed.

89
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,300
Do it.

90
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,020
It hurts.

91
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,460
Don't touch her.

92
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,220
Hit him.

93
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,060
Well done! Well done!

94
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,420
Step on him again.

95
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,780
He bullied me.

96
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
She's really gone mad.

97
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,220
What a pity.

98
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,660
Xingzhou,

99
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,580
if you weren't injured,

100
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,860
the few men I brought

101
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,340
might not be your match.

102
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,940
Thank you, Begonia.

103
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,180
Mingting,

104
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,940
I always respected you.

105
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,300
I never thought
you were this kind of person.

106
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,020
What kind of person should I be?

107
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,860
I'm just a cripple.

108
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,380
No one looks out for me.

109
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,740
I can only

110
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,820
find my own way out.

111
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,860
I never considered you a cripple.

112
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,220
That's because you're kind-hearted.

113
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,180
I appreciate your kindness.

114
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,580
I'll leave you a whole body.

115
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,860
If that's the case,

116
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,300
why not tell me everything before I die?

117
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,580
Father's death,

118
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,220
I was involved.

119
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,220
The opium you got addicted to

120
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,060
was made by me.

121
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,460
And these crippled legs

122
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,540
were healed long ago.

123
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,580
How's that?

124
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,660
Have you known enough?

125
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,820
Go check it out.

126
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,100
Yes.

127
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,140
Commander,

128
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,590
there was an explosion over there,

129
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
but no one was seen.

130
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,380
No one in the mansion was injured.

131
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,020
Got it.

132
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,940
Go and bring him back.

133
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,220
Alive or...

134
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,700
If he's not dead,

135
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,340
don't come back.

136
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,140
- Come with me.
- Yes.

137
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,460
What?

138
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,300
He Xingzhou fell off a cliff?

139
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,300
Yes.

140
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,380
I saw it with my own eyes.

141
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,740
The cliff is bottomless.

142
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,900
He must be dead falling down.

143
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,020
Must be dead?

144
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,460
Did you find the body?

145
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,540
We thought we should

146
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,540
report back immediately.

147
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,580
Then go and search again.

148
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,780
Take more people.

149
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,220
Yes.

150
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,620
A bunch of fools.

151
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,540
Little fish.

152
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,100
Little fish.

153
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,860
Yang Anning.

154
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,060
Miss.

155
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,620
Miss, do you want to catch fish together?

156
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,860
Fool,

157
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,580
he's dead
and all you care about is playing.

158
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,740
Fool?

159
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,700
Who's the fool?

160
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,540
You are.

161
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,420
You?

162
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,220
Miss, you're the fool.

163
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,940
- Are you pretending to be a fool?
- Miss, you're the fool.

164
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,060
Are you pretending to be a fool?

165
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,260
Miss,

166
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,540
how can you be so careless?

167
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,300
It must hurt a lot.

168
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,220
I will soothe it for you, okay?

169
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,420
What are you both doing?

170
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,180
Senior.

171
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,300
She is not happy.

172
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,460
Then sing an opera.

173
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,380
It will make her happy.

174
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,260
Opera?

175
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,020
What's opera?

176
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,060
I can't sing.

177
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,740
It's alright.

178
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,980
I'll teach you.

179
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,340
Then,

180
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,380
will you come play with us?

181
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,500
Her?

182
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,060
Her beloved fell off a cliff.

183
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,660
No one knows if he's still alive.

184
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
She's not in the mood.

185
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,060
But she is crying.

186
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,940
That's happy tears.

187
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,780
- Let's go.
- Let's go sing opera.

188
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,100
Senior, hurry up, come.

189
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,060
Stop, stop, stop.

190
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,380
Look at me.

191
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,500
I'll teach you.

192
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,860
Right.

193
