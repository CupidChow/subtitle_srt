00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,020
=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,220
=Episode 1=

3
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,740
(He Xingzhou, Commander's second son)

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,400
When did you come back?

5
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,870
Why didn't you wake me up?

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,090
(Yang Anning, renowned actress in Yuncheng)
My Lord, don't be angry.

7
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,160
There were guests today,
and an extra act was added to the play,

8
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,120
so I came back late.

9
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,080
So,

10
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,230
you went to accompany another man?

11
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,390
Are you

12
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,630
jealous?

13
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,510
We agreed at the beginning.

14
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,950
If you like me,

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
you can do anything you want,

16
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,800
but you can't restrict my

17
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,350
freedom.

18
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,800
You're mine.

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,630
Who would dare touch you?

20
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,160
Well,

21
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,360
you'll have to ask Miss Lu Yongxi,

22
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,120
that noble lady.

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,520
When did you have the right

24
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,550
to comment on my matters?

25
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,830
Why do you get anxious

26
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,670
every time Miss Lu is mentioned?

27
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,910
These days in Yuncheng,
everyone is talking

28
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,000
about her soon marrying a disabled man.

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,030
Even I feel pity for her,

30
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,110
so I...

31
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,750
Yang Anning,

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,600
this is the last time I warn you.

33
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,550
Mind your own business.

34
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,750
Don't cross the line.

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,600
I just can't accept it.

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,390
Being truly loved by you,
the young marshal,

37
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,160
is enviable indeed.

38
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,000
Begonia,

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,720
only you know

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,470
how sincere your words are.

41
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,280
(Senior,)

42
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,090
(I've been living in He Xingzhou's villa)

43
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,110
(for a year now,)

44
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,070
(but I found nothing.)

45
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,320
Senior.

46
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,390
Senior,

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,200
what's wrong with you, Senior?

48
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,040
Senior.

49
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,110
Commander's

50
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,790
Mansion.

51
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
Senior.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,920
Senior.

53
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,640
Wake up, Senior.

54
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,790
Master!

55
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,080
Master!

56
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,170
Master!

57
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,210
Master!

58
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,760
Master!

59
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,690
(But Senior,)

60
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,830
(I won't give up.)

61
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,990
(I will figure out a way
to enter the Commander's Mansion)

62
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,600
(and find the true murderer.)

63
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,110
Miss Yang.

64
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,460
(Zhao Xiaochuan, He Xingzhou's aide)

65
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,040
I forgot to bring this begonia inside
last night.

66
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,760
Such a pity.

67
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,040
Nothing to feel pity for.

68
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,390
Just some withered flowers and willows.

69
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,200
As long as Xingzhou's treasure is fine.

70
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
That's what matters.

71
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,780
(Yuncheng Grand Theater)

72
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,770
(Begonia in "The Peony Pavilion")
Safety matches! cigarettes!

73
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,410
Take a look at the cigarettes!

74
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,680
She really brought Du Liniang to life.

75
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
My Lord,
won't you go in and support her?

76
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
Miss Yang would surely be delighted.

77
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,600
No need.

78
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't like watching plays.

79
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,920
Did you buy the flowers I asked for?

80
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,350
There were no jasmines, only roses.

81
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,550
Maybe Miss Yang will like roses.

82
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,070
Who told you the flowers were for her?

83
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,920
Miss Yang, where are you going?

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,230
Don't rush off.

85
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,700
(Ma Yaozu, Vice Commander's son)
Sing a piece

86
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,640
for me.

87
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,070
Mr. Ma,

88
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,070
it's too late today.

89
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,550
I'll sing for you tomorrow.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,350
Tomorrow? I'm not even sure

91
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,430
whether I'm still alive tomorrow.

92
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,880
Why don't you come back with me?

93
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,270
We can spend a wonderful night

94
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,510
together.

95
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,840
Let go of me! Let go!

96
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,000
Ma Yaozu.

97
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,230
You!

98
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,670
Begonia!

99
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,040
I was wondering
who was making such a commotion.

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,040
Turns out it's the Vice Commander's son.

101
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,550
Mr. He,

102
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,640
I didn't know she was yours.

103
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,640
Either shoot me

104
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,110
or

105
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,640
get lost.

106
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,790
Misunderstanding.

107
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,200
This is a misunderstanding.

108
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,070
Sorry, sorry.

109
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,390
Xingzhou.

110
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,200
Xingzhou.

111
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,550
If you cause me trouble again,

112
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,760
immediately move out of the villa.

113
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,040
Don't be angry.

114
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,720
You jerk! I'll kill you!

115
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,670
Don't move!

116
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,630
Yang Anning!

117
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,160
Yang Anning!

118
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,320
Xiaochuan, don't hurt anyone.

119
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,500
Yes.

120
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,320
Yang Anning, Yang Anning!

121
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,360
Yang Anning,

122
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,640
hold on.

123
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,150
Xingzhou, be gentle.

124
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,550
It hurts.

125
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,590
Now you know it hurts.

126
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,080
Where did that reckless attitude go

127
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,920
just now?

128
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,840
The moment I saw you were in danger,

129
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,520
I couldn't think of anything else.

130
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,520
Bear with it.

131
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,550
Wait.

132
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
All done.

133
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,990
You really don't want
to go to the hospital?

134
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,760
Though I didn't need it,

135
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,960
you did save me.

136
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,670
Tell me.

137
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,520
What do you want?

138
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,590
I heard the Commander's Mansion

139
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,350
was converted from a royal mansion,

140
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,960
lavish and grand,
comparable to the Forbidden City.

141
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,000
I wonder if the beds there

142
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,000
are as soft as those in the villa.

143
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,230
Would you care to show me around?

144
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,110
That place is
a dragon's lair and tiger's den.

145
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,320
You could lose your life.

146
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,080
With you to protect me,

147
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,440
what should I be afraid of?

148
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,400
Well done.

149
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,880
The Vice Commander is very satisfied.

150
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,960
Here are fifty silver dollars.

151
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,670
Take it and leave Yuncheng immediately,

152
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,790
never to return.

153
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,190
Thank you, Miss.

154
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,340
(He's Mansion)

155
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,500
(He's Mansion)
You wench,

156
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,200
do you even know your place?

157
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,390
You think

158
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,690
you're worthy of entering this door?

159
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,710
Still want to see the Commander?

160
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,650
I want to see the Commander.

161
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,440
Do you still want to see the Commander?

162
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,640
Today, the Commander will return.

163
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,880
Don't cause a loss of life.

164
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,990
Yes.

165
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,720
Get lost now!

166
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,670
Yang Anning, what's wrong with you?

167
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,360
Nothing.

168
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,540
I'm just intimidated
by the grandeur of the Commander's Mansion.

169
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,760
Suddenly feeling a bit nervous.

170
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,180
Is that so?

171
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,350
Then let's go back.

172
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,400
The army is ready to move.

173
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,350
How can the General flee the battlefield?

174
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
If I accidentally offend someone,

175
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,880
remember to back me up.

176
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,680
Let's go.

177
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,790
Wait a moment.

178
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,310
Done.

179
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Let's go.

180
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,510
(Senior,)

181
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,200
(I swear)

182
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,400
(to find out everything)

183
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,350
(and make those who harmed you)

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,150
(pay the price.)

185
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,030
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

186
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,950
My Lord,

187
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,440
what is that place?

188
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
The Forbidden Area.

189
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,710
Inside are the aggrieved souls of the Hes.

190
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm most afraid of these things.

191
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,230
What's there to be afraid of?

192
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,590
The human heart is much scarier than this.

193
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,800
My Lord,

194
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,320
wait for me.

195
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,070
My Lord.

196
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,550
My Lord.

197
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
My Lord,

198
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
Lord He

199
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,550
is waiting for you in the study.

200
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,030
Wasn't he at the military camp?

201
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,440
He came back early last night

202
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
feeling unwell.

203
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,280
Wait here for me.

204
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,800
Don't wander off.

205
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,080
(In such a beautiful scene,)

206
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,670
(how much evil is hidden?)

207
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,000
(The person with that petal jewelry)

208
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,880
(must be here somewhere.)

209
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,470
You must be Begonia, right?
