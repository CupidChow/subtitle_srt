=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,080
Xingzhou, Xingzhou,

4
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
I'm begging you.

5
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,240
Take me with you.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,470
I realize now

7
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,150
that I can't leave you.

8
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,430
I simply can't leave you.

9
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,500
I love you.

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,300
Lu Yongxi,

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,380
I hope this is the last time

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,980
you exploit our past feelings.

13
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,900
What are you looking at?

14
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,780
(He's Mansion)

15
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,250
They're coming out.

16
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,820
You're waiting until it's dark.

17
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,900
Looks like you're latching
onto our family.

18
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,460
This wedding was agreed upon

19
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,620
by the Commander himself.

20
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,020
How dare you go back on your word?

21
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,780
Using the Commander to pressure me?

22
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,660
It's a pity.

23
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,260
I'm in charge of today's wedding.

24
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,260
Since you're so eager
to marry into our family,

25
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,820
I'll grant your wish.

26
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,100
Except for our new Mrs. Xingzhou,

27
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,900
no one else

28
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,700
is allowed inside the mansion.

29
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,340
Anning,

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,100
I feel this woman has ill intentions.

31
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,700
Be careful.

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,100
Don't worry, Yumei.

33
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,940
Still looking?

34
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,740
As the bride steps over the brazier,

35
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,940
no evil spirits allowed.

36
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,060
As the bride enters through the shorts,

37
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,500
the family will be
blessed and prosperous.

38
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,020
Don't want to marry anymore?

39
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,020
There's still time.

40
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,180
As the bride gets checked,

41
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,500
a life of honor and riches is ensured.

42
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,460
Hurry up, take off your clothes.

43
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,500
Let go of me!

44
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,740
- Quickly!
- Let go!

45
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,980
- Take off your clothes!
- Hurry!

46
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,260
Don't touch me!

47
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,100
- Let go!
- Don't move!

48
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,580
- Let go of me!
- Take off your clothes!

49
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,420
Let go!

50
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,580
Let go of me!

51
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,580
Let go!

52
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,460
My Lady,

53
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,060
you're going too far.

54
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,060
What's wrong?

55
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,700
How would I know unless I check?

56
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,340
You might bring some dirty disease
to our family

57
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,460
to tarnish our reputation.

58
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,380
Mother,

59
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,940
don't make a big deal out of it.

60
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,420
If it gets to Father's ears,

61
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,260
it won't be good.

62
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Fine.

63
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,940
We won't check.

64
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,940
You

65
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,380
just kneel in this courtyard.

66
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,700
Before midnight,

67
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,500
if He Xingzhou
returns and marries you,

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,300
then you'll be the true Mrs. Xingzhou.

69
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,020
Kneel farther away.

70
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,500
(Prosperous and Harmony)

71
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,380
(Yuncheng Grand Theater,
Begonia's "The Peony Pavilion")

72
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,660
Why are you kneeling here?

73
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,500
I thought you didn't want to marry me.

74
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,940
Who said that?

75
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,420
Let's get married right now.

76
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,620
First bow to the heavens.

77
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,910
Second bow to the parents.

78
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,400
Third bow to each other.

79
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,050
The ceremony is complete.

80
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,260
(Senior,)

81
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,860
(I hope your soul)

82
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,220
(can help me)

83
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,820
(find out the truth as soon as possible)

84
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,140
(and seek revenge for you.)

85
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,140
Why don't you sleep a bit longer?

86
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,220
Let me off, My Lord.

87
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,180
I almost broke my back last night.

88
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,580
If I sleep longer,
I won't be able to get up.

89
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,140
Are you praising me?

90
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,180
Then I'll try even harder.

91
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,340
Alright, stop fooling around.
I just finished my makeup.

92
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,460
We still have important matters
to attend to later.

93
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,700
Serve tea to Mrs. He.

94
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,820
My Lord, the Commander is back.

95
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,300
He's asking for you in the study now.

96
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,100
Commander, you wanted me.

97
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,740
Now that you're married,

98
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,540
focus and prepare

99
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,460
to take over my position soon.

100
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,380
Recently, I've been feeling

101
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,900
spiritually weak.

102
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,340
It seems I'm truly getting old.

103
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,020
Let me.

104
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,540
Inspector Zhao from above

105
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,460
is coming to Yuncheng for an inspection.

106
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,490
You're responsible
for welcoming him properly.

107
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,460
If you can
develop a relationship with him,

108
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,020
it will greatly

109
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,580
benefit your future.

110
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,660
Yes.

111
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,980
By the way, how many months has it been

112
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,820
since Anning conceived?

113
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,260
I had a fortune teller check.

114
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,420
It seems that the first child

115
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,820
of our family's next generation,

116
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,620
will be a boy.

117
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,380
Thank you for caring, Commander.

118
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,660
It's been two months already.

119
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,180
Just now, Anning said
she wanted to serve you tea.

120
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,780
What are we waiting for then?

121
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,700
Let's go.

122
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,420
Mama, please have some tea.

123
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,260
My Lady,

124
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
please have some tea.

125
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,860
Yongxi,

126
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,700
was yesterday hard on you?

127
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,660
Not at all.

128
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,620
If there's anything you need,
just tell me anytime.

129
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,460
My Lady, please have some tea.

130
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,260
How dare you dodge!

131
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,100
I...

132
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,660
I didn't touch her.

133
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,860
She fell on her own.

134
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,380
Anning!

135
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,380
- Go get the doctor!
- Yes.

136
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,860
What's going on? Go quickly!

137
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,420
My Lady,

138
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,620
no matter how much you dislike me,

139
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,820
you shouldn't harm
the child in my belly.

140
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
After all,
it's the flesh and blood of the Hes.

141
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,460
You wicked woman!

142
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,740
What nonsense are you spouting?

143
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,940
Who harmed you?

144
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,140
My Lord, I...

145
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,980
What have you done?

146
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,580
I... I...

147
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,700
My Lord, I didn't... I...

148
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,620
Commander...

149
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,020
Xingzhou, help me calm Commander down.

150
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,740
It's my fault.

151
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,940
I knelt for too long yesterday.

152
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,420
I was feeling unwell last night.

153
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,620
I shouldn't have soldiered on

154
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,860
and come to serve tea.

155
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,660
Why did you kneel yesterday?

156
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,060
Mr. Xingzhou,

157
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,460
the doctor is here.

158
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,300
Hurry!

159
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,980
Take your wife to see the doctor now!

160
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,460
Kneel! Get me the whip!

161
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,020
My Lord, don't!

162
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,180
My Lord, it's my fault!

163
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,100
Why did you do that?

164
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,580
- Father!
- I'll kill you!

165
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,780
Father!

166
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,260
Father, you can talk to her properly.

167
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,540
You've been married for many years.

168
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,860
You don't have to do this.

169
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,660
Why don't you ask her

170
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,500
about what she did?

171
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,420
If it weren't for the fear of gossip,
I would have divorced her!

172
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,100
- Father, please calm down.
- My Lord, don't...

173
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,460
You

174
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,140
are so unforgiving.

175
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,340
How can you manage the household?

176
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,660
How can you act
as the head of the household?

177
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,500
Starting today,

178
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,620
I'll leave this house

179
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,340
to Yongxi and Anning to manage.

180
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,900
Take your time to reflect on yourself!

181
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,260
My Lord!

182
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,180
Mother.

183
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,100
Take her away.

184
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,660
Yes.

185
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,980
Do you all understand

186
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,220
what to tell the Commander later?

187
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,020
Understood, understood.

188
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,820
Are you satisfied now?

189
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,660
Isn't this what you wanted to see?

190
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,540
If it weren't for your cooperation,

191
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
I couldn't have

192
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,660
pulled off this act alone.

193
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,340
You truly are Begonia.

194
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,980
This move killed two birds
with one stone.

195
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,940
Even the old man was fooled.

196
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,140
How many more tricks
do you have up your sleeve

197
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,140
that I don't know about?

198
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,820
My Lord, don't misunderstand me.

199
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,580
I'm doing this for you.

200
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,700
You don't like Mrs. He,

201
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,980
do you?

202
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,260
Don't try to figure out
my thoughts anymore.

203
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,980
Got it?

204
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,940
Behave yourself from now on.

205
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,740
Don't cause any more trouble,

206
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,740
or even I can't save you then.
