(Cheng's Medical)

4
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,900
Take this three times a day.

5
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,380
Make sure to take it on time.

6
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,220
Thank you, Doctor.

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,180
Next one.

8
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,460
I'm sorry,

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,340
Miss Yumei,

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,340
I need to know everything about Begonia.

11
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,620
Kill me if you must.

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,220
I don't know anything.

13
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,700
Commander! Commander!

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,500
Mrs. Xingzhou is in great pain.

15
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,960
It looks like
she's having a miscarriage.

16
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,860
Help me...

17
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,420
You really don't want our child, do you?

18
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,860
Why did you decide
to get rid of it on your own?

19
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

20
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,420
It hurts...

21
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,580
Anning!

22
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,540
Is everything you said true?

23
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,740
Absolutely.

24
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,380
Xingzhou,

25
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm thirsty.

26
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,300
What are you doing?

27
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,100
I should be asking you that.

28
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,860
Why did you go through so much trouble

29
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
to get close to my family,

30
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,940
and me?

31
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,900
You know the answer.

32
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,580
You...

33
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,300
You know everything?

34
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,340
Know what?

35
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,420
That you meticulously planned

36
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,580
to avenge Snowdrop?

37
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,460
Or that you'd rather
take medicine to miscarry

38
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,220
than give birth to my child?

39
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,060
No, no, Xingzhou, it's not like that.

40
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,980
Love at first sight?

41
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,020
Risking your life to shield me?
All lies!

42
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,860
No...

43
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,700
It's all

44
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,900
part of your plan, Yang Anning.

45
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,700
No...

46
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,580
Yang Anning,

47
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,060
what were you thinking

48
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,300
every night you lay with me?

49
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,620
Were you thinking about your senior?

50
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,380
So that's how you really see me

51
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,940
in your heart.

52
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,820
What about you?

53
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,460
Are you that innocent?

54
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,380
What do you mean?

55
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,020
I'm asking you.

56
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,340
What did you do to Senior

57
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,760
when he came to He's Mansion
for the private performance?

58
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,180
Yes.

59
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,260
I did see Snowdrop that day.

60
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,580
You should leave now.

61
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,300
Don't let Ma see you.

62
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,340
Thank you, Mr. Xingzhou.

63
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,140
That's what happened.

64
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,540
I don't care if you believe it,

65
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,940
Yang Anning.

66
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,860
Where are you going?

67
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,980
Since things have come to this,

68
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,700
there's no need for us
to be entangled any longer.

69
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,860
What are you doing?

70
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,740
He Xingzhou, what are you doing?

71
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,780
What are you doing?

72
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,140
What are you doing?

73
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,980
Let go of me!

74
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,300
Let go of me!

75
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,060
You deceived me.

76
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,820
Do you think

77
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,820
I will just let you go like this?

78
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,900
I'll make you wish for death

79
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,300
but be unable to die.

80
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,060
From now on,

81
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,060
you won't be able to leave this room.

82
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,980
You're imprisoning me?

83
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,380
I hold grudges deeply.

84
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,820
From the moment

85
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,540
you schemed to appear before me,

86
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,220
you should have expected
this day to come.

87
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,620
Let go of me! Let go!

88
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,340
Yang Anning,

89
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,480
don't make futile resistance.

90
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,900
If I find out
you're asking anyone for help,

91
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,740
I will twist their head off

92
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,780
and place it before you.

93
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,620
(Cheng's Medical)

94
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,340
Manager Li?

95
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,740
Yumei, it's been over ten days,

96
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,540
and there's no news of Begonia.

97
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,460
My customers

98
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,860
complain every day.

99
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,020
Do you know

100
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,060
what's going on?

101
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,380
Kill me if you must.

102
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,340
I don't know anything.

103
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,260
Didn't you call the Commander's Mansion?

104
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,830
My dear,

105
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,380
the Commander's Mansion

106
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,380
is not a place you can call
without causing trouble.

107
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,580
Yumei, you and Begonia are like sisters.

108
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,140
Can you go to the Commander's Mansion

109
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,180
and see what's happening?

110
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,860
Alright.

111
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,580
This...

112
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,340
- I'll go right now.
- Sure.

113
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,620
I need to deliver the medicine.

114
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,580
I'll come right out, okay?

115
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,740
(He's Mansion)
Can't you say something?

116
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,540
I'm just here to deliver the medicine.

117
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,460
Are you all mute?

118
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,380
Say something.

119
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,700
Hey!

120
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,620
What's going on?

121
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,820
She doesn't have a pass,

122
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,980
but she insists on entering.

123
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,860
Mr. Zhao, you're here just in time.

124
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,140
I'm here to deliver pregnancy medicine
to Begonia.

125
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,460
I'll deliver it and leave immediately.

126
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,980
Please help me.

127
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,180
Follow me.

128
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,820
Mrs. Xingzhou is sick.

129
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,260
Sick? When did she get sick?

130
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,380
Did she see a doctor?

131
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,340
Is she better?

132
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,180
Nothing's been diagnosed yet.

133
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,180
We only know it's contagious,

134
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,300
so she can't see anyone now.

135
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,860
You can talk through the door.

136
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,660
I'll be right here.

137
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,800
Call me if you need anything.

138
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,500
Anning.

139
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,460
Anning,

140
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
can you hear me?

141
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,600
Yumei.

142
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,210
Are you alright?

143
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,060
If I find out
you're asking anyone for help,

144
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,340
I'll twist their head off

145
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,380
and place it before you.

146
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm fine,

147
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,860
just very ill.

148
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,660
Is it very painful?

149
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,540
You don't sound right.

150
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,220
It's not too painful.

151
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,260
I'll get better soon.

152
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,220
You know my medical skills.

153
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,580
Let me in to check on you,

154
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,660
please.

155
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,620
I don't want to infect you.

156
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,140
The doctor said I'd be fine soon.

157
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,540
I promise.

158
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,220
Alright then.

159
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,220
Remember to tell me
if you need anything.

160
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,500
I'll leave the pregnancy medicine

161
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,740
at your door.

162
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,860
Remember to drink it.

163
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,020
Take care of the baby,
especially since you're not well.

164
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,980
Alright.

165
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,860
I'm leaving now.

166
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,520
Let's go.

167
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,180
Commander, I've investigated.

168
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,620
Since Meng Xueqiao left the mansion,

169
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,780
no one has seen him.

170
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,060
However...

171
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,940
However what?

172
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,500
That night, someone saw Mr. Mingting

173
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
bring someone back.

174
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,820
