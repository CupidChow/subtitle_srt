=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,840
Don't try to figure out
my thoughts anymore.

4
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,560
Got it?

5
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,040
Behave yourself from now on.

6
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't cause any more trouble,

7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,240
or even I can't save you then.

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,630
Thank you, My Lord.

9
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,550
My Lord, the meeting time

10
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,190
with the Inspector's secretary
is approaching.

11
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,270
I have urgent matters to handle
in the coming days

12
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,110
and will be back later.

13
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,670
My Lord.

14
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,790
Mrs. Xingzhou,

15
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,830
I've brought over
the ledgers you requested.

16
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,120
How often are the jewelry and valuables

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,310
from each room inventoried?

18
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,880
Mrs. Xingzhou,

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,600
they are inventoried every month.

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,910
Have they been checked this month yet?

21
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,430
Due to the wedding preparations this month,

22
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,910
Mrs. He

23
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,190
has not yet reviewed them.

24
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,240
Then this is a good opportunity
for me to learn.

25
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,390
Alright, I'll make the arrangements.

26
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,500
(Ledger)

27
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,750
(None of them match.)

28
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,360
(No jewelry matches the mark)

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,960
(on Senior's neck.)

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,470
Is everything here?

31
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,550
Mrs. Xingzhou, everything is here.

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,720
If anything is missing,
it would only be...

33
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
What is it?

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,630
It's the items from the Forbidden Area.

35
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,600
They are all sealed

36
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,750
and never inventoried.

37
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,360
Why is that?

38
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,600
Apart from Mr. Xingzhou,

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,240
no one is allowed to enter at will,

40
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,180
so...

41
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,380
This is outrageous!

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,320
An actress,

43
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,660
relying on the power of stewardship,

44
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,880
is throwing her weight around here!

45
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,220
What's the matter?

46
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,620
Why so angry?

47
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,740
That shameless woman

48
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,160
is actually checking the jewelry
and valuables in each room.

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,340
She isn't even qualified to look at them!

50
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,260
Just thinking about it makes me angry.

51
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,220
In my view,

52
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,300
you should take this chance

53
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,340
to rest and heal.

54
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,220
(If this continues,)

55
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
(this little wench)

56
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,740
(will try to step over me
sooner or later.)

57
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,700
(Might as well
deal with her once and for all.)

58
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,820
Where is that wench now?

59
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,620
Seems she went to the theater.

60
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,220
(Zhao's Mansion)

61
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,860
(Visit Card)

62
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,500
What's this?

63
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
(He Xingzhou)

64
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,170
Mr. He,

65
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,100
Vice Commander Ma has just brought over

66
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,380
the documents needed by the Inspector.

67
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,240
The Inspector currently
has no time to meet you.

68
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,260
Xiaochuan,

69
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,540
let's wait outside.

70
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,380
(Zhao's Mansion)

71
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,320
Thank you for waiting.

72
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,420
The Inspector has invited
Vice Commander Ma for dinner tonight.

73
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,540
You can come back another day.

74
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,420
We had already agreed over the phone!

75
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,980
It's been messed up
by Vice Commander Ma again.

76
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,500
Let him stir things up.

77
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,580
I'm determined to get this done.

78
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,620
Who gave you the courage

79
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,280
to mess with the people
of the Commander's Mansion?

80
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,060
Take them down!

81
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,580
Stop right there!

82
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,220
Mr. Mingting.

83
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,620
Thank you for saving me just now.

84
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,460
You're welcome.

85
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,860
I was just out buying books
and happened to run into you.

86
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,940
Too bad we couldn't catch them.

87
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,220
What book did you buy?

88
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,940
The Peony Pavilion.

89
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,820
I've always loved opera,

90
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,420
but it's unfortunate
that I can't frequent the theater now

91
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,140
to support you.

92
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,540
If you like it,

93
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,460
I can sing for you here from now on.

94
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,540
That would be wonderful.

95
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,300
I'm truly fortunate.

96
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,980
Your voice has a unique charm,

97
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,980
though there's a slight imperfection.

98
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,620
Is that so?

99
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,580
Could you explain in detail?

100
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,860
Your voice is rich

101
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,580
but lacks stamina.

102
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,780
Singing for long can hurt your throat.

103
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,460
Indeed, that's true.

104
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,660
Don't worry.

105
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,020
I have a way to help.

106
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,340
Here.

107
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,300
Try this.

108
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,540
Does this work?

109
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,060
Your method is truly effective.

110
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,520
Let's talk more another day.

111
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,300
Here.

112
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,260
(The Peony Pavilion)

113
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,460
Xingzhou.

114
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,160
Xingzhou.

115
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,420
I'm injured.

116
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,780
Look!

117
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,260
What happened?

118
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,540
Tonight, I encountered two thugs.

119
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,460
Thankfully, Mr. Mingting saved me.

120
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,660
I didn't realize

121
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,220
you two had gotten so close.

122
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,100
What?

123
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,540
Are you jealous?

124
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,980
I'm not familiar with him.

125
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,700
We just talked for a bit

126
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,220
on the road.

127
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,940
Xingzhou,

128
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,660
can you teach me how to use a gun?

129
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,100
Why don't you ask Mingting to teach you?

130
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,060
Will you teach me or not?

131
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,860
No.

132
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,300
Why not?

133
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,140
Your hands

134
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,900
were made for the stage,

135
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,540
not for the guns.

136
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,420
Today was my oversight.

137
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,060
From now on,

138
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,220
I'll assign more people to protect you.

139
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,180
(Who exactly wants to harm me?)

140
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,940
(Liang Rufen?)

141
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,820
(Regardless,)

142
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,780
(I must find a way to protect myself.)

143
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,180
Stop. Who are you?

144
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,340
I'm Mrs. Xingzhou.

145
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,540
He sent me to practice shooting.

146
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,220
Hand it over.

147
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,980
What?

148
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,820
Your pass.

149
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,900
Pass?

150
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,140
Don't you recognize me?

151
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,740
I'm Mrs. Xingzhou.

152
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,220
Before, someone claimed
to be Mr. Xingzhou's concubine,

153
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,180
trying to sneak in,
but she turned out to be a spy.

154
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,460
You say you're Mrs. Xingzhou.

155
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,300
How can you prove it?

156
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,020
I...

157
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,140
You can't show a pass

158
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,420
or prove your identity.

159
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,940
Who are you really?

160
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,060
You two...

161
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,940
Mr. Mingting.

162
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,500
My Lord.

163
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,420
You're out of line

164
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,180
to treat Mrs. Xingzhou like this.

165
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,340
If Mr. Xingzhou finds out,

166
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,860
do you still want to live?

167
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,260
My apologies for not recognizing you.

168
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,660
Please forgive me, Mrs. Xingzhou.

169
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,460
Now, open the gate.

170
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,020
Yes.

171
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,460
Mr. Mingting, let's go.

172
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,180
Thank you, Mr. Mingting.

173
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,700
You're welcome.

174
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,700
We're all family.

175
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,740
Did you come here to learn to shoot

176
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,660
because of what happened yesterday?

177
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,660
The theater is full of
all sorts of people.

178
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,020
I don't want to always trouble Xingzhou.

179
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,580
Here, try this.

180
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,540
This one.

181
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,060
Spread your legs a bit more.

182
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,860
Bring that hand up.

183
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,900
Here.

184
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,460
Right.

185
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,420
Support this hand.

186
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,220
Lift it slightly.

187
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,100
Now, straighten your back.

188
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,260
(Actresses are naturally shameless,)

189
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,700
(always ready
to throw themselves at any man.)

190
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,420
(You're truly not worthy
