00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,020
=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,110
Say it.

4
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,950
The gifts for the Inspector

5
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,840
were all returned.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,190
It must be Vice Commander Ma
messing things up behind the scenes.

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,360
Should we warn him?

8
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,590
On what grounds?

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,720
If it gets blown up to the old man,

10
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,990
it would just make me look incompetent.

11
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,630
Let's think of another plan.

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,360
But the Inspector is leaving in two days,

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,750
and we haven't even met him.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,470
Xingzhou.

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,310
Talk to you later.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,750
Xingzhou,

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,080
are you busy?

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,190
Mrs. Mingting, what brings you here?

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,360
It's about Begonia.

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,910
I don't know whether I should tell you.

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,440
Then don't say it.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,830
But I think

23
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,400
you should know.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,800
Wait for me, Xingzhou.

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,200
Mr. Mingting,

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,640
you...

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,190
You can't be like this.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,270
When you face an enemy,

29
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,830
you can't retreat,

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,000
or show fear.

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
You need to hold the gun steady

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,590
like this,

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,720
and then...

34
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,310
Mr. Mingting, you're so skilled.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,960
Have you learned it?

36
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,590
Have a try.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,880
Mingting, I don't need you

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,720
to teach my wife.

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,440
If you're free,

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,110
you should teach your own woman.

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Yongxi,

42
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,910
do you want to learn how to shoot?

43
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,750
I can teach you.

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,800
Since you're not interested,

45
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,470
and I'm tired anyway,

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,830
let's go back.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Bye, Begonia.

48
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,240
What are you standing there for?

49
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,240
It seems you really enjoy

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,110
challenging me.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,470
I'm just learning how to shoot.

52
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,910
Who else would teach me
since you refused?

53
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,190
Really want me to teach you?

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,590
Steady your hand.

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Why are you looking at me? Look ahead.

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,440
If you ever see Mingting again
behind my back,

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,160
you can get out of the He's Mansion.

58
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,030
My Lord, you're quite fiery today.

59
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Could it be
that something has upset you?

60
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,030
I have encountered some troubles lately.

61
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,880
I heard that a high-ranking official

62
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,910
named Zhao from the capital

63
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,630
specifically requested
to hear Begonia perform.

64
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,750
It just so happens
I'm on leave for a while.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,030
I heard Manager Li
is nearly driven mad by this.

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,350
Xingzhou, where are you taking me?

67
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,760
To meet Zhao Zheng and perform for him.

68
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,760
So, I'm just a stepping stone for you?

69
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,200
I could help,

70
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,670
but what's in it for me?

71
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,230
What trick are you playing now?

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,880
I dare not.

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,880
But I haven't done my makeup yet.

74
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,950
Going like this,

75
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,230
not only would it not work out,

76
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,600
but it might also bring blame.

77
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,390
Turn around
and take Mrs. Xingzhou back for makeup.

78
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,380
(He's Mansion)

79
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,350
Are you ready?

80
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,830
Going to see the Inspector

81
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,180
requires presenting
the best version of myself.

82
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,950
You wouldn't want me

83
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,230
to embarrass you, right?

84
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,000
Where are my pearl earrings?

85
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,510
What are you doing?

86
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,550
What are you doing?

87
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,230
Put me down.

88
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,640
We'll talk terms in the car.

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
He Xingzhou!

90
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,830
The Inspector is not here today.

91
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,760
Please return.

92
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,640
I have urgent matters.

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,230
Tell me where the Inspector is.

94
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,640
Knowing the Inspector
loves Begonia's performances,

95
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,070
Vice Commander Ma,

96
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,230
invited him to Lingyun Restaurant
to listen to a play.

97
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Unnecessary people should not disturb.

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,320
Inspector, it's tough on you.

99
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,600
I'll drink to that first.

100
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,540
(Ma Sihai, Vice Commander of Yuncheng)

101
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,920
Does this restaurant's wine

102
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,000
not suit your taste?

103
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,160
I'll change it right away.

104
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,950
Change the wine!

105
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,070
The wine is good,

106
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,580
(Zhao Zheng, Inspector)
but the accompanying dishes

107
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,160
do not match this fine liquor.

108
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,670
Sorry. I almost forgot!

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,600
Today's focus

110
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,670
is on Begonia.

111
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,350
Begonia usually performs

112
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,880
at Yuncheng Grand Theater.

113
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,320
I've been here a few days

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,350
and heard she was ill and on leave.

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,880
But you managed to invite her.

116
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,880
It must have been difficult.

117
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,830
Begonia is still unwell

118
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,070
and might pass the illness to you,

119
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
so you have to hear the play like this.

120
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,070
Who knew

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,480
spring

122
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,950
was covered

123
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,110
by snow?

124
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,550
If I sang like this,

125
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,760
I'd have broken the stage by now.

126
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,910
Stop.

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,110
That's not Begonia.

128
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,790
Maybe the illness

129
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,110
affected her voice.

130
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,950
Inspector, don't be upset.

131
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
Vice Commander Ma,

132
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,720
during my days in Yuncheng,

133
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,830
I treated you with utmost respect.

134
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,110
I didn't expect you
to deceive me like this.

135
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:36,320
♪All flowers bloom♪

136
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:51,280
♪All are given away freely♪

137
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,160
Begonia.

138
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,130
Inspector, if you want to hear a play,

139
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,550
just notify us and it will be arranged.

140
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,350
I'm at your beck and call.

141
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,070
This is

142
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,790
the second son of Commander He,

143
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,030
the young marshal of Yuncheng.

144
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,210
Today's performance

145
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,280
is a surprise

146
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,350
specially arranged for you.

147
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,580
A surprise.

148
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,470
Take your people and leave.

149
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,960
Don't spoil my mood.

150
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,720
And you.

151
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,440
I'm leaving now.

152
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,780
If you have any instructions later,

153
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,540
let someone inform me immediately.

154
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,860
Apologies for the intrusion,

155
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,940
and please don't take offense

156
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,180
at our forwardness, Inspector.

157
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,020
Fair enough.

158
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,260
Begonia,

159
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,220
you and Mr. He are...

160
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,060
Well.

161
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,100
Perhaps that's a question for Mr. He.

162
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,900
He Xingzhou, you're quite bold,

163
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,260
using your power to bully others
and monopolize Begonia.

164
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,900
Inspector, you misunderstand.

165
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,620
Begonia is my lawfully wedded wife.

166
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,340
You're the second son of Commander He.

167
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,220
How could you have married
an actress as a wife?

168
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,260
Do you think I'm a fool?

169
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,940
Inspector, you speak of justice

170
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,500
for Begonia,

171
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,890
yet your heart harbors the same prejudice

172
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,900
against the theater as others.

173
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,500
This shows you're not truly
a lover of the arts.

174
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,340
You...

175
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,340
I could kill you right now,

176
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,620
and He Zhenyun
wouldn't dare say a word against it.

177
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,420
Mr. Zhao,

178
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,980
I may not understand opera

179
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,700
or enjoy watching it,

180
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,140
but I fully appreciate
that a minute on stage

181
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,500
is the result of ten years of hard work.

182
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,820
Since I have married her,

183
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,980
I will not allow anyone

184
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,260
to belittle or insult her.

185
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,540
Mr. Zhao.

186
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,020
Mr. Zhao,

187
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,180
this is my fault
for not making things clear.

188
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,700
How about we drink this glass,

189
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,540
and I will perform a song just for you

190
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,900
as an apology?

191
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,180
A song of apology,

192
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,100
and a loyal and righteous Mr. He.

193
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,340
He Xingzhou,

194
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,580
you are a friend

195
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,780
that I'm glad to make.

196
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,660
Come, let's drink.

197
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,500
He Xingzhou!

198
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,180
Relying on his family

199
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,900
and bossing around over me?

200
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,020
That's outrageous!

201
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,700
Dad, that Begonia

202
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,220
is a natural seductress.

203
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,460
She's best at enticing men.

204
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,540
Today,

205
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,620
she must have completely

206
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,460
enchanted the Inspector.

207
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,540
You seem to know her well.

208
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,540
I've just heard, you know.

209
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,060
Who in Yuncheng doesn't know

210
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,100
that she's available to everyone?

211
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,260
It's a pity about Snowdrop.

212
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,420
If he hadn't died,

213
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,740
it wouldn't be Begonia's turn.

214
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,940
I told you not to mention
that person anymore.

215
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,420
Have you lost your mind?

216
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,420
Yes, I won't do it again, Father.

217
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,580
Begonia.

218
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,100
It seems this woman

219
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,620
cannot be kept around.
