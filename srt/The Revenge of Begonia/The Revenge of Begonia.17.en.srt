=Episode 17=

3
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,310
Lu Yongxi.

4
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,150
What are you trying to do now?

5
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,430
Tell me,

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,150
if I carve

7
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,080
a begonia flower

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,240
on your pretty face,

9
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,780
will Xingzhou

10
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,520
still want you?

11
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,720
I don't know,

12
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,550
but before that happens,

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,270
I'll cut your throat.

14
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,160
I'm here on Xingzhou's orders.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,720
If you dare touch me,

16
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,910
your entire troupe will be dead.

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,310
What about He Mingting?

18
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,000
As your husband,

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,830
does he know that his wife

20
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,040
always pines for his younger brother?

21
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,310
That's none of your business.

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,830
All I know is

23
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,080
your only value

24
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,720
to Xingzhou now

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,680
is your connection to Zhao Zheng.

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,680
So,

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,480
I'll make sure

28
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,510
you never sing again.

29
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,720
What are you going to do?

30
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,160
How's it going?

31
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,360
We only caught a few small fry,

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,680
but Ma Sihai shouldn't be far.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,970
- Get him.
- Yes.

34
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,510
Ma Sihai,

35
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,750
you won't escape today.

36
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,110
He Xingzhou,

37
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,670
kill me if you want.

38
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,600
Spare me your nonsense.

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,160
He Xingzhou,

40
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,190
I hate you.

41
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,360
I hate you to death!

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,240
Die!

43
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,720
- Get him.
- Yes.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,640
Commander,

45
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,750
- are you alright?
- Quickly.

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,080
Commander, are you alright?

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,750
What happened to me just now?

48
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,110
Let go.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,270
What did you make me drink?

50
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,520
What do we do?

51
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you afraid of?

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,270
The Commander said that from now on,

53
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,630
I'm in charge

54
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,750
of all the household affairs.

55
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,390
Anyone who disobeys me

56
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,830
will face death.

57
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,240
Yes.

58
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,950
Xingzhou,
something terrible has happened.

59
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,440
I don't know why, but Anning suddenly

60
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,510
vomited a lot of blood.

61
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,670
It was terrifying.

62
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,440
Xiaochuan, go and get a doctor.

63
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,950
Doctor,

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
how is she?

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,830
Her throat is severely injured.

66
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,880
I'll prescribe some medicine,

67
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
and after taking it,
she should be able to speak again.

68
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,160
But performing on stage in the future

69
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,040
might be impossible.

70
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,110
What?

71
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,040
You better cure her,

72
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,270
or it will cost you your life.

73
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,040
Please spare me, Commander,

74
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,230
spare me.

75
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,070
I really can't do anything more.

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,830
Commander, don't be hasty.

77
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,480
Maybe we should try another doctor.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,840
- Get out.
- Quickly, leave.

79
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,110
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,320
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,070
Did you put everything in place?

82
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,630
Yes.

83
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,950
The study and the bedroom are set.

84
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,440
Well,

85
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,270
what's in the cigars?

86
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,550
It's not poison, is it?

87
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

88
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,320
Afraid I'll poison your beloved?

89
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,720
No.

90
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,950
Don't worry.

91
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,790
How could I harm my brother?

92
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,950
Those cigars are no different

93
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,040
from regular ones,

94
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,230
except they become

95
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,160
more addictive.

96
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,550
Truly, it's not harmful to the body?

97
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,040
Come.

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,880
Sit.

99
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,110
Without these,

100
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,510
how else could he so quickly

101
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,760
be turned against Begonia

102
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,510
and be at my disposal?

103
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,550
We both get what we want.

104
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,070
Understand?

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,270
I understand.

106
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,040
Father,

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,830
you underestimated me.

108
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
That's why

109
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,200
your health deteriorated,

110
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,230
giving Mother an opportunity.

111
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,400
Senior, did I sing well?

112
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,390
Anning,

113
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,670
for us opera folks,

114
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,030
our throats
are more important than our lives.

115
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,640
You must protect yours.

116
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,670
I'll remember.

117
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,470
How's your throat?

118
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,680
What happened

119
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,790
that day?

120
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,640
Why did you suddenly vomit blood?

121
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,490
He Xingzhou,

122
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,240
it's no use pleasing her.

123
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,970
She never liked you.

124
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,610
She just wants to use you

125
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,610
to avenge me.

126
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,630
Shut up.

127
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,510
Shut up!

128
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,760
It's ridiculous that
the Commander of Yuncheng

129
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,500
can't even beat a dead man.

130
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,200
So what that you're dead?

131
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,920
