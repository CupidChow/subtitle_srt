00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,680
What's wrong?

4
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,720
Where did this hairpin come from?

5
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,950
I found it at the gate.

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,560
I don't know who put it there.

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,400
Anning is in danger.

8
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,550
Commander.

9
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,880
We can't proceed slowly.

10
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,400
We need to act quickly.

11
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,040
How many men do we have now?

12
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,160
We've gathered about a hundred people.

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,120
Disguise them

14
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,760
and ask them to find someone.

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,620
(Defense Map of Yuncheng)
Bring him here.

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,880
The old pier?

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,670
Please drink.

18
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,040
Sir, you haven't visited for so long.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,080
- That's right.
- I thought you forgot about me.

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,630
My sweetie,

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,630
even if I forget my mother,

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,190
I won't forget you.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,550
But my father

24
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,440
is too strict with me.

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,480
Today, I snuck out to see you.

26
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,950
You've suffered.

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,230
When you're in charge,

28
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,360
why don't you take us all back?

29
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,590
Yes, take us back.

30
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,680
You understand.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,360
But my father is too tough.

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,550
He won't die anytime soon.

33
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,480
Mr. Yaozu, Mr. Ma wants you to go back.

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
No, I've grown up,

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,870
but he still keeps me confined.

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm not done having fun. I won't go back.

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Excuse us then.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
No, no.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,320
- You...
- Come on.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,630
I paid for this.

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,600
At least let me finish my meal.

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,190
(Ma's Mansion)

43
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,390
If it weren't for you...

44
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,320
Commander, your letter.

45
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,260
(If you want Ma Yaozu alive,
meet me alone at the old pier)

46
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,240
He Xingzhou!

47
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,320
Why didn't you

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,630
stay hidden

49
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,520
forever?

50
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,390
Why come here to die?

51
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,600
Do you want to die now?

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,440
No, no, no.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,550
I still want to live.

54
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,470
He Xingzhou,

55
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,190
you captured me

56
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,000
to kill my father, right?

57
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,240
I don't want that old man

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,160
to live and control me.

59
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,800
Why not cooperate with me?

60
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,360
We can work together.

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,440
Why go through this torture?

62
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,030
Really?

63
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,590
Of course.

64
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,830
First, release me.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's plan carefully, okay?

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,160
Too late.

67
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Not too late.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
It's never too late

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,360
to kill a father.

70
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,880
Your father has arrived.

71
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,830
He Xingzhou,

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,160
I'm here.

73
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,440
Tell me what you want.

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,550
Dad, I'm useless,

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,960
always causing you trouble.

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
Go back without me.

77
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,960
Shut up.

78
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,110
If you weren't my only heir,

79
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,110
I would have killed you

80
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,440
long ago.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,800
Dad, I'm useless.

82
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,240
Go back

83
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,110
and find more women

84
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,550
to have more children.

85
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,390
Would that be okay?

86
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,550
Leave! Leave!

87
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,190
Stupid boy,

88
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,110
can you be mature a little bit?

89
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,960
Stay there.

90
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,160
Put down the gun.

91
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,320
Don't hurt my son.

92
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,320
Fine.

93
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,200
Let's discuss the terms.

94
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,350
Tell me.

95
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
As long as I can do it,

96
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,070
I agree.

97
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,550
I want command of your two battalions.

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Okay.

99
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,670
It seems you truly

100
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,270
treasure this son,

101
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,390
willing to give away

102
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,350
your hard-earned men.

103
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,160
Dad!

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,840
You didn't expect your men

105
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
to have long been replaced by us.

106
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,510
Ma Sihai,

107
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,670
you have committed

108
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,640
countless heinous acts.

109
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,640
Today, you will pay

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,300
for the innocent lives

111
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,590
you took.

112
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,510
No, no!

113
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Dad!

114
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,950
He Xingzhou!

115
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,410
Dad!

116
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,070
Commander,

117
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,950
Vice Commander Ma's men

118
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,200
have been absorbed by He Xingzhou.

119
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,350
(Floating Cloud Pavilion)

120
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,190
What?

121
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,720
What about the garrison?

122
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,920
You said

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,640
when the Commander returns,
you'll hand over power.

124
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
Now the Commander is back,

125
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,000
naturally, the garrison follows him.

126
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,920
As long as I kill He Xingzhou,

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
everything

128
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,760
can still be mine.

129
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,020
(He's Mansion)

130
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,500
(He's Mansion)

131
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,320
Mr. Mingting said

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,070
if you want Mrs. Xingzhou to live,

133
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,950
you must come unarmed

134
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,790
and alone.

135
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,070
Commander, no.

136
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,110
This is definitely a trap.

137
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,070
You stay here.

138
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,880
Stop.

139
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,000
Take one more step,

140
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,270
and I'll shoot her.

141
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
We brothers
haven't seen each other for days.

142
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,510
No need for hostility.

143
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
If you want her life,

144
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,270
trade it with military command.

145
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,040
Alright.

146
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,720
But if you don't let them in,

147
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,230
how can we make the exchange?

148
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,600
No more nonsense.

149
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
I want you to write it down.

150
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,300
Fine.

151
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,180
(He Mingting will take over
as the Commander. This document is proof.)

152
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,550
- Done.
- Don't move.

153
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,670
You, fetch it for me.

154
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,230
With this,

155
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,470
you're all dead.

156
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,190
Xingzhou,

157
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,400
you have no other faults,

158
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,710
but you're too soft-hearted.

159
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Do you dare to gamble

160
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,470
her life

161
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,000
with me?

162
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,520
Put down the gun.

163
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,070
Kneel.

164
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,080
You heard me!

165
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,150
So foolish.

166
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,350
To end up like this

167
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,110
for a woman.

168
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,330
Don't move. Put down the guns.

169
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,590
Don't move. Don't move.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,840
Anning!

171
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,960
Xingzhou!

172
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,000
Go now.

173
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,470
Go!

174
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,720
Go!

175
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,400
Xingzhou, I'm sorry.

176
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,520
It's all in the past.

177
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I'm just glad you're alright.

178
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,350
Yongxi! Xiaochuan!

179
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,840
Xingzhou,

180
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,590
the Yongxi of the past

181
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,240
isn't...

182
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,880
She isn't dead.

183
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,880
She just lost her way.

184
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,670
Can you forgive her?

185
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,360
I forgive her.

186
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,430
Yongxi!

187
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,440
Lu Yongxi!

188
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,320
The rain stopped
just after the opera ended.

189
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,840
Yes.

190
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,860
(Begonia in "The Peony Pavilion")

191
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,590
Take care.

192
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Why are you here?

193
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,880
It started raining,
so I came to take you home.

194
