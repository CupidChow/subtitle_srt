00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:06,950
Commander,

4
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,520
what's wrong?

5
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,680
(If I don't let you go now,)

6
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,080
(one day,)

7
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,800
(I'll completely lose control)

8
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,040
(and truly kill you.)

9
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,470
Commander!

10
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,390
Anning,

11
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,360
how are you feeling?

12
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,640
Yumei.

13
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,670
Anning, what happened to your voice?

14
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,900
I...

15
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,230
Yumei,

16
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,960
I can never sing again.

17
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,550
No, that's not true.

18
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,270
With me here, I can surely heal you.

19
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,750
Anning,

20
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,160
can you tell me

21
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,110
what really happened?

22
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,390
Do you know

23
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,080
how scared I was

24
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,720
when Mr. Zhao
brought you here yesterday?

25
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,600
I was terrified.

26
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,670
You're saying

27
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,520
Mr. Zhao brought me here yesterday?

28
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,030
Please, Commander,

29
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,440
stick out your tongue

30
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,550
so I can examine you.

31
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,160
Is this necessary?

32
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,910
Commander,

33
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
please just do it.

34
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,160
If something happens to you,

35
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,800
what will become
of the Commander's Mansion?

36
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,750
The entire Yuncheng
would be thrown into chaos.

37
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,390
What are you here for?

38
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,720
Making me handle everything?

39
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,240
May I ask, Commander,

40
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,720
have you been unusually angry lately,

41
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,630
and experiencing
frequent hallucinations?

42
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
Quick, bring me a cigar.

43
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Yes.

44
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,390
Is there something wrong
with these cigars?

45
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
That's it.

46
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,510
Commander,

47
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
you must stop smoking them.

48
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,230
They contain opium.

49
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,200
What?

50
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,350
I recently heard something

51
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,720
about the Commander of Yuncheng.

52
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
What is it?

53
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,670
I heard that Commander He

54
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,640
has started smoking opium,
and he's heavily addicted.

55
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,000
No way, that's impossible.

56
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,270
If you said it was the old Commander,

57
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,320
- I might believe it.
- Is it true?

58
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,790
Our new commander
is known for his strict discipline.

59
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,440
He forbids gambling, prostitution,

60
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,510
firearms, and drugs in the army.

61
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,880
How could he smoke opium?

62
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,670
- It's true. Believe me.
- Is that so?

63
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,110
A relative's daughter of mine

64
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,390
is working in the Commander's Mansion.

65
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,270
She said the Commander
is now acting crazy all the time.

66
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,160
Whenever he sees a woman,

67
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,320
he calls her Begonia.

68
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,830
And he often holds baby clothes.

69
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,200
Isn't that madness?

70
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,040
How did he become like this?

71
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,640
What are you saying?

72
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,550
I don't know,

73
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,950
but this is what everyone is saying.

74
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,950
What are the side effects
of smoking opium?

75
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,950
Restlessness,

76
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,200
uncontrollable emotions,

77
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
and in severe cases,

78
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,830
it can cause coughing up blood.

79
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,830
I used to think he hated me deeply.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,230
Now that I think about it,

81
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,950
he probably has lost control

82
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,550
of his emotions

83
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,830
from that time.

84
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,670
Yang Anning,

85
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
look at how much he has hurt you.

86
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,640
Why are you still speaking for him?

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,600
So, he really cared about that child.

88
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,160
Our child.

89
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,830
Anning,

90
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,040
I don't care about him,

91
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,440
but can you please stop being foolish?

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Yumei,

93
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,110
I finally understand

94
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,920
why I could escape
so smoothly that night

95
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,830
and why Mr. Zhao saved me.

96
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,510
It was all part of their plan.

97
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,640
I knew I shouldn't have told you.

98
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,440
So,

99
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,600
what do you want to do?

100
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,110
Yumei,

101
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,830
teach me how to help someone

102
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,070
quit opium addiction, please.

103
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,440
I'm begging you.

104
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
Alright.

105
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,950
I'll teach you. Is that enough?

106
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,040
Thank you, Yumei.

107
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,720
Stop crying.

108
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,830
Mr. Mingting, you're here.

109
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,880
The Commander
asked me to give this to you.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,110
This isn't appropriate, is it?

111
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,230
The Commander ordered it.

112
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,320
There are some things
he can't handle right now,

113
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,350
so he needs your help.

114
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,830
But you can help him, right?

115
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,200
You see, I...

116
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,720
I really can't handle it.

117
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,550
From today on,
I will help the Commander quit opium.

118
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,040
It may take a long time,

119
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,480
so I'm counting on you.

120
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,950
Come.

121
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,320
You lied to me.

122
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,840
You deliberately made Xingzhou
addicted to opium.

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
I wanted him to smoke opium for life,

124
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,880
so he would never leave you.

125
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,320
Isn't that good?

126
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,230
But didn't Mr. Zhao say

127
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,760
he would help him quit?

128
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,840
Quit?

129
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,310
Do you know

130
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,790
how painful it is for an addict

131
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,470
to quit?

132
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280
One mistake,

133
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,790
and he could die.

134
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,080
You should go and check on him.

135
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,640
Commander.

136
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,290
Commander.

137
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,540
Xiaochuan, opium.

138
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,500
Give me opium now.

139
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,650
- Opium.
- Commander,

140
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,580
you can't go on like this.

141
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,500
You have to quit.

142
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,380
I will.

143
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,940
I will quit.

144
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,380
Just give me one last stick.

145
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,500
One last stick.

146
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,780
I beg you.

147
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,220
I beg you.

148
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,220
Are you defying orders?

149
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,140
Commander, it's normal
to feel uncomfortable at first.

150
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,620
It will get much better later.

151
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,340
No!

152
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,340
Commander.

153
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,540
Xiaochuan, come here.

154
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,780
Xiaochuan, one last stick.

155
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,020
Just one stick, okay?

156
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,540
I promise I'll quit after this one.

157
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,600
Just one. Just...

158
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,740
I beg you.
