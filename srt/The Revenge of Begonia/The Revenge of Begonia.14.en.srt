00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,900
Who is it?

4
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,580
Mr. Mingting, it's me.

5
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,580
Oh, Begonia, it's you.

6
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,260
Please come in.

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,340
Yongxi,

8
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,460
Begonia rarely comes by.

9
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,180
Serve the best tea here

10
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,460
- for her.
- Okay.

11
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,460
Sure.

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,340
Mr. Mingting,

13
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,620
what happened?

14
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,260
Just a small disagreement.

15
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,940
Sorry you have to see that.

16
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,500
By the way,

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,060
did you come here for something?

18
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,780
I want to help you
with your leg treatment.

19
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,380
Dad, do we have to hide here

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,980
and eat steamed buns
for the rest of our lives?

21
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,380
I'd rather die than do that.

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,780
A great man knows when to yield.

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,300
We will take back what's ours someday.

24
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,780
Easy to say that.

25
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,980
Dad, why do you always fail

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,260
because of actors?

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,380
That Snowdrop

28
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,380
humiliated you in public,

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,820
and you didn't dare to say a word

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,140
but shut me up.

31
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,620
Now, you've been fooled by Begonia.

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,460
- You...
- You...

33
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,900
Vice Commander Ma, it's not good.

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,540
He Xingzhou and his men
are coming after us.

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,420
He Xingzhou... Let's go.

36
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,120
- Go, go, go.
- Go.

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,500
Mr. Mingting.

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,140
Mr. Mingting?

39
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,180
(He really is a lover of opera.)

40
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,020
Begonia.

41
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,860
Mr. Mingting, how do you feel?

42
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,100
Just a bit sore and swollen.

43
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,900
That's a good sign.

44
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,460
It means your legs
still have a sensation.

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,660
If you keep it up,

46
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,140
there might be a chance for recovery.

47
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,900
Thank you, Begonia.

48
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,260
You're welcome.

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,420
Mr. Mingting, try to go out more often.

50
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,900
Don't always stay cooped up inside.

51
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,500
It will help with your recovery.

52
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,580
Today,

53
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,700
Begonia, why don't you
accompany me for a walk?

54
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,340
Alright.

55
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,500
Begonia,

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,460
let's rest here for a bit.

57
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,660
This opera stage is really grand.

58
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,500
(Floating Cloud Pavilion)

59
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,340
Yes.

60
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,060
Since the last time

61
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,740
we invited Snowdrop
for a private performance,

62
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,420
there hasn't been another opera here.

63
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,940
What did Snowdrop do

64
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,180
to make you guys so unhappy

65
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,620
with opera singers?

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,500
Nothing of the sort.

67
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,620
In fact,

68
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,780
we wronged Snowdrop.

69
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,060
I'm quite interested.

70
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,300
Can you tell me more,

71
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,140
Mr. Mingting?

72
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,380
That day...

73
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,780
Screw you!

74
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,740
Asking for respect as an actor?

75
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,780
You're just a gender-ambiguous actor.

76
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,260
What respect do you need?

77
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,740
Today, I'll show you

78
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,300
what happens when you cross me.

79
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,940
Vice Commander Ma,

80
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,930
today is
the Commander's birthday banquet.

81
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,340
Don't spoil his mood.

82
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,020
Why don't you let me handle this?

83
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,100
Since you said that,
I'll definitely agree.

84
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,940
- Commander.
- Let me

85
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,980
give you another toast.

86
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,400
- Come on.
- Let's go.

87
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,540
So, you mean

88
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,700
in the end, Xingzhou took Snowdrop away?

89
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,100
Yes.

90
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,300
By the way,

91
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,020
I heard that a while ago,
a singer named Snowdrop

92
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,580
came to He's Mansion
for a private performance.

93
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,580
It was Mr. Xingzhou
who escorted him out in the end.

94
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,300
I think so.

95
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,580
At the time, I went to the wine cellar
to get some wine

96
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,420
and saw them in the West Garden.

97
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,540
And then?

98
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,820
Then,

99
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,260
I don't know.

100
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,780
I only saw them

101
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,260
talking there.

102
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,020
Wait.

103
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,100
Mrs. Xingzhou.

104
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,580
I have something to ask you.

105
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,340
Do you remember why
the performance last year

106
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,060
at the mansion was cut short?

107
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,860
I wasn't there at the time,

108
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,340
but I heard Vice Commander Ma

109
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,420
didn't like the singer,

110
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,340
so Mr. Xingzhou took him away.

111
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,340
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

112
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,220
This medicine

113
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,660
should be taken once a day.

114
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,540
You shouldn't eat before taking it.

115
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,660
These two

116
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,180
should be taken three times a day.

117
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,380
They're also for warming the spleen
and protecting the fetus.

118
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,860
Yumei,

119
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,010
you were right.

120
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,760
I shouldn't have rashly decided
to keep this child.

121
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,140
Did you find out something?

122
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,500
Not yet,

123
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,820
but I will uncover the truth.

124
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,300
(Why can she transform
from a crow into a phoenix,)

125
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,660
(and I have to be cast)

126
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,220
(into the depths of hell to suffer?)

127
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,340
(I'm not willing to accept this,
not even in death!)

128
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,180
What madness are you on now?

129
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,100
With your licentious nature,

130
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,020
who knows whose child it is?

131
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,860
If Xingzhou finds out,

132
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,500
neither you nor this baby

133
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,580
will survive.

134
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,780
I'll teach you a lesson

135
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,300
for Xingzhou.

136
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,740
You have time to meddle
in other people's affairs,

137
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,260
but you can't even manage your own.

138
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,660
Even if Anning won't keep the child,

139
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,780
the position beside He Xingzhou

140
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,820
won't be yours.

141
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,060
Xingzhou, when did you get here?

142
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,740
Just now.

143
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,420
Xingzhou,

144
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,220
I need to talk to you.

145
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,990
I'll go prepare
your pregnancy medicine first.

146
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,780
- Mrs. Mingting.
- Mrs. Mingting.

147
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,260
Xingzhou,

148
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,340
let me help you.

149
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,420
No need.

150
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,540
Xingzhou, can you pour me
a glass of water?

151
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,020
Thank you.

152
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,700
If there's nothing else,
you should leave now.

153
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,820
I'll be going then.

154
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,140
Xingzhou.

155
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,900
Xingzhou,

156
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,060
I need to ask you something.

157
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Drink your medicine first.

158
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,690
Are you saying you don't even have time
to drink the medicine?

159
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,940
I'll drink it.

160
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,400
It's so hot.
Are you trying to kill yourself?

161
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,060
Didn't you tell me to drink it?

162
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,660
Xingzhou, I really
have something to ask you.

163
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,380
(What do you want to investigate?)

164
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,860
(Why don't you want my child?)

165
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,220
(Does Senior's death)

166
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,340
(have anything to do with you?)

167
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,220
Here.

168
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,540
Xingzhou, I...

169
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,780
Commander,

170
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,140
I have something important to report.

171
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,620
We'll talk when I get back.

172
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,940
- Xingzhou...
- I need to talk to you.

173
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,660
It hurts.

174
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
Commander,

175
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,940
our people traced to 200 miles

176
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,380
southwest of the city outskirts

177
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,100
where Ma Sihai suddenly disappeared.

178
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,700
Disappeared?

179
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,780
Unless he knows magic,

180
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,540
there must be something wrong
with that place.

181
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,740
Continue searching.

182
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,740
Yes.

183
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,660
Xiaochuan,

184
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,820
I need you
to investigate someone for me.

185
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,300
I want all the information about her,

186
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,900
including where she grew up

187
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,300
and who has been around her

188
