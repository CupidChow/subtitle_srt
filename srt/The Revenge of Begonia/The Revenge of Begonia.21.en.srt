=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,080
Begonia, wait a moment.

4
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,680
It's you, Mr. Mingting.

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,560
Is there something wrong?

6
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,910
I want to apologize

7
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,080
on behalf of Yongxi.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,040
As her husband,

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,270
I also bear responsibility

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,840
for not stopping her in time.

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,430
You don't have to say that.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,200
It has nothing to do with you.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,430
To be honest, it's funny.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,880
I have known for a long time

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,910
that Yongxi likes Xingzhou.

16
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,000
I just didn't expect

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,830
that she would become so obsessed.

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,030
Back then,

19
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,310
after Mrs. Jasmine

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,160
passed away,

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,910
Yongxi became his only good friend.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,590
They were very close.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,160
You just mentioned

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,000
Jasmine?

25
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,440
She was Xingzhou's birth mother.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,870
She was also an opera singer.

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,070
Back then,

28
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,780
her performance of "The Peony Pavilion"

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,190
was the best in Yuncheng.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
Everyone said
her portrayal of Du Liniang

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,760
was unparalleled.

32
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,040
But unfortunately,

33
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,800
something happened at that time.

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,440
What happened?

35
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,950
Mr. Mingting, please tell me more.

36
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,760
I just want to know more

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,720
about Xingzhou.

38
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,270
This is Xingzhou's taboo.

39
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,270
For many years,
no one dared to mention it.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,440
There was a time

41
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,550
when anyone who sang
"The Peony Pavilion" would...

42
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,230
Would what?

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Nothing.

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,590
It's all in the past.

45
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,550
Have you seen this item before,

46
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,910
Mr. Mingting?

47
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,110
This...

48
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,880
It looks like

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,750
something belonging to Mrs. Jasmine.

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,560
Are you sure?

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm sure.

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,110
Mrs. Jasmine

53
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,720
loved jasmine flowers very much.

54
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,590
Back then,

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,910
the entire mansion

56
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,030
was filled with jasmine flowers.

57
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,110
Mr. Mingting, I have something to do.

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,270
I'll leave first.

59
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,750
Mr. Xingzhou,

60
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,000
what place is that?

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The Forbidden Area.

62
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,960
It's where the ghosts
of the He family are kept.

63
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,960
Why are you here?

64
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,110
Don't come here again.

65
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,630
There are ghosts here.

66
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,800
I heard Vice Commander Ma
didn't like opera singers.

67
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,940
- I went to the wine cellar to get wine
- Mr. Xingzhou brought him away.

68
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,830
and saw them.

69
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,910
This is Xingzhou's taboo.
No one dared to mention it.

70
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,160
That day, Senior came here
to sing at a banquet.

71
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,800
What did you do to him?

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,440
That day, I did see Snowdrop.

73
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,720
Mrs. Jasmine

74
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,110
loved jasmine flowers very much.

75
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,080
Back then,

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,320
the entire mansion

77
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,550
was filled with jasmine flowers.

78
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,030
No!

79
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,440
No, no!

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,270
You stay at home and practice diligently.

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
When I come back
after singing at the banquet,

82
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,640
we'll make dumplings together.

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Don't forget this.

84
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,760
Senior...

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,230
Why?

86
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,000
Anning,

87
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
where did you go?

88
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
Come here.

89
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,000
I went to the study to look for you,

90
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,190
but you weren't there.

91
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,630
We must have

92
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,790
just missed each other.

93
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,200
Happy birthday.

94
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,320
I made it myself.

95
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,880
Is it pretty?

96
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,910
Yes.

97
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,110
Let me put it on for you.

98
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
What's wrong, Anning?

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,720
Do you feel unwell?

100
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,950
This ring,

101
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,040
is it yours?

102
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,720
This...

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,350
Where did you find it?

104
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,790
You don't need to worry about that.

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,390
Just tell me.

106
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,070
Is this yours?

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,270
Yes.

108
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,230
This is my mother's keepsake.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
He Xingzhou,

110
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm asking you one last time.

111
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,550
The day Snowdrop came here,

112
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,920
what did you do to him?

113
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,350
What do you mean?

114
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,270
Answer my question.

115
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,600
It's Snowdrop again.

116
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,880
Is this Snowdrop

117
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,950
that important to you?

118
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,790
Yes.

119
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,760
From childhood to adulthood,

120
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,200
he has always been the closest

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,230
and most trusted person to me.

122
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,200
I won't allow anyone to harm him.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,230
What exactly are you saying?

124
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,880
Do you think I killed him?

125
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,070
Fine.

126
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,280
Yang Anning.

127
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,120
Very well.

128
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,150
I'm telling you now.

129
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,150
I did it.

130
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,310
So what?

131
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,440
What do you plan to do?

132
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,280
Kill me to avenge him?

133
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,880
Don't come near me.

134
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,790
Stay away from me.

135
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
What?

136
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
Are you afraid I will kill you too?

137
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,480
Yang Anning.

138
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,670
Yang Anning.

139
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,590
We've been through so much together.

140
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,110
In the end,

141
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm nothing to you.

142
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,230
Mrs. Xingzhou...

143
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,160
No.

144
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,880
Mrs. Xingzhou.

145
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,600
Mrs. Xingzhou?

146
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,280
Kill me.

147
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,470
What do we do?

148
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,150
Don't worry.

149
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,320
In this situation,

150
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
to prevent the patient
from harming herself,

151
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,760
we must inject a sedative first.

152
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,440
Kill me.

153
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,320
Lay her down.

154
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,990
Kill me.

155
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,110
Kill me.

156
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,280
Keep a close watch on her.

157
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,550
Call me if anything happens.

158
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,800
Commander!

159
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,550
Hurry. What are you waiting for?

160
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,760
Stop the bleeding quickly.

161
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,030
The hairpin is so close to the heart.

162
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,870
It's very dangerous.

163
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,440
