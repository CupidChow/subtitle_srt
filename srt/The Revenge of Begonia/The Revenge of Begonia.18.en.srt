=Episode 18=

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,950
So what that you're dead?

4
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,560
So what that you're dead?

5
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,080
- How dare you oppose me?
- Let go.

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,360
I'll make you die a hundred times,

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,270
a thousand times!

8
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,590
He Xingzhou,

9
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,720
what do you want?

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,190
What did I do?

11
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,510
Don't come closer.

12
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,390
I...

13
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,870
How did I become like this?

14
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,830
How did I become like this?

15
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,310
What's happening?

16
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,750
There was a fierce fight today.

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,080
Both of them are injured.

18
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,470
Mr. Zhao, you should go persuade them.

19
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Commander,

20
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,000
this...

21
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,240
What happened?

22
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,960
Maybe

23
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,320
I should get a doctor for you both.

24
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,800
Go find a doctor for her.

25
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,520
Commander, your hand...

26
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm fine. Don't mind me.

27
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,550
Quick, help Mrs. Xingzhou to bed.

28
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,110
- I'll send someone to fetch a doctor.
- Yes.

29
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,600
You killed my senior.

30
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,550
I want your life in return.

31
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,950
No, no.

32
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,880
He Xingzhou, no!

33
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,920
No, no!

34
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,390
Mrs. Xingzhou,

35
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,720
you're finally awake.

36
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,070
Let me help you up
to drink the medicine.

37
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,070
Where is He Xingzhou?

38
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,110
Mrs. Xingzhou,

39
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
you've been unconscious
for two whole days.

40
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
During these two days,

41
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,920
Commander has been coming
to see you during the day

42
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,350
and sleeping in the study at night.

43
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,480
Mrs. Xingzhou,

44
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,510
I'll go to the small kitchen

45
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,550
to get you some food.

46
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,480
No need to trouble yourself.

47
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,790
I'm not hungry.

48
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,230
It's no trouble at all.

49
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,980
Commander has already
instructed the small kitchen

50
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,350
to keep the porridge simmering.

51
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,070
Commander.

52
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,350
I can't stay here any longer.

53
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,920
I must find a way to leave immediately.

54
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,070
I want to go outside for a walk.

55
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,230
Commander has instructed

56
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,440
you can only move around
inside the mansion.

57
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,480
If you want to go further,

58
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,640
you need his permission.

59
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,760
Can I at least walk to the gate?

60
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,110
That's still within the mansion.

61
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,950
Mrs. Xingzhou,

62
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,160
I need to ask Commander first.

63
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,880
Never mind.

64
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,390
Let's go back.

65
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,510
I'm tired anyway.

66
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,440
If you want to go out,

67
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,720
you'll have to ask me.

68
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,880
Let's go.

69
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,040
Wait.

70
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
You hate me, but what can you do?

71
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,950
If you want to leave
the Commander's Mansion,

72
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,790
you have to ask me to help you.

73
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,640
Do you want to help me,

74
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,040
or do you want to harm me?

75
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,880
Only you know that.

76
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,760
Think carefully.

77
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,440
If I truly wanted your life,

78
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,670
last time,

79
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,160
I would have done more

80
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,600
than just harm your throat.

81
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,950
Lu Yongxi,

82
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,830
this is the biggest mistake
you've ever made.

83
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,500
Since you didn't kill me,

84
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,540
one day,

85
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,940
I will pay you back

86
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,260
for everything you've done.

87
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,500
People who can't even protect themselves

88
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,060
shouldn't make threats.

89
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,220
Let me tell you.

90
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,660
Everyone in this mansion
who could help you

91
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,180
is closely watched.

92
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,980
Only I can help you.

93
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,540
Everyone knows I hate you to the core.

94
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,500
No one would suspect I'd help you.

95
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,700
Help me?

96
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,580
What's in it for you?

97
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,700
Because

98
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,300
I want Xingzhou

99
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,980
to completely give up on you.

100
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,100
This is your only chance.

101
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,100
Use it or not, it's up to you.

102
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,380
Tonight,

103
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,420
I will help you leave
the Commander's Mansion.

104
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,140
But you must promise me

105
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,460
you will never

106
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,580
come back.

107
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,580
(This is your only chance.)

108
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,500
(Use it or not, it's up to you.)

109
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,900
(Tonight,)

110
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,900
(I will help you leave
the Commander's Mansion.)

111
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,660
(But you must promise me)

112
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,060
(you will never)

113
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,060
(come back.)

114
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,500
What's going on?

115
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,300
Mrs. Mingting said
something very important

116
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,380
is missing from the mansion.

117
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,250
The guards are being blamed
for their negligence

118
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,300
and are helping to search for it.

119
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,740
Do something for me.

120
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,380
You can't even guard
the warehouse properly.

121
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,460
What good are you?

122
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
Get out of my sight.

123
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,420
Stop.

124
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,140
She's just a maid.

125
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,980
Don't make a fuss.

126
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,060
Leave then.

127
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,780
(I can't touch you in the mansion.)

128
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,220
(Once you're out,
no one will protect you.)

129
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,140
(Enjoy the gift)

130
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,420
(I've prepared for you.)

131
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,580
Stop.

132
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,060
Today, I'll make you wish

133
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,340
you were dead.

134
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,700
Let go of me! Stop it!

135
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,700
You wench!

136
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,100
I'll kill you today.

137
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,220
Get him.

138
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,660
Mrs. Xingzhou?

139
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,620
Who's there?

140
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,940
Stop knocking.

141
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,960
We don't see patients at night.

142
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,980
Anning?

143
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,100
What's wrong?

144
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,260
Come in quickly.

145
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,100
What happened to her?

146
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,180
Take good care of her.

147
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,380
I have to go now.

148
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,220
Wait.

149
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,980
Although

150
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,740
I don't know what happened,

151
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,820
thank you for saving Anning.

152
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,340
You're welcome.

153
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,300
Anning,

154
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,820
what happened to you?

155
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,500
