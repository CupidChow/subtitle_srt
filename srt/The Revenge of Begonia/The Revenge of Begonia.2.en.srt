00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,020
=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,470
You must be Begonia, right?

4
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,270
Unbelievable.

5
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,110
(Lu Yongxi, daughter of the Lus)
The legendary Begonia

6
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,590
is so beautiful.

7
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,310
You're flattering me.

8
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,790
You're the true beauty of Yuncheng,

9
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,000
well-versed in poetry,

10
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,360
a beauty with brains.

11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,950
You know me?

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,920
No.

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,600
But

14
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,760
I know this.

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,060
(He Zhenyun, Yuncheng's Commander)

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,920
Come in.

17
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,390
Sir.

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,230
We're at home. Why call me sir?

19
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,310
You needed me?

20
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,720
Heard you went to Nancheng
to suppress bandits.

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,800
That's Vice Commander Ma's territory.

22
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,550
He complained to me.

23
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,080
What territory?

24
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,310
Yuncheng belongs to the Hes,

25
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,110
not the Mas.

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,440
Good. That's assertive.

27
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,080
You're truly my son.

28
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,230
Still, the Vice Commander

29
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,190
is highly respected.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,400
Respect

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,550
is due.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,750
I heard you brought back an actress.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,160
Messing around is fine.

34
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,830
Just don't take it seriously.

35
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,830
Like you did with my mother?

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,080
Scoundrel!

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,440
Who are you

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,360
to lecture me?

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,280
Get out!

40
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm leaving, sir.

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,960
This hairpin

42
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,160
was a gift from Xingzhou

43
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,960
on my 18th birthday.

44
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,110
I heard

45
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,470
you'll marry Xingzhou's brother soon.

46
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,000
Such a useless thing.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
Why keep it?

48
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,470
How dare you throw my thing?

49
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,600
It's nothing special.

50
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,240
I have one too.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,880
If you like it,

52
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,830
I can give it to you.

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,000
No, impossible.

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,830
Xingzhou would never give you this.

55
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,360
He's being with you

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,670
to spite me.

57
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,520
Miss Lu,

58
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,390
you've made your choice.

59
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,630
Don't regret it.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,750
Be at peace as his sister-in-law.

61
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,110
Accept it.

62
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,880
You lowly actress,

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,440
dare compete with me for Xingzhou?

64
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,000
Dream on!

65
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,390
You dare hit me?

66
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,510
I'm trying to wake you up.

67
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,640
Miss Lu, don't forget

68
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,720
the one lying next to Xingzhou

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,950
is me,

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
while you

71
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,950
can only be his

72
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,510
sister-in-law.

73
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,190
Shall we

74
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,880
make a bet?

75
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,110
What do you mean?

76
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,390
Bet on who

77
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,640
Xingzhou truly cares about.

78
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,390
What are you doing?

79
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,640
What are you doing, Miss Yang?

80
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,640
Why are you pushing me?

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,880
Miss Lu!

82
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,040
Xingzhou, save me!

83
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,230
Xingzhou!

84
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,070
My Lord!

85
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,510
Get up there!

86
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,790
My Lord! My Lord!

87
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,510
Xingzhou!

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,230
Xingzhou, I'm so cold.

89
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,290
Xiaochuan, take off your clothes.

90
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,040
Yes.

91
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,110
My Lord, what happened?

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,480
I don't know

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,640
how I offended this Miss Yang.

94
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,600
She pushed me without reason.

95
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,600
We'll talk about this later.

96
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,390
Let me take you back first.

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,350
Get her out of the water.

98
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,670
Yes.

99
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Miss Yang,

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
maybe change your clothes first?

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Be careful of catching a cold.

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

103
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,760
This way, please.

104
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,070
Where's my brother?

105
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,790
Mr. He just went out.

106
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,510
Go and get bath water

107
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,550
and clothes for Miss Lu.

108
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,390
Yes.

109
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,600
You rest for now.

110
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,230
Xingzhou,

111
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,670
don't leave.

112
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,480
Please stay with me.

113
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,110
Mrs. Mingting,

114
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,720
have some self-respect.

115
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,830
Don't call me Mrs. Mingting.

116
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,720
I beg you.

117
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,790
Don't call me that.

118
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,230
You're my brother's fiancée.

119
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,320
What else

120
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,160
should I call you?

121
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,260
Don't forget

122
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,160
how you betrayed me.

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,440
Xingzhou,

124
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,480
I know I was wrong.

125
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,880
Please forgive me.

126
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,000
I was forced by my father.

127
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
Lu Yongxi,

128
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,640
if my brother's legs weren't disabled,

129
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,670
would you still try so hard

130
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,440
to reconcile with me?

131
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,190
Xingzhou,

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,390
I know I was wrong.

133
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,160
Please, for the sake of our childhood,

134
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,110
give me another chance.

135
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,950
Please.

136
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,550
Xingzhou,

137
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,160
you've forgiven me, right?

138
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,710
I knew

139
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,200
you would forgive me.

140
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,000
Our relationship ended

141
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,670
the moment

142
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,960
you chose my brother.

143
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,550
Someone is waiting for me.

144
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,840
I won't let you find that woman.

145
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,150
She's a vixen.

146
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,400
She will ruin you.

147
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,000
Lu Yongxi,
how long will you keep this act?

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,580
I might not expose you, but I know.

149
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,440
You're deliberately framing Yang Anning.

150
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,640
Take care of yourself.

151
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,670
Madam, please change your clothes,

152
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,080
or you'll catch a cold.

153
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,470
Don't call me Madam!

154
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,790
Get out!

155
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
My Lady.

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Who is this?

157
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,360
Well...

158
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,320
Greetings, My Lady.

159
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,150
(Liang Rufen, Commander's wife)
You are?

160
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,040
My Lady,

161
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,980
this is the lead actress
of Yuncheng Grand Theater,

162
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,900
Begonia,

163
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,740
a friend of Mr. Xingzhou.

164
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,900
Another singer?

165
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,180
Our family really is cursed,

166
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,540
constantly bothered

167
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,740
by these shameless, despicable people.

168
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,900
Last time it was Snowdrop.

169
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,700
Now, it's Begonia.

170
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,220
Truly, all flowers bloom.

171
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,420
You know Snowdrop, My Lady?

172
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,780
A gender-ambiguous person

173
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,840
who dirtied my eyes.

174
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,550
I heard he committed suicide.

175
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,620
He must have been involved

176
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,860
in some disgraceful acts

177
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,510
and couldn't face
living in this world anymore.

178
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,900
You're amazing, Senior.

179
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,220
Here, take your medicine,

180
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,740
or your fever will hurt your throat.

181
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,700
Who are you calling dirty?

182
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,260
Who are you calling dirty?

183
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,820
Who are you calling dirty?

184
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,500
Who are you calling dirty?

185
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,900
- Miss Yang!
- Who are you calling dirty?

186
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,060
He was the gentlest and cleanest person,

187
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,860
thousands, hundreds of times purer

188
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,900
than anyone in your family.

189
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,980
This is too much!

190
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,620
Take her to the backyard!

191
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,620
Let go of me! Let go!

192
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,140
This is infuriating. Let's go.

193
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,060
Let go of me!

194
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,740
Stop!

195
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,020
Now, you're quiet.

196
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,620
You disgraceful little wench.

197
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,260
Were you blind?

198
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,980
How dare you offend me?

199
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,260
Which hand was it
that pinched me just now?

200
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,220
Put on the clamps.

201
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Clamp her fingers hard.

202
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,140
Put more strength into it.

203
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,460
Clamp her hard.

204
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,380
Harder, come on!

205
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,580
Wait.

206
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,700
Mingting, what are you doing here?

207
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,400
(He Mingting, Commander's eldest son)
It's so hot today.

208
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,460
You might get heatstroke.

209
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,380
Fan for him, quickly.

210
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,220
I don't need it.

211
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,660
Mother,

212
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,860
please, for my sake,

213
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,860
spare this lady.

214
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,980
What?

215
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,500
Is she a friend of yours?

216
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,500
No.

217
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,860
I just really appreciate
her performances.

218
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,260
A flick of the red sleeve
dispels the dust of sorrow.

219
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,300
A twist of the vine
recalls ten thousand miles.

220
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,220
She's just an actress who sings on stage

221
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,780
and laughs off stage,

222
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,660
no different from a prostitute.

223
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,820
What's there to praise so highly

224
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,780
and plead for her?

225
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,180
Mother.

226
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,180
Mrs. He hates actresses so much.

227
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,500
Could it be

228
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,220
because an actress stole your man?

229
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,940
Thank you, Mr. Mingting,
for your high regard.

230
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,980
An actor dedicates ten years of effort

231
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,540
just for this kind of recognition.

232
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,100
Miss Yang, you're too kind.

233
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Well,

234
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,020
it seems

235
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,260
I've underestimated you.

236
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,580
You're

237
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,820
seducing my son.

238
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,440
What are you looking at? Keep clamping.

239
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,380
Clamp hard!

240
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,780
Mother.

241
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,020
Mother, I spoke out of turn.

242
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,620
Please let her go.

243
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,700
Calm down.

244
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,900
Mingting,

245
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,340
I'm doing this for your own good.

246
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,100
People like her

247
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,940
are a disaster,

248
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,300
better to get rid of them sooner.

249
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Let's go, come on.

250
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,780
- Mother.
- Let's go, let's go.

251
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,570
Get lost!

252
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,460
What makes you so bold

253
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,660
to harm my girl?

254
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,780
It was me.

255
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,860
What about it?

256
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,420
Mr. Xingzhou, do you want to shoot me

257
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,700
to defend your mistress?

258
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,260
Miss Yang is my friend.

259
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,020
Isn't this a bit too much,

260
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,540
My Lady?

261
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,900
What friend?

262
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,090
I suppose

263
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,180
a friend from bed?

264
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,700
Mother,

265
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,060
the servants are here.

266
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,020
Mind your words.

267
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,300
Don't be a laughingstock.

268
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,540
What laughingstock?

269
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,820
We've been humiliated

270
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,940
the moment

271
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,990
that cheap girl Jasmine entered.

272
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,740
How dare you mention her?

273
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,860
He Xingzhou!

274
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,220
How dare you point a gun at me?

275
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,100
Someone!

276
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,550
Arrest this rebellious beast!

277
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,740
Now!

278
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,220
Fine.

279
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,340
You've decided to rebel today,

280
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,540
haven't you?

281
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,060
Alright, Mingting,

282
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,980
let's go.

283
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,100
We'll see what your father
has to say about this.

284
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,860
