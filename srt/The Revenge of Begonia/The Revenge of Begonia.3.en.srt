=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,110
What are you all arguing about?

4
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,930
My Lord,

5
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,470
you're finally here.

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,110
You must stand up for me!

7
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,750
He Xingzhou shot at me!

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,680
Xingzhou, what happened?

9
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,720
Mingting, you tell me.

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,080
It's nothing serious,

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,160
just a misunderstanding

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,270
between Mother and Xingzhou.

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,660
What misunderstanding?

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,760
He Xingzhou

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,190
wanted to shoot me

16
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,800
over a mere actress!

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,630
If you don't stand up for me,

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,630
how can I continue
to be the head of this household?

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,590
Xingzhou always has manners.

20
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,310
How could he do such a thing?

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,120
Commander He,

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,950
it's my fault for offending Mrs. He.

23
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,040
Please don't blame Mr. Xingzhou.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,400
You surely have a way with words.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,360
You've just arrived

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,550
and already caused such trouble.

27
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,190
Actresses are indeed never up to any good.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,230
I just don't want to hurt

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,830
the harmony between
you and Mr. Xingzhou.

30
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,830
After all, our low lives as actresses

31
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,720
aren't worth much.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,160
Commander, you may punish me
however you wish.

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,000
Who do you think you are

34
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,680
to cause such unrest in my household?

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,760
Someone, take her away.

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,480
Give her forty military lashes
and expel her!

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,320
Hurry up!

38
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,720
I'd like to see who dares.

39
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,630
She is my future wife.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,440
No one can touch her today.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,000
What did you say?

42
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,800
Unfilial!

43
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,720
You're my son!

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,390
How can you marry an actress?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,670
What's wrong with an actress?

46
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,470
I want her.

47
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,230
You...

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,960
Commander He, Mr. Xingzhou says this

49
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,960
because, actually,

50
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,910
I'm pregnant.

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,670
My Lord...

52
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,270
Xingzhou,

53
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,240
I'm feeling dizzy.

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,200
Someone, take her back to my room.

55
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,190
Yes.

56
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,110
Have you really thought this through?

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,280
Yes.

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,650
The wedding ceremony
will be in three days.

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,920
If that's the case,

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,750
then go ahead as you see fit.

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,030
No, My Lord!

62
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,160
How can he do that?

63
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,000
My Lord,

64
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,470
Mingting's wedding

65
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,320
should be advanced too.

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,550
He's your legitimate son!

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,160
Miss Yang...

68
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,750
Well, Madam,

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,630
this ointment works immediately.

70
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,820
Please apply it as soon as possible.

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
Thank you.

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,600
This is Mr. Xingzhou's room?

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,750
Right.

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,630
Mr. Xingzhou said you like begonia red,

75
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,190
so he had the servants change the curtains

76
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,440
before you arrived.

77
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,950
Madam, please rest.

78
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,270
My Lord, you're back.

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,160
Let me help you change.

80
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,160
You're very happy, aren't you?

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,760
Of course.

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,920
Who wouldn't want to be the young madam
of the Commander's Mansion?

83
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,920
You're honest.

84
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,200
I do wonder

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,070
why you would
defy the Commander to marry me.

86
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,110
Could it be that
you've fallen in love with me?

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Yang Anning,

88
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,600
this marriage is nothing more

89
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,200
than a necessary match.

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,670
Don't flatter yourself.

91
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,510
I don't care.

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,440
You could have just let me die,

93
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,790
but you didn't

94
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,950
because you're in love with me.

95
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,440
Your audacity is growing.

96
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
If the old man finds out,

97
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,760
you're dead.

98
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,600
Don't worry.

99
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,950
A lot can happen

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
in ten months of pregnancy.

101
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,270
Seems you've planned ahead.

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
I wouldn't dare.

103
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,350
I will follow your plans.

104
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,880
Since we're getting married,

105
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,230
you might as well call me by my name
from now on.

106
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,230
Xingzhou.

107
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,230
What are you doing here

108
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,440
in the middle of the night?

109
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,670
I couldn't sleep,
so I was just walking around.

110
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm asking

111
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,040
why you haven't left.

112
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,720
Didn't get enough during the day?

113
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,600
It seems you don't know yet.

114
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,510
I'm about to marry Mr. Xingzhou.

115
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,880
How is that possible?

116
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,200
You're just an actress.

117
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,390
So what?

118
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,230
I can still

119
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,070
get pregnant.

120
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,590
Inside here

121
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,670
is the first grandson of the Hes.

122
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm his mother.

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,550
Perhaps I'll even be
the head of the household.

124
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,480
Shut up. You're dreaming.

125
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,160
Thinking of hitting me again?

126
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,690
You should think twice.

127
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,960
When it comes to fighting,

128
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,290
you might not be my match.

129
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,770
Yang Anning,

130
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,600
don't get too confident.

131
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,000
After all, the actresses in this house

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,110
don't tend to live long.

133
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,200
Someone came, sang a play,

134
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,230
and then died.

135
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,550
Who are you talking about?

136
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,280
That person

137
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,670
was much more famous than you.

138
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,110
Not just in Yuncheng,

139
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,480
but across the whole Jiangbei,

140
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,010
he was a renowned actor.

141
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,280
- What did you see?
- Why?

142
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,030
- How did he die?
- I don't know!

143
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,880
Are you crazy?

144
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,230
- Lu Yongxi, what did you see?
- You're insane! Let go!

145
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,320
How did he die?

146
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,520
- Tell me now!
- I don't know!

147
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,590
Tell me what happened!

148
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,520
Tell me now!

149
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
Help me, Xingzhou!

150
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,720
Xingzhou,

151
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,520
where have you gone?

152
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,400
I woke up,

153
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,110
couldn't see you, and came out looking.

154
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,160
Didn't expect

155
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,590
to run into Miss Lu.

156
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,100
I suddenly have official matters
to attend to.

157
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,710
Xingzhou, just now, it was her...

158
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,710
It's late,

159
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,760
Mrs. Mingting should go back and rest

160
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,550
to avoid worrying my brother.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,840
Let's go.

162
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,910
Hurry up.

163
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,910
There, there, don't cry.

164
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,310
Are you alright?

165
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,000
Thank you, Miss.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,840
Take it slow.

167
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,350
(Yang Anning,)

168
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,080
(who really are you?)

169
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,940
(Joy)

170
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,190
The bridal sedan chair has arrived.

171
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,660
(He's Mansion)

172
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,550
Anning,

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
the people from the He's Mansion say

174
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,480
(Cheng Yumei, owner of Cheng's Medical)
we should wait for Lu Yongxi,

175
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,730
so you can have the ceremony together.

176
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,360
No rush.

177
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,520
As long as I can enter the He's Mansion,

178
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,200
I can wait however long it takes.

179
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,300
(He's Mansion)

180
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,320
My Lord, it's not good!

181
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,400
What's wrong?

182
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,000
The bride has changed her mind?

183
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,840
Miss Lu Yongxi
has poisoned herself in suicide.

184
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,660
(He's Mansion)

185
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,840
Mr. Xingzhou is coming out.

186
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,280
Mr. Xingzhou!

187
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,390
Mr. Xingzhou!

188
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,360
Wait, you...

189
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,640
What's wrong with He Xingzhou?

190
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,990
It seems like Mr. Xingzhou
wants to cancel the wedding.

191
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,520
This will be quite the spectacle.

192
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,200
In my opinion,

193
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,880
this marriage was absurd, to begin with.

194
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,050
(He's Mansion)
An actress

195
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,880
marrying into the Commander's residence
as a concubine

196
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,280
would have already been a miracle,

197
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,350
let alone as the wife.

198
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,110
Xingzhou,

199
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,840
why did you have to ride

200
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,520
the fiercest horse at the stable,

201
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,110
hurting yourself like this?

202
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,760
It's okay.

203
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,590
I've already tamed it.

204
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,470
I'll take you out another day.

205
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,200
I don't want to go out.

206
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,000
I just want you to protect yourself.

207
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,640
Yongxi, stop crying.

208
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,110
I promise you.

209
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,320
I'll take care of myself

210
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,320
and I'll protect you.

211
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,440
For a lifetime?

212
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,840
For a lifetime.

213
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,640
A pinky promise
is valid for a hundred years.

214
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,190
Go!

215
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,110
She poisoned herself on her wedding day?

216
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,280
Who is she showing this to?

217
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,670
She's making it hard for us,

218
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,550
isn't she?

219
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,150
You, go!

220
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,470
Get her at the Lu's Mansion!

221
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,310
- Yes.
- Wait.

222
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,600
Mother,

223
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,880
if Yongxi

224
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,590
would rather die

225
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,760
than marry a cripple like me,

226
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,790
why force her?

227
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,400
What cripple?

228
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,840
I won't allow you to say that.

229
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,520
You are the only legitimate son
of our family,

230
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,960
the future master of Yuncheng.

231
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,910
You deserve the best.

232
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,230
I fear Father has long stopped

233
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,520
thinking this way.

234
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,150
No,

235
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,350
it can't be.

236
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,520
As long as I'm here,

237
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,000
you'll always be the heir.

238
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,520
No one else will.

239
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,790
Miss.

240
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,280
Miss, please don't die!

241
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,590
Miss.

242
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,280
Miss, please don't die!

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,030
I'll go get a doctor.

244
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,920
Xingzhou.

245
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,400
Xingzhou, don't go.

246
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,990
Xingzhou,

247
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,960
I thought

248
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,550
I wouldn't even see you for the last time.

249
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,630
Thankfully,

250
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,760
heaven has pitied me.

251
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,960
Quite realistic.

252
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,840
What did you use?

253
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,590
Xingzhou, Xingzhou,

254
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,640
I'm begging you.

255
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,670
Take me with you.

256
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,910
I realize now

257
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,520
that I can't leave you.

258
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,840
I simply can't leave you.

259
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,710
I love you.
