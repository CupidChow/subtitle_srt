=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,260
(Ma's Mansion)

4
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,560
Yuncheng is a must-have for me.

5
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,590
He Xingzhou, you just wait to die.

6
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,750
Commander.

7
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,910
- Let her in.
- Yes.

8
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,950
Tell me.

9
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,840
What does Mrs. He have to tell me?

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,830
Your illness seems to be getting worse.

11
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,720
Why not change the doctor?

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,720
No need.

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,000
It's an old ailment,

14
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,360
hard to cure completely,

15
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,680
and just needs gradual treatment.

16
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,280
By the way,

17
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,800
I heard

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,400
Anning is pregnant again.

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,440
Yes.

20
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,080
You must be careful this time.

21
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,120
All food and medicines

22
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,500
should come directly
from the small kitchen.

23
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,440
Don't let others handle them.

24
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,440
I will.

25
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,870
What happened to your mother back then

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,550
was my fault.

27
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,910
Commander,

28
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,520
I really did nothing

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,030
to betray you.

30
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,880
Can you believe me?

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,390
With all the evidence against you,

32
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,520
what's there to argue?

33
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,320
The butler admitted it.

34
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,520
You seduced him

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,460
and even gave him your intimates

36
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,360
as a token of love.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,470
You're slandering me!

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,750
It was clearly a set-up.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,160
My Lord, please believe me.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,720
I really didn't do it.

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,360
My Lord, let me handle her for you.

42
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,750
You little wretch.

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll teach you for your infidelity!

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
Don't bully my mother!

45
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,740
Xingzhou!

46
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,300
Xingzhou, are you alright?

47
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,020
My Lord, I've always said

48
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,820
you can't marry an actress.

49
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,300
They're all lowly.

50
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,080
Soon she'll corrupt Mr. Xingzhou.

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,980
Someone,

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,260
lock up Jasmine.

53
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,540
No one is allowed to visit her.

54
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,540
Commander!

55
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,040
What should I do?

56
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,580
Back then,

57
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,580
I was blinded by anger.

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,700
But who knew

59
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,060
she would commit suicide?

60
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,500
Suicide?

61
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,620
Wasn't it a cover-up murder

62
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,460
just for your so-called honor?

63
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,500
Xingzhou, you...

64
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,540
Are you saying...

65
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,620
You've always thought...

66
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,460
Although

67
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,940
I wasn't good enough to her,

68
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,380
I definitely wouldn't do it.

69
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,420
She would never commit suicide.

70
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,610
My Lord,

71
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,460
your death was so tragic,

72
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,900
leaving me alone.

73
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,140
What am I supposed to do?

74
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,460
My Lord!

75
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,100
He Xingzhou!

76
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,220
You heartless beast!

77
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,900
You conscienceless jerk!

78
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,020
You killed your own father!

79
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,740
Do you have no conscience at all?

80
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,580
You're

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,620
playing the thief
shouting ''catch the thief'' again,

82
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,060
aren't you?

83
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,460
My Lady!

84
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,580
He Xingzhou.

85
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,620
You dared to poison Commander He

86
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,220
to seize power.

87
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,500
Someone,

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,620
arrest him!

89
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,460
Yes!

90
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,100
Stop, this is the Commander's mansion!

91
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,180
Are you trying to rebel?

92
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,780
Vice Commander Ma,

93
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,300
you said Xingzhou killed Commander He.

94
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,420
Do you have evidence?

95
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,180
Of course,

96
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,500
and it will convince you beyond doubt.

97
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,060
Tell me.

98
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,100
Who entered the study tonight?

99
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,060
Only...

100
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,780
Only Mr. Xingzhou.

101
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,700
And who brought in

102
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,900
that poisoned medicine?

103
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,700
It must have been

104
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,220
Mr. Xingzhou.

105
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,220
Must have?

106
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,340
So, you didn't actually see it
with your own eyes?

107
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,340
After Lord He fell ill,

108
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,620
he became very suspicious,

109
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,820
only eating food
made in the small kitchen.

110
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,860
Only Mr. Xingzhou had the opportunity,

111
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,220
and I personally heard them

112
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,380
arguing in the room.

113
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,340
Is that so?

114
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,180
What were we arguing about?

115
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,060
I didn't hear it very clearly.

116
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,340
Something about a will.

117
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,860
Right.

118
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,820
This is the will.

119
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,660
Lord He had only recently

120
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,660
discovered the true colors
of He Xingzhou.

121
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,380
So,

122
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,380
he changed the heir in the will.

123
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,980
Xingzhou,

124
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,820
how could you...

125
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,460
(It seems this is a carefully laid trap.)

126
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,580
Someone,

127
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,420
tie up He Xingzhou,

128
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,700
and take him to jail
for strict interrogation.

129
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,580
Yes.

130
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,540
No need.

131
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,260
I will go by myself.

132
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,980
Xingzhou.

133
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,900
Take care of yourself,

134
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,060
and wait for my return.

135
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Mrs. He,

136
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,860
why have you come?

137
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,740
I've come to seek cooperation

138
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,540
to deal with

139
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,020
He Zhenyun.

140
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,420
Is that so?

141
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,300
Weren't you deeply devoted

142
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,060
to that old man?

143
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,780
Now,

144
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,060
I just want him

145
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,300
to die sooner.

146
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,300
If you don't show some sincerity,

147
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,540
how can I believe you?

148
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,700
(Gales make mighty warriors,
adversities grieve this man)

149
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,120
First bow.

150
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,250
Second bow.

151
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,140
Third bow.

152
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,160
Family responds.

153
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,780
My Lady, I'm sorry.

154
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,660
Guests arrive. Take off the hats.

155
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,820
First bow.

156
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,300
(The Commander's death)

157
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,090
- (is clearly a conspiracy.)
- Second bow.

158
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,340
- (It definitely involves Liang Rufen.)
- Third bow.

159
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,510
- (If that's the case,)
- Family responds.

160
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,340
(they surely won't let him off easily.)

161
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,870
A guest arrives.

162
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,220
Take off the hat.

163
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,220
First bow.

164
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,060
Second bow.

165
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Third bow.

166
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,340
Family responds.

167
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,220
My Lady, I'm sorry.

168
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,740
I will surely reveal the truth

169
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,780
and give Zhenyun justice.

170
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,380
Thank you, Vice Commander Ma.

171
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,140
You wretch!

172
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,100
Why are you still here?

173
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,700
Get out of here now!

174
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,820
My Lady, there's no need to rush.

175
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,820
The truth hasn't been clarified yet.

176
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,300
Moreover, as the daughter-in-law,

177
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,940
I should stay at the Commander's wake.

178
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,100
You still dare to talk back
when it's come to this?

179
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,740
- Mama, are you alright?
- My Lady.

180
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,860
Mother, you've been overworking
these days.

181
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,940
Go back and rest now.

182
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,100
These family matters

183
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,500
can be handled after the funeral.

184
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,210
I...

185
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,740
Don't let the guests laugh at us

186
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,860
and accuse us of being petty

187
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,860
and treating her harshly.

188
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,420
Wait a few days,

189
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,020
and see how I'll deal with you.

190
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,300
Be careful.

191
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,020
Begonia, don't worry.

192
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,700
Though Xingzhou

193
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,860
made a mistake in a moment of confusion,

194
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,990
the crime should not extend
to his wife and children.

195
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,940
Mr. Mingting,

196
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,980
I believe Xingzhou is innocent.

197
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,020
There must be
some misunderstanding here.

198
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,860
I also hope so.

199
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,980
Begonia,

200
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,740
if you need any help,

201
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,700
just tell me.

202
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,140
Mr. Mingting,

203
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,420
over a year ago,

204
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,500
did you invite an actor here for a play?

205
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,980
Was Vice Commander Ma also present?

206
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,580
It seems

207
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,540
he was.

208
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,700
Begonia, why do you
suddenly ask about this?

209
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
I'm just trying to understand

210
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,980
Vice Commander Ma a bit better.

211
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,460
I think the matter with Xingzhou

212
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,100
might have been orchestrated by him.

213
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,340
That day,

214
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,700
it seemed he had a conflict

215
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,660
with Snowdrop.
