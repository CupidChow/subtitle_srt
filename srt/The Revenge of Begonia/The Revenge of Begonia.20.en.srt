00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,020
=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,720
Why did you come back?

4
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,910
Do you want to be imprisoned again?

5
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,910
I came back to help you quit opium.

6
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,950
Think you can do it?

7
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,760
Yes.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,950
Tie him up.

9
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,670
This...

10
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,630
Trust me.

11
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,640
Yes.

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,630
Mrs. Xingzhou,

13
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,720
what did you give Commander?

14
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,120
This is a detoxification pill
made by Yumei.

15
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,390
That's great.

16
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,630
Commander is saved.

17
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,190
This pill's effect
is not that significant.

18
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,160
It's just some calming medicine

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,910
to make him feel better
during the withdrawal.

20
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,240
The rest is up to him to endure.

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,200
Xingzhou.

22
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,830
Xingzhou, you will get better.

23
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,960
I can't take it anymore.

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,030
- Xingzhou.
- Opium.

25
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,880
Let me have a smoke. Just one.

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,080
Xingzhou, you will get better.

27
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,320
I can't get better.

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,520
I can't get better.

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,110
You can bite me.

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,320
Just bite me.

31
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,630
Commander.

32
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,230
Mrs. Xingzhou,

33
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,990
maybe you should
listen to the Commander.

34
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,190
Let him quit gradually.

35
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,560
Today, let him have one stick.

36
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,470
Tomorrow, half a stick.

37
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,520
Absolutely not.

38
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,600
Yumei said

39
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,630
it will never succeed that way.

40
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,060
Yang Anning, what are you doing?

41
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,140
Let Xingzhou go.

42
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,820
What are you doing?

43
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,660
It's just smoking opium.

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,370
The He family and the Lu family
have plenty of money.

45
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,140
We can support his habit
for a lifetime.

46
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,620
Why make him suffer like this?

47
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,220
That way, he'll become useless!

48
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,500
A useless man is none of your concern.

49
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,140
You've already left here.

50
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,980
Why did you come back?

51
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,060
Lu Yongxi,

52
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,940
listen to me carefully.

53
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,620
I am the rightful mistress
of the He family.

54
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,420
Why should I leave?

55
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,220
If you continue to cause trouble,

56
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,660
I'll deal with you by the family law.

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,540
Mr. Zhao,

58
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,180
escort Mrs. Mingting out.

59
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,500
Mrs. Mingting,

60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,060
please leave.

61
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,420
Please leave.

62
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,020
(She came back so quickly.)

63
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,140
(I really underestimated her.)

64
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,660
(If He Xingzhou's addiction)

65
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,900
(can really be cured,)

66
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,500
(it could be troublesome.)

67
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,020
(I need to come up with a good plan.)

68
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,500
So, you're saying

69
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,700
in the end,
it was Xingzhou who took Snowdrop?

70
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,380
Opium.

71
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,660
Xingzhou, calm down.

72
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,500
Quick, give me opium.

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,900
Xingzhou, hold on a bit longer.

74
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,700
- Xingzhou.
- It's so hard.

75
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,020
Xingzhou, let's endure a bit longer.

76
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,260
- A bit longer.
- It's so hard.

77
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,100
Xingzhou.

78
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,820
Xingzhou.

79
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,100
Xingzhou.

80
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,180
Xingzhou.

81
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,660
Xingzhou.

82
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,140
Xingzhou.

83
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,940
Zhao Xiaochuan!

84
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,260
Xingzhou.

85
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,820
Xingzhou.

86
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,860
Xingzhou.

87
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,580
- Anning.
- Xingzhou.

88
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,780
Anning.

89
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,420
I can't take it anymore.

90
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,020
Just let me die.

91
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,620
- Xingzhou.
- Just let me die.

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,540
Xingzhou,

93
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,500
you want a child with me, right?

94
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,820
You want a child, right?

95
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,660
Child.

96
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,180
The child is gone.

97
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,420
It really wasn't me who aborted it.

98
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,940
I was looking forward to this child,
just like you.

99
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,460
At that time, I was suspicious of you,

100
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,940
so I said some angry words.

101
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,060
Xingzhou,

102
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,380
you have to believe me.

103
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,180
It wasn't you.

104
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,980
Xingzhou,

105
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,380
when you get better,

106
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,780
we will have children again.

107
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,780
Quick.

108
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,700
Quick, tie me up.

109
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,700
Tie me up now.

110
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Tie me up now.

111
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,660
Someone,

112
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,460
someone, quick, come here.

113
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,980
Xingzhou.

114
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,620
Great.

115
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,740
Great.

116
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,100
Great, Commander.

117
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,300
You finally made it.

118
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,980
It's all thanks to Anning.

119
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,140
If it weren't for her,

120
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,580
I couldn't have made it through this.

121
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,260
It mainly depended on your willpower.

122
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,060
Recently,

123
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,860
you've been through a lot.

124
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,900
Forget it.

125
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,220
It's all in the past.

126
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,380
Stay with me a bit longer.

127
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,340
No, it's too late.

128
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,860
Yumei will be here soon.

129
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,220
Then wait until she arrives.

130
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,300
(Seems like he)

131
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,260
(has completely forgotten)

132
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,500
(today is a special day.)

133
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,860
(Considering you just recovered,)

134
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,340
(I won't argue with you.)

135
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,260
What are you humming?

136
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,140
What are you humming?

137
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,140
Still humming?

138
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,940
You...

139
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,060
Stop it, He Xingzhou.

140
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,900
- Humming again?
- Stop it.

141
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,140
Commander, the person
you arranged to meet is here.

142
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,420
He's waiting in the study.

143
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,100
Oh no, I almost forgot.

144
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,300
Who did you arrange to meet?

145
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,140
Why in such a hurry?

146
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,990
Someone from the Military Department.

147
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,460
He needs to report something to me.

148
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,660
Take it easy.

149
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,180
(Yang Anning,)

150
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,020
(happy 20th birthday.)

151
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,690
(Begonia blooms not sparing rouge,
standing alone in fine rain)

152
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,060
(My Begonia, happy birthday)

153
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,740
What are you thinking about?

154
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,060
Looks like a hanger in your mouth.

155
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,700
Yumei, you're here.

156
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,380
Look,

157
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,290
I specially stole my dad's
private stash of medicinal wine

158
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,660
to celebrate your birthday.

159
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,900
I'm such a good friend.

160
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,460
Let's go, Yumei.

161
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,700
I want to go somewhere.

162
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,580
Where are we going?

163
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,940
Commander, it's like this.

164
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,100
Yes, like this.

165
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,580
Alright.

166
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,700
Like this.

167
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,460
Commander, you did it wrong again.

168
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,460
You should wrap it like this.

169
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,020
It's reversed?

170
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,260
Commander,

171
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,780
how about I go check on Mrs. Xingzhou?

172
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,380
Go, go, go.

173
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,100
Master, then

174
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,520
should I start from scratch?

175
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,380
Yeah, cut it.

176
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,540
Be careful.

177
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,540
Let me do it.

178
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,660
If I wait for you to finish cooking,

179
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,540
I'll starve to death.

180
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,380
No, no.

181
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,540
This time
I must cook for Xingzhou myself.

182
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,940
I really don't understand

183
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,460
you lovers.

184
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,740
Miss Yumei.

185
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,980
Mrs. Xingzhou is also here.

186
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,340
What's going on?

187
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,940
No idea.

188
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,420
Miss Yumei,

189
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,820
are you

190
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,740
hungry?

191
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,780
How about

192
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
I treat you to a meal?

193
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,180
What do you mean?

194
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,180
You want to court me?

195
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,900
Speak properly.

196
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,540
If it's really impossible,

197
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,740
I won't force you.

198
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,220
Let's go.

199
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,740
Where to?

200
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,460
Didn't you say
you wanted to treat me to a meal?

201
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,420
I want to eat

202
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,740
Western food.

203
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,260
What are you standing around for?

204
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,980
Go now.

205
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,540
Xingzhou, it's time to eat.

206
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,860
Strange.

207
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
Why isn't he here?

208
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,740
(What's he busy with?)

209
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,540
