=Episode 9=

3
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,150
Tell me. Where is she?

4
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,550
Who?

5
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,480
I don't know.

6
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,390
Don't make me ask again.

7
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,430
Over there.

8
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,110
Stop right there!

9
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,550
Don't be rash!

10
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,990
Let me go!

11
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,150
Be careful!

12
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,560
Sir, it's all a misunderstanding!

13
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,270
Spare me! Spare me!

14
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,400
You dare touch my girl?

15
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
I...

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,470
I didn't know who she was.

17
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,990
Spare me!

18
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,910
He's lying.

19
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
He knows I'm Begonia.

20
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,110
I...

21
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,040
So, who told you to do this?

22
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,800
No one told me to do it.

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
It was just a moment of confusion,
Mr. He.

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,400
I have solid goods here.

25
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,040
I heard you're short on weapons.

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,760
Why not let my brothers bring them up

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,120
for you to see?

28
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,030
I'll bring them

29
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,350
to show you.

30
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,600
Put down your guns.

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,800
Put them down!

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Are you deaf?

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,080
Go!

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,990
Protect yourself.

35
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,630
Capture them alive!

36
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,600
I will swallow them whole!

37
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,230
Boil them alive in oil!

38
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,000
Xingzhou! Xingzhou!

39
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,920
Stop hitting him! Stop!

40
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,160
Xingzhou!

41
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,480
Stop!

42
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,670
Xingzhou!

43
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,730
- Go in!
- Yes!

44
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,100
(Fairy Tree with Good Reputation)

45
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,880
Don't move!

46
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,200
You handle the aftermath.

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,070
Make sure to find out who's behind this.

48
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,950
Take them away.

49
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,790
Yes.

50
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,580
Why?

51
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,860
Senior.

52
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,580
Why haven't you avenged me?

53
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,020
What's wrong?

54
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,260
Had a nightmare?

55
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
My head hurts.

56
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,680
What's wrong with me?

57
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,300
You've been unconscious for three days.

58
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,300
The doctor said you were frightened

59
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,500
and it affected your pregnancy.

60
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,660
You need to rest in bed for a while.

61
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,220
Three days?

62
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,780
What about the theater?

63
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,620
Don't worry.

64
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,260
I've applied for your leave.

65
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,620
Just lie down and rest.

66
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,580
Sleep easy.

67
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,660
I'm here.

68
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,620
Useless!

69
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,180
You couldn't even handle a woman!

70
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,860
It was going smoothly at first.

71
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,740
Who knew He Xingzhou
would come so quickly?

72
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,180
Begonia's reputation is growing,

73
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,220
and she's meeting
more and more important people.

74
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,420
In the future, she will certainly
be a great asset to He Xingzhou.

75
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,980
If we don't kill her now,

76
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,500
it'll be troublesome later.

77
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,940
She's just an actress.

78
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,100
How powerful can she be?

79
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,940
You!

80
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,020
You!

81
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,460
When will your brain

82
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,460
ever grow?

83
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,820
Zhao Zheng's incident

84
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,880
already fully showcased her capabilities.

85
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,860
Last time,

86
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,020
it was just like a blind cat
meeting a dead rat.

87
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,100
Are you trying to piss me off?

88
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,220
Since it's come to this,

89
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,460
might as well be thorough.

90
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,100
Dad, what do you mean

91
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,940
by that?

92
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,220
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't understand.

93
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,700
Where are they being held?

94
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,740
Open the door.

95
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,860
Vice Commander,

96
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,900
Mr. Xingzhou has ordered

97
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,220
that except for him and the Commander,

98
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,660
no one else may see these prisoners.

99
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,700
Open it.

100
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,700
Open it!

101
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,900
Yes.

102
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,020
Commander Ma.

103
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,300
Everyone out.

104
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,940
Well... Yes.

105
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,780
Commander Ma, Commander Ma,

106
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,340
please let us go.

107
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,420
All useless!

108
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,980
You deserve to die.

109
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,780
Attention!

110
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,140
By the Commander's order,

111
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,700
hang the bodies of these criminals

112
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,060
at the city gate

113
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,420
as a warning.

114
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,980
Yes.

115
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,300
My Lord, it's been found out.

116
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,100
The fake news
and the kidnapping of Begonia

117
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,350
were indeed planned by the same person.

118
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,100
Who?

119
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,260
Vice Commander Ma.

120
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,980
It must be

121
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,980
because you made him lose face

122
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,020
last time with the Inspector.

123
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,540
He wanted to get back at you.

124
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,860
It's not that simple.

125
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,420
What about the prisoners?

126
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,060
Mr. Xingzhou!

127
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,980
The criminals we caught last time

128
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,340
were all shot dead by Vice Commander Ma

129
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,990
and hung on the city walls
for public display.

130
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,580
It's his way of doing things.

131
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,220
They're all dead.

132
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,860
- This is no use now.
- Yes.

133
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,820
It's my fault,

134
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,280
I didn't assign enough people
to watch them.

135
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,180
Since he dared to go,

136
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,620
it must have been
under the old man's order.

137
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,620
It's okay.

138
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,300
There will be opportunities
to make him pay.

139
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,580
The priority now

140
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,980
is you need to find me a costume.

141
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,940
A costume?

142
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,780
It's been five whole days,

143
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,820
and I haven't seen you smile.

144
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,300
Do you really need to see me
make a fool of myself?

145
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,220
Regret it now?

146
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,660
Yeah.

147
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,540
But it was worth it.

148
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,700
Xingzhou.

149
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,220
Thank goodness you're alright.

150
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,580
My Lord, the Commander...

151
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,660
