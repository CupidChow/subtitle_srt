=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,790
Wake up.

4
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,270
Wake up.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,560
Stop.

6
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,950
I want to go home.

7
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,720
This is your home.

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,230
This is not my home.

9
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,910
Without Xingzhou,

10
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,180
the Commander's Mansion means nothing.

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,760
It's up to me, not you.

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,550
Moreover, you're carrying my child.

13
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,480
How could I let you go so easily?

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,040
I'll get rid of this child.

15
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,550
If you dare to abort this child,

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,230
I'll make sure everyone in your family

17
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,160
dies with it.

18
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,510
Don't think I don't know

19
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,800
that you were behind

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,360
this morning's explosion.

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,400
I can't be bothered to argue with you.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,360
Get back.

23
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,660
(Cheng's Medical)

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
Commander,

25
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,550
you're finally awake.

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Xiaochuan.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,640
Don't move.

28
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,270
Why am I here?

29
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,080
Of course, I saved you.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,470
You were lucky.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
Falling from such a high cliff

32
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,880
without injuring any vital organs.

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,960
Plus, with my miraculous skills,

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,030
you managed to survive.

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,030
How is Anning now?

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Is there any news about her?

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,670
I've been out several times
to gather information,

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,110
but the whole mansion is heavily guarded.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,320
Not even a fly could get in.

40
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,590
Yumei,

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,360
do you know what this ring

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,440
has to do with Snowdrop's death?

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,830
This pattern

44
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,960
looks exactly like the scars

45
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,360
on his body back then.

46
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,800
It must belong to the killer.

47
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,910
So that's it.

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,160
No wonder Anning
had such a strong reaction.

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,320
It seems everything
was set up by He Mingting.

50
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,550
Could Snowdrop's death
also be related to him?

51
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,510
No.

52
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,080
Anning is in danger.

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,470
I have to go save her.

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,600
Commander.

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
He Mingting and Ma Sihai

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,190
have already colluded.

57
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,320
Going there now

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,670
is just like walking into a trap.

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,440
Ma Sihai?

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,390
He's involved too?

61
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,270
Yes.

62
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,920
That day I was ordered to lead people

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,560
to the deserted village
in the west of the city.

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,030
We were ambushed by Ma Sihai.

65
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,550
Turns out he had already colluded
with He Mingting.

66
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,800
Now, the people outside are panicking,

67
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,000
saying that Yuncheng
is about to change hands.

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,110
The common folks surely
won't have good days ahead.

69
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,110
Xiaochuan,

70
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,910
I need you to do something.

71
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,230
Yes.

72
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,440
I understand.

73
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,390
Go on.

74
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,870
Wait.

75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
Drink your medicine.

76
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,470
Not a drop left.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,920
I'd be willing to drink

78
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,430
Miss Yumei's medicine for a lifetime.

79
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,350
Silly.

80
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,630
Go now.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,220
Congratulations, Vice Commander Ma,

82
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,350
on being reinstated.

83
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,110
You're too kind.

84
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,920
You are the one blessed with good fortune.

85
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,350
Not only have you healed your legs,

86
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
but you have also successfully inherited
the Commander's position.

87
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,320
It's truly a cause for celebration.

88
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
I...

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,160
Uncle Ma, there's a misunderstanding.

90
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,040
I haven't taken over the position
of Yuncheng's Commander.

91
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,070
Xingzhou was suddenly attacked.

92
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,600
No one has found him.

93
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,390
Begonia, unable to bear the shock,

94
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,350
lost her mind.

95
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,950
I had no choice

96
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,430
but to temporarily take over.

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,510
It's temporary.

98
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,480
Senior.

99
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,040
Senior, where are you?

100
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,190
Senior.

101
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,350
Mrs. Xingzhou, you can't go there.

102
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,950
Senior, you're here.

103
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,720
Come and practice my voice with me.

104
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,480
Really lost her mind, huh?

105
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,070
Begonia, don't worry.

106
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,920
I will be with you in no time.

107
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,670
You're not my senior.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,840
Bad man.

109
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,230
Alright, alright.

110
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,110
She's just a madwoman.

111
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,600
Don't argue with her.

112
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,600
Vice Commander Ma, you're magnanimous.

113
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,350
I'm new here.

114
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,320
In the future, Yuncheng's affairs,

115
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,440
whether big or small,

116
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,760
will rely on your support.

117
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,060
Of course, of course.

118
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,000
Who does Ma Sihai think he is?

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,920
Daring to sideline me.

120
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,380
The dog is biting another dog.

121
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,510
You truly deserve each other.

122
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,600
What did you say?

123
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,110
I...

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Lu Yongxi,

125
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,000
you really need a lesson.

126
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,950
Mingting, please don't do this.

127
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,270
I'm pregnant.

128
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,230
Don't worry.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,880
This will only make you suffer.

130
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,390
It won't harm the child.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,840
No.

132
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,280
Senior,

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,270
don't bully the pretty lady, okay?

134
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,550
She has a baby in her belly.

135
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,790
But she made a mistake.

136
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
How about

137
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,480
you take her punishment?

138
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,140
Then,

139
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,640
be gentle.

140
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,600
Mingting, Mingting,

141
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,040
I was wrong. I know I was wrong.

142
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,350
I promise

143
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,640
I'll listen to you from now on.

144
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,510
Let her go.

145
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,350
Women

146
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,440
are masochists.

147
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,790
A little beating, and you submit.

148
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,550
Baby, don't be afraid.

149
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,790
I'm here.

150
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,950
No one can bully you.

151
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,790
Anning, let's go.

152
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,600
I will take you out to play.

153
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:30,760
♪All flowers bloom♪

154
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:44,100
♪All given away freely♪

155
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,720
No,

156
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,110
still not like her.

157
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,190
Her?

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,760
Senior, who is she?

159
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,430
Slut!

160
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,200
Do you crave men that much?

161
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,960
Please spare me.

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,840
I really don't have anyone.

163
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,710
No?

164
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,550
They showed me the evidence.

165
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,520
Commander, don't!

166
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,000
No, Commander!

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,570
Today, I'll beat you to death.

168
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,440
Commander,
I really have nothing to do with him.

169
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
I'll beat you to death!

170
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,640
Commander, believe me!

171
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,480
Believe you?

172
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,030
How can I believe you?

173
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,400
I'll beat you until you confess.

174
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,710
Unfortunately,

175
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,230
over the years,

176
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,590
only Meng Xueqiao
resembles her the most.

177
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,840
If he hadn't been so proud back then,

178
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,550
I probably wouldn't have killed him.

179
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,640
Really.

180
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,790
You're really like her.

181
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,360
Who are you?

182
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,550
- Who are you?
- Shh.

183
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,920
Don't speak.

184
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,790
You are Du Liniang.

185
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,030
How can you speak with a man's voice?

186
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,550
Sing it.

187
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,910
Pretend I'm your Liu Mengmei.

188
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,880
Sing it.

189
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,370
- I'm not a woman.
- Shh.

190
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,230
I told you not to speak.

191
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,150
You look like her,

192
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,440
but not enough.

193
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,590
This way,

194
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,440
you'll look even more like her.

195
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,640
Go to hell.

196
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,200
Begonia,

197
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,350
you really can act.

198
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,960
Too bad.

199
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,200
I'm not Xingzhou.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,880
Scum!

201
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,350
Even as a ghost, I won't let you go.

202
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,320
People like you

203
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,200
are the lowest of the low even as ghosts.

204
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,470
Who are you trying to scare?

205
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,030
If you want to die so badly,

206
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,590
I'll grant your wish.

207
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,430
Commander.

208
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,760
He's alive, huh?

209
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,440
In that case,

210
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,960
I'll be merciful

211
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,320
and send you both to hell together.

212
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,200
Strange.

213
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
There's a hairpin at the main gate.

214
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,190
What's wrong?

215
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,400
Where did this hairpin come from?
