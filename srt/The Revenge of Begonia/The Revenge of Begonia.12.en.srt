=Episode 12=

3
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,500
Come on. Dig deeper. Dig deeper.

4
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,790
Split it up.

5
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,720
No, I don't feel safe putting it here.

6
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,800
Dig it out. Dig it out!

7
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,720
Throw it in the lake.
Hurry and dig it out!

8
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,910
Forget about it.
Let's come back at night.

9
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,590
Let's come back at night. Let's go now.

10
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,460
(Cheng's Medical)

11
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
Who is it?

12
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,270
It's not working hours yet.

13
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,870
Anning?

14
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,630
What are you doing here?

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,370
Come with me to investigate a case.
Let's go.

16
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,270
What case?

17
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,400
I haven't even washed my face.

18
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,520
Open the door!

19
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,270
Open the door now!

20
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,910
Hey, stop knocking, stop knocking.

21
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,830
I'm coming! I'm coming!

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
(Yuanfeng Pharmacy)
What are you knocking for?

23
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,750
Take him away.

24
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,240
You're arresting people

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,500
in broad daylight now?

26
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,940
(Ma's Mansion)

27
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,630
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,030
Slow down.

29
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,190
I'm not dead yet.

30
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,390
It's an emergency

31
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,880
and you're still
leisurely having breakfast?

32
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,830
What exactly happened?

33
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,440
- Really?
- Absolutely.

34
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
I just came from Fengyue Pavilion

35
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,420
and saw Zhao Zheng's car
heading towards the He's Mansion.

36
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,190
That car's grandeur
is definitely unmistakable.

37
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,270
It's done.

38
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,830
His coming won't change anything now.

39
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,240
It's not that.

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,670
I'm telling you
to seize the opportunity.

41
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,670
This time, we must regain our dignity

42
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,600
in front of the Inspector.

43
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,670
Go to sleep.

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,360
I'll leave it to you then.

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,270
Oh right, Dad, I heard that the aide

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,520
has arrested the manager
of Yuanfeng Pharmacy.

47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,390
What?

48
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,240
Send someone
to watch the He's Mansion now.

49
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,800
Report anything unusual right away.

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,270
You go and do it.

51
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,630
You...

52
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,110
My words don't work as well as yours.

53
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,960
I won't go.

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,000
Get out.

55
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,630
Inspector, your grand visit

56
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,960
truly makes this humble house shine.

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,880
Last time, the Commander
and Mr. Xingzhou

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,870
made great achievements
in the bandit suppression in Yuncheng.

59
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,670
I am here by order from above

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,110
to commend them.

61
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,440
On the way here,
I learned of the Commander's death,

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,920
truly regrettable.

63
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,200
If Father could know from the afterlife,

64
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,600
he would surely be grateful.

65
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,950
Since the Commander has passed away,

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,640
the reward goes to Mr. Xingzhou alone.

67
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,230
Where is he?

68
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,230
You may not know, sir.

69
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,880
Xingzhou

70
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,720
is suspected of poisoning Father

71
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,070
and is currently in jail.

72
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,270
Xingzhou has been wronged.

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
Where are your manners?

74
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,510
In front of the Inspector,

75
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,600
you have no place to speak.

76
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,510
It's alright.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,830
The news of
the Commander's death reached us,

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,820
and I was instructed
to investigate thoroughly.

79
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,160
You claim He Xingzhou is innocent.

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,320
Do you have evidence?

81
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,390
This is the evidence.

82
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,510
Last night, I personally saw Mrs. He

83
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,720
with her maid under the tree

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,000
in the backyard burying these.

85
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,790
The same type of poison was found

86
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,950
in the Commander's medicine.

87
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,110
These contain strychnine.

88
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,950
In small amounts, it can cure ailments,

89
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,790
but in excess, it's lethal.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
Are you sure?

91
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,940
Are you joking?

92
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,990
There were amazing doctors
for three generations in my family.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,950
This kind of thing

94
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,390
won't stump me.

95
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,390
Shut up! What nonsense

96
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,510
are you spouting here?

97
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,920
Whether it's nonsense,

98
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,950
you know best in your heart.

99
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,920
You wretch!

100
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,390
You just want to frame me!

101
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,950
Inspector,

102
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,040
this actress

103
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,440
lies habitually.

104
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,160
Her words are not to be believed.

105
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,350
Whether it's a false accusation,
I will find out.

106
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,110
Do you think

107
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,270
I am foolish and incompetent,

108
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,640
unable to clarify this matter?

109
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,390
- I...
- No, no!

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,600
How did you know it was strychnine?

111
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,640
And how did you know
my mother placed it?

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,070
Exactly!

113
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,830
Only Mrs. He uses

114
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,760
this kind of brocade handkerchief
in the entire family.

115
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,510
Everyone else uses silk handkerchiefs.

116
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,200
As for the source of the medicine...

117
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,070
Sir,

118
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,550
be gentle, please.

119
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,440
This is the manager of Yuanfeng Pharmacy.

120
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
I found out

121
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,640
that only his shop in Yuncheng
sells strychnine.

122
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,040
Whether it's real,

123
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
he'll know at a glance.

124
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,640
Yes, it's real strychnine.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,110
Who bought it at your store?

126
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,790
It was...

127
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,950
Speak!

128
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,320
Officer, please spare my life.
It was Vice Commander Ma.

129
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,270
It was Vice Commander Ma
who forced me to sell it.

130
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,230
Mr. Zhao,

131
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,880
you're pointing a gun at his head.

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,200
Aren't you afraid he'd say anything

133
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,070
just to save his life?

134
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,920
What about this then?

135
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,510
(Account Book)
It clearly records

136
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,160
who bought what medicine

137
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,720
on the exact date.

138
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,160
Surely this can't be fabricated, right?

139
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,350
There's more.

140
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,600
Bring her here.

141
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,160
No one knows the details better

142
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,070
than her.

143
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,200
It was...

144
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,070
It was Mrs. He.

145
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,670
I can testify to that.

146
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,670
Shut your mouth!

147
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,920
Bring the evidence forward
for me to see.

148
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,760
Now, it's clear.

149
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,000
He Xingzhou,

150
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,720
today, it's either you or me.

151
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,110
Vice Commander Ma,

152
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,790
aren't you a bit overconfident?

153
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,320
You're just a prisoner.

154
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,280
Fine.

155
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,950
I'll let you have your moment to talk.

156
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,920
Do you think everything

157
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,440
is proceeding as you planned?

158
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,280
Of course.

159
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,030
Before I left home today,

160
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,710
I even read your fate.

161
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,280
Soon,

162
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,400
you'll join your short-lived father

163
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,760
in the underworld.

164
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
Are you dead?

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Did you plan this?

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
Mother,

167
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,080
so, the will was also forged by you,

168
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,960
wasn't it?

169
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,630
I...

170
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,510
Mingting!

171
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,510
Inspector,

172
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,840
my mother is in poor health.

173
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,960
She can't survive prison.

174
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,110
Take me instead.

175
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,280
I'll serve her sentence.

176
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,200
Please, I beg you.

177
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,550
I'm begging you,

178
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,800
Inspector!

179
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,760
Please!

180
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,710
Please take me!

181
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,550
It's you!

182
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,910
You caused all this!

183
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,280
- Mother!
- It's all your fault!

184
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,910
You wretch!

185
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,780
Let her go!

186
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,150
Go to hell! Just die!

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
Mother!

188
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,080
Are you alright?

189
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,790
What took you so long?

190
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
Take them away.

191
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,140
Take them down.

192
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,510
Let's go, let's go.

193
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,960
- Please, I beg you to help us.
- Mingting!

194
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,320
Please.

195
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,250
- Please save my mother.
- Mingting!

196
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,880
You all wait and see!

197
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,520
I'll haunt you as a ghost!

198
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,640
Wait and see, you jerks!

199
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,480
Mother!

200
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,080
None of you will end well!

201
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,540
None of you will end well!

202
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,710
After so many days apart,

203
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I didn't expect such a turn of events.

204
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,360
People change so easily.

205
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,590
But rest assured, Mr. Zhao,

206
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,760
I will do everything

207
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,290
to keep Yuncheng's people
safe and prosperous.

208
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,000
(Praise Letter)
Having you as the Commander

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,320
is truly a blessing for the people.

210
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,320
It's getting late.

211
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,710
I must return to report.

212
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,550
I'm leaving now.

213
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,590
Won't you stay to hear Begonia

214
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,710
sing a tune?

215
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,910
Do you really think I'm the kind

216
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,590
to be seduced by music?

217
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,150
I helped you

218
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,470
solely because I respect you.

219
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,000
My Lord, the one in the prison says...

220
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,380
He Xingzhou,

221
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,300
do you want to know

222
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,440
how Jasmine died?

223
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,110
Everyone out.

224
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,950
Yes.

225
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,080
Tell me.

226
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,080
I refuse.

227
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,710
What can you do to me?

228
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,150
Don't test my patience,

229
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,160
or I'll use this dagger

230
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,550
to disable He Mingting's arm.

231
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,390
You wouldn't dare!

232
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,320
Don't harm Mingting.

233
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,840
He knows nothing.

234
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,400
Don't hurt him!

235
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,400
It was me!

236
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,100
It was me who killed your mother.

237
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,130
It was me!

238
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,230
I just couldn't stand

239
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,740
that woman's seductive ways.

240
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,080
Mind your words!

241
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,760
I just couldn't stand her.

242
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,200
Without her,

243
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,080
Lord He would still look at me,

244
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,470
but with her,

245
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,710
I was completely ignored.

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,840
She stole my happiness!

247
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,960
Why?

248
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,280
Shouldn't she die?

249
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,060
The person who killed my mother

250
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,380
was an expert with a gun,

251
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,820
precise in the shooting.

252
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,180
You don't have that skill.

253
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,420
Tell me.

254
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,900
Who exactly did it?

255
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,850
The Commander's not at home.

256
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,460
Finish her off now,

257
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,900
and I guarantee you a promotion.
