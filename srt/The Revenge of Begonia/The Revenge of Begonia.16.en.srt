=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,840
Alright, I understand.

4
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,720
You can go now.

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,560
Yes.

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,560
Mingting.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,720
Xingzhou.

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,680
You didn't go out today?

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,910
Isn't the Military Department busy?

10
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,310
Same as usual.

11
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,790
Why did you start smoking cigars?

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,000
These are harmful and offer no benefits.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,040
You should smoke less.

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,600
I know.

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,030
By the way,

16
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,080
recently, Mr. Li is celebrating
his seventieth birthday

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,090
and wants to hold a performance.

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,480
Last year,

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,980
Snowdrop, the actor playing Du Liniang,

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,080
was pretty good.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,950
Do you remember him?

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,160
Snowdrop...

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,400
I can't recall.

24
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,120
For a theater lover like you

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
not to remember him

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,550
must mean he was ordinary.

27
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,160
Alright, Mingting, I'll let you rest.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,600
I'll get back to work.

29
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,640
Where did you go?

30
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Nowhere.

31
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,750
Just walked around.

32
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,960
Not in a good mood?

33
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm in a good mood.

34
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,880
In that case,

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,000
come

36
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,030
over here.

37
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,630
Take off your clothes.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,960
Serve me.

39
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,790
Mingting,

40
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
can we not do this?

41
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,350
It's not good for the baby.

42
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,480
What nonsense.

43
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,830
We're husband and wife.

44
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,510
It's just

45
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,550
some marital intimacy.

46
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,070
Lu Yongxi,

47
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,230
stop dreaming of marrying He Xingzhou.

48
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,670
He'll always keep Begonia by his side

49
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,670
to curry favor with Zhao Zheng.

50
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
I beg you.

51
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,880
Mingting, I know I was wrong.

52
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,830
I know I was wrong.

53
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,920
I won't dare anymore.

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I beg you.

55
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,260
(Jasmine)

56
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,910
Mother,

57
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,760
the jasmine flowers smell so nice.

58
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,790
They're as beautiful as you.

59
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,070
Xingzhou, dear.

60
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,190
Xingzhou,

61
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,640
I will sing an opera for you, okay?

62
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,270
The Commander and Mrs. He

63
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,760
forbade me from singing,

64
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,920
but I really want to.

65
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,770
But what if Father gets angry?

66
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,880
How about we sing a song?

67
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,390
Alright, let's sing a song.

where were you?

78
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,990
I've been looking for you everywhere.

79
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,470

80
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,760
