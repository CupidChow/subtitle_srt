=Episode 7=

3
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,040
Mr. Zhao,

4
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,110
as long as the gang chaos persists,

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,590
the people of Yuncheng
will never have peace.

6
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,000
Please help us secure

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,840
this military funding.

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
Rest assured.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,240
I'll handle this matter.

10
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,990
Begonia,

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,630
if you need me

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,240
in the future,

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,430
bring this letter to me.

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

15
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,670
Slow down.

16
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,400
(What's wrong with him?)

17
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,310
Kites for sale!

18
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,270
Affordable kites!

19
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,510
Come and take a look!

20
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,080
Hold on.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,040
Kites for sale!

22
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,800
Kites for sale!

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,640
What's the matter?

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,090
- Wait, I'm going to buy something.
- Nice-looking, affordable kites!

25
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,910
Affordable kites!

26
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,360
Come and take a look!

27
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,910
Come, Miss, take a look at the kites.

28
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,240
You still have a childlike spirit,

29
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,470
but that one's quite ugly.

30
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,800
I want this one.

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
- Alright.
- Pay him.

32
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,720
Take care.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,550
This is called simplicity.

34
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,800
What do you know?

35
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,440
Commander,

36
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,720
please save my daughter.

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,080
She was taken by the Qinglong Gang.

38
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,830
- She hasn't returned.
- Go away!

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Commander!

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,800
Take him away! Now!

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,640
Please, Commander!

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,440
I beg you!

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
This is from Mr. Xingzhou.

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,520
Tomorrow, take this envelope

45
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,720
to the Military Department to see him.

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,390
Remember.

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
Don't tell anyone else.

48
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,600
Don't come here
and make a scene anymore.

49
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,360
Not only will you
not find your daughter,

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,880
but you might even lose your own life.

51
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,030
Yes.

52
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,890
Go now.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
Thank you.

54
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,800
Today, the Commander will return.

55
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,910
Don't cause a loss of life.

56
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,000
Take him away! Now!

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,840
I beg you!

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,520
(He's not what he seems.)

59
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
What's wrong?

60
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,470
Feeling unwell?

61
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,330
Why don't you keep your promises?

62
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,700
Where's what you promised me?

63
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,540
(Special Pass)

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,280
Special Pass!

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,460
Thank you, Xingzhou.

66
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,650
By the way, what do you need this for?

67
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,090
Of course, to throw my weight around!

68
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,250
I heard with this pass,

69
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,940
I can move freely within the mansion.

70
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,020
After all,

71
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,530
I am the future head of the household.

72
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,460
I should have some privileges.

73
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,180
Then, take it easy.

74
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,410
Don't overdo it.

75
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,130
Are you happy now?

76
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,620
Let's rest then.

77
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,860
Well...

78
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,020
Do you still want it?

79
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,900
I'm tired.

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,460
Rest now.

81
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,740
(Yang Anning,)

82
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,620
(why are you suddenly shy?)

83
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,770
(Is your brain broken?)

84
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,460
My Lord,

85
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,090
you've called everyone together today.

86
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,780
Is there something you wish to announce?

87
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,970
Today,

88
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,130
I received a telegram from above.

89
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,140
They not only agreed to provide
additional military funds for Yuncheng,

90
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,250
but also

91
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,570
highly praised Xingzhou.

92
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,900
It seems the position of Commander

93
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,500
will surely belong
to Xingzhou in the future.

94
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,020
Today, in front of the whole family,

95
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,900
I formally announce...

96
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
No, I disagree.

97
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,780
What did you say?

98
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,690
My Lord, the thing is

99
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,650
Mingting is the legitimate heir
of our family,

100
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,970
the rightful eldest son.

101
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,770
- You can't do it just because of his leg...
- Hold your tongue!

102
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,740
I earned this position,

103
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,810
and I decide who it goes to,

104
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,940
not some woman from the household.

105
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,370
As for Mingting,

106
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,650
I believe Xingzhou

107
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,460
will treat him and his wife well.

108
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,210
Xingzhou,

109
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,370
what do you say?

110
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,970
Commander, rest assured.

111
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,460
As long as I'm here,

112
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,020
I will protect my brother
and sister-in-law well,

113
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,810
ensuring they live a wealthy life.

114
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,370
Then, thank you, Xingzhou.

115
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,620
Good.

116
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,090
That settles it.

117
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,460
Congratulations, My Lord.

118
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,900
Congratulations, Mr. Xingzhou.

119
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,250
Congratulations, My Lord.

120
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,810
Congratulations, Mr. Xingzhou.

121
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,180
Alright.

122
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,460
He Zhenyun, you jerk!

123
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I, Liang Rufen,

124
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,220
have been with you for 25 years.

125
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,970
Even if I haven't made contributions,
I've endured hardships.

126
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,130
How have you treated me?

127
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,410
You hit and yell at me
whenever you want,

128
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,850
never treating me as a human.

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,410
Now, you even want
to give my son's inheritance

130
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,620
to that wench's

131
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,000
illegitimate child.

132
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,780
Now that it's done,

133
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,680
getting angry won't help,

134
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,300
Mother.

135
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,630
No, no.

136
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,320
It can't be.

137
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,740
There must be another way.

138
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,600
There must be.

139
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,880
You know,

140
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,880
Father is stubborn and strong-willed.

141
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,230
As long as he lives,

142
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,320
he won't hand over the family

143
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,920
to a cripple like me.

144
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,350
You mean...

145
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,390
I'm just reminding you

146
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,320
to see reality,

147
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,590
nothing more.

148
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,080
Done.

149
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,080
There's a gathering
at the department today.

150
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,400
I might be back late.

151
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,360
Okay.

152
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,340
(Jasmine)

153
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,180
Jasmine?

154
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,930
Who is she?

155
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,710
What are you doing here?

156
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,320
How did you come back so quickly?

157
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,320
Didn't you give me a pass?

158
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,710
So, I just wanted to wander around.

159
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,910
I didn't realize

160
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,880
I'd end up here.

161
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,480
What's wrong?

162
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,690
Is there something special
about this place?

163
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,990
Don't come here again.

164
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,550
I told you

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,840
this place is haunted.

166
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,430
Haunted?

167
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,230
Could it be a naughty ghost?

168
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,040
What naughty ghost?

169
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,550
Look at this.

170
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,030
These look like nail scratches.

171
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,790
Definitely a mischievous little spirit.

172
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,720
Xingzhou?

173
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,280
Xingzhou?

174
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,640
Those are old cat scratches.

175
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,550
Xingzhou.

176
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,720
Xingzhou.

177
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,240
Xingzhou.

178
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,470
Strange.

179
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,280
Where is he?

180
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
This is...

181
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,550
Xingzhou,

182
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,200
is this what you gave me?

183
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,710
How about a bet tonight

184
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,030
to see who gets drunk first?

185
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,910
If you lose,

186
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,840
you start teaching me

187
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,960
how to shoot from tomorrow.
