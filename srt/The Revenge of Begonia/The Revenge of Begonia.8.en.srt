=The Revenge of Begonia=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,180
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,200
(How did I get pregnant?)

4
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,560
(I've been taking the medicine
Yumei gave me.)

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,790
(What should I do now?)

6
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,230
What was that expression just now?

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,120
You don't want my child?

8
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,550
I just feel it's so sudden.

9
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,760
Do you want it?

10
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,030
I don't.

11
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,240
Then, shall we

12
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,400
find a doctor to take care of it?

13
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,240
Don't you dare!

14
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,030
Open your mouth.

15
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,870
You said you didn't want a child.

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,630
Why are you making me
take this medicine?

17
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,480
I'm worried
you'll affect my sleep at night.

18
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,160
The smell makes me nauseous.

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
So delicate.

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,870
Much better. Here.

21
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,510
Drink it.

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,360
It's too bitter.

23
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,240
Why so many complaints?

24
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,670
I'm not drinking today.

25
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,310
Really?

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,110
I really don't want to.

27
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,750
I've drunk it.

28
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,630
Let go of me.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,440
If you're unwilling
to drink in the future,

30
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,600
I'll feed you like this.

31
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,600
I don't want that.

32
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,440
Listen to me...

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,840
My Lord,

34
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,910
it's said someone knows

35
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,440
where the Qinglong Gang's hideout is.

36
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,360
But they'll only tell you

37
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
in person.

38
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,870
Understood.

39
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,880
I'll drink it myself.

40
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,270
I'll just go and take care of it.

41
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
Wait for me

42
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,550
to take tonight's medicine.

43
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,320
He Xingzhou, when will you ever stop?

44
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,600
Best wishes to Mrs. Xingzhou
on Dragon Boat Festival.

45
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,670
Good.

46
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,110
Senior.

47
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,920
Our little girl has really progressed.

48
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,270
In a little while,

49
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,440
you'll be ready to perform on stage.

50
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,600
Senior,

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,070
are you going out
on Dragon Boat Festival?

52
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,830
You just stay home and practice.

53
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,600
When I return from the performance,

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,720
we'll make zongzi together.

55
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,040
By the way,

56
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,950
don't forget this.

57
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,110
Senior,

58
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,760
why did you choose such a kite?

59
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,270
So ugly.

60
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,070
Silly girl.

61
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,760
Kites are like people.

62
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,350
The simpler, the better.

63
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
Just master the balance,

64
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,480
and it can fly high and steady.

65
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
It's going up, Senior.

66
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,510
It's flying really high.

67
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,550
I almost forgot
today was Dragon Boat Festival.

68
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,070
Senior...

69
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,480
Are you sure
this is the right meeting place?

70
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
That's right.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,040
It's past the time already.

72
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,990
Why hasn't the person arrived?

73
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,950
Could it be a trick just to lure us out?

74
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,510
Master,

75
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,560
Senior,

76
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,950
it's been over two years,

77
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,600
and I still haven't found the murderer.

78
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,110
What should I do?

79
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,070
Are you sure she's Begonia?

80
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
Yes.

81
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,950
So much has happened

82
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,670
over these years.

83
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,830
It would be nice if you were still here.

84
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,480
Eat up.

85
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,790
Look, it's mended.

86
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,230
Senior, you're really amazing.

87
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Drink your medicine.

88
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,760
If your throat gets damaged,

89
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,000
how will you perform?

90
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,040
Here.

91
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,910
Senior,

92
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,230
Master said

93
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,960
everyone on stage
must have a stage name.

94
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,440
You're called Snowdrop.

95
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,350
What should I be called?

96
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,640
"Who commands the spring
after begonias fade?

97
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,400
Blossoms are suffering
from storms every day."

98
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,870
How about

99
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,030
Begonia?

100
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,590
Master,

101
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,670
Senior,

102
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,080
I only want...

103
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,590
Time's up. Let's go back.

104
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,430
Yes.

105
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,510
My Lord.

106
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,590
Where is my wife?

107
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,840
Wasn't she with you

108
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,790
when you left?

109
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,790
Is she not at home?

110
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,550
Yuncheng Grand Theater, right?

111
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,550
Is Begonia there?

112
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,630
Okay, I got it.

113
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,670
Sir, something's wrong.

114
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,710
Darn it.

115
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,200
Didn't they say you're just a courtesan?

116
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,440
Why so fierce?

117
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,150
I'm warning you.

118
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,400
Don't come any closer.

119
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,430
Beauty,

120
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,230
I'll make sure you enjoy yourself today.

121
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,080
Come here.

122
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,470
You dare hit me?

123
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,470
Get back here!

124
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,110
You wench!

125
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,350
- I'll teach you a lesson!
- Don't come any closer!

126
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,280
You really don't know
your own strength, do you?

127
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,950
Don't move!

128
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,630
Don't move!

129
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,590
Come any closer and I'll shoot!

130
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840
Go ahead.

131
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,750
Shoot here.

132
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,790
Do you even know how to use a gun?

133
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,590
(Fairy Tree with Good Reputation)
It's been a long time.

134
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,170
Sir, it's been a while.

135
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,840
Here I am now.

136
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,690
Let's go.

137
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,430
What's going on?

138
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,760
Why is he here?

139
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,840
Should we intervene?

140
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,910
Didn't you see he's wearing a mask?

141
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,080
Clearly, he doesn't want
to be recognized.

142
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,550
Let's pretend we didn't see anything.

143
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,790
That brute Qian.

144
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,550
He might have already harmed her.

145
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,840
Who would have thought,

146
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,350
a singer like you

147
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,670
actually knows how to shoot?

148
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,760
If it weren't for my gun

149
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,670
being unloaded,

150
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,840
you might have actually killed me.

151
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,160
Alright.

152
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,880
Enough playing around.

153
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,670
A fiery woman like you

154
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,880
being dead

155
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,960
would still be delicious.

156
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,920
Put down the gun.

157
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,030
And what might your father command?

158
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,000
What father?

159
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,280
I am your master.

160
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,200
This woman is mine.

161
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,190
Put down the gun.

162
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,960
We agreed

163
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,520
after we have had our fun,

164
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,640
we'll hang her on the city wall.

165
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,640
It's not proper for you

166
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,760
to interfere like this.

167
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,320
Next time,

168
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,400
the gun will be pointed

169
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,350
at your head.

170
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,230
Sir, sir,

171
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,760
just calm down.

172
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,760
Calm down.

173
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,760
You're my brother after all.

174
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,320
If it really comes to it,

175
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,260
how about we do it together?

176
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,670
Get lost!

177
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,080
Look at yourself in the urine

178
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
and find out who you are.

179
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,710
Dare to call me brother?

180
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,000
Get out!

181
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,350
Alright, alright.

182
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,230
Then you better be quick.

183
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,670
My brothers are waiting.

184
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,350
You're the quick one!

185
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,630
My Lord,

186
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,640
these are...

187
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,790
Clues Anning left for us with the kite.

188
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,030
Looks like this is the place.

189
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,740
(Fairy Tree with Good Reputation)

190
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,790
Go back and bring my men.

191
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,640
No matter who the opponent is,

192
