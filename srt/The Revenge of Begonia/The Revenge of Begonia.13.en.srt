=Episode 13=

3
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,790
I won't let you die so easily.

4
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,840
I'll keep tormenting you.

5
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm afraid you'll never

6
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,880
have that chance!

7
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,280
Commander.

8
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,480
What?

9
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,510
Ma Sihai has escaped.

10
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,950
When did this happen?

11
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,790
Just now.

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,480
Ma Yaozu and their relatives
are missing too.

13
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,800
Order a citywide manhunt now.

14
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,510
Why aren't you resting in your room?

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,480
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,800
I want to see Ma Sihai.

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,590
Why do you want to see him?

19
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,760
He previously

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
had someone else impersonate me

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,270
to meet with the Inspector.

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,830
He didn't take me seriously at all.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,000
I need to slap him

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
to vent my anger.

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,520
Take me to him.

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,190
Go and slap.

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,800
He's escaped.

28
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,940
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,390
You'll have to settle

30
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,080
for slapping the place
where he was held.

31
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,670
He Xingzhou!

32
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,440
You're so easily teased.

33
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,110
Alright.

34
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,670
When we catch him again,

35
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,720
I'll let you personally execute him.

36
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,670
How about that?

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Not great.

38
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,870
What's wrong?

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,750
(Not that pattern.)

40
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,670
Nothing.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,560
Let's go.

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,030
(Now the trail is cold again.)

43
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,980
(If the killer isn't Ma Sihai,)

44
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,460
(then who could it be?)

45
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,160
Anning,

46
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,000
are you asleep?

47
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,070
(It's so late.)

48
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,600
(Where is he going?)

49
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,270
Right, turn around.

50
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,600
Good.

51
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,720
Great, great.

52
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,230
Xingzhou, come.

53
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,480
Let's write this character.

54
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,200
Write the character "person".

55
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,880
One stroke down and another stroke up.

56
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,040
Standing tall and upright.

57
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,600
Xingzhou,

58
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
when you grow up,

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,390
you should be a person

60
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,390
who stands tall and upright.

61
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,060
(Memorial Tablet
of the late Mr. He Zhenyun)

62
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
So, you're here.

63
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,390
Mr. Xingzhou... No, Commander.

64
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,110
Merchants from Nancheng
have sent representatives

65
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,360
to ask if they should continue to give the money
they used to pay Vice Commander Ma

66
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,230
to the Commander's Mansion.

67
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,670
Tell them

68
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,600
to operate as usual.

69
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,230
Aside from basic taxes,

70
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,320
all other fees are waived.

71
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,440
Yes, I'll handle it immediately.

72
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,720
Anything else?

73
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,950
Xingzhou.

74
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,790
Mrs. Mingting.

75
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,160
I came specifically to congratulate you.

76
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,200
Not only did you
successfully clear your name,

77
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,040
but you also completely
took over Yuncheng.

78
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,320
Xingzhou,

79
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,230
you don't know,

80
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,270
if it weren't for my secret help,

81
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,390
Yang Anning wouldn't have been able

82
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,040
to get the key evidence
to overturn your case.

83
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,670
Is that so?

84
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,230
Thank you.

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
I don't want any thanks.

86
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,150
I just hope you can forgive me.

87
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,230
I don't need to be your wife.

88
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,400
I could just stay by your side,

89
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,280
serving tea and water as a maid.

90
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,880
It would be better
than being with He Mingting.

91
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,110
Yongxi, it's over between us.

92
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,520
Now, Anning is my wife.

93
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,710
I won't do anything to betray her.

94
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,360
It seems,

95
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,400
you really have fallen for her.

96
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,390
Yes.

97
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,470
If you want to leave my brother

98
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,760
and leave here,

99
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,880
I won't oppose it.

100
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,350
Why are you laughing?

101
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,910
I'm laughing at how foolish I am.

102
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,350
I used to think

103
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,590
as long as I stayed by your side,

104
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,520
one day I would surpass her.

105
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,590
I didn't expect

106
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,200
it to be my wishful thinking.

107
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,550
Yongxi.

108
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,150
Done talking with Xingzhou?

109
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,350
I'm here to take you home.

110
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,180
(Cheng's Medical)

111
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,200
Now that the trail
with Ma Sihai is cold.

112
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,110
Could it be He Mingting,

113
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,990
whom I never investigated?

114
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,400
But he seems like a good person

115
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,110
and loves opera so much.

116
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,030
He wouldn't do anything harmful

117
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,030
to Senior.

118
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,470
Alright, Anning.

119
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,280
Don't overthink this now.

120
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,280
Such matters can't be rushed.

121
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,520
You'd better think

122
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,550
about the baby first.

123
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,880
What do you mean?

124
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,470
The baby is fine, right?

125
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,880
You never thought

126
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,150
about abortion, did you?

127
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,120
Anning,

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,440
have you really fallen for He Xingzhou?

129
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,190
No.

130
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,520
Am I

131
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,280
betraying Senior?

132
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,110
Don't talk nonsense.

133
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,200
You always saw Meng Xueqiao

134
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,230
as a brother.

135
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,550
Even if your master

136
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,030
had arranged a marriage for you two,

137
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,200
now that he's gone,

138
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,640
you have the right
to pursue your own happiness.

139
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,960
The baby is fine.

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Go back and eat well.

141
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,200
Put Xueqiao's matter aside

142
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,910
for now.

143
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,080
Thank you, Yumei.

144
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,000
No need to be polite with me.

145
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,320
Wait here.
I'll get you some prenatal medicine.

146

(Body Measurements Diagram)

147
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,600
What are you looking at?

148
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,590
You're back.

149
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,870
Acupuncture.

150
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,640
Since when
did you start learning medicine?

151
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,150
As a child, I often watched Yumei do it,

152
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,550
so I picked up bits and pieces.

153
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,350
What have you been busy with lately?

154
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,470
Why did you come back so late?

155
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,480
Did you miss me?

156
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,240
How much did you miss me?

157
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,640
As much as you missed me,

158
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,760
My Lord.

159
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,150
Playing mind games with me again?

160
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,790
He Xingzhou, you're like a dog.

161
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,520
With a beauty by my side,

162
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,110
it's a feast for the eyes.

163
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,630
What's wrong?

164
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,030
You're pregnant.

165
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,320
We'll do it later.

166
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,600
Xingzhou.

167
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,070
Alright.

168
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,520
You go to bed now.

169
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,640
