1
00:00:00,653 --> 00:00:03,774

2
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:30,968

3
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:33,841
You could have hurt yourself.

4
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:36,052
You have to be careful.

5
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:19,245
 All other women are...  nothing

6
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:23,706
 but toys to quench their desires.

7
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:44,103
Are you okay? Aren't you hurt?

8
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:49,293
Why would you have a docent do something like this?

9
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:53,577
I should have been more thoughtful.

10
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,725
I think you're just too busy these days.

11
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:02,519
Is Mother asking too much from you, perhaps?

12
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,018
Don't say that.

13
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:14,834
Yi Seol, this…

14
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,222
You should have called the facilities team for this.

15
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:22,383
We could have had an accident here.

16
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:25,275
I'm sorry. I thought we could do the little things ourselves.

17
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,681
- Clean this up. 
 - Okay.

18
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:36,032
Don't be too harsh.

19
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:38,430
I thought you were the nice boss.

20
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:51,515

21
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:53,498
What did you want to discuss?

22
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:56,305
Let's talk about it over lunch.

23
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:01,344
What do you want to have?

24
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:05,106
I'd actually like Yi Seol to join us.

25
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:10,808
- Why? 
 - Honey.

26
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,989
You know Dong Min, right?

27
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,832
It looks like he's a bit disappointed.

28
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:18,830
What does that have to do with Yi Seol?

29
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,598
What's up with you?

30
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:24,631
It's weird. You say you have something to discuss, and then…

31
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:41,614
 I know I'm being childish, but

32
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,058
 I'm in such agony. And I need your encouragement.

33
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:50,287
He just learned that my father's the CEO of Myeongseong Industry.

34
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:54,174
He's not a child. Why flip out over nothing?

35
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:56,839
Exactly. He is a child.

36
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,903
One conscientious child, who can also be dangerous.

37
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:04,697
Once a kid like that turns against you, he might be hard to stop.

38
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,902
But why Yi Seol?

39
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,426
I think he's into her.

40
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:18,488
I don't think it'll be enough with just me there.

41
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,608
And it'd also be weird

42
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:22,533
if the two of us sat him down to talk.

43
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,963
He'd feel weird, too.

44
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:33,110
What did you think I was doing to fume like this?

45
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:37,454
I've had a lot on my plate recently.

46
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,144
I guess I'm just sensitive.

47
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:48,605
Have you booked a place?

48
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,513
Any suggestions?

49
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:56,798
Well that…

50
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:59,420
Oh, I wasn't talking to you.

51
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,245
Madam Hong, so you're talking

52
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:06,316
about the booking on June 5th, 2014, right?

53
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:12,121
So Young Joo went with Cho Kang Hyeon, Da Jeong with Kwak Ki Hwan,

54
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,757
Ga Yeon with Choi Hee Joong, Chae Lin with Min…

55
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,573
Min Seong Sik?

56
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:19,534
Oh my lord. Yes.

57
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:21,534
So it wasn't any of them?

58
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:24,310
I see. I'll talk to you later.

59
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,942
- What did she say? 
 - It wasn't any of our girls.

60
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:29,354
So a child was born,

61
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,265
and somebody must have given birth.

62
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,124
Right.

63
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:37,233
Ah! Right!

64
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:45,041
Yong Seob!

65
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:48,721
Give me water.

66
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:02,726
Where is the child?

67
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:05,391
What?

68
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,790
Where is the girl that lived with No Young Joo?

69
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,395
- No, not her. 
 - What?

70
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:16,960
The child she gave birth to. What happened to the child?

71
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:19,994
I'm not sure what you're–

72
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:24,126
I heard she faked a stillbirth and gave the child up for adoption.

73
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,180
There must have been a reason why she had to give birth

74
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,819
under someone else's name.

75
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:33,800
- I don't know much at all. 
 - I don't need much from you.

76
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,644
Just answer this.

77
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,700
That child was conceived

78
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,598
on that day seven years ago, right?

79
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:51,224
If you're not too busy, you should join us.

80
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:54,622
I heard you're free.

81
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:57,127
And you'll have lunch anyway.

82
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:59,305
It's just a lunch.

83
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:05,003
Do you really want me there?

84
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:10,126
Do I sound like I don't mean it?

85
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,323
Well, there might be things you don't yet know about me

86
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:20,283
and vice versa.

87
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:32,117
If that's what you want, I'll go.

88
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:35,324
Really?

89
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:39,244
Honey.

90
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:45,222
Yi Seol will be joining us.

91
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:06,116

92
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,807

93
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,862

94
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:26,589
Hey, Eun Jung.

95
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:29,356
 Hey. What are you up to?

96
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:32,950
Why do you sound so down? Is something the matter?

97
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,127
It's about Joon Hyeok. Will he be okay?

98
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,829
So you saw the news, right?

99
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,783
Dad was so happy that Joon Hyeok

100
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:45,254
was going to be Secretary.

101
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:48,096
I'm sure he'll handle the situation

102
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,895
just like he always has.

103
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:53,711
Can you maybe give him a call?

104
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:56,308
 He's gotten flack for reporting on Sungjin Group,

105
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:59,826
 but I'm sure he has his side of the story.

106
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:02,535
 He's been the object of anger.

107
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:05,511
And now this happened…

108
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:09,993
I think that he'd find some comfort

109
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:13,215
if you gave him a call.

110
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,319
Right. I agree.

111
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,257
I'll give him a call.

112
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:23,029
Of course.

113
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,496
You're the best.

114
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,894
Thanks, Joon Il.

115
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,120
I'll call you later!

116
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:38,345

117
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:04,367

118
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,244
Oh, hi.

119
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:21,955
- Did I keep you waiting? 
 - No, I just arrived.

120
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:23,987
But this place is a bit…

121
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:26,337
Oh, hello, Jae Hee.

122
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:27,541
How are you?

123
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,992
What are you doing here…

124
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,006
Oh, Yi Seol!

125
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,820
I didn't expect to see all of you

126
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,314
and wondered why he wanted to see me here.

127
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:40,203
- Let's take a seat. 
 - Oh, sure.

128
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:41,938
Let's go.

129
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,995
How have you been?

130
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:04,616
I was going to come to the exhibit.

131
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,725
I saw your coverage of the memorial ceremony.

132
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:17,020
That was some good reporting.

133
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:23,814
Well, I'm really nothing compare to you.

134
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:29,327
It's okay. We can talk.

135
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:33,410
I saw in an article that your father owns Myeongseong Industry

136
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,995
- and I was awfully disappointed in you. 
 - Yes.

137
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:36,059
Yes.

138
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,162
That's why we're all here to make it up to you.

139
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:42,799
Oh, so that's why…  What do I…

140
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,467
I'm sorry about this.

141
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,317
This is embarrassing.

142
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,817
You didn't have to do this.

143
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:56,319
By the way, Dong Min, how do you know Yi Seol?

144
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:59,029
They had a traffic accident.

145
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:05,529
Oh, I hope you were okay.

146
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,184
Fortunately, we were.

147
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:12,999
And I bought her a meal to make up for it, but we have two more to go.

148
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:15,342
Right?

149
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,350
Yes.

150
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:23,477
So is this one going to count towards that?

151
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:25,188
What?

152
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:28,205
Perhaps that was a tough question.

153
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:30,900
Oh, well, it's um…

154
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,650
They have great pasta here. The risottos are good, too.

155
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,816
Pasta and risotto?

156
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,153
Pasta and risotto…

157
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:44,505
I don't know much about either.

158
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:47,833
What should I get?

159
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:14,795
What are you getting?

160
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:18,605

161
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:27,828
Find the child first.

162
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:28,815
What?

163
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:30,868
How do we find a child that was adopted in secret?

164
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:34,237
There must be some records at the hospital where it was born.

165
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,617
A formal apology?

166
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,362
Right.

167
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:47,808
It's not that I want to put on a show

168
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:51,660
talking about how tortured I am and play the sympathy card with the press.

169
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:55,389
I really want to do something meaningful for the victims.

170
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:59,022
If that could happen, it'd be amazing.

171
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:03,184
But that's not going to be easy.

172
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:06,514
People might think I'm just doing it to gain popularity.

173
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:09,702
Can you think of a way?

174
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:12,188
There's no one else that knows as much as you do

175
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:14,519
about the Hyeongsan-dong tragedy.

176
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:20,373
We can't just hold a press conference out of nowhere.

177
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:23,527
Using SNS would make it seem insincere.

178
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:28,320
How about something like a talk concert? 
  (T/N: A musician-less event with panels giving speeches.)

179
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,138
An event like that will need a lot of preparation.

180
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:37,828
We can make a joint event with the exhibit, can't we?

181
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:41,503
Young people these days find art galleries hip.

182
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:48,107
What do you think? Will that be possible?

183
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:51,315
Let's hear from the art folk.

184
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,952
Is my idea good?

185
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:57,341
I like it.

186
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:59,428
What do you think Yi Seol?

187
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:13,920
Maybe she needs some time to think.

188
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,906
After all,

189
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,414
for something like this, there are a lot of things to consider

190
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,592
before making the decision.

191
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:26,296
Still, I hope you remember that this is for my husband's future.

192
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:28,088
Yi Seol.

193
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:38,184
Okay.

194
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:57,677
Ma'am.

195
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:01,656
Is something up?

196
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:06,230
Am I bothering you somehow?

197
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:09,684
I'm worried.

198
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,941
It's not about you.

199
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,225
So you say, but you're acting like you're angry at me.

200
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:18,019
Do you think it's unfair?

201
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,473
A bit.

202
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:23,167
Do you want an apology?

203
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,616
I'd like an explanation.

204
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,747
- How thorough. 
 - I just want to understand you.

205
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:35,808
That might just be difficult right now.

206
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:40,028
You can do it later, then.

207
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:48,871
Okay. I'll try my best.

208
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:03,905
By the way, how did you support yourself

209
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:07,218
after your grandmother passed?

210
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,142
College tuition, living expenses…

211
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,505
It mustn't have been easy.

212
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:20,014
Would you like to know?

213
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:28,397
Never mind.

214
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:32,028
I don't want to be nosy.

215
00:18:46,188 --> 00:18:47,718
Joon Hyeok?

216
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:52,529
So Yi Seol is not dating anyone, right?

217
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,627
So?

218
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:59,131
I mean… she's different from other women.

219
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:01,017
And she's pretty.

220
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:04,862
Could you ask Jae Hee to just find out whether she has a boyfriend?

221
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:06,950
Ask her yourself.

222
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:09,519
- Dong Min. 
 - Yes?

223
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,165
You have to pick the right woman to marry.

224
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:15,117
Your wife is not just another woman,

225
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:18,704
but the mother of your future children.

226
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,330
Another important thing is whether she'd be willing

227
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,091
to help you achieve your life goals

228
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:30,116
and stay by your side all the way.

229
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:35,220
I just thought… you marry the girl you love.

230
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,877
Well, there are different types of love.

231
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,489
But you won't understand, as young as you are.

232
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:45,113
You'll come to understand when you're a little older.

233
00:19:45,113 --> 00:19:49,275
- Oh my. Nice to meet you. 
 - Hi. You, too.

234
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,850

235
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,330

236
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,976
 You reported the death of No Young Joo?

237
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:09,780
 You can come and collect her belongings.

238
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,525
You should go home.

239
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:33,199
I will see you tomorrow, then.

240
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:36,727
Aren't you going home?

241
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:39,463
You can go first. I have to finish this.

242
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:41,522
I'll see you, then.

243
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,476
Come in.

244
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,346
So you were about to have dinner?

245
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:05,416
Why don't we go out instead?

246
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:08,799
You can sit here.

247
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,275
I'm sorry for sneaking up to you like this.

248
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,637
So you wanted an explanation.

249
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:43,391
This is it.

250
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:46,481
No, it's an excuse.

251
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,977
I don't know who sent me that photo,

252
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:56,415
but it changed my impression of you in the blink of an eye.

253
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:03,204
You must have been shocked.

254
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:08,572
I was furious to think that you'd fooled me.

255
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:19,050
I'm sorry.

256
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:24,349
But I'm also here to listen to your explanation.

257
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,700
After my father passed,

258
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:53,438
I got evicted from the house where I lived with my grandmother.

259
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:00,476
Then you needed money?

260
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:05,937
I needed money, too.

261
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:11,398
But what I needed most was help from someone with power.

262
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:16,385
I was in college.

263
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:18,711
I was a grownup.

264
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:24,019
So I thought I had to protect Grandmother,

265
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:31,279
but I couldn't do anything on my own.

266
00:26:35,486 --> 00:26:40,078
So did you get what you needed?

267
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:44,007
No.

268
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:51,693
Grandmother passed away.

269
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:56,019
I got evicted from my home.

270
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,823
And then,

271
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:08,189
I gave birth to a child.

272
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,054
And…

273
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:25,484
I gave up the child to be adopted, for money.

274
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:34,888
I found myself a place with that money

275
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:38,796
and paid my living expenses and tuition fees.

276
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:46,543
It's okay.

277
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:49,395
You don't have to say anything.

278
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:51,513
It's okay, Seol.

279
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:57,539
I'm sorry.

280
00:27:58,072 --> 00:28:00,435
I was wrong to ask you.

281
00:28:00,435 --> 00:28:02,819
I'm so sorry, Seol.

282
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,540
Excuse me for interrupting.

283
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:58,820
You can join us if you're hungry.

284
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:01,199
I'm okay.

285
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,085
I just have something to discuss with Pil Sung.

286
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:08,086
Enjoy your meal.

287
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:17,061
How did it go?

288
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,976
Have you found the child?

289
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:25,803
Well, the hospital has long since closed.

290
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:38,281
Oh, gosh.

291
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,344
Just forget about it.

292
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:44,041
You didn't even know about it until this morning.

293
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,557
And we don't even know for sure if the child is Joon Hyeok's.

294
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:48,987
We'll find the child and see.

295
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,141
Okay.

296
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:51,990
Suppose we found the child.

297
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,999
Let's imagine we found someone that worked at the hospital

298
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:58,300
and found the child at last.

299
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,471
And if that child is indeed Joon Hyeok's,

300
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:03,577
what next?

301
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:05,833
What are you going to do?

302
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,728
Isn't that obvious?

303
00:30:07,728 --> 00:30:09,976
I'll bring the child here.

304
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:11,649
What?

305
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,712
Daddy, can you call Mommy for me?

306
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:25,357
You do it. Daddy's busy reading.

307
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,836
Come on.

308
00:30:26,836 --> 00:30:30,003
I have to show this to Mom.

309
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:31,760
Come on.

310
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,225
We can just take a video and send it to her.

311
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:35,784
Go ahead.

312
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:41,972
Go on inside.

313
00:30:41,972 --> 00:30:44,520
It's a sketchy neighborhood, and there aren't that many people.

314
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,432
It can be dangerous.

315
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:04,986
Sometimes, I have a scary thought.

316
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:11,121
I fear the child would be bullied

317
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:15,302
for being a motherless child, all because of me.

318
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:29,695
I'm sure that will never be the case.

319
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:35,131
The child must be well and healthy,

320
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:39,717
loved by the foster family, and happy.

321
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,278
Do you think so?

322
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,518
I'm sure about this.

323
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,137
I know so.

324
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,952
Those people that are raising that child

325
00:31:56,578 --> 00:32:01,369
would always be thinking about you

326
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:03,630
and thanking you

327
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:07,711
for giving birth to their precious child.

328
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:27,214
Are you sure you don't want a ride home?

329
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:28,790
I'm used to this. I'll be fine.

330
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,973
Take care. I'll see you tomorrow.

331
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:33,649
- I'll text when I'm home. 
 - Sure.

332
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,467
Hello?

333
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,692
 Hey, this is Yong Seob.

334
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:55,725
What is this number?

335
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:57,630
I'm at a phone booth.

336
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,803
Just in case.

337
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:02,335
I might get tapped, you know.

338
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,930
- Have you found a place? 
 - Yes.

339
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:08,924
With the money you gave me.

340
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,593
That's good.

341
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:13,705
Damn it.

342
00:34:17,578 --> 00:34:19,139
Anyway.

343
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,160
Take care, okay?

344
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:25,710
- Are you going somewhere? 
  - I'm sorry.

345
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:28,908
 I'm just too scared to stay here anymore.

346
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,156
What's up?

347
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:37,623
They know that you had a child.

348
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:42,205
 They're trying to locate the child.

349
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:46,600
 But I'm not the one who told them about your child.

350
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,764
I know.

351
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,145
You know?

352
00:34:51,145 --> 00:34:54,376
Hey, Yi Seol. Did something bad happen?

353
00:34:55,801 --> 00:35:00,070
Somebody sent a picture of me from that day to Yoon Jae Hee.

354
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:03,787
Does she know everything, then?

355
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:06,165
Not yet.

356
00:35:06,165 --> 00:35:07,992
What are you going to do?

357
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:14,124
I'll find a way to protect myself and her.

358
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:17,197
 Why do you even care about that woman?

359
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:20,139
Good question.

360
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:22,800
But I can't help but be fond of her.

361
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,953
You could get into a lot of trouble.

362
00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:27,517
I…

363
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,595
Listen.

364
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,700
Do you remember that when Young Joo died,

365
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,048
 we couldn't even give her a funeral and people were busy taking her things?

366
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:41,013
 And do you know how shocked and scared I was?

367
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,722
Don't make me go through that again.

368
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:45,541
That's beyond cruel.

369
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:49,281
-  Do you understand?  
 - I'll keep that in mind.

370
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:53,816
I hope you do well wherever you go.

371
00:35:53,816 --> 00:35:55,712
 You don't have to worry about me.

372
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:59,437
I'm going to make sure that the house

373
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:03,324
my mother left me will get redeveloped.

374
00:36:03,324 --> 00:36:06,540
Well, if your house gets redeveloped

375
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,832
into an apartment, you'll be rich.

376
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,649
 So you take care of yourself.

377
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:13,641
 I'll call when everything's settled.

378
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:17,660
Okay. I'll see you again.

379
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:06,098
 It's a present for Mommy.

380
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:10,648
 No, no. Don't touch that. Wait.

381
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,138
 - You ready? 
 - Yes.

382
00:38:12,138 --> 00:38:15,333
 - You excited? 
 - Yes, I am.

383
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,849
 - Are you ready? 
 - Yep!

384
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:18,787
 - Here we go. 
 - Yes!

385
00:38:19,294 --> 00:38:22,659
 Three. Two. One

386
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:24,215
 Go!

387
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,832
 We did it!

388
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:43,000
Welcome home.

389
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,995
Is Hyeon Woo asleep?

390
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,919
He was waiting for you and fell asleep just now.

391
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,798
Have you had dinner?

392
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:52,247
I had cup noodles.

393
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,310
Aren't you too old for that stuff?

394
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,721
It was actually quite tasty.

395
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,886
Thank you.

396
00:39:30,594 --> 00:39:32,734
Don't worry.

397
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:36,115
He's healthy,

398
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:38,626
and his life's full of happiness.

399
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:11,724
 I'll cooperate on your talk concert.

400
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:25,517
You know, Yi Seol…

401
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:27,544
What?

402
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:31,029
will cooperate on the talk concert.

403
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:36,522
I thought she didn't like the idea.

404
00:40:36,522 --> 00:40:38,483
Why the sudden change of heart?

405
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:44,349
Well, I told her to remember that this is for you, my own husband.

406
00:40:50,877 --> 00:40:53,002
Go on and sleep. I need to go wash up.

407
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:54,826
Okay.

408
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,770

409
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:28,660
 I got home safely. Good night.

410
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,830
 Thank you for saying yes to the talk concert.

411
00:41:42,892 --> 00:41:45,047
 Have a good night's sleep.

412
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:57,833

413
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,905

414
00:41:59,905 --> 00:42:03,969

415
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,877

416
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:26,750
 When can I see you?

417
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,752

418
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:54,780
 I'll let you know.

419
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,230

420
00:44:26,488 --> 00:44:28,502
Would you like some coffee?

421
00:44:29,482 --> 00:44:31,626
Will you be so nice?

422
00:44:37,991 --> 00:44:39,939
By the way, Joo Yeon.

423
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:43,631
When are you free this week?

424
00:44:43,631 --> 00:44:45,196
What's up?

425
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:50,783
I was thinking about having dinner with Joon Hyeok's family.

426
00:44:52,506 --> 00:44:54,716
Do we have to?

427
00:44:54,716 --> 00:44:58,194
Eun Jung seems quite worried about him.

428
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:01,900
Is she too dumb to know what kind of people they are?

429
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,441
Why would she be worried about him?

430
00:45:03,441 --> 00:45:06,875
And why did she tell you about it?

431
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:09,840
You know Eun Jung is kind and soft-hearted.

432
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,794
Eun Jung, Mother, Father, Joon Hyeok!

433
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:15,221
Do you even think about me at all?

434
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,939
Do you care about anything other than that damn family of yours?

435
00:45:31,191 --> 00:45:33,512
And by the way,

436
00:45:33,512 --> 00:45:38,514
you do know why Joon Hyeok's running for president

437
00:45:38,514 --> 00:45:42,112
in the first place, don't you?

438
00:45:42,112 --> 00:45:45,614
"I don't know anything. I just do as I'm told."

439
00:45:45,614 --> 00:45:47,426
Sound familiar?

440
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:50,905
You're the Vice Chairman of the Sungjin Group.

441
00:45:50,905 --> 00:45:54,298
Stop being so naïve.

442
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,008
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

443
00:46:18,588 --> 00:46:21,321
I'm bribing you, Mr. Prosecutor.

444
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,090
I really am.

445
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,422
I told you I have a favor to ask.

446
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:30,830
But isn't this place too close to the gallery?

447
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,692
Well, I think this is how it should be between us,

448
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:37,417
just meeting up casually, without having to hide.

449
00:46:39,737 --> 00:46:42,182
It doesn't seem serious.

450
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:44,833
But you still have to keep it a secret.

451
00:46:45,495 --> 00:46:47,670
It's not about me.

452
00:47:02,397 --> 00:47:04,474

453
00:47:04,474 --> 00:47:06,460

454
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,400

455
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,370

456
00:47:17,682 --> 00:47:21,080
Do you think you can find who sent this?

457
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,585
I want the culprit punished for taking advantage of another person's weakness.

458
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:28,582
In cases like this,

459
00:47:28,582 --> 00:47:32,153
the IP address is usually from abroad.

460
00:47:32,153 --> 00:47:34,046
So it'll be difficult?

461
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:39,969
Isn't this one of your staff at the gallery?

462
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:42,230
Don't be so judgmental.

463
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:46,830
Well, I was…

464
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,994
I was like that, too.

465
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:52,709
I had a million excuses for the things I did wrong,

466
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:54,386
but when it came to others,

467
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:57,199
I was always vindictive and suspicious.

468
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,207
That's the way I've always been.

469
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:02,787
I think, instead of tracking the email,

470
00:48:02,787 --> 00:48:07,328
it might be faster to find and investigate people that are involved with her.

471
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:11,624
The culprit already knew about her past.

472
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:14,601
She's had a tough life.

473
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:17,107
I don't want her to be hurt anymore.

474
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:20,800
I need your help so that I can help her.

475
00:48:21,585 --> 00:48:23,057
Okay.

476
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:26,947
Send me a copy of her resume.

477
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,412
Okay.

478
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:35,733
 Do you want to meet up today?

479
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:41,416
 Sure.

480
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:43,801
 It'll take some time to discuss things.

481
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,510
 I think so.

482
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:47,405
 Where do you want to meet?

483
00:48:47,405 --> 00:48:49,488
 Come to the gallery.

484
00:48:51,717 --> 00:48:54,027
 But my wife is there.

485
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:56,999
 I'm okay with that.

486
00:49:04,595 --> 00:49:05,902
Wow.

487
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:09,913
A fancy barber shop indeed worthy of the Prince.

488
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,132
What are you here to discuss?

489
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:19,219
This place would be long gone if not for its confidentiality.

490
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:24,835
About the investigation on the minister…

491
00:49:25,513 --> 00:49:27,878
I'll do it. I will.

492
00:49:27,878 --> 00:49:29,723
I'll do it, but...

493
00:49:29,723 --> 00:49:31,214
But?

494
00:49:31,795 --> 00:49:36,364
You know, we're doing this for your success,

495
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:39,690
and that will benefit me.

496
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:43,385
And it will be a win-win for the both of us.

497
00:49:43,385 --> 00:49:46,802
But I'm not really sure if it will.

498
00:49:46,802 --> 00:49:48,419
Well, I–

499
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,033
The reason?

500
00:49:52,379 --> 00:49:54,911
Your brother, Jung Joon Il.

501
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:59,136
Even if I were to pave the way to your presidency,

502
00:49:59,136 --> 00:50:03,117
would it really be for you or for your brother?

503
00:50:03,117 --> 00:50:05,911
I'm just not sure who wins in the end.

504
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:11,312
What do you want, then,

505
00:50:11,312 --> 00:50:14,405
supposing that it really is for me?

506
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:21,111
Are you sure you won't be bested by your brother?

507
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,595
I just can't help but have doubts.

508
00:50:25,595 --> 00:50:30,307
After all, you don't share the same blood with Seo Han Sook.

509
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:50,823
It does not make sense that out of the 10.5 billion won in expenses,

510
00:50:50,823 --> 00:50:54,341
only 30 million won was accounted for.

511
00:50:54,341 --> 00:50:57,683
The business was funded with the revenue from assets already endowed to her,

512
00:50:57,683 --> 00:51:00,394
so that was unnecessary.

513
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:02,715
It will be another problem that she's obtained shares through tax deductions

514
00:51:02,715 --> 00:51:07,117
without filing a report with her voting record.

515
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:11,774
I hope you don't lose your calm over this.

516
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:14,375
I'm only telling you about these

517
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:17,499
because they have to be dealt with before the presidential election begins.

518
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:21,722
Okay, I see.

519
00:51:24,894 --> 00:51:27,816
When we're done with the talk concert,

520
00:51:27,816 --> 00:51:30,674
Joon Hyeok will be a notable candidate,

521
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:33,834
and his rating will see an increase.

522
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,701
I'll make sure that Joon Hyeok

523
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:40,600
is worthy of the generosity you've shown him.

524
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:15,985

525
00:52:24,682 --> 00:52:25,844
Ma'am.

526
00:52:25,844 --> 00:52:29,567
Your husband has requested a meeting regarding the talk concert.

527
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,381
So I told him to come to the gallery.

528
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,375
Tell him to come directly to the performance hall.

529
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,727
I've been to only a couple of talk concerts,

530
00:52:35,727 --> 00:52:37,750
so I don't have a clear idea.

531
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:42,042
I'll have to see you two on stage and draw up a list of artworks.

532
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:43,928
Understood.

533
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:47,123
Here's the key card.

534
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:49,619
- Leave the door unlocked. 
 - Sure.

535
00:53:35,601 --> 00:53:38,678
 If you could call it guilt love,

536
00:53:38,678 --> 00:53:42,190
 I love him very much.

537
00:53:42,696 --> 00:53:45,419
 What I mean is I could never

538
00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:49,411
 leave him unless he leaves me.

539
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:56,137
 So, please stay by my side.

540
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:52,873
 Come to the performance hall.

541
00:55:57,583 --> 00:56:00,495
They're doing the talk concert here?

542
00:56:00,495 --> 00:56:02,160
Yes.

543
00:56:03,325 --> 00:56:06,601
Well, he's good for at least something.

544
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:10,822
Where did he get that talent to earn people's favor?

545
00:56:12,071 --> 00:56:13,486
Did he get it from his mother,

546
00:56:13,486 --> 00:56:16,697
who seduced a married man and had a child?

547
00:56:17,636 --> 00:56:21,066
Whatever it is, I'll gain something from it.

548
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,647

549
00:56:44,647 --> 00:56:46,040

550
00:58:21,496 --> 00:58:23,993
Ms. Yoon will be here soon.

551
00:58:31,097 --> 00:58:36,441
Right now, it's just the two of us.

552
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:44,608
Why are you doing this to me?

553
00:58:51,926 --> 00:58:56,420
Do you know what it's like to deal with so much hate and expectations at the same time?

554
00:59:00,794 --> 00:59:02,910
You're married.

555
00:59:08,493 --> 00:59:10,557
I've never…

556
00:59:12,228 --> 00:59:15,006
lived my own life before.

557
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:20,597
I've always had to do as others wanted.

558
00:59:23,698 --> 00:59:26,244
We're not supposed to do this.

559
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:49,299
With you,

560
00:59:51,191 --> 00:59:54,508
I can truly be myself

561
00:59:56,285 --> 00:59:58,972
in just a small aspect of my life.

562
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:24,489
I think Mr. Jung is here.

563
01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:26,051
I saw him going to the performance hall.

564
01:00:26,051 --> 01:00:28,444
Yes, it's for the talk concert.

565
01:00:28,444 --> 01:00:30,640
I'm also on my way there.

566
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:03,576

567
01:01:05,614 --> 01:01:07,570

568
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,951

569
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:28,213

570
01:02:28,605 --> 01:02:30,621
You…

571
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,201
have a wife.

572
01:02:54,984 --> 01:02:59,789
I know perfectly that Yoon Jae Hee is a great mother

573
01:03:01,192 --> 01:03:04,633
and a remarkable woman, indeed.

574
01:03:19,973 --> 01:03:22,590
But she doesn't make my heart race.

575
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:28,313
Then

576
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,310
can you divorce her?

577
01:03:46,513 --> 01:03:48,533
Is that what you want?

578
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:52,521
Answer me.

579
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:58,602
Can you… divorce your wife?

580
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:53,197

581
01:04:54,690 --> 01:05:03,150

582
01:05:12,696 --> 01:05:15,647
 Did he make you uncomfortable?

583
01:05:15,647 --> 01:05:19,623
 Even though I know that would never happen.

584
01:05:19,623 --> 01:05:22,407
 If I wanted to seduce your husband...

585
01:05:22,407 --> 01:05:24,290
 What do you suggest we do?

586
01:05:25,873 --> 01:05:29,773
 Please help me so that I can take care of it myself.

587
01:05:29,773 --> 01:05:34,302
 Jae Hee is not involved in the death of No Young Joo.

588
01:05:34,302 --> 01:05:36,328
 Cheers.

589
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:39,789
 Do you think she won't have any problems?

590
01:05:39,789 --> 01:05:40,998
 A leopard cannot change its spots.

591
01:05:40,998 --> 01:05:44,380
 Are you being jealous?

592
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:47,158
 A man doesn't change in a day.

593
01:05:47,998 --> 01:05:50,100
 What should I do then?
