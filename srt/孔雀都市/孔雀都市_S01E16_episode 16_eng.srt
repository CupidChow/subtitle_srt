1
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:04,642
 Just leave.

2
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:08,008
 I'll have no more problems with you gone.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,999
 I don't want to.

4
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:12,502
 I can't just leave like this.

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:15,994
 Please.

6
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:18,959
 Help me out this once.

7
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,490
 I told you, no.

8
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:24,627
 Are you trying to ruin me?

9
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:27,807
 Do you think there is anything else to ruin?

10
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:32,712
 Do you know how pathetic you are?

11
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:34,747
 You live alongside people who disrespect you,

12
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:39,342
 trying your best to please them and to get something out of them!

13
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:42,512
 Like you're crazy.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,018
 Yes, I am crazy!

15
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,711
 How else can I go on?

16
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:54,392
 Nothing gets better no matter how hard I try.

17
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:56,895
 I try to bear it.

18
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:59,677
 So until when do I have to live like this?

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,650

20
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:18,482
 Yi Seol.

21
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:23,853
 Please go away. I beg of you.

22
00:01:26,558 --> 00:01:28,299
 I can't.

23
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:32,191
 There's no way that's happening.

24
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:38,386
 - I beg of you! 
 - Wait until I've make a decision about

25
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,172
 what to do with you.

26
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:38,028

27
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:51,546

28
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,010

29
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:27,701

30
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:36,170
You're here.

31
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,808
What is it?

32
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:44,153
Why is Yi Seol back here?

33
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:47,484
Didn't she quit her job at the gallery?

34
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,616
When I was in school,

35
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,788
preparing for my final piece,

36
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:02,465
you have no idea how many cup noodles and instant coffee I had.

37
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,713
I was pretending to be busy, not even meeting friends,

38
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:13,438
when I was actually trying to hide the fact that I was broke.

39
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:16,849
My father had stood surety for his brother,

40
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:20,063
and that really gave us a hard time financially.

41
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:22,883
Why are you telling me this?

42
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:25,137
And what did Yi Seol say to you?

43
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:37,013
She must want something out of this.

44
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:41,708
She knows all too well what it's like

45
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,382
to live in poverty.

46
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:58,130
After all, she did give birth to your child,

47
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,296
and she might actually want to take my place beside you

48
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:03,127
for that, don't you think?

49
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:11,681
I told Jung Ho to tell you.

50
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:16,414
I wanted to make you suffer and test you.

51
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:22,582
Whatever Yi Seol does,

52
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:24,987
I'm standing my ground.

53
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:30,647
And I expect you to do the same.

54
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,624
Why suddenly do you need this money?

55
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:06,035
To get rid of Yi Seol.

56
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,506
I'll make sure it happens.

57
00:06:10,502 --> 00:06:14,858
But I don't think you'll need my help at all just for that amount.

58
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,582
I need a cashier's check from the foundation's corporate account.

59
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,627
It's just to avoid any kind of trouble.

60
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:26,511
That's why I'm asking you.

61
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,561
Prepare the check.

62
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:34,645
And keep a record of the serial number.

63
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,735
Well then, I'll get going.

64
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,573
Wait.

65
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:50,636
I think it'd be better

66
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:54,102
if the necklace stayed with me for a while.

67
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,681
I'll give it back to you

68
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:00,394
when things are taken care of.

69
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:09,898

70
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:36,598
Snap out of it.

71
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:38,593
What?

72
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:41,783
You have to forget about that child.

73
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:46,035
- Really! 
 - I can't let him stay there.

74
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:49,385
Then what? Are you going to raise him yourself?

75
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:56,487
- Just take this. 
 - What is it?

76
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,480

77
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:01,804
If anything happens to me, send this to that reporter.

78
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:03,942
What is this? You're making me anxious.

79
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,322
Don't worry.

80
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:08,452
I'm just preparing for the worst.

81
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:12,128
Don't do anything stupid, all right?

82
00:08:14,124 --> 00:08:15,657
See you.

83
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:21,295
Hey! Where are you going? Let's eat first.

84
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:23,026
Hey!

85
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,817
Why did you want to see me?

86
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:56,937
I told you to wait until I've made my decision.

87
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,905
If you are to leave like I asked, I thought I should at least

88
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:15,910
help you find a new place for yourself.

89
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:20,026
They'll start taking down houses in your neighborhood some time soon,

90
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,998
including yours.

91
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:26,996
You were born and raised in the area, right?

92
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,266
You must be sad

93
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:33,945
that all those places will be gone after this.

94
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,323
Once again, they'll drive people like you out of their homes

95
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:41,216
to build fancy apartments for the rich.

96
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:48,063
Find a place and bring me the papers.

97
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:51,262
And I'll give you the rest of the money.

98
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,263
I would actually need

99
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:02,850
some money if I were to bring Hyeon Woo to live with me.

100
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:07,594
I didn't know there would be an easy way like this.

101
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:11,614
I appreciate your help.

102
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,548
That's better.

103
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:56,240
I drank too much yesterday.

104
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:01,083
Was Yoo Jin Seok there until the end?

105
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,106
He knows how to party, really.

106
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:08,539
It turned out that the rumor is true, after all.

107
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:13,110
The way he handled those two girls was…

108
00:11:14,203 --> 00:11:16,929
You're making Jung Ho uncomfortable.

109
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,169
Am I?

110
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,146
You're not.

111
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:24,586
Right?

112
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:30,359
Anyway, he definitely is something.

113
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,901
How are things between him and Min Seong Sik?

114
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:39,435
That was just funny to watch.

115
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,752
Yoo doesn't seem to care at all,

116
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:44,406
but him joining must have lit a fire under Min's ass.

117
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:48,910
And he started doing things he never would normally.

118
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,830
It was quite a sight. I've never seen him like that.

119
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:02,500
But anyway, you'd better be careful.

120
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,990
You don't know what he might be thinking, especially now that we have Yoo with us.

121
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,683
Not to mention he has higher ratings than you,

122
00:12:08,683 --> 00:12:10,967
although only by little.

123
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,881
He also has the party's full support.

124
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:17,574
Even though you have Chairwoman Seo's support,

125
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:20,919
should he decide to go against you,

126
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,593
that might cause a huge problem for everyone.

127
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:30,786
And remember that he already has history of plotting behind your back.

128
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:35,724
That's exactly why I need your help.

129
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:42,295
Or I think Jung Ho might be able to help this time.

130
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:56,763
Even if we acquire enough funds to buy the Sungjin Electronics shares

131
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:58,608
owned by Sungjin Life,

132
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:01,997
the law forbids that the owner of the holding company

133
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:07,100
own so much of the shares for the subsidiaries.

134
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,965
Also, the holding company has to own at least 20% of its subsidiaries,

135
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:17,788
which means Sungjin Trade might have to purchase more Sungjin Electronics shares.

136
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:24,096
If we were to temporarily increase our debt,

137
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:29,634
I think we'd be able to bypass the law when we purchase those shares.

138
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:35,513
But if the holding company law ends up being an obstacle,

139
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:42,040
we would first need more Sungjin Life shares under Joon Il's name.

140
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:50,106
How much of Sungjin Life shares does the foundation own at the moment?

141
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:52,811
4.5%.

142
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:01,516
It's time to have Joo Yeon run this foundation.

143
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:07,597
We would need the approval from the Board of Directors.

144
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,031
If Joon Hyeok should vote against it,

145
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:13,965
Joon Il and Eun Jung would agree

146
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:17,298
and take his side, as they always have.

147
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:17,800
It's a surprise you wanted to see me alone. What is it?

148
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:27,096
You can just start talking.

149
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:30,560
I'd prefer to have her company as I listen to any of your nonsense.

150
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,536
Why do you have to be so harsh all the time?

151
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:39,670
That's because you're never so nice to me, either.

152
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:47,223
Well, you're never nice even to Joon Il.

153
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:49,799
Perhaps I'm asking for too much from you.

154
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:57,884
I've been sitting back watching as you women of the family take care of things,

155
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:00,416
but it's time for me to get involved.

156
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,341
You're busy stirring up needless trouble

157
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:09,938
when we have more important matters at hand.

158
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:12,228
You've got to make it clearer.

159
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:17,140
What do you mean by "needless trouble" and by "important matters?"

160
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:22,244
It's been decided that I'll run for president,

161
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:24,491
and that's everything we should be focused on.

162
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:27,588
Everything else is needless trouble and a waste of time.

163
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:33,400
For example, the friction between you and Jae Hee.

164
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:38,997
Someone told me I had a child out of wedlock.

165
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:41,140
Was it Jae Hee?

166
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,308
Did she say you "had" one?

167
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:45,770
Why did you have to trigger her with that?

168
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:51,010
I didn't think she'd be triggered by something so small.

169
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:57,825
Then, are you saying she was simply feigning an emotional reaction?

170
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:04,516
Let me just say you never know what she's really thinking.

171
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:14,470
If you're not at fault for anything, I'd like you to prove yourself.

172
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:20,968
I need to see for myself that you're fully committed to my election.

173
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:28,580
What would you have me do?

174
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:34,214
Before I join the Liberty Reformation Party,

175
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:38,227
get rid of the people that might oppose me during the primary election.

176
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:45,620
Do you mean the ones supporting Min Seong Sik?

177
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:50,438
Do you think Cho Kang Hyeon will help you in this?

178
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,010
I'm not sure.

179
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:56,140
Don't worry.

180
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,180
I have someone who can help.

181
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,580
Really?

182
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,720
In that case, you have my support.

183
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:10,965
But I have one condition.

184
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,360

185
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:44,214
An interview with the victim's family?

186
00:18:44,214 --> 00:18:46,239
Why all of a sudden?

187
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,200
Send me a list of the families.

188
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,400
And their profile.

189
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:56,160
Okay.

190
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,516

191
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:03,616
Yes. I'm looking at it right now.

192
00:19:03,616 --> 00:19:05,483
Wait.

193
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:06,336
Na Soon Ok?

194
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:08,059

195
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,707
She didn't have any family?

196
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:19,007
Okay, I got it.

197
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,761
Okay.

198
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,696
So, you mean

199
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:28,497
you're planning to organize an event to find her?

200
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:30,965
Okay.

201
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:35,920
Are you sure there's anything noteworthy?

202
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:19,620
Why an interview with the victims' family?

203
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:23,823
Was it Dong Min's idea?

204
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,958
I'll take care of it.

205
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,660
Why does he want you involved?

206
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,340
Just stop, Jae Hee.

207
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,223
Honey.

208
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:50,164
I'll drive Hyeon Woo to kindergarten.

209
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:52,224
Just letting you know.

210
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:19,712
Hello.

211
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,835
I'm sorry. I got caught up with work.

212
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,849
Do you know Ms. Kim Myung Hwan, one of the victims' family?

213
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,290
I met with her for an interview

214
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,390
and came up with an idea.

215
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,704
"Those Who Were Left: Seven Years After the Incident"

216
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:39,155
There will be news coverage under that title.

217
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:43,332
Next, Joon Hyeok will mention this and then

218
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:46,140
find the family of Na Soon Ok.

219
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:51,096
I took the inspiration from how Yi Seol found that painting.

220
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,734
It's not been long since the commemoration event,

221
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:59,820
and I think this might seem a bit early and out of the blue.

222
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:04,399
I don't think those things should matter.

223
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,671
We're doing this for the victims.

224
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:09,351
And it will help Joon Hyeok greatly.

225
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:12,311
He has to live up to the people's expectations.

226
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,464
A lot of people believe in him.

227
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:19,357
They believe he'll bring change so that such brutalities won't happen again.

228
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,939
- Is the chairwoman in? 
 - Yes.

229
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,481
But right now, she's–

230
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:48,693

231
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:57,567
It looks like you haven't heard the news.

232
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,837
What happened?

233
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,450
It was approved by the Board of Directors including Joon Hyeok,

234
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,801
so don't get the wrong idea.

235
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:13,389
So did you really not know?

236
00:23:15,642 --> 00:23:17,792
Sit. Let's have some tea.

237
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,197
I'll talk to Mother about this.

238
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:25,535
She's busy discussing the plan of action with Joon Hyeok.

239
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:28,766
Didn't Secretary Go give you her schedule?

240
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:35,401
How did you end up like this anyway?

241
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,723
You may not go in.

242
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,260
Wait.

243
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,349
I have important matters to discuss with her.

244
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:53,249
- You will have to wait. 
 - Secretary Go.

245
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,583
That is not something I will let happen.

246
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:04,224
You must care a lot for these people.

247
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:07,700
I'm not speaking on my personal behalf in this.

248
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,948
Then could you explain

249
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,312
why you want to keep these people

250
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:15,005
when they clearly have problems.

251
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:17,166
The presidential election is coming soon.

252
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,902
If we have five members under investigation,

253
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:23,097
how do you think the public will react?

254
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:26,891
You're afraid of the public's disappointment,

255
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:29,409
so you'll cover up their crimes.

256
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:32,304
Look, Professor Yoo.

257
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,504
Let's stop it there.

258
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:37,057
I see why Congressman Min's concerned.

259
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:42,120
But we cannot have these men with us as we go through the election.

260
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:49,795
We'll have to get rid of these people

261
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:53,705
and have Professor Yoo lead the Emergency Committee.

262
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:55,814
He will take care of the party affairs.

263
00:24:55,814 --> 00:25:02,398
And I'm sorry to say this, but you might have to step down as party leader.

264
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:06,389
I think that'll be the best way to calm the public sentiment.

265
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:16,420
It will be the perfect occasion before the party conference.

266
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,403
We'll have everyone's attention over who will be the next party leader.

267
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:29,959
Now, I think we can discuss the plans for the primary election, then?

268
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,600
Sure.

269
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:34,576
Today is…

270
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:50,798
You'll just have to bear with it and everything will be fine.

271
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,424
Did you know about this?

272
00:26:04,304 --> 00:26:06,530
Come to think of it,

273
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,014
you've been extra nice to me these days.

274
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:14,155
I see you already know he's your own grandson.

275
00:26:15,361 --> 00:26:18,773
It's your fault for going behind our back.

276
00:26:37,451 --> 00:26:41,826
I didn't know you were here, Mrs. Yoon.

277
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:45,240
You should have joined us.

278
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:49,017
Are you here to see Mother?

279
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:50,878
Yes.

280
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:53,228
I have something to discuss with her.

281
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:55,992
Then go ahead.

282
00:26:55,992 --> 00:26:58,848
I still have more to discuss with Professor Yoo.

283
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:01,381
I'll see you at home.

284
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:04,103
I'll see you around, Mrs. Yoon.

285
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,140
- Let's go inside. 
 - Yes. Let's go inside.

286
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,670
Okay.

287
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:35,610
Joon Hyeok said he'd take care of it.

288
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,401
You can just let him.

289
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:41,200
This will hold us back for sure.

290
00:27:42,654 --> 00:27:46,199
Should any problems arise during the redevelopment,

291
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:49,485
Joon Hyeok will be held responsible.

292
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:55,010
But he simply wouldn't listen to me.

293
00:27:56,706 --> 00:28:00,360
If you can stop Han Dong Min's report,

294
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,009
I'll persuade Joon Hyeok about this.

295
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,196
Right.

296
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:11,578
You can take care of this.

297
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:14,547
You can do this on your own.

298
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:15,986
Just make sure that

299
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:20,873
Han Dong Min's on our side so that he won't

300
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:24,219
do anything to harm Joon Hyeok.

301
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:33,436
When we've taken care of Kim Yi Seol and Han Dong Min,

302
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:40,111
we'll see ourselves in a much better situation.

303
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:53,800
It's close to the subway station, and it's perfect for newlyweds.

304
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:57,432
You can book it at anytime, so just give me a call.

305
00:28:57,432 --> 00:29:00,793
You can also bring your fiancée to take a look.

306
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:03,341
Is there an elementary school nearby?

307
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,291
I have a child that'll be starting school next year.

308
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:31,905
It was my bad for talking to Jung Ho.

309
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:35,900
I know I reacted rather emotionally.

310
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:55,444
How can you be jealous of someone like Yi Seol?

311
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:59,530
- I'm not jealous– 
 - She's not at the same level as you.

312
00:31:09,644 --> 00:31:12,960
Do you know how disappointed I was in you?

313
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,086
I didn't ask for much.

314
00:31:15,703 --> 00:31:18,578
Just behaving yourself as my wife

315
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:23,091
and helping me achieve my goals. That's all I ask.

316
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,354
We're in this together.

317
00:31:25,354 --> 00:31:29,455
I've always thought whatever helps you will also be helpful for me.

318
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:31,860
Well you say that!

319
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,985
But look at the mess you've made.

320
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:57,370
I beg of you, Jae Hee.

321
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:03,026
Behave with some class, okay?

322
00:32:10,185 --> 00:32:12,607
Let me ask you one thing.

323
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:22,080
I understand what a woman like Yi Seol means to you.

324
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:27,403
But then… What about me?

325
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:33,760
What do I mean to you?

326
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:47,947
It's up to you, Jae Hee,

327
00:32:47,947 --> 00:32:50,797
to prove how much you mean and are worth.

328
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:28,426
Talk to Joon Hyeok and make sure

329
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:32,842
your father has a meeting with Yoo Jin Seok.

330
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:36,487
- I will. 
 - That won't be necessary.

331
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:40,929
He'll play a central role in Joon Hyeok's election.

332
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:46,055
And he has all the connections we need for the redevelopment project.

333
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:48,705
That's exactly why I won't see him.

334
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:54,711
You'll have to find another company for the demolition this time. I'm out.

335
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:56,230
Why are you doing this?

336
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:01,440
I just want to avoid being a liability for my own son.

337
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:07,010
What will happen to us without your help, Father?

338
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,420
As you know, Joon Il's not experienced in matters like this,

339
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,654
and it's not something Mother or I can help with.

340
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:19,805
You're the only one we can depend on.

341
00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:25,068
It's rather harsh of you to tell us to find some other company.

342
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:31,282
I understand your concerns for Joon Hyeok, but...

343
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:37,208
Joon Il is also your son, and he needs your guidance and help.

344
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:41,420
He still has a lot to learn.

345
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:56,987
Why are you doing this?

346
00:34:58,204 --> 00:35:00,095
What?

347
00:35:00,095 --> 00:35:02,448
What you said to Father.

348
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:05,293
You never say such things to him.

349
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:10,404
Someone had to tell him that.

350
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:17,196
You should know perfectly well that there has to be someone

351
00:35:17,196 --> 00:35:20,026
to clean up after the mess

352
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:22,504
that this family leaves in its wake,

353
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:25,699
and we can't get our own hands dirty.

354
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:27,432
Don't you agree?

355
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,586

356
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:50,475
 I've sent you the text for Han Dong Min's report.

357
00:36:57,196 --> 00:37:01,202

358
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:19,394
Hello, Director?

359
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:24,185
I just received a copy of a report from my mother-in-law,

360
00:37:24,185 --> 00:37:26,510
and you should take a look at it, too.

361
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,851
Tomorrow evening. It will be around 9:35.

362
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,894
I don't think I'll be getting another award for this.

363
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:37,360
Don't drink too much, Dad.

364
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,970
I'll come down to see you next month. Bye!

365
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,776
Okay. Thank you in advance, Director.

366
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:53,279
Of course.

367
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:57,288
Just tell me whenever. I'll get you an appointment.

368
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:01,574
Okay. Thank you.

369
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,500

370
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:26,561
You promised you'd give me the rest of the money when I have the paperwork.

371
00:38:28,061 --> 00:38:31,780
Okay. I'll keep my promise.

372
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,081
Are you free today?

373
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,393
Hyeon Woo likes camping, but we've been too busy these days.

374
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:06,580
Do you like camping?

375
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:10,288
I've never done it.

376
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,740

377
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:34,909
Hyeon Woo!

378
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,929
Mommy!

379
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:39,785
Hey! Yi Seol!

380
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:42,895
Don't run.

381
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:05,497
- We can do this ourselves. 
 - Okay.

382
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,513
- Mommy. 
 - Yeah?

383
00:40:13,597 --> 00:40:16,176
Can I go play with the bunnies?

384
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:17,501
Sure.

385
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,450
Awesome!

386
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,386
I'll bring them carrots and lettuce.

387
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,186
- Please keep an eye on him. 
 - Yes.

388
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:31,308
Come with me, Yi Seol.

389
00:40:31,308 --> 00:40:32,841
Well…

390
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:35,466
That's…

391
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:38,630
Hyeon Woo.

392
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,340
You can go first with the maid. We will join you soon.

393
00:40:41,344 --> 00:40:43,607
Okay.

394
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,657
Make it quick, okay?

395
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,970
Let's go.

396
00:41:04,249 --> 00:41:06,599
Hyeon Woo's so adorable, isn't he?

397
00:41:13,956 --> 00:41:16,006
Do you want to bring him with you tonight?

398
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:21,393
That's what you wanted. This is your chance.

399
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:23,109
Are you serious?

400
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:26,090
How do I explain it to Hyeon Woo?

401
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,450
Ah!

402
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:33,090
We'll first tell him that you're his real mother.

403
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,380
Then we'll tell him…

404
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,384
about the relationship

405
00:41:38,384 --> 00:41:41,700
between you and Joon Hyeok.

406
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,104
What do we tell him next?

407
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:51,668
Well, he'll be shocked to hear his own mother gave him away for money.

408
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:53,501
Right?

409
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:57,664
I'll let you decide.

410
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:01,183
Whether to bring him with you

411
00:42:01,183 --> 00:42:03,776
or just leave.

412
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,190
Mommy, where's Yi Seol?

413
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:06,335
I asked you, where's Yi Seol?

414
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,170
It's quite awesome.

415
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,795
I wonder how does it feel to work in such a place.

416
00:44:11,795 --> 00:44:15,043
If only my dad had put me through college.

417
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:19,317
Oh! We have the same one at my place.

418
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:24,336
It looks even better hanging here. Oh my god!

419
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:30,873
I'm sure the people that lived there got tons of money for reimbursement

420
00:44:30,873 --> 00:44:34,169
and they're well off now, don't you think?

421
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:37,989
As they say, every cloud has a silver lining. Right?

422
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:41,692
 Those people were chased out of their homes.

423
00:44:42,254 --> 00:44:47,397
 I wonder where they are and what they're doing.

424
00:44:48,498 --> 00:44:53,730
 Even though they might not even be alive.

425
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:03,319
Just cut to the chase. You must be here for a reason.

426
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:05,678
Oh, I just…

427
00:45:05,678 --> 00:45:09,674
I just wanted to have lunch with you

428
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:12,628
and do a bit of catching up, as well.

429
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:18,550
Perhaps you could help me figure out a way to make my marriage official.

430
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,640
I just wanted to talk about a few things.

431
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,291
But you already know what your husband is like. Is it really necessary?

432
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,959
I thought you'd be able to empathize.

433
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:35,374
You're also having a tough time, putting up with a man like your husband.

434
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:40,810
Exactly.

435
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,306
- Go wait in the lobby. I'll be there. 
 - Okay. No need to rush, though.

436
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,690

437
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,082
 Han Dong Min's report has been taken care of.

438
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:14,438
Oh, who did I run into?

439
00:46:15,491 --> 00:46:17,781
Miss Oh, right?

440
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:22,632
Don't you remember me? It's me, Yoo Jin Seok.

441
00:46:22,632 --> 00:46:25,850
It's been a long time.

442
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:31,082
Well, I think… I think you have the wrong person.

443
00:46:32,314 --> 00:46:35,733
- Don't pretend you don't know me. 
 - Oh, dear!

444
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:37,464
Stop that!

445
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:45,747
So, I see you've settled in at Cho Kang Hyeon's side, huh?

446
00:46:45,747 --> 00:46:50,252
- I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 - Honey.

447
00:46:55,027 --> 00:46:58,094
Good afternoon, Mrs. Yoon.

448
00:46:58,094 --> 00:47:00,546
What's the occasion?

449
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:05,451
Professor Yoo offered to treat us to lunch as an apology.

450
00:47:06,622 --> 00:47:10,969
Mrs. Yoon's generous character is already well-known,

451
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:14,617
but I am indeed surprised.

452
00:47:14,617 --> 00:47:16,299
Thank you.

453
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,151
I heard there was an accusation of forgery.

454
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:24,117
He told me you took a blind eye on that.

455
00:47:26,631 --> 00:47:27,684
It's all good now.

456
00:47:27,684 --> 00:47:30,375
Why don't we put the past behind us?

457
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:37,934
Let me treat you to a nice lunch today.

458
00:47:41,478 --> 00:47:46,119
 Eighteenth floor. The door is opening.

459
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,739
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

460
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:54,767
- What's with the rush? 
 - You don't know? We need to fill in for your report.

461
00:47:54,767 --> 00:47:56,100
What?

462
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:03,150

463
00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:20,047
Director.

464
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:27,306
You'll have to talk to Mrs. Yoon.

465
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:33,699
Yoon Jae Hee of the Sungjin Group.

466
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:36,750
That's the message she left for you.

467
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:43,306
- Let's have a drink. 
 - Sure.

468
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:51,583
'General Boneless' seethes with anger 
  (T/N: A poem about a gallant hero.)

469
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:55,051
and with three thousand men makes his way into the Half-Moon Fortress.

470
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:59,207
They shed blood as they advance and retreat.

471
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:02,214
And how magnanimous are the man and his army?

472
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:05,214
In the end, the entire fortress was red with stains of blood.

473
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:25,930

474
00:49:35,507 --> 00:49:37,272
Hi, Dong Min.

475
00:49:45,642 --> 00:49:47,275
Here.

476
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:54,559
I need an explanation.

477
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:00,103
Is it true that… you stopped my report from going through?

478
00:50:00,103 --> 00:50:04,556
- Well, sometimes you get in my way. 
 - Jae Hee!

479
00:50:04,556 --> 00:50:08,428
- I'm being as polite as I can. 
 - Exactly.

480
00:50:08,428 --> 00:50:13,280
You just had your report cut out, and you still care more about manners?

481
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:17,397
The Yoon Jae Hee I know wouldn't have done this.

482
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:21,029
Think about what happened, not the person who did it.

483
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:23,447
You never thought I would?

484
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:26,889
You're a fool for saying such a thing

485
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:30,015
at a situation like this.

486
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:35,645
I used my power to stop your report from going through.

487
00:50:35,645 --> 00:50:38,510
What more do I have to explain?

488
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,417
That's why!

489
00:50:42,013 --> 00:50:44,497
That's why I'm asking why you would do…

490
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:51,002
Why you always try to make sense out of everything?

491
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:04,262
Take a look.

492
00:51:29,457 --> 00:51:31,279
That's Yi Seol.

493
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,300
How do you feel?

494
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:37,242
Can you make sense out of that?

495
00:51:42,091 --> 00:51:47,570
Yi Seol gave birth to Joon Hyeok's child, and I'm raising him.

496
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,102
Stop lying.

497
00:51:53,493 --> 00:51:58,850
I'm helping you to see the truth, but now you deny what you see.

498
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:04,592
Dong Min. Why are you denying the truth when you see it?

499
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:13,179
I know you want to use Joon Hyeok to your advantage, so stop the pretense.

500
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:18,303
Or this could be a chance to prove what you stand for.

501
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:25,492
To prove just how righteous and resolute you are.

502
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:28,700
You can expose the truth about Joon Hyeok

503
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,720
and step up as the man of the hour.

504
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:55,088
Jae Hee said Kim Yi Seol and Han Dong Min are both taken care of.

505
00:52:59,563 --> 00:53:02,814
She proves herself still useful.

506
00:53:02,814 --> 00:53:05,691
I'll give her another chance.

507
00:53:18,102 --> 00:53:19,999
Good one!

508
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,840
Good shot!

509
00:53:22,844 --> 00:53:25,210
That was a good swing.

510
00:53:26,523 --> 00:53:30,503
Have you been practicing?

511
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:38,285
- Can I get her number perhaps? 
 - Oh, well...

512
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:42,589
I can't do that without her consent.

513
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:45,681
But you can leave a memo with me.

514
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:50,393
- That'll work. My number is… 
 - Wait a second.

515
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,536
- Go ahead. 
 - 010…

516
00:53:54,352 --> 00:53:56,195
Ms. Kim Myung Hwan.

517
00:53:57,116 --> 00:53:58,498
How have you been?

518
00:53:58,498 --> 00:54:00,393
It's been a long time.

519
00:54:00,393 --> 00:54:02,436
What are you doing here?

520
00:54:02,436 --> 00:54:05,750
Oh, I'm just here to see someone.

521
00:54:12,592 --> 00:54:17,425
Reporter Han said he wanted to find Soon Ok's granddaughter.

522
00:54:17,425 --> 00:54:22,903
He said media coverage will help prevent the same kind of brutalities from before.

523
00:54:22,903 --> 00:54:28,209
But I wasn't sure if Yi Seol would want that. So I came to ask.

524
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:30,277
So, you're saying

525
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:36,055
Yi Seol is the granddaughter of the late Na Soon Ok?

526
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:40,410
I was so surprised to see her at the Talk Concert.

527
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:44,080
I wanted to go and talk to her right then,

528
00:54:45,637 --> 00:54:51,505
but thought I'd leave her be rather than remind her of the tragedy.

529
00:54:51,505 --> 00:54:56,019
I'm just glad that she's doing so well.

530
00:54:56,842 --> 00:55:01,809
And I respect her decision to put her past behind her.

531
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,710
Right there.

532
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,980
- What is it? 
 - Just come with me.

533
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,768
Sit here.

534
00:55:13,196 --> 00:55:15,593
Now that you're back on the field,

535
00:55:15,593 --> 00:55:19,090
I've prepared a little something for your health.

536
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,910
I don't need that.

537
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:28,020
Come on now. I bought this just for you, so try one.

538
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,230
You'll have to stay in good health

539
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:33,620
if you are to help Joon Hyeok in his way to the Blue House.

540
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,410
Here.

541
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,538
There you go.

542
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,306
Good, right?

543
00:55:50,512 --> 00:55:52,358
Just a moment.

544
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:02,073
Hay Jae Hee. I'm out golfing with Joon Hyeok and Pil Sung.

545
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,720
What!

546
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:09,038
What do you mean what happened that day?

547
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:17,205
Of course, some of my crew were there, serving the guests, but…

548
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,975
I have to meet that person myself.

549
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:23,690
There's something I need to confirm.

550
00:56:38,551 --> 00:56:42,800

551
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:55,740

552
00:57:13,186 --> 00:57:16,490
Excuse me, Mrs. Han.

553
00:58:01,582 --> 00:58:06,950
You must be Park Yong Seob, who leaked the videos before.

554
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:13,218
I heard that you know where Yi Seol and Joon Hyeok were

555
00:58:14,396 --> 00:58:19,916
on the day of the tragedy of Hyeongsan-dong seven years ago.

556
00:58:22,109 --> 00:58:25,570
Tell me everything you know about Yi Seol.

557
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,781
When did she get into that kind of work?

558
00:58:27,781 --> 00:58:30,328
She wouldn't do that kind of thing.

559
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:40,707
What do you mean she wouldn't do that?

560
00:58:40,707 --> 00:58:43,515
Well, the truth is…

561
00:58:43,515 --> 00:58:48,690
She had no idea that such a thing would happen.

562
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:54,299
She was just there to beg for help to avoid getting evicted.

563
00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:59,050
Then things took a wrong turn and that bastard of Jung Joon Hyeok...

564
00:59:01,608 --> 00:59:04,934
I mean Anchor Jung…

565
00:59:07,105 --> 00:59:08,218
raped Yi Seol.

566
00:59:08,218 --> 00:59:10,836
You little punk!

567
00:59:10,836 --> 00:59:12,973
You'd better watch your mouth, or--

568
00:59:12,973 --> 00:59:14,990
Mr. Yang.

569
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,728
Be quiet.

570
00:59:25,069 --> 00:59:27,419
You can continue.

571
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:35,191
It looks like everything's finally in place.

572
00:59:35,191 --> 00:59:39,050
Will it be okay to leave Kim Yi Seol like that?

573
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:44,492
Jae Hee's made up her mind. That won't be a problem.

574
00:59:44,492 --> 00:59:47,841
I'm glad everything turned out the way you wanted.

575
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:05,845
I'd like to have a word with you, Mother.

576
01:00:16,285 --> 01:00:19,600
Are you here to get the necklace back?

577
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:25,810
Good job taking care of Kim Yi Seol.

578
01:00:29,346 --> 01:00:32,608
She said she'd leave.

579
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:35,130
Have you talked to her?

580
01:00:37,558 --> 01:00:39,696
What else did she say?

581
01:00:39,696 --> 01:00:42,940
Didn't she say anything except that she'd leave?

582
01:00:45,218 --> 01:00:48,118
Perhaps that you should get me divorced?

583
01:00:48,118 --> 01:00:51,318
Or that I'm merely trying to please you all to get something out of you?

584
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:53,497
Or that I'm crazy

585
01:00:53,497 --> 01:00:56,687
to live alongside you when you only disrespect me,

586
01:00:56,687 --> 01:01:00,902
and that you should kick me out of the family?

587
01:01:00,902 --> 01:01:05,505
Or that she would protect me no matter what it takes?

588
01:01:05,505 --> 01:01:08,680
Didn't she say any nonsense like that?

589
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:17,499
That day seven years ago…

590
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:27,386
You already knew about everything that happened that day, didn't you?

591
01:01:27,386 --> 01:01:31,101
So, you just listened to that nonsense and did nothing?

592
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:33,430
I didn't just listen. I…

593
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:36,204
Oh, darn it!

594
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,241
I was shocked to hear that and couldn't believe it,

595
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:43,237
but he didn't seem to be lying, saying she'd told him all about it.

596
01:01:43,237 --> 01:01:45,285
Of course, that must have been a lie!

597
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:48,592
Perhaps Kim Yi Seol lied to him about it.

598
01:01:48,592 --> 01:01:52,210
After all, she sold her own child for money.

599
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,319
She was trying to get some money from us for her child.

600
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:59,189
And now, she's trying to threaten us with this nonsense.

601
01:01:59,189 --> 01:02:00,964
So, what should we do now?

602
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:05,648
And I think Joon Hyeok will be shocked to hear that she's the mother of his child.

603
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,807
- Come in. 
 - Thanks.

604
01:02:20,253 --> 01:02:23,611
I'm sure Mother gives you a lot of pressure.

605
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:25,432
You'll be more comfortable here.

606
01:02:25,432 --> 01:02:29,729
Feel free to use this place whenever you'd like.

607
01:02:29,729 --> 01:02:31,149
Thank you.

608
01:02:31,149 --> 01:02:37,875
I'm glad to be helping in your efforts to bring a new future to this country.

609
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:42,260
You have my absolute trust, Professor Yoo.

610
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:47,398
I am honored to have your trust, Mr. President.

611
01:02:47,398 --> 01:02:50,700
Don't call me that. We have a long way to go.

612
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:56,673
It's enough for today that we came to really understand each other.

613
01:02:56,673 --> 01:02:59,870
- Shall we have a drink? 
 - Sure.

614
01:03:02,494 --> 01:03:04,986
Let me take this call.

615
01:03:13,444 --> 01:03:15,277
Yes, Father.

616
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:20,896
So, Mrs. Yoon believed everything you said?

617
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:22,485
She did.

618
01:03:22,485 --> 01:03:25,670
The Little Boss said I was lying and made a fuss.

619
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:28,717
But she just sat there listening, looking shocked and all.

620
01:03:28,717 --> 01:03:34,480
Then she said that she'd take care of everything and to wait.

621
01:03:40,113 --> 01:03:46,356
By the way, do you think she can really handle this?

622
01:03:54,570 --> 01:04:00,940

623
01:04:07,508 --> 01:04:12,997
So, what are you going to do about it?

624
01:04:17,373 --> 01:04:20,673
I'll take some time to think about it.

625
01:04:20,673 --> 01:04:28,591
About how you people have wronged us and how to make you pay.

626
01:04:28,591 --> 01:04:34,030
And you'd better be ready for that.

627
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:39,338
"You people" and "us."

628
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:41,744
"Us?"

629
01:04:43,691 --> 01:04:49,580
Since when are you and Kim Yi Seol "us?"

630
01:04:52,992 --> 01:04:56,084
Come back to your senses.

631
01:04:56,084 --> 01:05:00,530
Have you forgotten the goal you've been striving for all this time?

632
01:05:12,895 --> 01:05:17,998
Will you be so daring to side against me?

633
01:05:20,206 --> 01:05:26,212
What do you think you could do in opposition to me?

634
01:05:32,604 --> 01:05:38,803
If I can't have it all, I'll ruin it all.

635
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,800
Just wait.

636
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,000
I will ruin everything completely.

637
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,970

638
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:51,190
 Come meet me at the office from before.

639
01:07:25,097 --> 01:07:29,570

640
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:41,320

641
01:07:49,086 --> 01:07:51,423
 What does it feel like to live with a secret like that?

642
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:55,110
 Remember. You've never seen Kim Yi Seol before.

643
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,450
 When you see people who don't know the truth,

644
01:07:57,450 --> 01:08:00,580
 do you feel guilty or superior?

645
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,959
 She must have known there was danger coming her way when she wrote it.

646
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:06,128
 They'll have to pay for the sins they've committed.

647
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:07,890
 Who was it? Tell me!

648
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:10,455
 How will you take care of it?

649
01:08:10,455 --> 01:08:13,332
 I never wanted a child born like this.

650
01:08:13,332 --> 01:08:17,030
 Joon Hyeok called Yi Seol into the office.

651
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:21,370
 You don't know the difference between a secret and a lie.

652
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,300
 Are you with Kim Yi Seol?

653
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,888
 Why are you overreacting?

654
01:08:25,888 --> 01:08:29,272
 Are you going to say I'm a murderer?

655
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,401
 How did you know?
