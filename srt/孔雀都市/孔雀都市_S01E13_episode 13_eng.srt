1
00:00:01,513 --> 00:00:05,409

2
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:09,315

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,180

4
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:25,489
Let's go.

5
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:34,207
Joon Hyeok, you eat such rustic food.

6
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:36,020
Rustic?

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm sorry we couldn't serve you something better.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
It's fine. I'm just glad that this isn't the emergency room.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,893
- Enjoy. 
 - Thanks.

10
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,468
Thanks.

11
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,928
Joon Hyeok, I've always wondered. Why do you do that?

12
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:05,168
This? You cover the brand name when you pour.

13
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:08,841
Old manners from my prosecutor days. My seniors were very strict.

14
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:10,827
Oh.

15
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,594
It seemed stupid at first.

16
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:18,427
I thought they were making a big deal out of nothing.

17
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:21,552
- It is nothing. 
 - Maybe not.

18
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:24,894
But they use such manners to show that they've hegemony.

19
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:27,574
Come on. What an exaggeration.

20
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:30,626
And I don't care about such things.

21
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:33,387
Have you ever been to the Majang-dong Meat Market?

22
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,547
My dad took me there when I was young.

23
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:42,660
They'd sell pork hock in big iron pots.

24
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:46,813
Have you ever tried boiled pig tail?

25
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:49,600
Pig tail? You eat that?

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,183
It's a delicacy only true pork lovers know about.

27
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,987
I have a question.

28
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:59,920
Why did you assume that I wouldn't eat such foods?

29
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,507
Well…

30
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:07,822
Why did you think I wouldn't eat such lowbrow and common foods?

31
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:10,533
What was your logic?

32
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:16,899
It's because you are acutely aware of society's status quo.

33
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:20,119
You just don't want to admit it.

34
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,196
That's why you despise

35
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:28,052
the etiquette practiced by those in power.

36
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:32,379
But Dong Min, the sad thing is

37
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,029
that those who are in power

38
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,509
don't give a thing about what you think.

39
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:41,596
Why? Because you are not a threat to them.

40
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:44,455
They recognize that.

41
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:48,004
So if you want what you think to truly matter,

42
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:54,529
you've to earn the recognition of those who have power.

43
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:59,636
It's… quite ironic, isn't it?

44
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:05,047
Here.

45
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:07,082
Let's drink.

46
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:13,811
Cheers.

47
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:23,200
Come with me, Yi Seol.

48
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:35,752
Take that bandage off.

49
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:38,740
You should take it off since it's wet.

50
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:45,777
Let me see.

51
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:49,780
It's almost healed. You won't need ointment.

52
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:56,405
Why are you doing this?

53
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:00,810
You could have been

54
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:06,266
in serious trouble if things had gone south.

55
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:11,099
Just play along.

56
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,572
I have to do this.

57
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,032
You said you were on my side.

58
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:34,174

59
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,890
Good work.

60
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,986
This isn't for you, so just take it.

61
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:48,056
You have to take your colleagues out to dinner.

62
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:51,727
Thank you, sir.

63
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:55,989
If only I hadn't heard that

64
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:57,603
No Young Joo gave birth to a kid;

65
00:04:57,603 --> 00:05:01,218
then, I would have tried to stand my ground.

66
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,507
Things went awry

67
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,598
just because of the money.

68
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:10,789
Nowadays, my knees are killing me.

69
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:18,819
Jung Ho, you should have gotten to the bottom of things.

70
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,665
You only found out half the truth.

71
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,835
The kid's not No Young Joo's.

72
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:29,031
It belongs to the girl Young Joo was rooming with.

73
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:45,839
 Was it because of the child?

74
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:53,673
Was that why you wanted to make Jae Hee and Joon Hyeok get divorced?

75
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:58,878
What were you planning to do after the divorce?

76
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:03,339
Planning?

77
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:07,332
Are you asking me if

78
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:09,705
I wanted to become Joon Hyeok's wife?

79
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:14,352
You think I wanted to

80
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:18,738
steal Mrs. Yoon's husband and find my child, is that it?

81
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:25,552
Is that the kind of person you think I am?

82
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:30,332
I don't care what your true intentions were.

83
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:33,562
You won't be able to bring back your child.

84
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:38,792
Your child died two years go.

85
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:09,072
 Why did you marry such a man?

86
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:12,765
 You should have married a man who would never do such a thing.

87
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:16,238
 You're a good person.

88
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:23,379
 And I had a child.

89
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,817
 Can't you just divorce him?

90
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:47,715
Please stop.

91
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:50,761
It's all over now.

92
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:54,318
No.

93
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,527
It's only the beginning.

94
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00,973
There's no reason for me to hesitate.

95
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:05,387
What are you going to do?

96
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:07,532
You shouldn't involve Jae Hee

97
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,838
in a matter that's between you and Joon Hyeok.

98
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:14,330
What difference will it make if you tell Jae Hee everything?

99
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,891
Will you help me?

100
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,766
If you promise

101
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:32,053
- that you'll leave quietly. 
 - If you won't help,

102
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,350
then don't interfere.

103
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,560
Kim Yi Seol!

104
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:40,377
Kim Yi Seol!

105
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:54,798

106
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,423
How likely is it for a man to be unable

107
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:38,476
to remember the face of a woman he slept with?

108
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:46,560
Or, was I too stupid to notice?

109
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,027
Jae Hee, it's not your fault.

110
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:55,945
What the hell.

111
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:58,265
Did you know about this?

112
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:03,298
Don't try to understand it

113
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:07,483
or do anything to resolve the situation.

114
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,543
Since when?

115
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,074
Since when did you know about it?

116
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,545
First, take a seat.

117
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:18,183
I'll explain it to you.

118
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:21,016
Why did you pretend you didn't know?

119
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:23,308
How could you do this to me?

120
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,730
How could you betray me like this?

121
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:58,447
- Congratulations, Dong Min. 
 - Thank you.

122
00:11:58,447 --> 00:11:59,860
- Congratulations. 
 - Thanks.

123
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:03,370
- Thank you! 
 - Dong Min!

124
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:08,351
"Excellence in reporting."

125
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:11,978
"Han Dong Min of JBC."

126
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:13,117
This is fantastic.

127
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:15,421
What are you preparing for your next story?

128
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:18,831
I'm going to report on the real estate speculation of government officials.

129
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:20,037
I'm getting so many leads.

130
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:22,564
It seems that lots of people are angry about it.

131
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:23,784
Now,

132
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:27,790
Dong Min will replace Joon Hyeok as the star of our newsroom.

133
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,964
I wouldn't dare presume…

134
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:31,454
Why not?

135
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:34,357
You have a passionate sense of responsibility

136
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:35,910
and you're not too bad to look at, either.

137
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,028
Will you please stop, Director?

138
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:39,437
Laughing?

139
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:40,957
What's so funny?

140
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:42,510
Get to work, now!

141
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,449
Get me a story.

142
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,423
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

143
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:48,304
Come over here!

144
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:58,710

145
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,730
 The phone you dialed was turned off. Please leave a message…

146
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:17,296
The perfect word

147
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,031
to describe this situation is providential.

148
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:25,298
It's a perfect timing for the Minister of Land's scandal.

149
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:30,871
Korean reporters are quite excellent, aren't they?

150
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:33,964
This could be the source of unnecessary misunderstandings.

151
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:38,624
It would be a travesty if people begin to suspect

152
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:42,450
that Prosecutor General Cho and Mr. Jung Joon Hyeok are in cahoots.

153
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,184
That's--

154
00:13:43,244 --> 00:13:46,304
That seems like an unnecessary concern.

155
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:48,603
Who in the world knows

156
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:53,323
that we're behind the investigation into Minister Park?

157
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:58,530
Unless, the Chief Editor of the Hanju Daily

158
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,711
leaks the secret.

159
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,530
Stop talking nonsense!

160
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,184
I know you obtained the rights to redevelop

161
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:11,621
Hyeongsan-dong by offering to stop the investigation

162
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:14,795
into the Minister of Land.

163
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:19,122
But you can't let anything like

164
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:22,576
the incident from 7 years ago happen again.

165
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:23,733
While Mr. Jung Joon Hyeok was

166
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:27,628
able to overcome the negative sentiment over his father's past misdeeds,

167
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,655
if such a travesty were to recur,

168
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:33,208
that would sound a death knell to Mr. Jung's presidential aspirations.

169
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,368
That would be a catastrophe.

170
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,528
We can't let

171
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:41,017
Congressman Min's sacrifice for our greater goal

172
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:45,953
go to waste. That's something that we cannot let happen.

173
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:49,480
Chairman Jung, please be careful of your actions.

174
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,506
Okay?

175
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:54,277
If such a thing were to…

176
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:56,719
I've heard enough!

177
00:14:56,719 --> 00:15:01,792
Since we're on the subject, let's go over exactly what happened.

178
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:08,259
See exactly what happened seven years ago and who's truly at fault.

179
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:10,686
Is there anyone here

180
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:16,470
who can claim innocence and has the right to point fingers?

181
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,859
I'm sorry.

182
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:29,158
I'll make sure that

183
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:33,311
what you're worried about doesn't happen again.

184
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:08,891
I don't care what others say about me.

185
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:11,036
I can just let it slide.

186
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,289
What were the apologies for?

187
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:16,249
You should have stood up for me.

188
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:21,409
You said you needed funds for Joon Il to expand Sungjin Trade and Apparel.

189
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:25,209
So in order to obtain those funds, I did everything I could,

190
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:29,436
even kowtowing to those bastards.

191
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:35,342
I know that you feel deeply wounded

192
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:40,570
because of all the ridicule you've received in your life.

193
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:46,389
I know that people say you struck it rich

194
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:49,735
by marrying an unwed mother.

195
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:51,689
How could I not?

196
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:53,980
I have ears and eyes, too.

197
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,407
If you know that, how could you be so harsh on me?

198
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,708
But that's why you were so ambitious.

199
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,741
All this time, you wanted to

200
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:09,281
reach a position of power and influence in this family.

201
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:12,561
But I won't be held responsible

202
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:17,258
for the mistakes you made because of that ambition.

203
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:20,311
So, don't drag me down

204
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:24,624
to your level ever again.

205
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:46,930
It was that day, seven years ago,

206
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,174
when you had a gathering with them over the Hyeongsan-dong demolition?

207
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:52,940
 I'm going to check out some desks.

208
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,555
 I don't think I can go with you.

209
00:17:54,628 --> 00:17:57,388
 Everyone is on standby because of the Hyeongsan-dong demolition.

210
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:58,649
 Just focus on your work.

211
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,517
 I'll take care of everything.

212
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:03,343
 It hasn't been that long since you became the main anchor.

213
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:04,543
 Focus on work.

214
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,856
 But it's our wedding anniversary.

215
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:10,190
 I'll take you somewhere nice for dinner.

216
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:15,917
Jae Hee, why don't you just get a divorce?

217
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:20,430
No! I can't do that.

218
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:23,016
Jung Joon Hyeok is mine.

219
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,070
I made him.

220
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,056
I won't let anyone else have him.

221
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:30,280
Yi Seol might not be trying to take him.

222
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,495
She might've been sincere when she said she'd protect you.

223
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:38,650
Did she get to you, too?

224
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:42,680
If Yi Seol reveals everything,

225
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:47,430
that we created a fake alibi for Cho Kang Hyeon

226
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,209
and closed the case on No Young Joo's death...

227
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:52,050
Yi Seol knows everything.

228
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,794
She could even reveal that she had a child with Joon Hyeok.

229
00:18:56,794 --> 00:19:00,054
She sold her body in order to make money.

230
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:03,240
She's in no position to reveal anyone's wrongdoings.

231
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,213
Didn't she say she'd protect me?

232
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:09,130
Tell her to keep her promise.

233
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,746
Hi, Honey.

234
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:37,240
Is something the matter?

235
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:25,630

236
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:30,591
Hello, Dong Min.

237
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:36,730
Hi. Have you talked to Yi Seol today?

238
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,778
Why do you ask?

239
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,753
I wasn't able to get through to her.

240
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:44,406
So, I came to her place, and her door is open, but no one is here.

241
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:46,613
It's strange.

242
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,879
I'm sure there's a reason.

243
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:52,751
But I don't know everything about her.

244
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:00,510
Who is it?

245
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:25,090
What's going on?

246
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,883
Yi Seol!

247
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:13,210
What is it? Who's there?

248
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:15,814
What is it?

249
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,394
What's going on?

250
00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:20,547
Yi… Yi Seol!

251
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,588
Yi Seol! Wake up!

252
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:25,515
- Let's get her inside. 
 - Ok.

253
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,747
Wake up!

254
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,053

255
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:02,427
She'll be fine. She just needs some rest.

256
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:04,195
Thank you, Doctor.

257
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:21,641
Was it those bastards that assaulted you?

258
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,575
I don't know.

259
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:25,094
We'll have to find out more.

260
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:27,974
But they must've attacked Yi Seol.

261
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,714
They're using the people around you to pressure you.

262
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,674
Yi Seol hosted the talk concert with Joon Hyeok so…

263
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:42,445
Excuse me.

264
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,380

265
00:24:22,757 --> 00:24:24,797
What do you want this late night?

266
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:28,057
What?

267
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:34,383
What are you saying?

268
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:42,176
Kim Yi Seol?

269
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:43,950
Who is that?

270
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,603
 Hello?

271
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,749
 Why don't you answer me?

272
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:53,444
She's a staff member at the gallery.

273
00:24:53,444 --> 00:24:55,575
She appeared in the talk concert with Joon Hyeok.

274
00:24:55,575 --> 00:25:00,955
So? What does she have to do with me?

275
00:25:02,174 --> 00:25:07,347
You didn't tell Mother about what we did together, did you?

276
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:09,227
I'm not stupid.

277
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:12,400
You told me that Han Sook was pretending to be for Joon Hyeok,

278
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,174
but she had Joo Yeon to secretly plot against him.

279
00:25:16,174 --> 00:25:18,653
That's why you wanted a truce

280
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:22,020
so that we could protect Joon Hyeok together.

281
00:25:22,714 --> 00:25:28,066
I said that I wouldn't let Mother use me again.

282
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:55,850
No. It's nothing serious.

283
00:25:56,609 --> 00:25:58,948
I'll tell you after I resolve the matter.

284
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:03,567
Open the door.

285
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,812
Yes, I understand, Father.

286
00:26:14,812 --> 00:26:17,292
I'll call you later.

287
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:18,818
What's going on?

288
00:26:18,818 --> 00:26:20,786
What?

289
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:25,411
Why would you lock the door and call Father in the middle of the night?

290
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:29,119
Hasn't everything been resolved?

291
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,993
You received permission to redevelop Hyeongsan-dong by threatening to leak

292
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:34,073
your files on Park Man Jae and pinning the assault on him, no?

293
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:36,930
What happened today has nothing to do with that.

294
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:42,378
Then what's the meaning of this?

295
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:45,404
Someone must have found out it was fake.

296
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,432
What?

297
00:26:47,432 --> 00:26:51,365
I was behind the assault.

298
00:26:51,365 --> 00:26:53,350
With your father.

299
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:57,239
We did it together.

300
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:02,212
Hello, Detective.

301
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:04,206
I'm sorry for calling you so late.

302
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,259
Something urgent came up.

303
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,172
Someone close to me was assaulted,

304
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:13,015
but I can't report it

305
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:14,949
through official channels.

306
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:17,651
Yes.

307
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:19,831
Yes.

308
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:21,705
Are you crazy?

309
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:23,922
What do you think will happen

310
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:26,252
if Dong Min were to find out about it?

311
00:27:26,252 --> 00:27:30,065
So, I should have just stood by

312
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,772
as Joo Yeon plotted against you with Congressman Min

313
00:27:32,772 --> 00:27:36,158
and waited to see how Mother would react?

314
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:39,804
All the while, worrying about whose side Mother would take?

315
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:43,192
You should have discussed it with me!

316
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:52,768
I know about the child you had with another woman.

317
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:56,261
Mother told me.

318
00:27:57,746 --> 00:28:00,358
She knew that Father was

319
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:03,250
desperately searching for the whereabouts of the child.

320
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:10,910
Mother might even know the identity of the woman who gave birth.

321
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,721
Today's incident

322
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:19,021
is most likely a warning from Mother.

323
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:23,910
To have Yi Seol assaulted and left outside of our place

324
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:28,479
could be a warning from Mother to me,

325
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:31,360
so that I don't try to assert my independence.

326
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:35,960
Or it could be a warning to you so that you'll stop acting in a way

327
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,021
that will dent her plans for you.

328
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:42,234
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

329
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,800
I'll get going now.

330
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,766
How is Yi Seol?

331
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:06,380
She's sleeping deeply.

332
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,047
I called a detective that I know.

333
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:13,340
I asked him to help me find the bastard that attacked Yi Seol.

334
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,847
I thought it would be better than calling the police

335
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:18,166
since I didn't want Joon Hyeok to be fodder

336
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,593
for any unpleasant gossip.

337
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:25,739
It's probably better than to call this into the police officially.

338
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:28,232
Yes, you're right.

339
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:32,059
Yi Seol really likes you a lot.

340
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:34,137
She says that you've been nice to her

341
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:36,344
and helped her out a lot.

342
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:39,810
She said that she wanted to repay you.

343
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:46,214
You must be tired. Get some rest.

344
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:48,381
- I'll call you tomorrow. 
 - Okay.

345
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:50,354
I'll see myself out.

346
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:52,161
Good night.

347
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:55,327
- I'm leaving, Joon Hyeok. 
 - Okay.

348
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,340
Good night.

349
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:12,604
Drive safe.

350
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:16,880
Joon Hyeok, don't let this weaken your resolve.

351
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,311
I'll protect you.

352
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:21,908
Okay.

353
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:50,919
Get up. I know you're not sleeping.

354
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,780
Did you see who did it?

355
00:31:18,607 --> 00:31:19,550
No.

356
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,990
It wasn't anyone from Sungjin.

357
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,720
I checked.

358
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:29,173
Joon Hyeok doesn't seem to recognize you at all.

359
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:31,360
Do you have feelings for him?

360
00:31:32,341 --> 00:31:36,690
Or did you plot with No Young Joo

361
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:41,070
to blackmail men you've slept with?

362
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,970
Don't say such things.

363
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:52,557
I know you're the one who sent the sex video to Madam Kwon.

364
00:31:57,303 --> 00:32:00,420
Do you have videos of Joon Hyeok, too?

365
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:08,500
You just wait

366
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,199
until I decide what I'm going to do with you.

367
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:18,241
In the meantime, you can mourn for your dead child.

368
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:17,606
Hyeon Woo, I'm sorry I can't take you to kindergarten, Honey.

369
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:18,819
It's all right.

370
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:21,180
Daddy is taking me.

371
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,510
- I'll see you at dinnertime. 
 - Okay.

372
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,621
Bye, Mom.

373
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:29,591
Bye.

374
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:45,539
- Please give her meals on time. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

375
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:17,390
Excuse me.

376
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,565
What are you doing in here?

377
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:23,584
Your meal is ready.

378
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:25,258
Come with me.

379
00:34:25,258 --> 00:34:27,073
Okay.

380
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:30,311
What do you mean Yi Seol was kidnapped and assaulted?

381
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,495
This neighborhood

382
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:37,530
is full of vacancies, and people only care about redevelopment.

383
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,740
It'll be tough to find out who did it.

384
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,525
So, where is Yi Seol right now?

385
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:47,110
At my house.

386
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,440
What are you trying to do?

387
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,782
Please find out who's behind this.

388
00:36:50,782 --> 00:36:54,751
I have my suspicions, but I want to be sure.

389
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:57,084
Chairwoman Seo knows who Kim Yi Seol is?

390
00:36:57,084 --> 00:37:01,020
Maybe she just found out or maybe she knew all along.

391
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,384
I'm going to ask her.

392
00:37:03,384 --> 00:37:05,110
So please hurry.

393
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:10,760

394
00:37:16,656 --> 00:37:18,070
How did it go?

395
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,510
Nobody has reported the assault to the police.

396
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:27,071
She hasn't reported it even though a staff member was

397
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:30,085
kidnapped and assaulted?

398
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:34,400
She's a scary girl.

399
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,470
What's he doing there?

400
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,788
Well, Mrs. Yoon told me to leave him alone.

401
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:26,240
Let me see that.

402
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:38,950
Can you explain this to me?

403
00:38:43,064 --> 00:38:45,590
How did you…

404
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:52,257
Jae Hee seems to know that I was the one who sent her the present.

405
00:38:52,257 --> 00:38:55,339
I'll have to call her in and talk to her.

406
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,755
I want to know

407
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,855
why she's doing things without my permission again.

408
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:31,640
It's been a long time.

409
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,234
So, what's the occasion?

410
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:37,450
Why did you want to see a nobody like me all of a sudden?

411
00:39:42,194 --> 00:39:44,550
- I'll take the same. 
 - Okay.

412
00:39:48,397 --> 00:39:52,650
How was it the first time you met Madam Kwon?

413
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,389
Is that why you called me here?

414
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:57,210
Why do you want to know?

415
00:39:57,733 --> 00:40:00,003
You're so mean.

416
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:02,724
You know what she said?

417
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:06,602
She said she couldn't believe

418
00:40:07,683 --> 00:40:10,094
what she was going through.

419
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:13,028
Yet, she was smiling as if it wasn't bothering her at all.

420
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,821
I'm just wondering how she felt as she took her husband's mistress

421
00:40:19,821 --> 00:40:21,990
and child into her home.

422
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:30,719
There's just one reason she took me in.

423
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,243
She didn't want her husband going behind her back.

424
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:36,620
She wanted her husband to be open about his affairs.

425
00:40:37,856 --> 00:40:42,189
That made me feel so pathetic.

426
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,266
When we were going behind her back,

427
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:47,861
I felt a sense of superiority.

428
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:49,751
Like I was better.

429
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:52,738
I was completely taken because Kang Hyeon

430
00:40:52,738 --> 00:40:55,488
told me that I was his love and that he didn't care for his wife.

431
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:57,707
How pathetic.

432
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,365
You're right.

433
00:40:59,365 --> 00:41:01,707
I regret it.

434
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:05,536
I was pathetic and stupid.

435
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:11,931
But you know what's even worse?

436
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:16,240
Kang Hyeon had no sense of guilt.

437
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,873
He became bold about his indiscretions.

438
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:22,702
Before, he was scared to get caught.

439
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:26,700
But he completely changed overnight.

440
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,233
He knew that she would never divorce him

441
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:34,598
so he became confident and took on even more mistresses.

442
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:35,663
What an ass!

443
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:38,000
That's how power is.

444
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:44,068
You become confident even when you do wrong.

445
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,506
No matter how badly you behave

446
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,879
and how much you lie,

447
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:52,225
it doesn't affect you a bit.

448
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:57,192
You probably won't divorce him because of all the effort you put in.

449
00:41:57,192 --> 00:41:59,993
It's your choice.

450
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:02,112
You can keep him by your side and harass him

451
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:05,282
or you can send him away and feel anxious.

452
00:42:05,282 --> 00:42:09,328
Your husband will behave differently depending on what you choose.

453
00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:12,821
Don't forget that. Okay?

454
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:33,711
What's the occasion?

455
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:36,404
I'm just thinking of old times.

456
00:42:36,404 --> 00:42:40,702
Joon Il, you, Eun Jung, and I used to come here to drink.

457
00:42:40,702 --> 00:42:45,881
It could still have been that way if you hadn't married Jae Hee.

458
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:58,918
-  Hi, Oppa! 
 - Hi, you're here.

459
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,714
You're disappointed that I'm here, aren't you?

460
00:43:06,392 --> 00:43:08,095
Is Joo Yeon bothering you again?

461
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:10,420
- You want me to scold her? 
 - Yes.

462
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:15,677
I'm just joking.

463
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,223
It's not like that.

464
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:18,966
Where's Jae Hee?

465
00:43:18,966 --> 00:43:22,304
She's in no mood to be drinking with us right now.

466
00:43:22,304 --> 00:43:24,969
You're so clueless.

467
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:27,778
It must be tough for you, Joo Yeon.

468
00:43:27,778 --> 00:43:30,663
Now, isn't that the truth?

469
00:43:30,663 --> 00:43:35,104
Joon Il, you should take care of Joo Yeon.

470
00:43:35,104 --> 00:43:39,438
She's going around causing trouble because you don't pay enough attention to her.

471
00:43:44,517 --> 00:43:47,390
Hey! What are you saying, Joon Hyeok?

472
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,413
Did something happen?

473
00:43:51,277 --> 00:43:53,234
You shouldn't try to stab me in the back.

474
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:56,170
You and I are family, after all.

475
00:43:56,941 --> 00:44:00,260
What will people say if they find out?

476
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:04,929
You know I'm not running

477
00:44:04,929 --> 00:44:08,252
for president for my own interests.

478
00:44:08,252 --> 00:44:13,722
It's just a role I have to play for the good of the Sungjin family business.

479
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:19,708
Just as Joon Il has to become chairman even though he doesn't want to.

480
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,543
Am I wrong?

481
00:44:21,543 --> 00:44:23,560
Well, am I?

482
00:44:33,108 --> 00:44:36,866
Nobody forced you to marry a woman like Jae Hee.

483
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:40,556
She's my woman and I chose her.

484
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,816
If you don't like it, then you get a divorce.

485
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:45,920
- Are you done talking? 
 - I'm sorry, Joon Hyeok.

486
00:44:47,399 --> 00:44:53,420
I'll make sure that such a thing never happens again.

487
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:07,789
Mommy!

488
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:15,398
- Is she in the room? 
 - She went out with Han Dong Min, the reporter.

489
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:35,783
You can get CCTV footage without a subpoena.

490
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:38,977
All you have to do is put in a request.

491
00:45:38,977 --> 00:45:41,728
If you give me power of attorney,

492
00:45:41,728 --> 00:45:43,923
I can put in the request for you.

493
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,050
Thank you.

494
00:45:51,063 --> 00:45:56,744
I'm sorry that I can't do anything more for you.

495
00:46:00,981 --> 00:46:05,497
Is it fine for you if I become someone that

496
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:09,340
you can rely on and ask for help?

497
00:46:35,481 --> 00:46:37,000
- Mommy. 
 - Yes?

498
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,400
- Let's play dominoes after dinner. 
 - Okay.

499
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,798
I hope Yi Seol comes back soon.

500
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:57,730
What do you mean? There aren't any CCTVs?

501
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,397
The area's been slated for demolition.

502
00:47:00,397 --> 00:47:04,636
So, there aren't any CCTVs around that area.

503
00:47:04,636 --> 00:47:06,995
How about the CCTVs in front of my home?

504
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:09,384
There must be footage of the man who left Yi Seol there.

505
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:12,470
I sent you a video, so take a look.

506
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:27,209
 It's from a dashcam of a car in front of the manager's office of your home.

507
00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:30,863
The manager said that the CCTVs were down

508
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:34,020
temporarily last night because of a malfunction.

509
00:47:34,906 --> 00:47:37,477
That's all I need to know.

510
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:40,684
Now, I just need to hear Mother's explanation.

511
00:47:40,684 --> 00:47:45,824
I'll ask her why she is treating me badly again.

512
00:47:55,427 --> 00:47:57,118
Yi Seol!

513
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,775
Come play dominoes with me!

514
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:05,394
You should brush your teeth first, Hyeon Woo.

515
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:08,892
Come on!

516
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:11,499
Do as I say.

517
00:48:11,499 --> 00:48:13,563
Okay.

518
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:26,459
What did Dong Min say?

519
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:33,039
He said we could find the assailant even without reporting the incident to the police.

520
00:48:33,803 --> 00:48:36,478
He seemed very worried for you.

521
00:48:36,478 --> 00:48:39,390
So, why didn't he report it to the police?

522
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:43,420
Why didn't you?

523
00:48:45,003 --> 00:48:46,849
That's because

524
00:48:48,243 --> 00:48:51,030
my husband and I, are more important than you.

525
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:57,464
It's more important that everything goes according to plan.

526
00:48:57,464 --> 00:49:03,040
It's more important that we don't become fodder for rumors.

527
00:49:05,565 --> 00:49:08,273
That's also why Dong Min didn't report it to the police.

528
00:49:08,273 --> 00:49:10,558
He may be concerned for you,

529
00:49:10,558 --> 00:49:15,030
but he knows that Joon Hyeok is far more important for him.

530
00:49:23,322 --> 00:49:25,191
Mommy is a liar.

531
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:28,143
It got late, Hyeon Woo.

532
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:30,641
You can play tomorrow.

533
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:35,521
I wanted to find Young Joo's killer

534
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:38,505
and take revenge.

535
00:49:38,505 --> 00:49:42,009
If Madam Kwon killed her,

536
00:49:42,009 --> 00:49:44,327
she wouldn't have killed herself

537
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:47,711
when she received the text from you purporting to be No Young Joo.

538
00:49:49,021 --> 00:49:51,011
If it wasn't her,

539
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:53,590
I thought it would be you.

540
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:01,871
But you accepted me without a sliver of suspicion.

541
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:05,801
I played into your hands completely.

542
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:12,326
That's why I was going to tell you everything.

543
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:19,423
Did you think that telling me about my husband's infidelities

544
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:23,010
and making me divorce him was truly for my benefit?

545
00:50:23,692 --> 00:50:25,165
Yes.

546
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:29,260
I still think that.

547
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:33,324
I don't care what kind of man he is.

548
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:37,259
I told you that I accept it and I'm going to live with him. It's none of your business.

549
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:43,001
You seem to have taken the moral high ground.

550
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:49,523
But then, instead of pretending to care about me,

551
00:50:49,523 --> 00:50:53,011
you shouldn't have slept with my husband to begin with!

552
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,684
You made me feel so pathetic.

553
00:51:24,134 --> 00:51:27,129
How could you apologize to Joon Hyeok?

554
00:51:27,924 --> 00:51:31,675
How could you apologize to him when you knew fully well

555
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:35,330
that Joon Hyeok called everyone together in order to embarrass me?

556
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,683
Did you have to play the good guy?

557
00:51:42,528 --> 00:51:45,070
What does a good guy do?

558
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,502
I don't know how I have to behave

559
00:51:52,437 --> 00:51:54,699
to play the good guy.

560
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,262
Is Joon Il home?

561
00:52:06,262 --> 00:52:08,095
Yes, Ma'am.

562
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:12,853
- Tell him to come visit me. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

563
00:52:12,853 --> 00:52:19,252
Actually, I shouldn't talk to him while my husband is around.

564
00:52:24,982 --> 00:52:28,310
I'm no different from you.

565
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:32,139
Just as you're going after Jae Hee

566
00:52:32,139 --> 00:52:35,275
in order to protect what's important to you,

567
00:52:35,275 --> 00:52:40,113
I'm trying to protect what's important to me

568
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:44,030
by refraining from saying things even when I want to.

569
00:52:45,153 --> 00:52:46,732
So,

570
00:52:48,276 --> 00:52:52,840
what you're saying is that I'm not important to you.

571
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:57,808
Fine.

572
00:52:58,978 --> 00:53:02,090
Now that I know how you truly feel,

573
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,599
it's fine.

574
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,960
Joo Yeon,

575
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:19,558
should we get a divorce?

576
00:54:18,076 --> 00:54:21,103
Tell Jae Hee to come visit me tomorrow morning.

577
00:54:21,103 --> 00:54:22,623
Yes, Ma'am.

578
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:47,177
 Chairwoman Seo wishes to see you tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

579
00:54:47,177 --> 00:54:49,269
 Don't be late.

580
00:55:04,977 --> 00:55:07,920

581
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:12,159

582
00:55:23,758 --> 00:55:25,960
What is it?

583
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,560
Well…

584
00:55:38,149 --> 00:55:40,560
 I'm afraid I can't make it.

585
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,560
 Please tell Mother that I'll contact her later.

586
00:56:08,194 --> 00:56:10,679
I've solved my problem.

587
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:12,720
How about you?

588
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,115
Me, too.

589
00:56:14,115 --> 00:56:16,483
I talked to Joon Il and Joo Yeon.

590
00:56:16,483 --> 00:56:18,732
Good.

591
00:56:18,732 --> 00:56:21,829
It would have been better if that hadn't happened at all.

592
00:56:22,899 --> 00:56:25,123
That's how it'll be in the future.

593
00:56:25,123 --> 00:56:26,667
I'm going to make sure

594
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:30,350
that no one dares to disrespect you or me in the future.

595
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,984
Just trust me.

596
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:08,697
If that hadn't happened at all…

597
01:00:20,866 --> 01:00:26,394

598
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:35,770

599
01:00:47,847 --> 01:00:49,923
 I had no other choice.

600
01:00:49,923 --> 01:00:51,720
 I trusted you so.

601
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,190
 He didn't die.

602
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:57,842
 Jae Hee doesn't know the truth, yet.

603
01:00:57,842 --> 01:00:59,399
 Everyone gets what they deserve.

604
01:00:59,399 --> 01:01:02,139
 You've to be responsible for your actions.

605
01:01:02,139 --> 01:01:03,277
 Say hello.

606
01:01:03,277 --> 01:01:07,105
 No one knows how you've lived until now.

607
01:01:07,105 --> 01:01:08,940
 The game is over.

608
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,810
 Jae Hee has everything.

609
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,540
 Mother, you're finished.

610
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,318
 I don't want to live

611
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:20,210
 fearing what would happen if you decided to use

612
01:01:20,856 --> 01:01:24,320
 Joon Hyeok's problems against me, Mother.
