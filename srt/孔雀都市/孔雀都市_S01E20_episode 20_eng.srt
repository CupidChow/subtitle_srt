1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,270

2
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:10,045

3
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,742
 The warrant is out.

4
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:50,186
 We won't get a second chance. Let's give them a show.

5
00:00:57,594 --> 00:01:02,123
Chairwoman, there is something you need to see.

6
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:25,089
Mrs. Yoon, you're under arrest for bribery, embezzlement, and violation of the act

7
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:28,058
on the prevention of flight of domestic property.

8
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:36,345
Mrs. Yoon, is your husband aware of this situation?

9
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,712
Is he aware of the charges you're being arrested for?

10
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:42,410
How do you feel, Mrs. Yoon?

11
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,550
 Leave the way!

12
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:54,162
We have to hurry before the reporters storm in.

13
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,697
It's him!

14
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:04,461
Director Yoon Jae Hee was arrested at the Sungjin Gallery.

15
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:05,763
Have you heard the news?

16
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,710
Is it true that you're not on good terms with Mrs. Yoon?

17
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,850
- Did you know or not? 
 - Please give a comment!

18
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,689
- One word, please! 
 - Just a moment!

19
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,100
- Are you involved in any of this? 
 - One comment, please.

20
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,590
Mr. President!

21
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:15,643
What is happening?

22
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:19,279
Wasn't the warrant going to be denied?

23
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,625
 This morning, Seoul Central District Court issued

24
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:54,104
 an arrest warrant for Yoon Jae Hee.

25
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:56,251
 Judge Moon, who approved the warrant,

26
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:59,429
 stated that the evidence for the charges

27
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:03,873
 are sufficient to put her under custody.

28
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:05,649
The charges for her arrest

29
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:09,744
 include bribery, embezzlement,

30
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:14,480
 violation of the act on the prevention of flight of domestic property, and

31
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,165
 concealment of criminal proceeds.

32
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:20,346
 Director Yoon did not request a pre-warrant hearing,

33
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:25,925
 and it is speculated that she might plead guilty for the charges.

34
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,826
Have you still not made up your mind?

35
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:34,706
Joon Hyeok.

36
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,347
What is the problem?

37
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:44,407
I told her I'd forgive her.

38
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:48,435
I told her I'd forgive her so we could start over.

39
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,493
Why did you?

40
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:58,465
Were you trying to use her wrongdoings to cover up your own?

41
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:03,139
It's not that. She did everything intentionally.

42
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,396
I only made a mistake.

43
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:08,918
There are plenty who have done the same thing that I did.

44
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:12,715
Why do I have to suffer when most get away with it?

45
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,194
I didn't know you were so weak.

46
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,814
For your own sake,

47
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:30,282
you should give up running for President.

48
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:42,696
Summon the referential witnesses.

49
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,598
Give Seo Han Sook a confrontation with Yoon Jae Hee.

50
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:47,672
If their accounts don't match,

51
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:54,017
request a search and seizure warrant and get everything in their secret files.

52
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,959
Yes, Sir.

53
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:01,265

54
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:03,912

55
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:18,328

56
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:32,982
 This has the list of those responsible

57
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:36,219
 for the Hyeongsan-dong tragedy.

58
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:42,385
 I'll let you decide whether to report this or not.

59
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:55,551
This is no time for golf practice.

60
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:04,994
We'd better stay on the low before we find out

61
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:07,623
which boat will be safer to take.

62
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:09,331
What?

63
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,373
What do you think will happen

64
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:17,813
if Cho Kang Hyeon takes a hold of the secret files of the Sungjin family?

65
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:37,716
Congressmen Min and Kwak are not answering calls.

66
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,722

67
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:57,222

68
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:12,526
 That "hope" you speak of,

69
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,797
 who is it for?

70
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:36,685
 Just because I'm a bastard,

71
00:08:37,502 --> 00:08:41,706
 just because I am my father's son,

72
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:50,165
 I've been the object of ridicule all my life, and that's how I know

73
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,002
 how it feels to be discriminated.

74
00:08:54,805 --> 00:09:00,217
 I don't want anyone to suffer from discrimination like I did.

75
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:07,082
 And that's the world I want to make.

76
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:14,495
 Joon Hyeok, let's not trample on other people's dreams,

77
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,752
 or pretend to know their pain,

78
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:20,296
 or take advantage of their misery.

79
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:24,122
 Let's stop living like that. Okay?

80
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:51,547
I think we'll have to brace ourselves for an investigation.

81
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:54,236
Cho Kang Hyeon is one of the dirtiest bastards out there.

82
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:56,337
If we blow one thing in our secret files,

83
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:59,102
his career will be ruined for good.

84
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:01,638
That might be a dangerous move

85
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:06,601
when we don't know exactly how much information Jae Hee has given him.

86
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:08,120
He could counterattack.

87
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,470
SVP Kim of the legal team advised that

88
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:15,206
it is likely that they accused her for more than what the evidence suggests.

89
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:19,656
They're probably aiming to expand the investigation early on

90
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:23,803
so that they can request a search and seizure warrant

91
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:28,508
or summon us as referential witnesses.

92
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:30,926
So Jae Hee is only the bait,

93
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:34,405
and they're actually coming after Mother.

94
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:42,625
In that case, she could pretend like they got her.

95
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,253
Let's go!

96
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,481
Daddy!

97
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,497
Were you a good boy?

98
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:04,700
Where is Mommy?

99
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:10,631
Now, say goodbye to your hosts.

100
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:12,491
Thank you for everything.

101
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:15,476
I'll bring Mommy along next time.

102
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:19,108
I'll see you, Hyeon Woo.

103
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:20,884
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

104
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:23,022
We'll get going.

105
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,580
- Take care. 
 - You, too.

106
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:38,821
Is it okay to let him go just like that?

107
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:44,059
His father came to pick him up. There is nothing we can do about it.

108
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:50,346
Stay out of their business if you don't want any trouble.

109
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:24,489
What are the reasons for your voluntary appearance today?

110
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,637
Does this have to do with Director Yoon Jae Hee?

111
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:28,685
Are you aware that the stock prices are swaying?

112
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,403
What are the reasons for your voluntary appearance?

113
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:34,588
Did Director Yoon tell you anything before the arrest?

114
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:25,111
I'm sorry about what's happening right now.

115
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,326
But of course,

116
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:34,026
you never loved your stepmother, so…

117
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:38,293
You know Jae Hee's only been using you, right?

118
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:41,706
I know she had to give your mother the choice over the CIO directorship

119
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:43,739
and raise funds for your–

120
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:45,855
Is that what she said?

121
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,044
It is true that Mother wanted control over the CIO.

122
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:55,583
That would help her handle higher government officials.

123
00:14:55,583 --> 00:15:01,233
Anyway, it doesn't matter who's the director as long as she's the one in control.

124
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,093
Don't you agree?

125
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:15,617
My wife had a phone call with No Young Joo the night she committed suicide.

126
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:20,397
I'm sure you already know

127
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:24,326
who No Young Joo was and how she died.

128
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:33,196
But to have a phone call with someone who'd been dead for a month…

129
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:41,201
There are not many that can arrange such a thing.

130
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:48,059
Save your wife and free yourself from the Sungjin family.

131
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:52,521
They never treat you properly as a family member, anyway.

132
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,715
If you help me take down your stepmother,

133
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:06,099
I'll persuade your wife so that you two can start over.

134
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:12,150
A stepmother is also a mother.

135
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,589
Are you telling me to betray my own mother?

136
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,513
That's low.

137
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,626
You're not doing all this just to help Jae Hee.

138
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,890
What do you want?

139
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,407
The secret files of the Sungjin family?

140
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:35,400
Have some conscience.

141
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,030
It's a real shame that you're using your dead wife's name in this.

142
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,100
- You little punk! 
 - Think about it.

143
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,039
Take the time and think about your decision

144
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,592
to side with Jae Hee and against my mother.

145
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,195
You'd better think carefully.

146
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:06,800
I'll ask again.

147
00:17:08,312 --> 00:17:10,853
Did you admit to Yoon Jae Hee

148
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:15,694
that you had ordered the murder of Kim Yi Seol?

149
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,398
Hasn't it been 30 minutes? Since we started?

150
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:28,921
Yes, Madam.

151
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:31,823
It's been 37 minutes.

152
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:36,809
I feel bad that your efforts will be in vain.

153
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,457
There won't even be a trial for this.

154
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:42,200
Are you scared?

155
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:45,717
You will lose Hyeon Woo

156
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:50,115
and be kicked out without a single penny for alimony.

157
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:54,420
You will also pay for tampering with the reputation of the Sungjin family.

158
00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:00,738
You've killed many innocent people to acquire your wealth.

159
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:05,198
And all of your crimes will be revealed.

160
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:11,309
Good luck with everything.

161
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,411
You'd better brace yourself.

162
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:19,606
You have a lot of trouble coming your way.

163
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,429
 How do you suggest I pay

164
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:40,515
 for having Kim Yi Seol murdered?

165
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,999
 To protect this family, I had Kim Yi Seol and No Young Joo murdered

166
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:50,368
 and drove Kwon Min Seon to suicide.

167
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:56,399
 I was also responsible for the deaths in the Hyeongsan-dong tragedy.

168
00:18:57,696 --> 00:18:59,596
 Tell me.

169
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:05,388
 What should I do to pay for everything I've done?

170
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:10,281
 Why are you doing this?

171
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:15,063
 Are you saying such unspeakable things just to pressure him?

172
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:17,617
 He wants to change.

173
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:21,088
 Exactly how and how much do you want to change?

174
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:25,566
 How will you pay for your own past wrongdoings?

175
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:30,325
 If my methods are wrong, then how are yours going to be different?

176
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:36,440
 You're not prepared to risk anything.

177
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,497
 You should remember that

178
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:45,056
 pointing out the wrong doesn't solve anything.

179
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:08,495
Myeongseong Industries should

180
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:12,936
back out from the demolition of Hyeongsan Area 5.

181
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:14,956
What?

182
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:18,106
You'll have to make five new corporate bodies.

183
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:23,606
They will be the subcontractors in the demolition and divide up the area

184
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:26,862
that Myeongseong is responsible for.

185
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:28,704
What do you…

186
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:33,193
Why would you make things so complicated?

187
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:37,215
That way, should any issues come up regarding the demolition,

188
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:40,356
Myeongseong Industries

189
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:45,708
and Father will be free from any allegations.

190
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:53,404
I'll get it done and report back to you.

191
00:21:58,122 --> 00:22:01,584
Why did you file for a review on legality of custody?

192
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:05,021
Do you think it is fair that you're being released from custody?

193
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,662
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

194
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:10,412
How do you think it was possible for you to be released from custody?

195
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,817
Is it true that you are not on good terms with each other?

196
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:18,739
A review on the legality of custody is a right protected by law.

197
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:22,780
Let me just say that it was the court's decision to temporarily

198
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,610
release her from custody after a careful review of her charges.

199
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll be answering any further questions at a later time.

200
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,127
Thank you for your understanding.

201
00:22:33,212 --> 00:22:35,320
Could you elaborate on the reasons behind this?

202
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,590
One more comment, please.

203
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,370
How can this even happen without me knowing?

204
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:56,450
You decided to go against the family.

205
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,010
And you know what we're capable of.

206
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,722
You're pathetic.

207
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,920
What about Hyeon Woo?

208
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,030
Where's Hyeon Woo?

209
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:17,670
Sir, are you rejoining Seo Han Sook?

210
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,713
Remember who you're talking to.

211
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:24,099
Why would you release Jae Hee like that if you're not joining them?

212
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:27,887
The accused filed for it, and the court approved it, not me.

213
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:30,749
You assigned another prosecutor on the case, didn't you?

214
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:33,050
So that I wouldn't find out.

215
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:39,317
Jung Joon Hyeok abandoned his wife and took Seo Han Sook's side.

216
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,290
That bastard's determined.

217
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:47,230
We can take a step back for now and wait.

218
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,428
And when we see a chance

219
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,490
to actually win, we can try again.

220
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:54,593
Think about it.

221
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:57,703
I might be dead even before the fight begins.

222
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:01,925
Then will the two of you fight them on your own?

223
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:10,000
Listen, Jung Ho.

224
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:13,097
It was Seo Han Sook

225
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:17,292
that killed the woman who was my wife for 25 years.

226
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,490
Do you still not trust me?

227
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:27,492
Hyeon Woo!

228
00:24:27,492 --> 00:24:30,440
- Hyeon Woo! 
 - Hyeon Woo is not here.

229
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,130
He's at the family home.

230
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:37,850
Bring him back right now.

231
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:41,350
He's my son.

232
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:46,912
Did you think that you could keep Hyeon Woo?

233
00:24:53,183 --> 00:24:56,089
You don't deserve to be his father.

234
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:57,631
What?

235
00:24:58,308 --> 00:25:00,973
Will you tell everyone that I raped Yi Seol

236
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:03,076
so you can keep Hyeon Woo?

237
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:13,308
You couldn't go that far. You're his mother.

238
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:17,297
So just keep quiet and wait.

239
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:19,320
I'll give you the divorce.

240
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:45,124
Stop, the two of you.

241
00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:47,590
We need to be discussing what's happening,

242
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,016
and what we're going to do about it.

243
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:58,004
So is Jung Joon Hyeok going against Madam Seo

244
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:01,522
in order to protect Yoon Jae Hee?

245
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:03,657
That cannot be the case.

246
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:05,600
Then...

247
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:12,306
Is Madam Seo forgiving Yoon Jae Hee to protect Sungjin?

248
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:15,797
Madam Seo is never so benign.

249
00:26:15,813 --> 00:26:17,880
But it is certain that

250
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,197
Cho Kang Hyeon has taken a step back.

251
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:28,020
So what do we have to do now?

252
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:02,405
Did you call for me, Mr. Jung?

253
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:05,118
Welcome. Take a seat.

254
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:13,458
Have you heard the news?

255
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:17,508
I did, about your wife.

256
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:20,380
How do you think everything will go from now on?

257
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:25,379
Well, my duty is to follow your orders,

258
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:28,980
- so I only– 
 - Exactly.

259
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:43,408
I need to find a solution to all this as soon as possible,

260
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,693
but as of late, I have been deeply troubled

261
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:51,402
and unable to focus.

262
00:27:54,499 --> 00:28:00,296
Since you told me that story between you and Jae Hee, you know.

263
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:07,448
That was… I only did that for you…

264
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:09,232
Now, listen.

265
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,747
If the wife of Jung Joon Hyeok

266
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:17,203
was sexually harassed by a former minister,

267
00:28:17,203 --> 00:28:20,070
wouldn't that be newsworthy?

268
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,338
Yoo Jin Seok pressured Cho Kang Hyeon to

269
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:28,431
conduct an investigation on Yoon Jae Hee, fearing she'd reveal the truth.

270
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,450
I think that will

271
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,602
make a nice story for the news.

272
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:36,480
How does it sound?

273
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:44,930
Please, have mercy.

274
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:48,700
Forgive me, please.

275
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,717
 Hello?

276
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,131
 Jae Hee.

277
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:55,800
Yes.

278
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:00,430
Is everything okay?

279
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,640
Yes.

280
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:08,410
Are you alone?

281
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:11,350
Yes.

282
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,017
How about Hyeon Woo?

283
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:24,823
Cho Kang Hyeon said

284
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:30,996
we'd better take a step back and wait for another opportunity.

285
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:36,806
I'm sure we can get through this.

286
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:39,853
Everything will be okay.

287
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,521
Sure. It will.

288
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:48,206
Everything will go as planned.

289
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:51,590
It is bound to happen.

290
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:57,015
In the end, everyone will

291
00:30:57,015 --> 00:31:00,143
pay for what they've done.

292
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,015
That has to happen.

293
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:15,899
The average rent nationwide has gone over 800,000 won.

294
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:19,606
The average rent for apartments has increased by more than 10% in a year.

295
00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:21,601
Get back to work.

296
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,663
This is an exclusive.

297
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:32,108
What is this?

298
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,921
Let's get back to work.

299
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:38,170

300
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,630

301
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:08,520

302
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:15,987
What a shameless bastard!

303
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,070
He's making his own son a bastard to cover up his crime.

304
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,731
There is no chance we can win against somebody so vile.

305
00:32:26,815 --> 00:32:33,710
That's why you should play along with him and get what you want.

306
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,428
The CIO directorship.

307
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:41,030
Will you let Min take it?

308
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:46,216
And who knows?

309
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:48,714
If you wait long enough,

310
00:32:48,714 --> 00:32:54,070
an opportunity might come along to beat Sungjin.

311
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,235

312
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:05,617

313
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:14,998
The media will say Kim Yi Seol threatened to reveal

314
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:19,518
your illegal adoption and demanded money from you.

315
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:24,804
Park Yong Seob, who murdered her targeting the money, will be arrested.

316
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:33,192
Luckily, there was a record that Kim Yi Seol

317
00:33:33,257 --> 00:33:36,225
was issued a check from the Sungjin Foundation.

318
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,779
I heard you told them to keep that record.

319
00:33:41,804 --> 00:33:44,223
You were going to use it against her, right?

320
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,880
Are you not afraid that

321
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:52,417
your lies will be exposed some day?

322
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,113
Were you afraid

323
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:58,754
when you adopted Hyeon Woo behind my back?

324
00:33:58,754 --> 00:34:02,570
Yes. I was scared.

325
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:05,580
I was anxious.

326
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,620
That makes you even worse.

327
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:11,097
You knew what you were doing was bad.

328
00:34:13,213 --> 00:34:15,425
You've trampled on other people's dreams,

329
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:17,811
pretended to know their pain,

330
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:20,360
and take advantage of their misery.

331
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,485
That's how you've lived.

332
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:28,740
And you won't just let everything go to waste, right?

333
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:33,110
Good for you.

334
00:34:33,915 --> 00:34:37,680
You don't have to be anxious or scared anymore.

335
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:47,449
Sign the papers. I'll send Secretary Go later.

336
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:53,123
It's Father's birthday today, and I'm going to attend the party with Hyeon Woo.

337
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:59,503
Do you want Hyeon Woo to live the way you did?

338
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:06,122
Do you want Hyeon Woo to suffer everything

339
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,229
that you had to go through in the family?

340
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:13,805
Will you…

341
00:35:14,884 --> 00:35:16,890
be okay with that?

342
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:26,260
I don't think that's your problem anymore.

343
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:30,360
Oh, and Jung Ho

344
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:34,036
will face an internal investigation

345
00:35:34,036 --> 00:35:36,588
for having an affair with you.

346
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:39,421
Just letting you know.

347
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:54,350
Oppa!

348
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:57,780
Hi, Eun Jeong.

349
00:37:04,511 --> 00:37:07,890
Hyeon Woo is here.

350
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,330
What's up, Auntie?

351
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:15,062
Hyeon Woo, how have you been?

352
00:37:15,062 --> 00:37:17,090
Did you miss me?

353
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,802
I missed you so much.

354
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:23,408
- I missed you. 
 - You did?

355
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,710
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

356
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:38,293
I've always wondered whether she's actually dumb or pretending to be.

357
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:45,236
Now, I see she's the kind of character that this family needs.

358
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:48,300
The innocent girl that believes what she wants

359
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:50,817
without a worry in the world.

360
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:02,250
You must think you're above everybody in the world.

361
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:07,252
Did you threaten him?

362
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:12,324
What did you tell him to turn him into a monster?

363
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:15,038
Are you blaming me, again?

364
00:38:15,038 --> 00:38:17,896
Why don't you just kick him out?

365
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:24,117
You've always hated him. Stop using him to your advantage.

366
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:31,499
You say almost the exact same things that Kim Yi Seol said.

367
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:37,632
 I asked to see you to make one last request.

368
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:43,921
 Jae Hee said everything's taken care of.

369
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,920
 Nothing's been taken care of.

370
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:51,486
 I only decided not to

371
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:53,811
 give her any more trouble.

372
00:38:54,903 --> 00:39:01,624
 To get rid of troublemakers like you from sight.

373
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:05,433
 That's how we take care of things.

374
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:10,994
 Look at the painting.

375
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:14,904
 How would you feel if you were passing by a helpless woman and her child

376
00:39:14,904 --> 00:39:18,105
 without offering a helping hand?

377
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:23,885
 At first, you might feel sorry and guilty.

378
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:31,570
 But the human heart is weak and cannot bear such feelings for long.

379
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:35,710
 Sympathy would soon turn into hatred.

380
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:40,907
 You'd find yourself hating all those like her,

381
00:39:40,907 --> 00:39:43,816
 who once had your sympathy,

382
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:49,918
 for giving you an emotional burden.

383
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:55,006
 You'd want them out of your sight.

384
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,710
 I understand that.

385
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:08,707
 That woman probably would, too.

386
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:12,680
 She'd probably understand how the passerby would feel.

387
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:16,905
 She'd be sad and hurt.

388
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:21,910
 But she'd also worry for the passerby.

389
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,816
 Just like I worry for Mrs. Yoon.

390
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:32,304
 And that's why I ask you

391
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,340
 to let go of Mrs. Yoon.

392
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:43,317
 She's striving so hard for her own greed.

393
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:44,927
 What can I even do?

394
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:47,192
 You're using her greed

395
00:40:47,192 --> 00:40:52,292
 and her desire for success to your advantage.

396
00:40:54,692 --> 00:40:56,690
 You fear that

397
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:02,115
 she might not believe you even after hearing your story

398
00:41:02,115 --> 00:41:06,330
 and never got to tell her about your past.

399
00:41:08,116 --> 00:41:11,870
 You have no right to tell me that.

400
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,421
 You probably don't understand what I feel.

401
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:23,920
 Because you've never truly cared for anyone,

402
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:29,020
 and nobody cared for you, either.

403
00:41:35,546 --> 00:41:37,892
 I'm asking you for the last time.

404
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:41,908
 Please let go of Mrs. Yoon.

405
00:41:42,796 --> 00:41:46,437
 If you free Mrs. Yoon and Hyeon Woo,

406
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:52,125
 I won't give you any more trouble.

407
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:57,420
She scared me

408
00:41:58,545 --> 00:42:02,103
with her words and her gaze.

409
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:05,934
But then…

410
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:10,310
Do you know how I overcame that fear?

411
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:13,888
It was you.

412
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:20,575
Thanks to your pathetic greed.

413
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:23,059
It is your vanity that makes you

414
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:27,085
pity your humble self while believing yourself just and honorable.

415
00:42:30,941 --> 00:42:35,042
And just as I had expected, you abandoned and mocked

416
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:39,111
Kim Yi Seol and her scars in order to protect yourself.

417
00:42:39,713 --> 00:42:42,862
It's not I, but you, who caused her death.

418
00:42:42,862 --> 00:42:46,017
Till the very moment she died, she cared for you

419
00:42:46,017 --> 00:42:50,883
and it was you who abandoned her.

420
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,720
The same goes for Joon Hyeok.

421
00:42:56,315 --> 00:43:00,607
I did not turn him into a monster. His own greed did.

422
00:43:07,196 --> 00:43:11,329
I see that you truly loved him.

423
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:15,118
Will you be able to handle what's to come?

424
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:21,019
Soon, you'll forget this feeling of guilt

425
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:24,015
and repeat the same wrongdoings of the past.

426
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:27,846
You'll meet somebody just like her once again

427
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:30,991
and toy around with her.

428
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:34,638
And when you're done, you'll hurt and abandon her.

429
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:38,647
You will continue to point fingers at others

430
00:43:38,647 --> 00:43:42,655
pretending to be just and honorable.

431
00:43:44,717 --> 00:43:50,120
As hideous as you are, do you still want to carry on?

432
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:30,100
I'll give one last chance to save your dignity.

433
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,625

434
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:50,297

435
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:52,899

436
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,114

437
00:48:02,106 --> 00:48:04,598

438
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,116

439
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:47,417
I'd like to begin with my sincerest words of apology.

440
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:53,125
I am a terrible husband for failing to understand my beloved wife.

441
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,116
My wife so desperately wanted a child

442
00:48:58,116 --> 00:49:00,408
and committed

443
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:05,626
the crime of illegal adoption, and I was not there with her

444
00:49:06,703 --> 00:49:09,207
to soothe and stop her.

445
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:13,710
I am at fault for this. I am to blame.

446
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:20,193
And so, I ask you to stop directing your criticism at her.

447
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:21,630
I ask you with all my heart.

448
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,052

449
00:49:23,052 --> 00:49:25,810
 I need your support so that I can

450
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,121
 rise up again and make a better world

451
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:32,271
 for our children, including my own, where nobody will be faced

452
00:49:32,271 --> 00:49:34,949
 with discrimination of any kind.

453
00:49:34,949 --> 00:49:37,540
 A world with justice and fairness.

454
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,788
 A world without discrimination of any kind.

455
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:42,165
 I can make that happen!

456
00:49:42,165 --> 00:49:43,899
 I will!

457
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:46,445
 And I need your help with that.

458
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:49,127
 Once again, I give you my sincerest apology.

459
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:51,847
Thank you.

460
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,970
What a bummer!

461
00:50:48,297 --> 00:50:51,388
Let's eat. The food is no good today.

462
00:50:51,388 --> 00:50:53,709
I'm starving.

463
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:57,506
What's wrong with her?

464
00:50:57,506 --> 00:51:01,118
Does she want us to bring her food or what?

465
00:51:01,148 --> 00:51:04,700
Maybe she thinks she's still a somebody.

466
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,278
- What is she in for, anyway? 
 - She shot at her mother-in-law.

467
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:11,457
Apparently, she bought her son.

468
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:14,580
She's not even human.

469
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,670
Disgusting.

470
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:19,589
What?

471
00:51:20,635 --> 00:51:23,520
- Has she gone crazy? 
 - What was that?

472
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,426
Do you want a good beating?

473
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:33,336
You bitch!

474
00:51:33,336 --> 00:51:36,360
Bitches like you don't deserve to live.

475
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,150
Just die!

476
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:41,508
I'll kill you!

477
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:45,017
Kill her.

478
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:48,860
More!

479
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,250
Hey. Hey.

480
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,720
Seriously. What's wrong?

481
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,836
- Miss? 
 - Hello, Eun Jung.

482
00:52:01,836 --> 00:52:05,604
When is Hyeon Woo's elementary school orientation?

483
00:52:05,604 --> 00:52:07,660
Next Thursday.

484
00:52:08,493 --> 00:52:11,211
I'm not sure if he has all he needs.

485
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,915
- I'll go up and see. 
 - Sure.

486
00:52:12,915 --> 00:52:14,970
Hyeon Woo!

487
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,604
Auntie's here!

488
00:52:17,604 --> 00:52:21,110

489
00:53:45,285 --> 00:53:48,905
Thanks. I'll call you later.

490
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,670

491
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,307

492
00:55:43,242 --> 00:55:46,907
Careful.

493
00:55:46,907 --> 00:55:49,092
What do you want?

494
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,900
Yes.

495
00:55:56,976 --> 00:55:58,617
Welcome.

496
00:55:58,617 --> 00:56:00,194
- Let's try them on. 
 - Okay.

497
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:02,128
Welcome.

498
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,100
Stand up. Stand up.

499
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,086
- Aren't they too big? 
 - I think so, too.

500
00:56:09,086 --> 00:56:11,633
Can we have a smaller size?

501
00:56:11,633 --> 00:56:14,351
Let's try another pair.

502
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:17,110
- Let's try the backpack. 
 - Sure.

503
00:56:17,162 --> 00:56:18,938
Let me see.

504
00:56:20,162 --> 00:56:22,880
- It's perfect. 
 - It looks good on you.

505
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,960
Wait a second.

506
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:28,420
It looks nice.

507
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,145
It'll look good on you.

508
00:56:34,902 --> 00:56:37,337
- Nice. 
 - Cute, right?

509
00:57:00,557 --> 00:57:02,130

510
00:57:57,423 --> 00:57:59,501

511
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:07,831
Sir, why don't you go have a meal and then come back?

512
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,389
You're always skipping meals like this, waiting for your daughter.

513
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:15,949
She'll be sad if she finds out.

514
00:58:40,463 --> 00:58:43,343
You shouldn't have waited.

515
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,230
But you came.

516
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:52,938
I know you waited for me everyday.

517
00:58:55,187 --> 00:59:03,508
What if I never came to visit you?

518
00:59:03,508 --> 00:59:06,957
But I know you.

519
00:59:06,992 --> 00:59:11,368
I know you wouldn't abandon me.

520
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:38,032
Park Yong Seob is having his third trial.

521
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:42,659
Will you come to testify?

522
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:49,040
That might make things worse for him.

523
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,670
Would anybody believe what I say?

524
00:59:56,872 --> 01:00:00,965
I want to bring Hyeon Woo back,

525
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:04,925
but when I think of how I wronged Yi Seol,

526
01:00:06,086 --> 01:00:12,772
I… want to leave and hide somewhere.

527
01:00:15,457 --> 01:00:18,704
Until the day I die,

528
01:00:18,704 --> 01:00:21,617
I'll stay in hiding.

529
01:00:22,717 --> 01:00:28,897
Then I wish I could just vanish into thin air.

530
01:00:28,897 --> 01:00:31,160
I wish.

531
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,669
I wish for the same thing.

532
01:00:34,409 --> 01:00:37,809
But we're the only ones

533
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:39,970
who can help him.

534
01:01:30,964 --> 01:01:32,837
I'll take that.

535
01:01:56,336 --> 01:02:00,069
- Hello! 
 - Hi, Eun Yeong.

536
01:02:00,975 --> 01:02:02,789
Can I please have two gimbaps? 
  (T/N: Seaweed rice rolls with vegetables, seafood, and meat)

537
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:04,915
Okay. Just a minute.

538
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:08,649
How are things going with moving?

539
01:02:08,689 --> 01:02:09,896
Not good.

540
01:02:09,896 --> 01:02:12,689
We're still waiting for the compensation.

541
01:02:12,716 --> 01:02:16,575
Everybody's suffering, I guess.

542
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:31,837
I just cooked these.

543
01:02:31,884 --> 01:02:35,150
- Bring these home. 
 - They're too small.

544
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,064
Don't worry. You don't have to pay for these.

545
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,797
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

546
01:02:40,797 --> 01:02:43,603
- I'll see you around. 
 - See you.

547
01:02:43,663 --> 01:02:46,197
Take care.

548
01:02:56,452 --> 01:03:01,038
I heard Yong Seob's having his third trial.

549
01:03:02,305 --> 01:03:03,966
Yes.

550
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:09,845
Don't stress over giving a testimony.

551
01:03:09,925 --> 01:03:13,018
I'm sure you'll do fine.

552
01:03:15,703 --> 01:03:19,216
You've pulled through, so I know you can do this.

553
01:03:46,877 --> 01:03:50,243
I'd like to welcome you all

554
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,570
to our new party house.

555
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:56,490
- How are you, Congressman? 
 - Oh.

556
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:58,203
Sir!

557
01:03:58,203 --> 01:04:00,040
Welcome, Professor.

558
01:04:00,992 --> 01:04:02,124
The night is young,

559
01:04:02,124 --> 01:04:06,806
so let's get started and blow our stress away!

560
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:09,495
Sir!

561
01:04:10,148 --> 01:04:11,993
Welcome.

562
01:04:13,837 --> 01:04:15,360
Good.

563
01:04:16,031 --> 01:04:18,933
Give me just two minutes.

564
01:04:23,436 --> 01:04:26,147
Hey, where are you?

565
01:04:26,147 --> 01:04:30,020
I'm dropping by the office for a bit. It won't take long.

566
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,952
I'll be there soon.

567
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:33,527
Okay.

568
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,960

569
01:05:22,063 --> 01:05:24,617
Do you work for the demolition company?

570
01:05:24,617 --> 01:05:26,025
What is it?

571
01:05:26,025 --> 01:05:30,804
Hello. My name is Do Eun Yeong, and I'm a resident of Area 5.

572
01:05:30,804 --> 01:05:33,634
I need your help with some tenancy issues.

573
01:05:33,634 --> 01:05:37,270
I can't help you. I'm not the boss here.

574
01:05:38,259 --> 01:05:43,575
Could you delay the demolition until we've gotten our compensation?

575
01:05:47,204 --> 01:05:48,711
Well, then,

576
01:05:49,397 --> 01:05:51,351
go wait in the car.

577
01:05:51,351 --> 01:05:55,694
I'll take you to my boss when I'm done here.

578
01:05:55,694 --> 01:05:57,457
Okay?

579
01:05:57,457 --> 01:05:59,231
Thank you.

580
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:24,861
Don't do this.

581
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:28,790
It won't help to ask them. Don't go.

582
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,164
Hey.

583
01:06:46,164 --> 01:06:48,510
I'm out for a bit.

584
01:06:49,248 --> 01:06:52,868
The key? It should be there.

585
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,468
Okay. I'm on my way.

586
01:07:31,263 --> 01:07:33,960
What? Where's that girl?

587
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:11,460
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Okay.

588
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,930
See you guys.

589
01:08:18,258 --> 01:08:20,617
How are you?

590
01:08:20,617 --> 01:08:22,930
I'm well. Thanks.

591
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:25,625
I won't have any problem working.

592
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:29,117
You're always so hard at work.

593
01:08:29,117 --> 01:08:32,782
You would always come in early and go home late.

594
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,895
This might be tough for you.

595
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:38,841
I understand you because I'm a friend.

596
01:08:38,841 --> 01:08:42,013
But the students' parents are different.

597
01:08:42,013 --> 01:08:46,838
There are a few that are not happy about you joining us.

598
01:08:47,779 --> 01:08:49,800
Will you be okay?

599
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:52,482
Of course.

600
01:08:52,482 --> 01:08:54,793
Thank you for the opportunity.

601
01:09:32,462 --> 01:09:35,079

602
01:10:11,634 --> 01:10:16,059

603
01:11:04,715 --> 01:11:08,546
Why did you say that yesterday?

604
01:11:11,122 --> 01:11:14,140
That it wouldn't help to ask.

605
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:19,746
I kept thinking about it.

606
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:24,566
I'm sorry.

607
01:11:25,128 --> 01:11:27,826
That was all I could say.

608
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:33,066
I was upset that a stranger found out

609
01:11:33,066 --> 01:11:35,709
about what I'm going through.

610
01:11:37,476 --> 01:11:41,620
I'm sorry I pretended to know.

611
01:11:45,126 --> 01:11:49,810
I was scared that I might repeat the same mistake from the past.

612
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:54,308
I couldn't help it.

613
01:12:00,336 --> 01:12:02,910
I also felt thankful.

614
01:12:07,544 --> 01:12:09,932
It put my heart at ease.

615
01:12:12,556 --> 01:12:15,857
I used to think it was all my fault

616
01:12:15,857 --> 01:12:19,170
that I have to go through this misery.

617
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:22,795
That made me anxious.

618
01:12:22,795 --> 01:12:26,991
When you told me that, I felt hopeless for a second.

619
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:30,670
But now I know it's not my fault.

620
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:32,463
So that felt good.

621
01:12:45,764 --> 01:12:48,956
I wonder what happened to the people that lived here.

622
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:52,475
I wonder how they are now.

623
01:12:52,475 --> 01:12:54,345
I'm curious to know.

624
01:12:56,602 --> 01:12:59,338
Life must have been tough for them.

625
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:03,118
Still,

626
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:07,552
they won't live in poverty forever.

627
01:13:11,586 --> 01:13:13,916
Things will change, right?

628
01:13:19,459 --> 01:13:21,582
They should.

629
01:13:23,092 --> 01:13:25,012
They will.

630
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:25,279

631
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:33,720

632
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:40,650

633
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:47,650
 Thanks to segmenters, 
 pilar_velasquez, kazumi_oka, nmelova, lari_sferreira42_336, kitty100

634
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:54,620
 Thanks to chief editor 
 lazarini

635
01:14:54,620 --> 01:15:01,710

636
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:08,700
 Thanks to page designer 
 jhnimm

637
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:15,580
 Thanks to all language moderators, editors, and translators.

638
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:22,620

639
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:39,160
