1
00:00:02,398 --> 00:00:05,660

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,240

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,010

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,400

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,150

6
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:08,870

7
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:12,349

8
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,359

9
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,854

10
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:14,281

11
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,901

12
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:36,632
Let's see how long Jae Hee will hang on.

13
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:42,634
Tell her I'd like to meet her tomorrow morning.

14
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:46,606
- She should be informed of this. 
 - Yes.

15
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:29,786
Yes, Mrs. Yoon.

16
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:32,505
I'm visiting my husband's family.

17
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,412
If you're available tomorrow,

18
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:37,964
can you work with me from the morning on?

19
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:40,410
We can also talk in the car.

20
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,424
We'll do the rehearsal in the evening so we'll have enough time.

21
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,821
Good. Thank you.

22
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,126
Okay. See you tomorrow.

23
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,818

Is this your thread of hope?

50
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:35,988
Don't play the sympathy card.

51
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:38,625
This is all because of your ambition.

52
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,183
You have a nice house and a nice car,

53
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:44,505
but still, nothing is enough to satisfy your dirty ambitions.

54
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:48,408
What's so dirty about my ambitions?

55
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,234
Do you want me to tell you what's really dirty?

56
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,104
Please take care of this.

57
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:08,016
We've got to stop bringing shame on this family.

58
00:07:12,794 --> 00:07:14,820
 Kneel.

59
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,857
 Get on your knees and bow your head.

60
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:19,604
 Tell me that you're sorry

61
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:21,904
 and beg me to help you.

62
00:07:23,914 --> 00:07:27,129
 And cry some alligator tears for good measure.

63
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:36,994
 Spare me!

64
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,820
 Spare me, Mother!

65
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:44,110
 I just wanted to live in style.

66
00:07:57,987 --> 00:07:59,614
 What do you think you're doing?

67
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:02,269
 If you'll use this incident to treat me like shit,

68
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:03,994
 I would rather die.

69
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:06,727
 I won't live like that anymore! No, I can't!

70
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:08,218
 Let go!

71
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,005
 Promise me!

72
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:12,421
 Promise me you'll treat me well!

73
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:14,094
 You're out of your mind!

74
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,729
 Or shoot me! Shoot!

75
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,611
 You're capable of anything, Mother!

76
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:21,721
 Let go! Let go!

77
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:25,073
 Shoot me!

78
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:46,184
What the heck is this?

79
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:49,284
Joon Hyeok! Joon Hyeok!

80
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,312
Joon Hyeok!

81
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:54,517
Joon Hyeok, wake up!

82
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,911
 Joon Hyeok! Joon Hyeok!

83
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:00,349
 Joon Hyeok!

84
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:21,221

85
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:32,307

86
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,416
How did this even happen?

87
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,691
A gunshot in the family home?

88
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:44,808
I know your mother has a bad temper,

89
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:49,030
but what have you done to set her off?

90
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,496
Seon Mi said it was just an accident.

91
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:55,084
Fortunately, her wound is not fatal.

92
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:57,115
Mother must have been outraged.

93
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:02,220
Even I am angry that she had to deal with Jae Hee's cheeky attitude.

94
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:07,209
By the way, Jae Hee will be touched

95
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:11,671
by how much you care about her.

96
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:19,820

97
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,640

98
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:28,302
Oh, they'll for sure be divorced.

99
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:31,606
Joon Hyeok is just as annoying as Jae Hee,

100
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:34,022
but he's still part of this family.

101
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:39,013
I'm sure you can make up a narrative that won't harm Joon Hyeok's reputation.

102
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:42,429
You know, the common divorce storyㅡ

103
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,883
Then have it ready.

104
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,804
Were you…

105
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,810
behind what happened today?

106
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:59,029
You accuse me of everything.

107
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:04,414
Why is it so hard for you to focus on your own live?

108
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:06,535
I don't wish for more.

109
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:10,095
- I've always said that's allㅡ 
 - Why don't you wish for more?

110
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,120
Shouldn't we be working together?

111
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,436
There's a limit to what I can tolerate.

112
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,974
I knew about your family before I married you.

113
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:25,516
And I do feel sympathy for Mother's plight.

114
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:28,721
And I can bear with a brother-in-law like Joon Hyeok.

115
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:32,924
I hate your father to death,

116
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:36,406
but I can pretend he doesn't exist and mind my own business.

117
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:41,411
Because of you. Because you're Jung Joon Il.

118
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:46,129
But I cannot tolerate Jae Hee.

119
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:50,413
Why don't you just turn a blind eye?

120
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:54,316
You're not interested in anything I do, anyway.

121
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:34,748

122
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,360
This way, Joon Hyeok.

123
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:45,831
Joon Hyeok!

124
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:54,614

125
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:05,297
Have you called the police?

126
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:07,920
It's only a flesh wound. It won't take long.

127
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,569
What are you thinking, not calling the police?

128
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:13,497
- Joon Hyeok. 
 - What? Oh,

129
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:16,252
you think even the law cannot touch the mighty Sungjin Group?

130
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:20,015
You don't have to worry. We will take suitable measures.

131
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:21,535
What?

132
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:24,224
Hey, Seon Mi! Seon Mi!

133
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:25,739
Yes, Madam.

134
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,374
Yes.

135
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:59,227
I heard she's in surgery.

136
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:01,001
She is.

137
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,248
You could have just let her go with some alimony.

138
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:05,490
Why cause such a commotion?

139
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,742
Don't you know what Jae Hee's like?

140
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:11,531
Or is it because of me? Or Joon Hyeok?

141
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:14,626
What's gotten you so sour?

142
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:18,990
You froze her assets seven years ago.

143
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,299
What do you have against her?

144
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:25,300
Don't blame me. You're always the one that complained about her.

145
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:40,524
So just hold on a little longer.

146
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,815
I'll see you to your old place.

147
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:44,829
I'm beyond grateful.

148
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:47,507
How will I repay you for all this?

149
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:49,522
Make sure you do.

150
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:53,107
I made one wrong move

151
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:57,006
and lost everything I worked for all my life.

152
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,548
I'm sure Mother will forgive you.

153
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:03,114
It'll take time, but you're family.

154
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,492
You know she's had some painful memories,

155
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:10,638
and how she's a bit paranoid and doubts everything.

156
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,501
And you stabbed her in the back.

157
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:17,127
When I gave birth to Yoo Ri,

158
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:20,526
she even demanded a paternity test

159
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:23,099
before she gave me Sungjin Apparel shares.

160
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,550
I felt so insulted.

161
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:29,623
She is indeed meticulous.

162
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:33,410
Had the world been as liberal as today, she wouldn't have let my husband

163
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,101
inherit the Sungjin Group.

164
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:39,102
She would have taken on it herself.

165
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:40,787
It's not any different today.

166
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:45,356
We still live in a world where nobody finds it surprising

167
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,200
that stocks plummet after a woman inherits a company.

168
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,884
Sure. You have a good point there.

169
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:56,640
Oh my. Do you want to become chairwoman yourself?

170
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,776
How would I dare?

171
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:02,185
It would have been nice if you had a son for just such a situation.

172
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:05,910
Look who's talking. What about yourself, Joo Yeon?

173
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:11,093
Jae Hee was only so confident because she had a son.

174
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:19,431
Mother requested that my husband adopt him.

175
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:22,688
Who? Joon Hyeok's son?

176
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:25,907
Oh my God.

177
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:18,291
Oh, Yi Seol. What brings you here?

178
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:25,002
 I don't know much, but it seems there was an accident.

179
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:27,155
 I heard she needed surgery…

180
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:31,009
Excuse me. What room is Yoon Jae Hee in?

181
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,286
What's your relationship with the patient?

182
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,980

183
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,290

184
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:02,098
I will be going then. I have to report to the chairwoman.

185
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:04,891
No need for that.

186
00:19:07,507 --> 00:19:09,014
Daddy!

187
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,474
Hi.

188
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:12,522
Let's go in.

189
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:14,063
Yes, Madam.

190
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,358
 I won't live like that anymore! No, I can't!

191
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:10,913
 Let go!

192
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:15,121
 Promise me! Promise me you'll treat me well!

193
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:18,495
 - You're out of your mind! 
 - Or just shoot me! Shoot!

194
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,035
 Shoot me!

195
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,307
 I meant every word of it.

196
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,122
 I thought I'd rather die

197
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:31,601
 if I couldn't live in style.

198
00:20:31,622 --> 00:20:33,756
 I knew that life wasn't so fair

199
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:38,219
 as to give everyone a chance to live

200
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:40,025
 with human dignity.

 Mom!

216
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:35,318
 Why did I feel sorry for her?

217
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:38,746
 I hadn't done anything wrong.

218
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:43,506
 I wanted to ask that girl who stared at me in sullen anger.

219
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:45,708
 "What did I do wrong?"

220
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,814
 I haven't done anything.

221
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,033
 Hey.

222
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,003
 You're not supposed to touch that.

223
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:56,423
 That'll change the sound.

224
00:22:56,423 --> 00:22:57,889
 Okay.

225
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,223
 Do you take piano lessons?

226
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:02,530
 No.

227
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,176
 - What do you even know? 
 - What?

228
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:09,401
 Why are you playing with something you know nothing about?

229
00:23:16,387 --> 00:23:18,691
 That's when I realized

230
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:21,879
 what indeed was wrong.

231
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:24,329
 Our father in heaven,

232
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:28,677
 we have before us an abundant dinner thanks to your amazing grace.

233
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:31,526
 We shall consume this food

234
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:35,389
 and act as your proud children in your grace.

235
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:37,792
 I pray you watch over us.

236
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,708
 Give us generous, loving hearts

237
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:44,595
 so we will help those in need.

238
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,285
 Give us a plentiful pantry from which we will share with our neighbors.

239
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,799
 And my dissatisfaction reveals your satisfaction.

240
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,028
 My poverty gives your achievements greater glory.

241
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:04,196
 My misfortunes shine light on your benevolence.

242
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:10,399
 My sorrows give way to my gratitude for the happiness you share with me.

243
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:15,614
 And my manner of speech casts light into your world.

244
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:17,996
 Don't be so offended.

245
00:24:17,996 --> 00:24:20,445
 As lowly as you are, you will be a Sungjin woman

246
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:23,125
 though just in the namesake.

247
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,666
 And this is what it takes.

248
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:28,253
 That's when I made up my mind.

249
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:33,120
 That I would not let myself live in squalor or darkness.

250
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,014
 That I would achieve success and glory by any means.

251
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:40,296
 Always remember this.

252
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:43,212
 Your husband, Joon Hyeok, is a bastard

253
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:46,516
 between a floozy and a driver.

254
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:48,804
 And you should be thankful

255
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:51,714
 that you were only allowed to set foot in my house

256
00:24:51,714 --> 00:24:53,834
 because of his humble origin.

257
00:24:55,301 --> 00:25:00,821
 Your environment will be different from what you've experienced until now.

258
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:04,814
 But there's only one thing you really need to know.

259
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:07,991
 Make yourself useful.

260
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:09,816
 If you do that,

261
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:14,333
 I'll see to it that you'll live a life without want.

262
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,098
 I decided that I would ever again

263
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:21,122
 rely on the charity of others

264
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:25,936
 or be an object of sympathy.

265
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,310

266
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,224
Hello.

267
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:22,908
It's me, Kim Yi Seol.

268
00:26:24,705 --> 00:26:26,871
Don't you remember me?

269
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:31,599
Oh, we met before

270
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,700
in front of the art center, right?

271
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:47,123
It's the prenuptial agreement. Please check the revisions.

272
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:51,797
If you agree, we will send it to our lawyers and make it official.

273
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,129
And this is…

274
00:26:56,386 --> 00:27:00,288
for the shares that are to be transferred to Master Hyeon Woo.

275
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,436

276
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:09,111
Mother, I will prepare Hyeon Woo's

277
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:12,539
proof of paternity as soon as I get out of here.

278
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,832
There's no need.

279
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:20,504
We're past such formalities now.

280
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:24,623
Take good care of yourself.

281
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:29,208
I'm glad that you're alright.

282
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:33,238
 I thought all my suffering had come to an end.

283
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:36,493
 Now that I had everything I wanted,

284
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:39,900
 I thought that I could live

285
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,715
 praying to God to give me

286
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:46,003
 the goodness and generosity to help those less fortunate than I,

287
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,087
 just like my father's wealthy friend.

288
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:55,948
But  how did you know she was here?

289
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,493
I went to the art center

290
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:01,590
in order to participate in a rehearsal.

291
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:04,516
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Yoon there.

292
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:15,030
Mother, we need to talk.

293
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,725
I don't want to repeat myself. Ask your wife what happened.

294
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:22,586
And mind your actions.

295
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:24,206
Do you understand?

296
00:28:38,397 --> 00:28:41,516
Thank you for everything. I'll show myself out.

297
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:51,195
What are you so worried about?

298
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:54,321
Do you think I've gone senile?

299
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:58,713
I'm glad.

300
00:28:58,713 --> 00:29:02,212
A girl who isn't scared to die

301
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:06,144
won't shy away from any difficulties that come her way.

302
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:24,676
Does it hurt, Mom?

303
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:27,733
No, it doesn't hurt at all.

304
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:31,101
So why do you still have the needle in your arm?

305
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:32,669
Don't you remember, Hyeon Woo?

306
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:35,655
When you were in the hospital because of a tummy ache,

307
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:40,390
you had the same kind of needle sticking out of your wrist.

308
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,700
Oh, that's right.

309
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,605
Do you have a tummy ache, Mommy? What did you eat?

310
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:49,031
Mommy has a tummy ache.

311
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:52,817
She ate something really big.

312
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:56,400
That's why Mommy has to stay here for three nights.

313
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,702
Jeez, for three whole nights?

314
00:29:59,702 --> 00:30:02,896
You can sleep with Daddy while Mommy's not home.

315
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:04,918
How about you, Mommy?

316
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:09,184
Are you going to sleep here with that lady?

317
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:13,280
No, she will go home to sleep.

318
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:21,405
I brought the things I thought you might need.

319
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:23,392
Please call me if you need anything else.

320
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:25,075
It's all right. I'm only here for a little while.

321
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:26,865
Who'll take Hyeon Woo home?

322
00:30:26,865 --> 00:30:30,213
I have to drop by the supermarket on my way home.

323
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:32,316
You take her home, Honey.

324
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:35,147
It's all right. If you could just take Hyeon Woo home…

325
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:38,808
Go ahead. I'll take him home with me.

326
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:40,634
- Are you sure? 
 - Of course.

327
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:43,399
Hyeon Woo, I'll see you at home.

328
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:47,512
- Don't forget about my chocolate milk! 
 - Okay.

329
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,827
Goodbye.

330
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:50,497
Bye.

331
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:53,789
Having fun?

332
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,418
Hyeon Woo, do you want to go buy some chocolate milk?

333
00:31:02,418 --> 00:31:05,182
- Really? 
 - There's a convenience store downstairs.

334
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:06,876
Why don't you ask Daddy to buy you some?

335
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:08,815
Daddy!

336
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:13,224
Oh? Chocolate milk?

337
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:16,340
Do you want to go get some? Let's go!

338
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,780
- We'll be right back. 
 - Okay.

339
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,216
Chocolate milk!

340
00:31:31,296 --> 00:31:34,278
Two cartons? Mommy won't like that.

341
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:35,805
Let's just get one, okay?

342
00:31:35,805 --> 00:31:38,398
Are you all right, Yi Seol?

343
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:42,819
You seem uncomfortable around my husband.

344
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,332
Pardon?

345
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:48,671
My husband has lots of female fans.

346
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:52,412
He was the most popular guy on campus.

347
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:58,423
All the girls hated me because they wanted to be with him.

348
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,328
Don't worry.

349
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:11,328
I'm not that kind of girl.

350
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:18,780
I am interested

351
00:32:21,988 --> 00:32:23,815
in Mr. Jung.

352
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:31,500
But I'm even more interested in you, Mrs. Yoon.

353
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:37,038
As I already told you, I wanted to impress you.

354
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:44,725
I'm interested in your husband because of one thing.

355
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:52,601
I'm just curious about the man that you chose.

356
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,399
That's it.

357
00:33:20,204 --> 00:33:21,285
What is all this?

358
00:33:21,285 --> 00:33:24,767
Mrs. Lee instructed me…

359
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:27,053
Where is she now?

360
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,236
First, we'll publish an article about someone abusing Propofol. 
  (T/N: An illegal drug used by the wealthy.)

361
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:37,835
Then we'll publish an article implying that it is Mrs. Yoon.

362
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:40,404
Then the Public Relations Department at Sungjin

363
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:44,596
will publish an article denying the drug abuse.

364
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:49,705
Afterward, if the two get divorced,

365
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:51,610
everyone will assume

366
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,083
that it's because of Mrs. Yoon's addiction.

367
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,485
Let's proceed like this.

368
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:59,165
- How about the chairwoman? 
 - I'll tell her.

369
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:00,880
Okay.

370
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,037
Mother?

371
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:06,310
I didn't think you'd come here today.

372
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,611
What are you doing here, Joo Yeon?

373
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:12,570
The exhibition will soon be starting.

374
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,920

375
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:23,907

376
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:26,462

377
00:34:27,706 --> 00:34:29,983
Unbelievable!

378
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:36,348
Chief Editor of the Hanju Daily!

379
00:34:36,348 --> 00:34:37,974
Yes, Madam?

380
00:34:38,782 --> 00:34:41,599
Chief Editor Choi Hee Joong!

381
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:49,525
- Yes, Madam? 
- Did you study abroad on a scholarship from the Sungjin Group

382
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:52,098
so you could drink all night?

383
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:54,763
Your lack of sober judgment makes me think

384
00:34:54,763 --> 00:34:57,319
it's time for you to quit.

385
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:00,520
How dare you do something like this without my consent?

386
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,598
I'm sorry, Madam. Please forgive me.

387
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:06,348
A daughter-in-law is nothing!

388
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:10,440
She's family only as long as she's married to my son!

389
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,150

390
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:53,530
How is the investigation into Sungjin Bio going?

391
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,397
Mr. Kim, the VP of Strategy is going to take the fall.

392
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:04,788
It's a sad fate to be a prosecutor in this country, isn't it?

393
00:36:06,518 --> 00:36:10,701
Anyway, if they pass the Insurance Business Act,

394
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,290
Sungjin Life will have to sell the Sungjin Electronics shares

395
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,276
that it owns.

396
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:17,453
What will happen to Jung Joon Il then?

397
00:36:17,453 --> 00:36:19,863
If Sungjin Trade can't buy those shares,

398
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:22,610
he won't be able to take control of the company.

399
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:25,356
We need to know

400
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:30,501
what Seo Han Sook has up her sleeve in order to prepare.

401
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:33,615
How are you enjoying the food?

402
00:36:34,288 --> 00:36:37,338
Think of this as your home and make yourself comfortable.

403
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:40,504
Tell me if you need anything else.

404
00:36:44,897 --> 00:36:46,607
Eat up.

405
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:27,603
 I've been thinking about my position in Kang Hyeon's life.

406
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:31,011
 What are you trying to say?

407
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:34,778
Now, draw the fins like this.

408
00:37:36,513 --> 00:37:37,460
That's good.

409
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,926
Hyeon Woo, are you happy now that you've had chocolate milk?

410
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,154
Yes!

411
00:37:43,154 --> 00:37:46,193
You can have a carton a day until Mommy comes home.

412
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:49,613
- Promise? 
 - Promise.

413
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:51,427
Hold on.

414
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:57,201
 I become Gyu Seong's mom and Kang Hyeon's wife, for a perfect life.

415
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:59,111
 Please help me.

416
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,738
Who is it? That woman from before?

417
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:06,447
Before?

418
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,522
Do you mean Kim Yi Seol?

419
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,855
Why?

420
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,815
I heard that she will be narrating the exhibition.

421
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:19,240
Yes.

422
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,508
She seemed really young.

423
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,607
She's different than she looks.

424
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:27,182
And she's not some young floozy.

425
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:29,921
She has a strong sense of ethics.

426
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:32,830
What's that supposed to mean?

427
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:36,322
Will you look at the time?

428
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:37,915
It's time to put Hyeon Woo to bed.

429
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:41,610
Hyeon Woo, say good night to Mommy. It's time to go.

430
00:38:42,897 --> 00:38:44,635
Good night, Mommy.

431
00:38:44,635 --> 00:38:47,761
Good night, Hyeon Woo. I love you.

432
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:52,317
Call me if you need anything.

433
00:38:52,317 --> 00:38:53,320
Okay.

434
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,960
Let's go.

435
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,502
 I'll call you later.

436
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:09,340
 I'm recuperating after surgery.

437
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:22,488
Honey!

438
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:28,209
Honey!

439
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,585
What does

440
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,195
"recuperating" mean?

441
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:46,170
Who said that?

442
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,710
I was texting Jae Hee,

443
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:54,112
and she texted, "I'm recuperating after surgery."

444
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,614
I know what surgery is.

445
00:39:56,982 --> 00:40:00,306
But what does "recuperating" mean?

446
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:06,454
That means that she's recovering her health.

447
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:09,821
But why did she have surgery?

448
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,198
I don't know.

449
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:14,329
Hey, where are you going?

450
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:18,790
I'm sorry, sir. I left something in the office.

451
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:57,925
Why did you come out? You could have used the call button.

452
00:40:57,925 --> 00:40:59,911
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

453
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:02,992
Please call me if you need anything.

454
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:05,170
Of course.

455
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:17,763
- Hello? 
  - Where are you?

456
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:20,180
I'm home.

457
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,292
 Is it all right to talk to me from home?

458
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:28,789
I don't see why not. I've done worse.

459
00:41:29,514 --> 00:41:33,690
Are you all right?

460
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,324
Why wouldn't I be all right?

461
00:41:49,504 --> 00:41:52,130
Were you with Cho Kang Hyeon?

462
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,192
Who was it?

463
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:58,124
Who did this to you?

464
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:03,336
 I'm the new CEO of the art center.

465
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:08,240
And I finally received Hyeon Woo's shares of Sungjin Trade.

466
00:42:11,082 --> 00:42:13,555
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

467
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:17,736
 Do you think it's just a result of my dirty ambition?

468
00:42:21,283 --> 00:42:24,814
I'm going to continue to contact you.

469
00:42:24,814 --> 00:42:28,550
And I'm going to keep asking for your help.

470
00:42:32,227 --> 00:42:34,855
I won't apologize for yesterday, either.

471
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:37,600
I've made enough apologies for a lifetime.

472
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:41,623
 If you don't like it,

473
00:42:41,623 --> 00:42:43,911
you can do what you want.

474
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:36,881

475
00:44:36,881 --> 00:44:42,830

476
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,793

477
00:45:20,793 --> 00:45:24,990
 It was nice seeing you. See you again.

478
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,633

479
00:46:19,206 --> 00:46:23,939

480
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,397
It was nothing.

481
00:46:31,116 --> 00:46:36,205
It would have passed if you'd just let it.

482
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,480

483
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,326

484
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:12,622
 Good morning.

485
00:47:29,408 --> 00:47:32,594
 It's nice to hear from you.

486
00:47:34,296 --> 00:47:35,809
Sunbaenim.

487
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:37,400
Hi.

488
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:44,082
I heard that tonight will be your final newscast.

489
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:47,799
I saw the article that you'll be the next Secretary of Civil Affairs.

490
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:53,604
People will write anything that they want nowadays

491
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:54,865
without even checking their sources.

492
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,535
And it spreads like wildfire.

493
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:01,608
People will only see

494
00:48:01,608 --> 00:48:05,607
what they want to see and believe what they want to believe.

495
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,482
Isn't that so?

496
00:48:10,835 --> 00:48:16,450

497
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:23,743

498
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,060

499
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:34,480

500
00:48:56,008 --> 00:48:59,986
Mother, how's your schedule today?

501
00:49:01,196 --> 00:49:05,187
We're having the rehearsal for the exhibition narration.

502
00:49:05,187 --> 00:49:08,270
- I can't wait. 
 - Great.

503
00:49:27,196 --> 00:49:30,635
Hello, Jae Hee.

504
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:34,932
What brings you here?

505
00:49:34,932 --> 00:49:39,330
Didn't you hear that the narrator has been changed?

506
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:44,968
Are you very busy?

507
00:49:44,968 --> 00:49:48,316
The opening of the exhibition is just around the corner.

508
00:49:48,316 --> 00:49:51,796
It would have been nice if you'd called ahead.

509
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:54,086
I see.

510
00:49:54,086 --> 00:49:56,889
I was thinking it was like old times, I guess.

511
00:49:58,191 --> 00:50:02,316
We met for the first time seven or eight years ago, right?

512
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:05,280
It's been so long that I can hardly remember.

513
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,800
I must be getting old.

514
00:50:08,481 --> 00:50:11,816
I wanted to talk to you

515
00:50:11,816 --> 00:50:15,222
the last time I was here.

516
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:24,813
It was exactly ten years ago.

517
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,229
I was in charge of protocol at the Biennale

518
00:50:28,229 --> 00:50:30,615
while you were at the Ministry of Culture.

519
00:50:30,615 --> 00:50:33,272
That's right.

520
00:50:33,272 --> 00:50:38,613
I guess my memory can't be as good as someone so young.

521
00:50:39,986 --> 00:50:45,208
You were quite old even then.

522
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:51,595
I was young and foolish,

523
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:54,997
so I asked you to put me in charge

524
00:50:54,997 --> 00:50:56,483
of the new artist's exhibition.

525
00:50:56,483 --> 00:50:58,402
Oh my!

526
00:50:59,281 --> 00:51:03,198
You certainly had the skills for the job.

527
00:51:03,198 --> 00:51:06,176
Why didn't you get it?

528
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:08,919
Isn't it obvious?

529
00:51:08,919 --> 00:51:13,009
I couldn't bring myself to go to bed with a dirty old man.

530
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,473
You even gave me your hotel key

531
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:20,514
to help me get the job.

532
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:23,217
It was quite unfortunate.

533
00:51:27,894 --> 00:51:31,920
I'm sure you're aware that you are no longer the narrator.

534
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,540
I'll send you an invitation so come back at the opening.

535
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:39,219
And don't be late.

536
00:52:36,604 --> 00:52:39,484
Hello, my name is Kim Yi Seol.

537
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:42,894
We will now begin the rehearsal.

538
00:52:45,901 --> 00:52:49,113
A painter but not be obsessed with the object of his art.

539
00:52:49,113 --> 00:52:51,374
However, if he does not struggle with the object,

540
00:52:51,374 --> 00:52:54,037
the painting will lose all tension.

541
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:58,827
Painter Sun Sang Gi was born on November 14th, 1945.

542
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:02,934
He was born on an island near Yeosu in Jeollanam-do.

543
00:53:02,934 --> 00:53:05,069
Due to his weak constitution,

544
00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:10,280
he only started elementary school at the age of ten.

545
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,329
But his talent was recognized early on,

546
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:16,532
so he attended both middle and high school on an art scholarship.

547
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,151

548
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:20,532

549
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:22,752

550
00:55:11,618 --> 00:55:14,651

551
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:27,896
Hello everyone. It's time for JBC News.

552
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:41,410
Yi Seol, I think this is just about finished…

553
00:56:00,826 --> 00:56:03,614
I was wondering where you were.

554
00:56:04,418 --> 00:56:06,715
What are you thinking?

555
00:56:10,803 --> 00:56:13,702
I'm just wondering about the people

556
00:56:14,212 --> 00:56:16,688
that lived in this place.

557
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,015
How about you?

558
00:56:24,016 --> 00:56:28,611
What do you think when you see this painting?

559
00:56:28,611 --> 00:56:30,586
I'm curious.

560
00:56:32,611 --> 00:56:34,709
It…

561
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:39,235
pains me.

562
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:41,976
That's how I felt from the first time.

563
00:56:43,819 --> 00:56:47,292
That white dirt road

564
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:51,915
seems to harbor a sadness whose tears have dried up.

565
00:56:53,405 --> 00:56:57,432
But also, it tells us not to be sad,

566
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:01,375
that someone is still here,

567
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,906
that people are still living here.

568
00:58:01,929 --> 00:58:03,807
Geez!

569
00:58:07,627 --> 00:58:11,582
That stupid girl!

570
00:58:43,004 --> 00:58:45,837

571
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:02,701
How about you, Yi Seol?

572
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:13,516
I just wonder

573
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,835
how those people are now.

574
00:59:21,506 --> 00:59:25,197
Those people were chased out of their homes.

575
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:31,332
I wonder where they are and what they're doing.

576
00:59:33,783 --> 00:59:36,695
Even though

577
00:59:36,695 --> 00:59:39,139
they might not even be alive.

578
01:00:49,586 --> 01:00:53,328
Did you find the person who lived with No Young Joo?

579
01:00:53,328 --> 01:00:55,612
We're looking.

580
01:00:55,612 --> 01:00:57,827
Hurry.

581
01:00:57,827 --> 01:01:02,126
We can't have another person that knows what happened that day.

582
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,423
I'm sure they're doing fine.

583
01:01:10,096 --> 01:01:12,330
They're probably living in some city

584
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:16,082
in cozy homes of their own.

585
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,397
That's what we should think.

586
01:01:28,294 --> 01:01:30,721
But for whom?

587
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,938

588
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:16,180

589
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:25,016
 I hide my weaknesses

590
01:02:25,016 --> 01:02:28,348
 and try to embarrass others by revealing their weaknesses.

591
01:02:28,348 --> 01:02:29,775
 That's how I am.

592
01:02:29,775 --> 01:02:33,720
 You look and smell especially good tonight.

593
01:02:34,775 --> 01:02:36,399
 It's just strange.

594
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:39,821
 We're getting tips about the woman in the video.

595
01:02:39,821 --> 01:02:42,555
 She is being blackmailed by the person

596
01:02:42,555 --> 01:02:44,142
 who used to live with No Young Joo.

597
01:02:44,142 --> 01:02:48,025
 It's unsettling that a woman is so vindictive.

598
01:02:48,025 --> 01:02:49,424
You're not like that, are you?

599
01:02:49,424 --> 01:02:51,553
 I punished her because she was mean.

600
01:02:51,553 --> 01:02:55,518
 It felt good… but bad at the same time.
