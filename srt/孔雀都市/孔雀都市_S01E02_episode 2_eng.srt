1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:14,190

2
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:28,157

3
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:30,280
What's wrong?

4
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,063
Hello?

5
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:37,028
What about Madam Kwon?

6
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:41,200
What is it? What happened?

7
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:04,504
You can't be in here. Come outside.

8
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:06,290
Come outside.

9
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,370
Please, come outside.

10
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:47,290

11
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:11,620

12
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:27,740

13
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:41,331
What is it? I'm busy right now.

14
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,129
Something has happened at home.

15
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,840
What? At my house?

16
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,963
- Where? Which house? 
 - We should go.

17
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:50,905
I'll explain on the way, sir.

18
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:53,874
Just spit it out!

19
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:11,284

20
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:14,070

21
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,883
What is this?

22
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:19,729
Hey! Are you blind?

23
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:22,418
Does this look like the same work to you?

24
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:24,807
I told you to watch for color separation,

25
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:28,002
and you give me something that looks like it was done in some back alley shop.

26
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:32,111
I checked the sample and calibrated the settings to match it.

27
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:34,350
And?

28
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,033
And this is the result?

29
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:38,413
I apologize.

30
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:43,540
Go show Director Yoon what you've done and have her take care of it.

31
00:06:08,396 --> 00:06:09,818
Sorry.

32
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:13,421
We usually don't let docents do this kind of thing.

33
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:17,326
I'll treat you to lunch.

34
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:19,297
Mrs. Lee has this place she loves to go to.

35
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:22,819
They have the best truffle risotto.

36
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,216
I could sell everything I own

37
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,644
and still not have enough to buy one of her shoes.

38
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:29,958
But food, I can handle.

39
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,308
I guess she really let you have it.

40
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,322
But hadn't Director Yoon already given the go ahead?

41
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:39,010
I just got caught in the crossfire, I guess.

42
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,435
Anyway, the director is out today because of a friend's funeral.

43
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:49,250
We can really take our time at lunch.

44
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:57,421
Hello? Yes, this is Art Space Jin.

45
00:06:57,421 --> 00:06:59,611
The Sungjin Art Gallery.

46
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:02,999
We'd like a courier, please. An art brochure.

47
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,882
Right. Right.

48
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,370
To the Sungjin Hospital Funeral Hall.

49
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,540
Oh, Da Eun.

50
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,383
No, I originally arranged a courier.

51
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:05,905
One of our docents thought it might be a little insensitive.

52
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:09,118
Oh, Ms. Kim Yi Seol. Kim Yi Seol.

53
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:11,818
Yes, I gave her the cab fare.

54
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:13,790
Okay.

55
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,724
No, I'll handle the printing.

56
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:19,210
Okay, thanks.

57
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:31,141
You're here.

58
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:35,050
This is a problem. What will you do?

59
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,033
Get out.

60
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:27,850
Come on, get out.

61
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,502
I said get out!

62
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,820
Now!

63
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,349
Why're we even here?

64
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,107
God, this boy.

65
00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:39,808
Even if it was only on paper, she was still your mother.

66
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:42,311
She's the reason you're not illegitima–

67
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,442
People need to repay favors.

68
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:49,693
Start acting like a human being, okay?

69
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:53,702
You're Cho Gyu Seong, the son of Cho Kang Hyeon,

70
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:56,766
and your father's wife, Madam Kwon, just passed away.

71
00:09:56,766 --> 00:10:00,199
What does that mean? You're a sangju. Sangju. 
  (T/N: Chief mourner)

72
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,880
Fine, then give me 50,000 won.

73
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,349
Why do you want money?

74
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:06,616
For bujo? 
  (T/N: Donation to the bereaved family.)

75
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,347
You little jerk.

76
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:09,665
Family donating to family?

77
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:10,860
Just give me 50,000 won.

78
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,310
Always money, just gimme gimme!

79
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:17,885
50,000?

80
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:21,819
If you see your father, bow respectfully.

81
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,482
Be polite toward his guests, too.

82
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,632
- One, two, three… 
 - God, you're stingy.

83
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:28,783
- Hey, hey now. 
 - Put my bag inside.

84
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:32,750
You little bastard. Stay right there.

85
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:44,610
If you aren't busy, shall we talk?

86
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,580
This is Mrs. Kwon's phone.

87
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,379
As Mother-in-Law, I need to be on top of these things.

88
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,386
Look through the messages received.

89
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:13,640
We have the password, so you can take a look.

90
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,770

91
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,533
At the top.

92
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:53,027
Yes.

93
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:57,805
A sex tape?

94
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:02,022
Is that why she committed suicide?

95
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:04,897
And you're sure it's Cho Kang Hyeon?

96
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:07,867
Who is the source?

97
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,529
What? Where do you get that from?

98
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,197
Speak some sense.

99
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:17,116
Whether it's assault or blackmail, you have to start with the facts.

100
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:19,195
What?

101
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:21,908
When have ratings mattered to me?

102
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,841
Station Manager, if you keep this up,

103
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:29,580
I can make things hard for you in the newsroom.

104
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:46,400
 Something happened at Madam Kwon's. Call me when you wake up.

105
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:56,993
Can you handle this?

106
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:02,110
I'll contact you soon.

107
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:48,502
You really underestimate your mom, don't you?

108
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:51,146
- The straps are also short, and there is nothing to show anywhere! 
 - It hurts.

109
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:54,445
But when I was at school I ran the 100 meters in 13 seconds.

110
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,354
You didn't know that until today, did you?

111
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:58,817
- Okay, just let go already. 
 - You little punk, you just…

112
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:02,983
You already take after your father so all you do is eat and love money.

113
00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:04,807
What's wrong with you!

114
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:07,045
Stop shouting! I won't go!

115
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:10,350
- Let go! 
 - You horrible little brat!

116
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,851
Sister!

117
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:31,580
Oh my god, why?

118
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:38,022
What a horrible life you had.

119
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:40,843
After all your struggles,

120
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:43,257
I thought things had finally gotten easier for you.

121
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,058
But now this? Oh, Sister.

122
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:48,012
How can it end like this?

123
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,315
Hey, get her out of here!

124
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:52,510
Sister, no…

125
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,416
 Just yesterday,

126
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:19,205
 you seemed strong enough to fight off a tiger

127
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:24,902
 so how is this possible?

128
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:27,013
 Sister…

129
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:30,315
Don't worry about us here.

130
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:36,030
Please just rest in peace.

131
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,649
Don't worry about Gyu Seong's dad.

132
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,926
I'll take care of him. I will.

133
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:46,709
I'll give everything I have. Everything!

134
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:49,109
So don't worry, Sister.

135
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:51,974
Leave it to me.

136
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:55,005
And you, Sister.

137
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:59,040
I wish you a safe passage into Heaven.

138
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,930
What a real shame.

139
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,590
You've been through a lot.

140
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,210
Sister, my poor sister.

141
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:15,804
I can't believe it.

142
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:17,101
Sister–

143
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,772
- Please go home. 
 - Ouch, wait.

144
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:22,419
Wait, who are you anyway?

145
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:24,941
I'm Prosecutor Park Jong Ho of the SPO. 
  (T/N: Supreme Prosecutor's Office)

146
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,112
Oh, so you work with Gyu Seong's dad?

147
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:31,231
Before he was nominated for Prosecutor General,

148
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,305
he worked at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office for years.

149
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:34,881
I will escort you home.

150
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:38,152
What? What's with this poor treatment?

151
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:42,541
Don't you have any manners? Why aren't you answering me?

152
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:46,485
You smarty-pants types always just talk around people.

153
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:48,402
Listen to others.

154
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:50,590
Attentively listening to others–

155
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,194
Yes, I trained under Director Cho.

156
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:56,321
Oh, is that right?

157
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:57,762
It's a pleasure.

158
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:01,491
- I will escort you home. 
 - Oh, I drove here.

159
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:04,778
But my son's a sangju, and I'm his mother.

160
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:07,630
How can I go home by myself and feel relaxed?

161
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,730
I'll bring your son la–

162
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,870
Fine, fine. I need the restroom. Just wait a sec.

163
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:20,360
Leave her. Go and take care of Cho Kang Hyeon.

171
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,708
Mrs. Yoon…

172
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:29,137
How did you…

173
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:34,890
You came to pay respects to my dear sister.

174
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:42,076
You sing well.

175
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:45,104
Oh, it's just…

176
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:50,215
It's a song my husband likes, so I got used to singing it.

177
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,927
Old habits die hard, right?

178
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,846
Yes, I know.

179
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:02,724
You sing one line and the rest somehow just pops out.

180
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,083
Old habits are very scary.

181
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:09,601
They always have a way of revealing how low class they are.

182
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:11,613
 Listen, Mrs. Yoon.

183
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:14,787
I understand how this looks. I see where you're coming from.

184
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,649
You think I have no business to be here.

185
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:19,704
But you know what?

186
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,405
Ever since I heard the news last night,

187
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:25,447
I haven't once been able to calm this pounding heart of mine.

188
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:27,405
Look at this.

189
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:29,362
Look at how much I've cried.

190
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:33,688
Do you see how my mascara's spread? See?

191
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:36,933
If I dry my hands like this

192
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:42,315
and wipe at it, it comes right off.

193
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:46,170
Don't go around intentionally looking for the worst in people.

194
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:52,222
As women, we have to trust each other.

195
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:55,856
Just thinking about how my dead sister met the wrong guy,

196
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:59,160
and how she went through hell because of it…

197
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:03,176
Stop crying, Oh Ye Rin!

198
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:08,124
You understand me now, don't you?

199
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,097
It's not like we're any different.

200
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:13,026
We're the same sort, you and I.

201
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:16,155
How Mrs. Kwon put up with you, I'll never know.

202
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:19,121
I'm tempted to kill you myself!

203
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:21,640
How dare you come here and cry crocodile tears?

204
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,780
But I'll help you snap out of it!

205
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:42,515
No, but… Jesus.

206
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:45,622
Do you think I'm some kind of punching bag?

207
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:48,412
Listen, do you think I'm the only one who cheated?

208
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:51,208
So you wanted to get revenge?

209
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,157
So…

210
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,991
is that why you did this?

211
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:58,022
You've crossed the line.

212
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:01,670
You had to send her over the edge and make her kill herself!

213
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,563
What…

214
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:14,322
What did you just say?

215
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:17,539
Kill herself?

216
00:21:20,117 --> 00:21:22,780
This.

217
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,090
Didn't you send this?

218
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,250

219
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,988
CrazyBitch2?

220
00:21:31,886 --> 00:21:34,332
 It's all quite awkward.

221
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,408
The people we asked to handle it–

222
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:40,604
Why don't you keep your sister with you at home?

223
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:43,218
We'll notify you when we make a decision.

224
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:47,888
Sister-in-Law, I was wrong. Please forgive me.

225
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:50,943
How dare you speak to me of forgiveness!

226
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,130
No Young Joo.

227
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,743
What? Who?

228
00:21:55,743 --> 00:21:59,796
CrazyBitch2, that's No Young Joo.

229
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:04,541
I'm… CrazyBitch1.

230
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,452
I was the one who ratted on her…

231
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:14,532
Sister said she'd take care of it

232
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:17,463
so I just left it at that…

233
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:21,880
Gyu Seong's father, he…

234
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:26,718
Will he really run for Prosecutor General?

235
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:28,632
Will he, Mrs. Yoon?

236
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:30,468
Okay, so…

237
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,362
This here…

238
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:36,013
Do you confirm this is Director Cho?

239
00:22:36,741 --> 00:22:40,208
He always had women. It wasn't his first time.

240
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,619
I always just prayed he'd never get any of them pregnant,

241
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:46,699
but he just couldn't get over this one.

242
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:51,227
It made me so crazy that I told Sister everything.

243
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:54,644
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

244
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:01,672
Mrs. Yoon, please do something about it. Okay?

245
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:06,368
Your husband and my son's father, they…

246
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,735
They're both in the same boat, right?

247
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:16,527
Mrs. Yoon, please help me.

248
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:19,841
Mrs. Yoon, please.

249
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,767

250
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:45,561
Vice Chairman Jung will not be indicted.

251
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:49,415
You'd better make sure of that.

252
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:51,705
How you must feel,

253
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:54,443
seeing your one and only sister

254
00:23:54,443 --> 00:23:57,658
lose everything she has in one fell swoop.

255
00:23:57,658 --> 00:24:02,027
What will you do about Cho Kang Hyeon?

256
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:06,510
First, we'll publish a column in the Hanju Daily,

257
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,572
something affectionate and sympathetic.

258
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:12,041
"Can we entrust prosecutorial reform

259
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:16,713
to a man with deep personal sorrows?"

260
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:18,779
Maybe it's because you majored in literature,

261
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:22,222
but you sure have a way with words, Madam.

262
00:24:22,222 --> 00:24:25,247
Mr. Editor-in-Chief, what do you think?

263
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:30,200
Jung Joon Hyeok would have to report on it.

264
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,441
These days, if the broadcast news doesn't get behind something…

265
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,846
the papers alone won't get very far.

266
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:42,396
We must know some police officers who have connections with the press.

267
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:44,233
Not like in the past, no.

268
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,960
There's been a push to clean things up.

269
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,424
People expect the police to be clean, these days.

270
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:57,832
They say it's for the public good. What can you say to that?

271
00:24:59,102 --> 00:25:02,815
Assemblyman Min, please choose another candidate for the director position.

272
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:05,940
Once you've settled on a candidate,

273
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,294
we'll support you in whatever way you need.

274
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:13,122
How will you take responsibility for this?

275
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:16,733
This all happened because you couldn't keep your house in order.

276
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:20,216
Women flying off the handle seems to be a family tradition.

277
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:24,557
She was so quiet growing up. I don't understand what happened to her.

278
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:27,810
Your family had nothing at all

279
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:32,102
until you got your law degree with the money from selling your sister.

280
00:25:32,102 --> 00:25:36,018
It paid your expenses when you worked as a prosecutor.

281
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:39,140
That's a surprising attitude from you,

282
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,834
who had his way paid by us for sixteen years.

283
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,422
What I'm saying is…

284
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:48,227
Your younger daughter-in-law should be called here for fairness' sake.

285
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:53,322
So you wonder how I'll punish Yoon Jae Hee, I see.

286
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,818
She'll be disposed of.

287
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:03,543
One doesn't keep broken tools in the toolbox.

288
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,122
Please give this to Director Yoon Jae Hee.

289
00:26:32,813 --> 00:26:35,979
I was sent to deliver it. Sungjin Art Gallery.

290
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,419
We couldn't find the shoes this time.

291
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:31,297
He always relapses like this.

292
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:35,129
Such a gentle man, why does he acts like that when he sees women's shoes?

293
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:39,224
But after you come to see him, he always improves for a time.

294
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,090
He doesn't recognize me anyway.

295
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,015
No, that's not true, even if that's how it might feel.

296
00:27:44,015 --> 00:27:46,015
I appreciate the hard work.

297
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:48,182
Make sure to treat all the staff, on me.

298
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:51,443
You don't have to keep doing this.

299
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:53,515
Thank you.

300
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:22,230
Why? Do you like them?

301
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:25,456
Yes.

302
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,586
They're quite expensive. You can't afford them.

303
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:33,627
I'm a judge, you know.

304
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:39,707
Not like the judges I know.

305
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:42,238
You don't have any money.

306
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:44,728
You put all your siblings through school

307
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:48,643
and even paid for their weddings, so of course, you're poor.

308
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:54,752
You already told me this. Don't you remember?

309
00:28:54,752 --> 00:28:57,919
Oh, yes, right.

310
00:28:59,054 --> 00:29:00,617
Still.

311
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:02,350
Your…

312
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,840
Your shoes, would you tell me how much they cost?

313
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:10,615
Actually, I have a daughter.

314
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,182
She's an art student at the University of Korea.

315
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:17,547
I want to buy her a pair for graduation.

316
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:22,817
You know when she was in middle school,

317
00:29:22,817 --> 00:29:27,104
I promised to buy her some brand-name sneakers but never could.

318
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:30,705
I still feel guilty about that.

319
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:35,604
It's fine, don't buy anything.

320
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:39,213
Shoes are just the beginning.

321
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:42,102
Once she has shoes, then she'll need a bag and clothes.

322
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:45,825
You really have to dress nice when you're selling art to rich people.

323
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,496
Otherwise, they say you have bad taste.

324
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:54,021
Why not make a bunch of money yourself?

325
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:55,496
You said you were a judge.

326
00:29:55,496 --> 00:29:59,916
Get wined and dined, get some kickbacks, get promoted.

327
00:30:01,706 --> 00:30:03,569
No…

328
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:07,805
You should have just married rich after you passed the law exam.

329
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:11,222
Then these shoes wouldn't seem so expensive.

330
00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:16,783
For such a pretty woman, you sure say horrible things.

331
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:22,308
Anyway, I'm a bit busy. I'll be going.

332
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:33,029
 Your father is a great man.

333
00:30:33,552 --> 00:30:38,171
 A judge for 30 years, and yet he stayed clean.

334
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:40,832
 I appreciate the compliment.

335
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,425
 I hear your mother went to a vocational school?

336
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:48,550
 She worked as a bank teller while he sat for his exams, right?

337
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:50,863
 You must have learned a lot from her.

338
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:54,597
 You'll know to support your husband.

339
00:30:54,597 --> 00:30:57,721
 You know Joon Hyeok was illegitimate, right?

340
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,322
 You don't hear that word very often these days.

341
00:31:01,322 --> 00:31:04,522
 It's considered discriminatory.

342
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:09,227
 Right, and they call unmarried mothers "single" mothers.

343
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:10,702
 Right.

344
00:31:11,358 --> 00:31:14,527
 Your soon-to-be father-in-law was once my family's driver.

345
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,083
 I'm sure you've heard that.

346
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,066
 I know that Joon Il

347
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:25,044
 was born out of wedlock,

348
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:29,785
 and you were forced to marry for the sake of your son's legitimacy.

349
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,411
 Let's call a spade a spade.

350
00:31:33,411 --> 00:31:36,183
 I wasn't a single mother, I was unmarried.

351
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:40,199
 I didn't choose it for myself. It was just bad luck.

352
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:50,424
 If you're worried

353
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:53,396
 that for that reason I might be disrespectful of you–

354
00:31:53,396 --> 00:31:55,189
 Hey!

355
00:31:57,992 --> 00:32:00,955
 You're a cheeky one, aren't you?

356
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:04,961
 I'm telling you this so you understand your position.

357
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:09,942
 Don't make the mistake of thinking you're one of us.

358
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:12,593
 You must never forget that.

359
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:15,138
 Your husband, Joon Hyeok,

360
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:20,541
 he's the child of the driver and some floozy.

361
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:24,616
 Still, because of Joon Hyeok,

362
00:32:24,616 --> 00:32:28,029
 you were able to set foot in my house.

363
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,621
 Be thankful for that.

364
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:44,200
 Found not guilty, ma'am.

365
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:54,177
 Your father worried a lot about your dowry.

366
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:56,621
 He helped us out today.

367
00:32:56,621 --> 00:33:00,425
 All parents have a soft spot for their children.

368
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:06,524
 Tell him I said he made a wise choice.

369
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,715
 A word, sir.

370
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:19,827
 How are you feeling about the verdict?

371
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:33,191
 It's not the life you're used to,

372
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:36,118
 so you'll find it uncomfortable.

373
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:41,102
 Don't overthink it. Just keep one thought in mind.

374
00:33:42,325 --> 00:33:45,521
 Be useful to us.

375
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:47,432
 If you're useful,

376
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:52,166
 I'll see you never want for anything…

377
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:57,424
 Integrity above all, right?

378
00:33:57,424 --> 00:34:00,711
 But you gave our relatives everything we had,

379
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:02,829
 leaving Mom to struggle.

380
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:05,641
 You were always so worried about tarnishing your name,

381
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:10,216
 you wouldn't even let her haggle for lower prices at the market.

382
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:14,696
 You couldn't even afford to send me to a cram school.

383
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:18,407
 So why? Why are you doing this?

384
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:20,524
 How do you think I got here?

385
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:22,840
 Do you know how long I struggled already?

386
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,895
 So…

387
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:30,002
 Isn't that the reason?

388
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:36,749
 I'm trying to repay that debt.

389
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:39,647
 I know it's late,

390
00:34:41,264 --> 00:34:44,924
 but I wanted to repay at least a tiny bit of that debt.

391
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:13,602
Pass, pass!

392
00:35:17,234 --> 00:35:20,334
Down the middle!

393
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:23,775
- Nice! 
 - Good one!

394
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,773
Nice!

395
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,073
Where's Hyeon Woo?

396
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:36,130
He's about to finish his violin lesson.

397
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,922
Mommy!

398
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:40,494
Don't run.

399
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,921
Why are you so late?

400
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:49,705
I know, right? Mommy missed Hyeon Woo.

401
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:52,532
- Where's Daddy? 
 - I don't know.

402
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:56,930
Every third weekend, Mr. Jung goes to play basketball.

403
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,825
Oh, you're right.

404
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,858
Mom, can I play games?

405
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,536
Hyeon Woo, I'm going now. You should say goodbye.

406
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,513
Bye bye. Be sure to practice.

407
00:36:06,513 --> 00:36:07,446
How many times will you practice?

408
00:36:07,446 --> 00:36:08,474
A hundred times!

409
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:10,637
A hundred times? Promise?

410
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:12,582
Bye!

411
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:18,217

412
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:31,910
 The customer is not answering the phone.

413
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,673
 Please leave a message after the tone.

414
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:41,805
 Mommy!

415
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:44,530
Mommy's in her room.

416
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:47,683
Mommy, let's eat.

417
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:50,155
Dinner is ready.

418
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:00,546
"Dinner is ready" sounds weird.

419
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:02,288
Why?

420
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:05,024
You're becoming a big boy, so you'll have to use big boy words.

421
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:07,990
It doesn't sound like we love each other.

422
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,804
Then you'll have to say it lovingly.

423
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:15,526
Mommy and Daddy are like that.

424
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:19,915
"No. Okay. Great." Then…

425
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:23,052
"Yes. No. Fine."

426
00:37:23,052 --> 00:37:25,912
That's what you say when you don't love someone.

427
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,676

428
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,573
I saw someone leave your house.

429
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:42,821
A young twenty-something.

430
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:46,027
Ah, Kim Yi Seol?

431
00:37:46,027 --> 00:37:49,977
She's pretty, right? Young and fresh.

432
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:52,077
Are you okay?

433
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,685
Did you come all the way for this?

434
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:01,121
Seeing as how there's little movement from the hearing committee,

435
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:03,641
it seems like damage control is proceeding smoothly.

436
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:07,576
Are you still secretly investigating my husband?

437
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:12,101
He has another woman, right?

438
00:38:13,897 --> 00:38:17,860
Nothing will come of it. Don't worry.

439
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:21,532
You must be happy.

440
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:26,098
Take a good look at the asshole you chose over me, right?

441
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,379
Yes, it's great.

442
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:32,415
The fact that I'm better than him.

443
00:38:33,046 --> 00:38:35,382
Serves you right.

444
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:43,118
It's not like I didn't know you were the better man.

445
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:46,712
Diligent, kind and faithful.

446
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,373
But…

447
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:53,108
Joon Hyeok had what I needed.

448
00:38:53,108 --> 00:38:55,265
Sungjin Group…

449
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:58,157
Joon Hyeok's protection.

450
00:38:58,157 --> 00:39:02,691
Born an illegitimate child, he still ended up with a silver spoon

451
00:39:02,691 --> 00:39:06,319
and given things we can only dream of.

452
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:14,701
Find someone for me.

453
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,773
No Young Joo.

454
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,027
It was the woman that set Madam Kwon off.

455
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,702
I have to fix it before it all blows up.

456
00:39:27,747 --> 00:39:32,185
Whatever happens, I'll protect my husband.

457
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:34,937
I need him.

458
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:38,551
Hey, treat the boys to something nice.

459
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:43,302
Thank you! Food and drinks on Joon Hyeok tonight!

460
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,030
You should come with us.

461
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,730
- Jung Joon Hyeok! Jung Joon Hyeok 
 - You go on ahead.

462
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:52,513
Jung Joon Hyeok! Jung Joon Hyeok!

463
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:55,390
Goodnight!

464
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:22,202
Did you wait long?

465
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:23,749
No.

466
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:24,707
Did you win?

467
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:26,876
Of course.

468
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,333
Let's go.

469
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:52,640
What do you say we take a little break?

470
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:56,049
So what do you want me to do for you this time?

471
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:59,713
I'll be here with you. And this will be the last time.

472
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:02,971
I knew it, you old art student types

473
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:06,502
need to come work this job, not us.

474
00:41:06,502 --> 00:41:08,635
What do we know about color?

475
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,200
Once we're done, I'll buy you some kimchi stew.

476
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,932
We'll have some makgeolli, too.

477
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:15,405
Got out early today. God, I'm hungry.

478
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:18,078
No way. So even though you're a bigwig,

479
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:20,353
you're telling me you still like kimchi stew?

480
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:24,198
Just this once, okay? Promise.

481
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:27,665
But listen, you've got it made now.

482
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:29,987
Why this daily grind?

483
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,317
Count your lucky stars,

484
00:41:33,317 --> 00:41:36,093
kick back and start relaxing.

485
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,524
Okay then, let's see now.

486
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:41,726
What does she think the problem is?

487
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:47,274
Oh, what's this?

488
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:48,598
Don't know.

489
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:53,578

490
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,560

491
00:41:58,587 --> 00:42:01,212

492
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:03,454

493
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:04,653
Well...

494
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:09,198
Burrata cheese salad, but with white truffle oil, please.

495
00:42:09,898 --> 00:42:12,957
Also, the asparagus should be lightly boiled, not fried,

496
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:16,413
- and pack the jujube separately. 
 - Sorry?

497
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:22,496
Oh, um…

498
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:25,693
The CEO of Space Jin, she…

499
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:27,513
Oh, hello.

500
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:29,116
- A burrata cheese salad? 
 - Right.

501
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,741
- As Mrs. Lee likes it? 
 - Yes.

502
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:33,210
I'll get that ready for you.

503
00:42:43,904 --> 00:42:46,026
Where's Director Yoon?

504
00:42:54,957 --> 00:42:59,411
- Is she taking the day off again? 
 - No, she's out at the printer's…

505
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:03,679
- Where's my salad? 
 - Sorry?

506
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,832
I asked you to get lunch.

507
00:43:05,832 --> 00:43:08,907
Oh, the docent, she…

508
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:10,502
She should be back any moment.

509
00:43:10,502 --> 00:43:14,519
How could you leave that to a docent? So uncouth.

510
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:16,219
I'm sorry.

511
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:21,123
I must have seemed busy like because she offered to help.

512
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:23,035
Busy like…

513
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:26,624
These people and their grammar,

514
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:28,752
working here in the arts.

515
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:30,139

516
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:35,698
Is she an art major, or?

517
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:43,246
What's this?

518
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:46,794
This was so complic…

519
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:54,024
It looks like our docent is a big fan of Jung Joon Hyeok.

520
00:43:54,024 --> 00:43:55,631
No, I'm not.

521
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,019
Why are you acting so angry? You can just be frank.

522
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,296
My employee shouldn't have asked you to do this.

523
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:06,679
Don't do it again.

524
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,738
Start with an apology

525
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:11,023
for going through my things.

526
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:14,666
What?

527
00:44:22,885 --> 00:44:26,282
How is it? Good?

528
00:44:38,598 --> 00:44:42,913
Tone it down. A little less yellow, a little more blue.

529
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,190
Okay.

530
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,015
 I asked you to apologize.

531
00:44:58,015 --> 00:45:02,921
You can't just go through other people's things.

532
00:45:02,921 --> 00:45:05,054
Isn't it common sense?

533
00:45:10,517 --> 00:45:13,518
I know what's going on.

534
00:45:13,526 --> 00:45:15,055
I must've set off

535
00:45:15,055 --> 00:45:19,755
your inferiority complex to make you blow up like this.

536
00:45:19,755 --> 00:45:22,199
Cut the bullshit.

537
00:45:23,705 --> 00:45:27,393
Apologize. Say you're sorry.

538
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:29,446
Don't you understand Korean?

539
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:35,366
You're crazy. How dare you?

540
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:37,158
Dare?

541
00:45:39,518 --> 00:45:41,927
- Who do you think you are? 
 - Hey!

542
00:45:41,927 --> 00:45:43,993
What's all this commotion?

543
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:56,698
You have to control your temper.

544
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:58,705
You're not an impulsive child anymore.

545
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:01,716
You should be calmer.

546
00:46:01,716 --> 00:46:03,696
We should teach Jae Hee a lesson, Mother.

547
00:46:03,696 --> 00:46:07,532
Her behavior is unacceptable. It's not just the incident with Joon Il.

548
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:10,945
I even don't know if she really considers us family.

549
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:13,916
You don't think she's family, either.

550
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:21,707
We're going to have you adopt Hyeon Woo.

551
00:46:22,536 --> 00:46:24,199
Mother!

552
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:28,846
People are so obsessed with sons these days, but to adopt one?

553
00:46:28,846 --> 00:46:31,196
That's embarrassing.

554
00:46:31,196 --> 00:46:34,287
Joon Hyeok isn't even Joon Il's real brother.

555
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:38,569
Running off to your parents' place

556
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:42,721
while your husband is being grilled by prosecutors,

557
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:44,927
and fighting with a girl,

558
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:48,316
who is beneath you in every way,

559
00:46:48,316 --> 00:46:50,318
that's what's embarrassing.

560
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:54,963
Looks like I'm set for another late night tonight.

561
00:46:54,963 --> 00:46:57,604
Hey, you're getting paid, right?

562
00:46:57,604 --> 00:47:01,369
There's only so much money you need.

563
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:03,467
And I'm already done raising my children.

564
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:06,444
I live for myself now.

565
00:47:06,444 --> 00:47:08,362
So how's your son?

566
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:10,762
- He's starting elementary school next year. 
 - Already?

567
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:15,165
Other people's children always grow up so fast!

568
00:47:18,918 --> 00:47:22,071
I've got to answer this. I'll be right back.

569
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,127
What happened? Did you find her?

570
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:33,772
Yes.

571
00:47:39,307 --> 00:47:40,370
But…

572
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,250

573
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,899
Hello? Why are you so quiet? Did you find her or not?

574
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:52,118
I'll turn off the stove. I have hypertension so it can't be too salty.

575
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:53,881
Okay.

576
00:47:56,197 --> 00:48:00,133
You think you found her? What do you mean?

577
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:12,156

578
00:48:12,158 --> 00:48:13,610

579
00:48:26,595 --> 00:48:29,948
Hey, it's the Station Manager.

580
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,760
Oppa! Here.

581
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:40,913
Oh god.

582
00:48:40,913 --> 00:48:43,285
What are you doing?

583
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,070
Gosh...

584
00:48:52,551 --> 00:48:54,590
 - The customer is not answering…  
 - What are you doing?

585
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,665
 Please leave a message after the tone.

586
00:48:57,665 --> 00:49:01,529
That jerk isn't answering.

587
00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:04,091
But he's right, anyway.

588
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:06,843
This alone doesn't tell us whether this is quid pro quo

589
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,204
and the video quality is awful

590
00:49:09,204 --> 00:49:11,701
so it's impossible to identify her.

591
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:14,407
If we answer it now, there could be backlash.

592
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,004
No Young Joo.

593
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:27,318
You heard about the Minerva Bar when you covered room salons, right?

594
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:31,741
That place where only the VIPs go.

595
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:34,533
You still think it wasn't quid pro quo.

596
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:38,557
Fine then. Let's say it wasn't quid pro quo.

597
00:49:38,557 --> 00:49:42,643
It was just a bunch of guys partying and having fun together.

598
00:49:42,643 --> 00:49:44,912
Nothing new.

599
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:49,644
But isn't it ethically wrong?

600
00:49:50,294 --> 00:49:52,416
What are you going to do about that?

601
00:49:56,221 --> 00:49:59,712
Geez. This is driving me nuts.

602
00:49:59,712 --> 00:50:02,363
Why can't he just answer?

603
00:50:03,304 --> 00:50:06,948
Joon Hyeok, answer the damn phone.

604
00:50:06,948 --> 00:50:10,213
She's a crazy bitch with no fear at all.

605
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:12,310
She's threatening to ruin Cho

606
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,210
if he still plans to attend the hearing.

607
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:20,766
The whole affair has ruined Cho's career.

608
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:23,530
So what's going to happen to Joon Hyeok?

609
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,690
Nothing.

610
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,898
He'll still do the news.

611
00:50:28,898 --> 00:50:32,280
Your wife is so nice to him.

612
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,907
Jae Hee, though, will go through a lot.

613
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:37,232
Will Jae Hee quit now?

614
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:39,707
She's full of ambition.

615
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:44,338
But she's no match for your wife.

616
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,855
Why are you acting so weird?

617
00:50:48,855 --> 00:50:51,582
The Civil Affairs Secretary is just the President's lackey.

618
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:54,723
CEO of one of Sungjin Group's affiliates is a much better position.

619
00:50:54,723 --> 00:50:57,602
But President, now that might be worth it.

620
00:50:57,602 --> 00:50:59,116
You're right.

621
00:50:59,116 --> 00:51:03,529
The presidency is what everyone wants.

622
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:05,542
What do you mean?

623
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:18,493
They'll report on Cho Kang Hyeon the day after the wake.

624
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:22,901
Yes, it's good of them to do it together.

625
00:51:22,901 --> 00:51:25,851
I'll have to talk with Jae Hee over a meal.

626
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:28,724
She won't be with us for much longer.

627
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,250
Stop.

628
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,224
Her. Enlarge it.

629
00:52:19,224 --> 00:52:22,001
Madam Yoon is in Hyeon Woo's room.

630
00:52:22,001 --> 00:52:24,255
Just leave her. She must be tired.

631
00:53:00,147 --> 00:53:01,836

632
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:09,621
 Tomorrow at 8:30 a.m., breakfast here.

633
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:12,980
 She wants you to return the key.

634
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,798
Yes, Da Eun. You have called quite a few times.

635
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:23,037
I dozed off for a bit.

636
00:53:27,136 --> 00:53:28,899
Mrs. Lee did?

637
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,052
And?

638
00:53:31,052 --> 00:53:33,191
What's missing?

639
00:53:34,933 --> 00:53:36,912
That must have been a shock.

640
00:53:37,996 --> 00:53:39,659
You have her resume, don't you?

641
00:53:39,659 --> 00:53:41,832
Can you send that over to me?

642
00:53:41,832 --> 00:53:43,926
Yes, see you tomorrow.

643
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,640

644
00:54:13,689 --> 00:54:16,934

645
00:54:20,813 --> 00:54:23,415
We're having breakfast at your parents' house tomorrow.

646
00:54:55,507 --> 00:55:00,998
All of this was brought about by my failings as a father.

647
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:04,380
I should have put my foot down about this marriage.

648
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,300
But at that time, I was doing my utmost

649
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,000
to protect my oldest son.

650
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,435
It turns out it was a grave mistake.

651
00:55:15,435 --> 00:55:18,475
Why didn't I know it was more complicated than that?

652
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,904
I should have known.

653
00:55:21,903 --> 00:55:25,716
Why are you alone? Where's the star of the show?

654
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,325
Has she not arrived yet?

655
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,607
She left before I did.

656
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,260

657
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:00,567

658
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:03,927
What's this?

659
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,813
A Cho Gang Hyeon sex tape?

660
00:56:05,813 --> 00:56:07,253
Wait, a sex tape?

661
00:56:07,337 --> 00:56:09,082
It looks like it was secretly recorded.

662
00:56:10,713 --> 00:56:11,860
Isn't that the Prosecutor General?

663
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,940
- It's really him! 
 - Yes, this looks legit.

664
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:17,230
What?

665
00:56:18,683 --> 00:56:20,589
Do you know anything about the leaked video?

666
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,259
Are you the one in the video?

667
00:56:22,259 --> 00:56:23,787
Do you know the source of the video?

668
00:56:23,787 --> 00:56:25,149
Might this be some kind of political plot?

669
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:26,716
Please comment.

670
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,120
Do you confirm your involvement?

671
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,043
Please offer an explanation.

672
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:32,022
A few words, sir.

673
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,923
Is it you in the video?

674
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,900
Prosecutor General! Please!

675
00:56:37,906 --> 00:56:41,016
Please confirm or deny your involvement.

676
00:56:41,016 --> 00:56:44,229
Oh, poor Gyu Seong.

677
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:48,648
Oh, hey! They must be crazy!

678
00:56:48,648 --> 00:56:52,023
You'd better not make any mistakes.

679
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:57,201
I'm not stupid you know. And I practiced all night.

680
00:56:57,201 --> 00:57:00,013
I am your father. Ah, no.

681
00:57:00,013 --> 00:57:02,979
I am that woman. The woman in the video is me.

682
00:57:02,979 --> 00:57:05,981
I didn't do anything wrong.

683
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:08,858
It happened while Cho was separated from his wife.

684
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:12,005
- Get a hold of yourself. 
 - Okay, okay. Wait a sec.

685
00:57:12,005 --> 00:57:15,504
Where was I? Oh, right. It was an unfortunate private affair

686
00:57:15,504 --> 00:57:17,779
but nothing immoral or tawdry.

687
00:57:17,779 --> 00:57:21,951
It's all simply a plot to block the prosecutorial reform.

688
00:57:21,951 --> 00:57:24,977
That's it! Bam, I'll nail it.

689
00:57:24,977 --> 00:57:26,443
Wait and see, Mrs. Yoon.

690
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,160
I'll make our Gyu Seong's dad the prosecutor general,

691
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,015
and we'll get your husband in as Civil Affairs Secretary.

692
00:57:33,015 --> 00:57:35,486
Just trust me.

693
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,349
I'll be right back.

694
00:57:48,496 --> 00:57:52,835
Everyone, please. I'm… I'm the woman in that video.

695
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:54,072
What?

696
00:57:54,812 --> 00:57:56,819
Is it really her?

697
00:57:57,504 --> 00:57:58,484
It must be.

698
00:57:58,484 --> 00:58:01,521
 Is No Young Joo dead?

699
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:06,468
 If she's dead, why is her SMS ID still active?

700
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:10,884
 No known acquaintances?

701
00:58:10,884 --> 00:58:13,441
 No one reported her death?

702
00:58:16,338 --> 00:58:21,005
 So she had no family and she's dead…

703
00:58:21,811 --> 00:58:23,898
 then who sent it?

704
00:58:26,823 --> 00:58:29,318
 Let's leak the video first.

705
00:58:31,613 --> 00:58:33,416
 Don't worry.

706
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:36,013
 I know someone who fits the part.

707
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,587
This person, and this person here…

708
00:58:38,587 --> 00:58:41,818
they were going through a painful divorce

709
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:44,988
and I had no idea they'd get back together.

710
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,519
So…

711
00:58:51,288 --> 00:58:54,821

712
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:18,140
An arrest warrant has been issued.

713
00:59:54,807 --> 00:59:58,513
 If you aren't busy, why don't we have a little talk?

714
01:00:22,772 --> 01:00:24,591
 Come to the vault.

715
01:00:45,453 --> 01:00:47,116
Welcome.

716
01:00:48,262 --> 01:00:49,896
You've got quite a lot of spirit.

717
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,866
No, I'm actually quite tired.

718
01:00:52,866 --> 01:00:55,369
An upsetting thing has happened.

719
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,724
Joon Hyeok has another woman.

720
01:00:58,724 --> 01:01:03,302
It's not the first time. I thought I'd get used to it,

721
01:01:03,302 --> 01:01:04,535
but it hurts my pride.

722
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:07,998
- Divorce would work. 
 - Hate that, too.

723
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:11,070
No, I don't want that. We won't do that.

724
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:13,679
I guess I've realized,

725
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,802
if you can't throw something out, you've to protect it.

726
01:01:19,287 --> 01:01:22,124
It looks like you're finally maturing.

727
01:01:22,124 --> 01:01:26,982
Oh, then it's happened to you, too.

728
01:01:27,981 --> 01:01:31,007
I failed to put myself in your shoes after all.

729
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,020
But Mother,

730
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:35,620
I have finally understood.

731
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:39,412
Unfortunately, I'm not quite as desperate as you are.

732
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:43,933
I don't have anything so precious to protect.

733
01:01:45,813 --> 01:01:48,333
What is it that you want?

734
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:53,134
Everything.

735
01:01:53,134 --> 01:01:55,185
Everything you have.

736
01:02:01,272 --> 01:02:03,818
Do you think you're capable of taking it?

737
01:02:04,695 --> 01:02:07,396
You'll have to help me.

738
01:02:07,396 --> 01:02:10,599
No one's just born ready.

739
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:12,630
How can I trust that

740
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:15,213
you have the best interests of Joon Hyeok in mind?

741
01:02:15,213 --> 01:02:19,083
If you're not interested in helping me,

742
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:22,091
Vice Chairman Jung Joon Il will be arrested.

743
01:02:23,242 --> 01:02:25,912
I called in a favor from Cho Kang Hyeon.

744
01:02:26,895 --> 01:02:30,187
That and I'll reveal all of his infidelities.

745
01:02:31,535 --> 01:02:34,218
If I'm going to lose it all anyway,

746
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:36,793
then why not do it.

747
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:49,319
So what shall I do?

748
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:40,300

749
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:54,970

750
01:03:58,496 --> 01:04:01,693
 So you think I was behind Cho Kang Hyeon's wife's death.

751
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:02,990
 Cutting her off–

752
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:06,937
 Seon Mi, that's not how you raise a dog.

753
01:04:06,937 --> 01:04:08,851
 Not satisfied with stealing scraps?

754
01:04:08,851 --> 01:04:11,699
 I'm not stealing scraps, I'm taking the whole thing.

755
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:13,490
 You stupid bitch.

756
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:14,810
 I need you, Kim Yi Seol.

757
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:15,974
 Do you have to go this far?

758
01:04:15,974 --> 01:04:19,123
 A child from an orphanage, how pitiful.

759
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:22,251
 You know what, though? I'm more pitiful.

760
01:04:22,251 --> 01:04:24,888
 I want to get along with you, Mother.

761
01:04:25,707 --> 01:04:26,386
 What are you doing?

762
01:04:26,386 --> 01:04:29,724
 You're just being greedy.

763
01:04:29,724 --> 01:04:31,345
 Don't, Mother.

764
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:34,427
 I want to live well, just once.
