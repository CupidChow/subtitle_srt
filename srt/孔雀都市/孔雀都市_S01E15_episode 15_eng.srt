1
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:10,346
- Good morning. 
 - Where's Yi Seol?

2
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:15,377
She said that she handed in her resignation.

3
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:17,861
How dare she!

4
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:21,823
I understand. I'll take care of it.

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,662
I came to Seoul last night

6
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,185
as soon as I heard the news of redevelopment.

7
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:34,636
People begun calling me about buying my house.

8
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,886
I made a $100,000 in a few days.

9
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:41,410
I'm going to sell the place.

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,032
So, you've become successful, Yong Seob.

11
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:45,392
You're the one that's really successful.

12
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:48,669
Your Art Concert was the talk of the town.

13
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:51,953
There were advertisements for it all over.

14
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:54,840
Well done.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,193
It's good that you used her.

16
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:01,771
I quit.

17
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:04,614
- I didn't start because I wanted to. 
 - Hey!

18
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:07,804
That was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

19
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:13,105
So, you won't get revenge for Young Joo?

20
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:16,982
I don't know about that.

21
00:01:16,982 --> 00:01:18,649
Can I even get revenge if I tried?

22
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:20,783
Then why did you quit?

23
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:24,320
Jung Joon Hyeok's father has stopped searching for the child, hasn't he?

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,591
So, all you have to do is play along.

25
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:31,160
Jung Joon Hyeok probably doesn't remember you or me.

26
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,998
He knows everything now.

27
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:41,340
He told me that I shouldn't act vengeful just because I was unfortunate.

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,730
What the hell!

29
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,680
So you just let it slide?

30
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:48,010
Find the child and show him the consequences of his actions.

31
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:52,949
He's dead.

32
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,354
Who's dead?

33
00:01:57,354 --> 00:01:59,307
The child you sent away for adoption?

34
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,708
I thought

35
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,544
that he would be doing well.

36
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,635
That's what I wanted to believe.

37
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:21,041

38
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:27,889
The child's foster parents asked me to give this to you.

39
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,698
They asked that you come alone.

40
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:33,356
The address is in the envelope.

41
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:04,240

42
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:21,537

43
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:25,021

44
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,981

45
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:36,833

46
00:03:49,214 --> 00:03:54,190
 It's 11:26 PM, March 14th. It's a boy, and he weighs 3.2 kilograms.

47
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:59,043

48
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:06,006

49
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:08,585

50
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:00,791
 I'm sure he's healthy and well.

51
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:05,241
 And I'm sure that his entire family loves him.

52
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:10,298
 Somewhere, the people who are raising your kid,

53
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:13,550
 will think of you every day

54
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,613
 and thank you

55
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,666
 for giving birth to such a precious child,

56
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,423
 even though they don't even know what you look like.

57
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:22,983
 Hello.

58
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,939
What are you doing here?

59
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:40,669
Mommy!

60
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,531
Mommy!

61
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:17,873
Hi, Yi Seol.

62
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:39,126
I prepared this place as Joon Hyeok's campaign headquarters.

63
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,188
But you never said that you needed one,

64
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:44,433
so I took the liberty of using it first.

65
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:10,159
Mommy.

66
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,566
Isn't Yi Seol coming with us?

67
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:18,701
Hyeon Woo, I want you to count to one hundred.

68
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,503
Why?

69
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:24,039
Just do as I say.

70
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,878
Jeez!

71
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:35,276
You said you wanted to leave.

72
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:37,719
Fine, you can leave.

73
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,692
Do whatever you want.

74
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:42,625
Mrs. Yoon.

75
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:49,764
What is it? Do you think this changes anything?

76
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,610
Do you think you've beaten me?

77
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,842
Not at all, think again.

78
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:57,015
Hyeon Woo is my son.

79
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:01,518
Get that through your head.

80
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:05,180
I won't forgive you if you try anything funny.

81
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,581
You already gave up your child,

82
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,758
and you've been doing fine without him.

83
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,451
And you thought he was dead.

84
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,456
So, just keep thinking that

85
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:18,160
since nothing has changed at all.

86
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,347
Were you

87
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:15,483
behind this plot?

88
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:19,788
I wouldn't exactly call it a plot.

89
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:24,809
How much do you know?

90
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:28,030
What in the world happened to make you like this?

91
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:32,512
You must not want to tell me.

92
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:37,339
So, how would I know anything when you won't tell me?

93
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,021
I just cleaned up the mess

94
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:43,446
created by thoughtless and irresponsible people.

95
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,866
Talk to Jae Hee

96
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:48,250
and work it out with her.

97
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:30,620
Joon Hyeok.

98
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,610
What are you so engrossed in?

99
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:36,876
- Take a look at this. 
 - What is it?

100
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,703
After the report on Minister Park,

101
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:43,488
I've been researching the real estate investments of government officials.

102
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:46,059
No Jin Yeong, Minister Park's brother-in-law,

103
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:49,013
and his sister, Minister Park's wife

104
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,029
have been buying up properties

105
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:53,850
in Yi Seol's neighborhood

106
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,121
which has also been slated for redevelopment.

107
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:59,978
I looked into it and it's true.

108
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:02,255
He's resigning because of a real estate scandal,

109
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,937
but he's still buying real estate.

110
00:12:03,937 --> 00:12:06,212
- What about these documents in the back? 
 - Well…

111
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:10,089
you always told me that a reporter's hunch can't be the news

112
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:14,294
but it can help you uncover the news, so I kept on digging.

113
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:15,905
Okay, and?

114
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:18,418
And I found some more interesting things

115
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:22,010
connected with Sungjin Trade.

116
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,283
Kwak Ki Hwan purchased real estate

117
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:27,073
in the area in Hyeongsan-dong where the incident occurred 7 years ago

118
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:29,649
and made quite a hefty profit.

119
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,154
Then, Min Seong Sik…

120
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:04,555
 Why don't you mourn the death

121
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:06,470
 of your poor child?

122
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,126
 It's hard to live in poverty with nothing to your name, isn't it?

123
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:13,796
 You can't protect the people you cherish.

124
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 Your child may have died

125
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:19,635
 in the arms of strangers.

126
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:23,305
 But mine enjoys a happy life

127
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:26,290
 in the safety of his home just because he's mine.

128
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,885
 That's why I put up with Joon Hyeok.

129
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:31,609
 Do you understand?

130
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,606
I think we should reorganize the task force.

131
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,090
I don't like the fact that

132
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,929
Min Seong Sik and Kwak Ki Hwan are under Mother's influence.

133
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:12,440
Why don't we choose people who don't have such questionable morality?

134
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:15,875
Where can we find such people?

135
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:19,360
Bring them to me, so I can see them.

136
00:14:21,782 --> 00:14:24,333
This is all your fault.

137
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,143
You shouldn't have involved Dong Min in this.

138
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:33,091
Didn't I tell you? He's a dangerous idealist.

139
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:38,497
You made him into a big shot.

140
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:40,749
So, for his new report,

141
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:44,978
he's investigating the real estate investments of government officials.

142
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:48,810
The presidential election is right around the corner.

143
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,511
He has no idea of the kind of uproar he'll cause for crying out loud.

144
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:56,629
You really think he doesn't know?

145
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,242
He just wants to be successful

146
00:14:59,242 --> 00:15:02,822
like any other human being. Just like you and me.

147
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:05,074
But that's the problem.

148
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:08,043
He doesn't know his place.

149
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:11,447
Everyone has his place and station in life.

150
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:14,983
Mother treated me like that, so I stabbed her in the back.

151
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:18,509
She said, "How dare you!"

152
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:20,987
She disregarded me, thinking that I should be satisfied

153
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:24,426
with what little she gave me.

154
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:28,263
You should've gotten over your inferiority complex by now.

155
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:26,659
- Mommy… 
 - Don't come any closer!

156
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:30,052
Stay there.

157
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,902

158
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:34,474
I thought that you were aware that I owned the piece.

159
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:39,209
I asked myself, what could your motive be

160
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:43,558
for placing an advertisement looking for work?

161
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:46,172
Were you trying to reconcile with me

162
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:48,570
or trying to force me to donate it?

163
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:53,297
I was puzzling over this

164
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:56,980
when this unpleasantness occurred.

165
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,701
I'm sorry.

166
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:04,279
Thank you for telling us about it.

167
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,790
Think nothing of it.

168
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:09,944
You and I are both working to advance Korean art.

169
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:13,985
But the fact that a place like

170
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:17,178
the Sungjing Gallery couldn't detect a fake artwork

171
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:19,548
should be a concern

172
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:23,697
for all of us that work in the world of art.

173
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:35,509
I apologize for not being more careful.

174
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:37,911
However,

175
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:42,786
I can't be sure that your work, Professor Yoo, is real, either.

176
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,543
We'll ask the person who donated the piece about how he came to acquire it

177
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:58,600
and if we deem it necessary, we'll have a panel of experts authenticate it.

178
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:20,293
Bring me the acquisition form for the work by Son Sangki.

179
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,617
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,290
Hello.

181
00:20:34,054 --> 00:20:36,884
Did you meet the foster parents?

182
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:39,398
Also, is the child in a cemetery?

183
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:43,620
Give me the number of your boss.

184
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,720
Look at you. I told you it's too dangerous.

185
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:51,140
I thought that he gave you money

186
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,403
when you brought him Young Joo's laptop?

187
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:54,984
You said he was worried

188
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:58,507
other clients could find out that Cho Kang Hyeon's video was leaked.

189
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:03,297
You said that it didn't seem like he killed Young Joo.

190
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:05,648
So, why are you saying he's dangerous?

191
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:07,125
I also told you that

192
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:11,289
they're not the kind of people we can stand up against.

193
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:18,778
When I stole Jung Joon Hyeok's video and gave it to Yoo Jin Seok,

194
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,200
I almost got killed.

195
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,292
My little boss caught me, and I went to the house.

196
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:28,535
I told you I had a big boss who's a woman, remember?

197
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:31,689
And she was at that house.

198
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:35,809
She seemed very close with Jung Joon Hyeok's adopted mother.

199
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,270
Think about it.

200
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,887
I know she owns a bar for VIPs,

201
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:45,615
but how many bar owners are close with billionaires?

202
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:48,198
Jung Joon Hyeok's adopted mother…

203
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,479
Chairwoman Seo Han Sook?

204
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,620
So, your big boss is close with the chairwoman?

205
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,237
That's right.

206
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:57,090
They seemed to be real close.

207
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:01,946
So you should forget about everything.

208
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,465
Yi Seol, let's go visit your child.

209
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:11,865
Look at me. I'm wearing new clothes to visit my nephew at his grave.

210
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:16,349
My son is alive.

211
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,280
What?

212
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,320

213
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,693
 The number you dialed is no longer in service.

214
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,309
It's all fake.

215
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:37,566
None of the phone numbers work.

216
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:40,396
Should we call the police?

217
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:56,124
- Take care. 
 - Bye.

218
00:22:56,124 --> 00:23:00,132
I hope our next meeting will be more pleasant.

219
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:21,638
 Here's the number, but be extra careful.

220
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,580

221
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,450
What brings you here?

222
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,576
I'm here to see Mrs. Yoon.

223
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,745
Is something wrong?

224
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:34,768
I have something important to discuss with you about Hyeon Woo.

225
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:39,376
There's nothing to discuss about him.

226
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:43,399
And even if there were something to discuss,

227
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,899
what right do you have

228
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,830
to bring it up with me, Hyeon Woo's mother?

229
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:50,543
You're right.

230
00:24:50,543 --> 00:24:52,635
I don't have the right.

231
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:56,380
I already abandoned my child

232
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,199
seven years ago because of money.

233
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:04,105
However, I can't let the child I gave birth to

234
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:07,718
live under the same roof as Jung Joon Hyeok.

235
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:15,714
So, what do you want me to do?

236
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:21,273
- You and I were used during Hyeon Woo's adoption. 
 - No.

237
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:23,092
I'm the victim.

238
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:28,100
You, Joon Hyeok, and Chairwoman Seo caused this problem.

239
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,915
Hyeon Woo and I are the victims.

240
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:33,606
I didn't even know that

241
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:37,340
and was wracked with guilt about secretly adopting a son.

242
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,380
So I did my utmost to love and care for Hyeon Woo.

243
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:46,056
My only wrongdoing

244
00:25:46,056 --> 00:25:49,960
was to show you my sympathy and generosity.

245
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,407
I thought your sad story

246
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:56,290
somehow guaranteed that you were a good person.

247
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,460
Right.

248
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:04,908
This is the reason I got involved with the fake artwork.

249
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:11,216
I was so taken by the offer to sell us the work for a nominal price

250
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:15,016
that I trusted a person I'd never seen in my life.

251
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:20,788
If you ever play the victim in front of me again,

252
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,620
I won't let it slide.

253
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:28,435
Then don't.

254
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:30,730
Don't just talk.

255
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:37,381
Just do it.

256
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:38,601
How dare you!

257
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:41,103
You don't even have the courage.

258
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:49,343
Do you think it's because I'm scared of you?

259
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:52,120
It's because I don't want to hurt Hyeon Woo.

260
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,310
I don't want to do anything to hurt my son.

261
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,557
That's why I'm doing my best to be patient.

262
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,346
So don't anger me anymore.

263
00:27:05,187 --> 00:27:08,049
The moment I reach the limit of my patience,

264
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:11,790
there's no telling what I am capable of doing.

265
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:52,249
You must take responsibility for this incident.

266
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,289
You should quit your post as CEO of the gallery.

267
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,196
And if you can't bear it,

268
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:05,870
you can get a divorce.

269
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,315
I'll give you a handsome alimony since you did

270
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:12,490
such an excellent job raising Hyeon Woo.

271
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,116
Right.

272
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:18,094
You're a human, too.

273
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:21,008
So you do have a conscience.

274
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:24,998
But you can't make a decision right away.

275
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:27,428
I'll give you a few days

276
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:30,259
so give it some careful thought.

277
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:32,720
Thank you, Mother.

278
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:37,212
I no longer have to feel guilty

279
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:43,190
for secretly adopting a son without you knowing.

280
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:47,103
But I can't quit being CEO.

281
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:50,051
Nothing is going to change.

282
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:52,996
Hyeon Woo is still my son.

283
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:55,058
I am still the CEO of the Sungjin Cultural Foundation

284
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:57,691
and director of Sungjin Gallery.

285
00:28:57,691 --> 00:29:01,867
And my husband, Joon Hyeok is still the future president.

286
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,477
Mother,

287
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:07,991
all you have to do is help us the best you can, just as you promised.

288
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:10,317
I'm going to keep my eye on you.

289
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,708
If you keep your promise to help,

290
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:18,089
I'll forgive you for deceiving me until now.

291
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:23,291
Don't you want to make the son

292
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:28,264
you gave birth to out of wedlock into the Chairman of the Sungjin Group?

293
00:30:15,873 --> 00:30:19,717
- You should take better care of your mother. 
 - Yes, Father.

294
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,190
And keep better control of your wife.

295
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:27,935
- Okay. 
 - How dare she talk about divorce?

296
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,706
Do you know what your mother went through

297
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:33,040
by merely choosing to give birth of you?

298
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,040
I'd rather not hear

299
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:39,240
that story.

300
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,002
You won't let me return home? Why are you being like this?

301
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:49,115
Mother?

302
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,180
Dad, that's not my fault.

303
00:30:56,363 --> 00:30:59,385
I can't bear it anymore!

304
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:03,830
You can't hold me responsible for that!

305
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,514
Dad!

306
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:15,461
The reason you keep repeating that

307
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:19,892
time after time is because

308
00:31:19,892 --> 00:31:25,931
you want to hide all the hurt you caused mother by your mistakes.

309
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:33,284
You want to increase my sense of guilt

310
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:38,170
so you keep repeating what you just said.

311
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:43,586
I've had enough.

312
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:10,970
Mother pulled all the advertisements,

313
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,211
and my parents have forbidden me to return.

314
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:18,393
My father wants us to maintain this marriage,

315
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:20,650
but we can't do that, can we?

316
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:23,171
You take care of it.

317
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:25,750
I'll stay away until then.

318
00:32:27,982 --> 00:32:31,878
Didn't your father forbid you from returning home?

319
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:36,460
- So, where are you going? 
 - Take care of it quickly

320
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:39,160
and give me a divorce.

321
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:01,931
What are you doing here?

322
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:06,644
I need you to investigate these people.

323
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:07,890
Find out everything,

324
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,960
everything that could possibly be used against them.

325
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,744
Someone is accusing one of the pieces at my gallery as being fake.

326
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:21,770
I have to get it authenticated no matter what.

327
00:33:22,954 --> 00:33:25,212
So this is…

328
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,010
You're right.

329
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:32,086
It's a list of the most influential people in the art world.

330
00:33:32,086 --> 00:33:34,156
Jae Hee…

331
00:33:34,156 --> 00:33:37,343
Is it too difficult for you?

332
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:43,597
So, there's nothing I can do without Chairwoman Seo Han Sook's help?

333
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:46,600
Did Chairwoman Seo hold you accountable for the fake?

334
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:51,464
You asked me whether I'd met

335
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:54,247
Hyeon Woo's biological mother, remember?

336
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:59,039
I didn't think you wanted to talk about that.

337
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,174
It turns out that

338
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:07,320
Hyeon Woo is Joon Hyeok's real son.

339
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:12,790
And Yi Seol is the biological mother.

340
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,850
Seo Han Sook was behind it all.

341
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:21,975
She knew I was planning to adopt a son in secret

342
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:26,410
and tricked me into adopting Joon Hyeok's real son.

343
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:32,397
She thought I'd never know it.

344
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,631
Why are you standing here?

345
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:44,559
If you have something to discuss, we can talk inside.

346
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,551
You promised Joo Yeon's parents

347
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:51,065
that you'd advertise on their paper when we got married.

348
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,850
But she wants a divorce.

349
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,343
Then we'll divorce.

350
00:34:57,343 --> 00:34:59,428
Please give us your permission.

351
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:04,517
And give Joo Yeon the alimony that she wants.

352
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:06,610
And what do you want?

353
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:09,533
I want nothing.

354
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:12,180
That is your problem.

355
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:19,241
I've always done as you asked.

356
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:26,276
Just this time, do as I ask please.

357
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:29,483
This is the first favor

358
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:32,970
that I'm ever asking of you.

359
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:53,987
Where's Hyeon Woo?

360
00:35:54,764 --> 00:35:57,571
He's been asking about when you would come home.

361
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:00,031
He just fell asleep.

362
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:28,914
Hyeon Woo is already asleep.

363
00:36:28,914 --> 00:36:35,666
I've missed you all day long today, my dear Hyeon Woo.

364
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:38,758
I should have come home earlier.

365
00:36:38,758 --> 00:36:42,724
Then, I could have seen Hyeon Woo's face.

366
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:48,013
Hyeon Woo, honey, did I wake you?

367
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:52,977
Mommy. Why'd you scream at me this morning?

368
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:57,323
Were you upset about that?

369
00:36:57,323 --> 00:36:58,790
Yeah.

370
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,784
Come here.

371
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:07,293
Mommy is so sorry.

372
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:12,547
It's because I was scared you'd get hurt.

373
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:16,981
I was scared that you would get hurt because of me.

374
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:21,780
Mommy, do you want to play dominoes?

375
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,187
You should sleep at night.

376
00:37:25,187 --> 00:37:28,298
So you can be tall and healthy.

377
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:30,853
Let's play dominoes later.

378
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:34,892
Right now, you should sleep with your teddy bear, okay?

379
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:39,236
Okay. I love you, Mommy.

380
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,400
I love you very much, Hyeon Woo.

381
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,114
Mommy, isn't the name tag on my teddy nice?

382
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:55,982
Yes, it's very nice.

383
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,692
Did the maid make it for you?

384
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,089
No. It was Yi Seol.

385
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:03,954
She made it for me.

386
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:07,898
Remember when grandpa brought

387
00:38:07,898 --> 00:38:11,103
a whole bunch of your favorite grapes?

388
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:16,395
I let Yi Seol borrow my teddy then.

389
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:21,895
I promised to buy her lots and lots of her favorite apples

390
00:38:21,895 --> 00:38:25,528
when I grow up and make lots of money like Dad,

391
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:27,915
and Yi Seol made the name tag because she was thankful.

392
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:30,139
Didn't I do good, Mommy?

393
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:33,704
You did good.

394
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:36,218
You did very good, Hyeon Woo.

395
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:45,239
Mommy, stay next to me until I fall asleep.

396
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,198
Of course!

397
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:51,585
Mommy will always be by your side.

398
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:55,539
Let's sleep.

399
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:18,166
This is a picture from the artist's family.

400
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:22,801
They say it's true that Mr. Park Chi Ho purchased it 35 years ago.

401
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:24,963
They said they'll check on the piece

402
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,584
that Yoo Jin Seok owns and get back to us.

403
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:29,083
What a relief.

404
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:32,488
Mrs. Yoon will be so happy when she finds out.

405
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:35,587
You've helped us even though you don't work here anymore.

406
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:38,320
Thank you so much for everything.

407
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:48,405
Have you found where Joo Yeon is staying at?

408
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:53,930
Yes. We've found the hotel she's staying at by tracing her credit card.

409
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,031
I'm sorry. I tried to stop her, but…

410
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:09,210
Hello, Big Boss.

411
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:15,133
- You can leave. 
 - Okay.

412
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:24,014
You knew about it too, Chairwoman?

413
00:40:24,014 --> 00:40:27,836
You knew that Go Mi Seon has been

414
00:40:27,836 --> 00:40:30,170
running an illicit bar called the Minerva?

415
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:36,081
What is the reason for your rudeness?

416
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:46,451
You know about what happened

417
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:49,924
on that day seven years ago?

418
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,660
What is it you want to say?

419
00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:14,910
Hello, Mrs. Yoon.

420
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:21,877
I wanted to tell you myself.

421
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:25,268
But the chairwoman found out about it first

422
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:28,860
and instructed that the piece be put on display again.

423
00:41:41,994 --> 00:41:46,296
- Is the chairwoman in? 
 - Yes, she's talking with a guest.

424
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:20,557
You must be relieved.

425
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:25,550
I'm glad that the work has been authenticated,

426
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,788
but that's not the only thing that Yoo Jin Seok visited you about, is it?

427
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,335
So, you knew?

428
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:34,977
If he wanted to just get back at me,

429
00:42:34,977 --> 00:42:39,743
he wouldn't have gone to visit you first.

430
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,103
That's why I was planning

431
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:46,525
to have the painting authenticated no matter what it took.

432
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:50,770
Yi Seol made such a thing unnecessary.

433
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:55,510
Yoo Jin Seok wants to join us.

434
00:42:56,686 --> 00:43:00,995
He's grown ambitious, seeing how quickly Joon Hyeok's numbers have gone up.

435
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,186
He may be part of the current administration,

436
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,891
but he's only an old albatross

437
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:10,788
that needs to be looked after in their eyes.

438
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:13,609
And he knows it as well.

439
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:17,691
However, I think he could be useful.

440
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:19,740
What do you think, Jae Hee?

441
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:27,810
I'll do as you say, Mother.

442
00:43:31,772 --> 00:43:33,380
Also,

443
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,850
Kim Yi Seol wants me to make you divorce.

444
00:43:39,212 --> 00:43:41,984
I won't ever divorce.

445
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:46,548
So, you'll raise Hyeon Woo and support Joon Hyeok

446
00:43:46,548 --> 00:43:50,488
as if nothing ever happened?

447
00:43:50,488 --> 00:43:52,940
Can you live like that?

448
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,167

449
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:06,868
You don't have to investigate those people. It's been resolved.

450
00:45:10,714 --> 00:45:13,818
There's one thing I didn't tell you.

451
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:20,987
Yoo Jin Seok was behind the accusation of forgery.

452
00:45:21,888 --> 00:45:25,521
He wants to join the election task force.

453
00:45:26,749 --> 00:45:32,435
Thanks to that, I was able to get a new opportunity.

454
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:42,748
Tell Joon Hyeok what kind of man Yoo Jin Seok is.

455
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:45,875
What if I tell him?

456
00:45:47,118 --> 00:45:53,489
I could tell him that Yoo Jin Seok tried to coerce me into sex.

457
00:45:54,614 --> 00:45:56,800
But

458
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,302
what if he threatens to kill him just as you did?

459
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:06,416
And what if he really follows through with that threat?

460
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,899
Then what am I going to do?

461
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:17,079
Men always care more about their pride, especially in cases like this.

462
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,165
Also, it isn't easy for me

463
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:24,402
to tell people that I received such treatment.

464
00:46:25,101 --> 00:46:29,687
I thought about pretending that I was dead

465
00:46:30,813 --> 00:46:36,350
and doing what he wanted to get what I wanted in return.

466
00:46:36,981 --> 00:46:40,321
I was so angry at myself

467
00:46:40,321 --> 00:46:46,236
for even considering such a shameful and insulting offer.

468
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:49,214
That bastard was using your poor circumstances.

469
00:46:49,214 --> 00:46:51,603
It's not your fault.

470
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:00,123
It would have been nice had you been so understanding back then.

471
00:47:00,123 --> 00:47:06,555
Back then, you were angry at me as if I caused such behavior.

472
00:47:07,873 --> 00:47:11,440
You told me to quit my work

473
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:16,690
and offered to marry me as if you were doing me a favor.

474
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:22,189
I don't care what happens.

475
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:24,450
I'm going to bear it.

476
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:29,510
I'll bear both Joon Hyeok and Yoo Jin Seok.

477
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:34,356
I'm going to bear it and do everything Seo Han Sook tells me to do.

478
00:47:36,213 --> 00:47:42,213
And in the end, I'm going to get everything I want.

479
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:51,451
I won't let myself become the object of pity ever again.

480
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:39,715
Oh my, I'm honored to meet a presidential candidate.

481
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:42,347
I'm Yoo Jin Seok.

482
00:48:42,347 --> 00:48:44,487
It's a little early to call me a candidate,

483
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,167
but it's nice to meet you.

484
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:49,570
- I'm Jung Joon Hyeok. 
 - Thank you.

485
00:48:51,378 --> 00:48:57,710
Mrs. Yoon, you've grown even more beautiful than before.

486
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:01,629
You must receive lots of love from your wife.

487
00:49:01,629 --> 00:49:04,821
You have quite a way with words.

488
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:09,315
For men of weak constitution like us, living with a beautiful woman

489
00:49:09,315 --> 00:49:14,714
requires a quick wit and a silver tongue.

490
00:49:14,714 --> 00:49:19,524
I can see that you'll be of great help to me.

491
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:26,340
I see that your judgment of character is uncanny.

492
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,490
- Take a seat. 
 - Oh, okay. Thank you.

493
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,860
Take a seat.

494
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:35,506
Hello, Mr. Yang. Are you here?

495
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:43,856
Thank you for coming all the way here.

496
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:47,935
The meal is almost over, so you can join their table.

497
00:49:47,935 --> 00:49:49,048
Okay.

498
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:50,482
Mrs. Yoon.

499
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:54,393
You shouldn't have involved me if you were going to recruit Mr. Yoo.

500
00:49:54,393 --> 00:49:57,998
I'm the one that prosecuted him and had him interrogated.

501
00:49:57,998 --> 00:49:59,656
He must still be angry at me.

502
00:49:59,656 --> 00:50:03,234
I'll make sure that things won't be uncomfortable.

503
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,519
We're counting on you.

504
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:08,010
Go on inside.

505
00:50:13,034 --> 00:50:14,927
Did Chairwoman Seo

506
00:50:14,927 --> 00:50:20,400
say anything when she decided to have Yoo Jin Seok join us?

507
00:50:21,948 --> 00:50:26,058
I mean about the party organization

508
00:50:26,058 --> 00:50:29,748
or the organization of the administration in the future.

509
00:50:29,748 --> 00:50:34,890
Don't worry. Mr. Yoo won't take your position, Congressman Min.

510
00:50:39,544 --> 00:50:43,884
You didn't tell Han Sook about

511
00:50:43,884 --> 00:50:46,859
our petty little misunderstandings, did you?

512
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,320
Of course not.

513
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,831
She would have addressed such issues if she had been aware of them.

514
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:53,299
Well, let me just say

515
00:50:53,299 --> 00:50:57,442
you once again prove yourself a very clever woman.

516
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,302
What about after the meal?

517
00:51:04,302 --> 00:51:07,970
I heard that Yoo Jin Seok likes to party so I prepared accordingly.

518
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:11,850
But Chairwoman Seo told me to ask you.

519
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,250
Give him what he wants.

520
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,638
Okay.

521
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:19,900
Go on inside.

522
00:51:29,968 --> 00:51:34,120
I'll take my leave. Thank you.

523
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:42,000

524
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,640

525
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:51,420

526
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,650

527
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:06,379
Hi. I'm Han Dong Min, a reporter of JBC.

528
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:13,100
I have some questions about the redevelopment of Hyeongsan Area 5.

529
00:52:16,513 --> 00:52:18,080
It's been a long time, Mr. Han.

530
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,964
How are you?

531
00:52:18,964 --> 00:52:21,455
What brings you here all of a sudden?

532
00:52:21,455 --> 00:52:22,180
Well,

533
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,181
you know Hyeongsan Area 5 which was confirmed for redevelopment?

534
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:31,229
I heard that it was confirmed after it was almost cancelled.

535
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:36,680
They must have hurried because they were worried it could get cancelled again.

536
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,774
It hasn't been long since they've been confirmed,

537
00:52:39,774 --> 00:52:41,897
but it seems the construction company has already been decided.

538
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:45,538
- Is that what the association says? 
 - They said that they'll have a bid.

539
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:49,775
But the real estate brokers say that the apartments will be built by Sungjin.

540
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:51,636
That's how it was with us.

541
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:54,393
Everyone knew that the construction company was decided.

542
00:52:54,393 --> 00:52:57,129
But they put the project up for bidding and when that failed,

543
00:52:57,129 --> 00:53:00,806
they gave the project to Sungjin Trade.

544
00:53:00,806 --> 00:53:03,924
Everyone said it was collusion,

545
00:53:03,924 --> 00:53:06,194
but the people with the houses liked it

546
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:09,724
because Sungjin's brand apartments are the best.

547
00:53:10,851 --> 00:53:13,330
It was the same with the demolition company.

548
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,070
The demolition company?

549
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:19,129
For Area 5, since the construction company is Sungjin,

550
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:22,292
the demolition will be done by Myeongseong Industries.

551
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:23,270
But hopefully,

552
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:28,040
nothing bad will happen this time since Jung Joon Hyeok gave his promise.

553
00:53:36,105 --> 00:53:40,440
Honey, Yoo Jin Seok seems like a decent man, doesn't he?

554
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,630
We'll have to make him compete with Congressman Min.

555
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:48,599
I'm glad. I was worried because I know that you don't like Congressman Min.

556
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,176
How should we do it?

557
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:57,428
Should we send Yoo Jin Seok into the Liberty Party before I join

558
00:53:57,428 --> 00:54:00,626
to clean it up and invite me?

559
00:54:00,626 --> 00:54:03,850
- What do you think? 
 - I think it's a good idea.

560
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,715
Tell me when you've decided, and I'll make it happen.

561
00:54:06,715 --> 00:54:08,705
Okay.

562
00:54:11,286 --> 00:54:14,622
Yes, we've just arrived home.

563
00:54:15,692 --> 00:54:17,130
Put him on.

564
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,448
Hi, Hyeon Woo.

565
00:54:19,448 --> 00:54:21,270
Really?

566
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:24,897
Hold on. I'll be right there.

567
00:54:24,897 --> 00:54:26,940
Bye.

568
00:54:27,824 --> 00:54:32,240
Hyeon Woo is in the playground and wants me to bring him his scooter.

569
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,129
I'll take it to him. Go inside and get some rest.

570
00:54:35,129 --> 00:54:38,510
I want to play with him today.

571
00:54:40,312 --> 00:54:42,249
I'll see you later.

572
00:54:54,507 --> 00:54:57,930
It started to pour all of a sudden.

573
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:43,292
Huh? There's Yi Seol.

574
00:56:34,213 --> 00:56:36,099
Mommy!

575
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:13,100
Take a seat.

576
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:22,146
Why are you giving me such a hard time?

577
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:26,697
You turned a blind eye on Aunt and her brother, Congressman Min.

578
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:31,295
If you won't let me get a divorce for going against you,

579
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:35,180
then what do you expect me to do?

580
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,021
A sinner cannot decide on her punishment.

581
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:44,099
That's not something you should say, Mother.

582
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:46,500
We all know how you treat everybody here.

583
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,861
If Father or Joon Hyeok did anything wrong,

584
00:57:49,861 --> 00:57:53,742
you swept it under the rug lest it be the source of rumors

585
00:57:53,742 --> 00:57:56,458
and turned a blind eye.

586
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:58,503
Then, you'd use it

587
00:57:58,503 --> 00:58:03,450
to control the two when you needed to.

588
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:07,576
That is how I protected this family.

589
00:58:07,576 --> 00:58:12,860
And that's what you need to learn how to do in the future.

590
00:58:13,712 --> 00:58:18,893
Do you know why I turned a blind eye on Ji Young and her brother?

591
00:58:18,893 --> 00:58:23,827
Do you think I forgave them for the trouble they caused hand-in-hand with you?

592
00:58:24,476 --> 00:58:25,953
No.

593
00:58:25,953 --> 00:58:28,884
But I would get nothing for punishing them.

594
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:35,210
And I won't do anything unless I gain from it somehow.

595
00:58:37,462 --> 00:58:42,439
Now, think again.

596
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:45,486
Why do you think I'm doing this to you?

597
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:52,625
What do you want to get from me?

598
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,478
There you go.

599
00:59:25,372 --> 00:59:28,536
Why won't you leave me alone?

600
00:59:31,815 --> 00:59:33,517
Are you scared?

601
00:59:33,517 --> 00:59:36,218
That I'll take everything from you?

602
00:59:38,136 --> 00:59:40,950
That will never happen.

603
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:45,320
I'll do anything to protect what I have.

604
00:59:46,494 --> 00:59:49,683
Have you thought about the price you'll have to pay?

605
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:54,613
You saw it yourself.

606
00:59:54,613 --> 00:59:57,530
The kind of treatment I get here.

607
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:01,201
Still, I realized thanks to you,

608
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:04,084
that this is the safest place for me.

609
01:00:04,084 --> 01:00:06,610
You lost your parents when you were young

610
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,957
and in order to protect the home you lived in with your grandmother,

611
01:00:09,957 --> 01:00:13,679
you needed the help of someone powerful. When I heard that,

612
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:17,990
I felt sad for you but also scared.

613
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,894
You showed me that in this world,

614
01:00:22,894 --> 01:00:27,085
you had to give your own child up for adoption

615
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,500
for money to buy a home.

616
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:36,308
I don't want to live like that.

617
01:00:36,308 --> 01:00:39,055
 You must not act like you deserve

618
01:00:39,055 --> 01:00:43,510
 everything that you have, all your luxuries.

619
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:47,251
If people like Yoon Jae Hee

620
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:49,650
whom you scorn,

621
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:53,012
don't envy you and hold you up on a pedestal,

622
01:00:53,012 --> 01:00:57,230
all of that can disappear in the blink of an eye.

623
01:00:58,564 --> 01:01:02,313
Make Jae Hee long for what you have.

624
01:01:02,313 --> 01:01:07,500
Make her do things for you and think for you.

625
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:13,660
Make her want to fill your needs even before you ask.

626
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:23,263
Just leave.

627
01:01:23,916 --> 01:01:26,820
I'll have no more problems with you gone.

628
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,297
I don't want to.

629
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:31,990
I can't just leave like this.

630
01:01:33,582 --> 01:01:35,629
Please.

631
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:38,100
Help me out this once.

632
01:01:39,591 --> 01:01:42,140
I told you, no.

633
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,910
Are you trying to ruin me?

634
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:49,817
Do you think there's anything else to ruin?

635
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:54,828
Do you know how pathetic you are?

636
01:01:54,828 --> 01:01:56,854
You live alongside people who disrespect you,

637
01:01:56,854 --> 01:02:01,820
trying your best to please them and to get something out of them!

638
01:02:02,609 --> 01:02:04,960
Like you're crazy.

639
01:02:07,392 --> 01:02:10,300
Yes, I am crazy!

640
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,819
How else can I go on?

641
01:02:12,819 --> 01:02:16,565
Nothing gets better no matter how hard I try.

642
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:19,167
I try to bear it.

643
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:22,040
So until when do I have to live like this?

644
01:02:38,999 --> 01:02:41,060
Yi Seol.

645
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:44,224
Please go away.

646
01:02:44,224 --> 01:02:46,300
I beg of you.

647
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:51,067
I can't.

648
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,805
There's no way that's happening.

649
01:02:56,547 --> 01:02:57,314
I beg of you!

650
01:02:57,314 --> 01:03:01,172
Wait until I've made a decision about

651
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,550
what to do with you.

652
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:35,490

653
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:41,750

654
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:46,300
♫  I've given it my all  ♫

655
01:03:49,780 --> 01:04:01,560
♫  Like an echo in silent despair  ♫

656
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,910
 How do I explain it to Hyeon Woo?

657
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:08,631
 About the relationship between Joon Hyeok and Yi Seol and how Hyeon Woo was born.

658
01:04:08,631 --> 01:04:10,494
 I had a child out of wedlock?

659
01:04:10,494 --> 01:04:14,260
 Is that what your wife told you?

660
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,903
 I will take care of Yi Seol.

661
01:04:15,903 --> 01:04:18,289
 I'll make sure of it.

662
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:21,154
 If anything happens to me, send it to this person.

663
01:04:21,154 --> 01:04:24,230
He says that he knows where the two were

664
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:26,840
 on the day of the Hyeongsan-dong's tragedy 7 years ago.

665
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,016
 The Jae Hee I know isn't that kind of person.

666
01:04:30,016 --> 01:04:33,040
 You knew about everything that happened that day, didn't you?

667
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:37,270
 What do you think you could do in opposition to me?

668
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,050
 Wait for it.

669
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,070
 I will ruin you completely.
