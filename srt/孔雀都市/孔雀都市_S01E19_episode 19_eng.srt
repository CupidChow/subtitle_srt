1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:03,794

2
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:10,118

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,520

4
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:19,705

5
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,691
What's that?

6
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:31,023
They're interviewing the wives of presidential candidates.

7
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:34,541
I see. Wasn't there also

8
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,888
a discussion about going on a talk show?

9
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:39,550
What should we do?

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,300
I don't think it's the best idea,

11
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:43,814
but if you're okay with it, we could.

12
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm not okay with that.

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,324
Is there a problem?

14
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:58,106
Let me leave with Hyeon Woo.

15
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:02,311
It doesn't make sense to raise him as your son.

16
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,167
Why?

17
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:08,315
I thought we were putting that behind us.

18
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:13,426
I thought that was the only choice I had.

19
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:16,146
That there would be no other way.

20
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:19,699
I had never expected these kinds of things

21
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,750
would occur in my life.

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,199
To be honest, I was also surprised at my own change of heart.

23
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:31,118
For my entire life,

24
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,513
I have done all kinds of dirty things to achieve whatever I wanted.

25
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,668
That's how I lived.

26
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:59,122
So, what are you planning to do?

27
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:07,653
Renounce to your candidacy.

28
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:13,234
Or… You might end up getting hurt.

29
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:28,919
You must be having a tough time.

30
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,289
You must be under a lot of stress to say that.

31
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:35,380
That happens to everyone. I understand that.

32
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,034
- Joon Hyeok– 
 - So, I suggest

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,506
that you take some time to think

34
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,236
and reconsider your decision.

35
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:11,290
The impeachment complaints will be filed tomorrow morning.

36
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,427
I would like to pay my gratitude

37
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:16,908
to all those who helped in this.

38
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:20,322
I'll pass your words to them.

39
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:26,750
I'll report to you on the public reaction to Mrs. Yoon's interview today.

40
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,446
So you can consider that when you answer any questions

41
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:36,320
that the reporters ask tomorrow regarding the impeachment.

42
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:38,827
I will.

43
00:03:38,856 --> 00:03:41,294
 Hello and good morning from "Go! Morning Live!"

44
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:44,221
 Today we have our first special interview

45
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:47,551
 with the wife of a presidential candidate.

46
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:49,784
 Will you introduce our first guest?

47
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:53,127
 Our first guest is Mrs. Yoon Jae Hee, wife to Jung Joon Hyeok,

48
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:56,448
 who ranked first in the latest presidential candidate poll.

49
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:59,624
 Let's meet her on the other screen.

50
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:02,223
By the way,

51
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:05,916
what would happen if I were to get a divorce?

52
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:10,005
Why do you ask such a thing out of the blue?

53
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:12,305
It's nothing to be worried about.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,335
It's just a possibility. Who knows what's going to happen?

55
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:20,317
A lot of things can happen in a marriage.

56
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:24,457
Sometimes, it happens that you grow doubts about your spouse

57
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,822
or get disappointed.

58
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:30,392
But it is always important to work together and understand each other.

59
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:35,612
This is a time when you most need your wife's support.

60
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:39,168
Even though this is the 21st century,

61
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:44,826
voters will not favor a candidate who has had a divorce.

62
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,001
Remember that.

63
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:59,703
 To help the President stick to his principles.

64
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:03,400
 I believe that's the duty of the First Lady.

65
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:07,377
 I've always had much sympathy for people who face discrimination.

66
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:14,426
 Lots of people are discriminated against for various reasons.

67
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:16,948
She sure has a way with words.

68
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:19,277
- My goodness… 
  - I've also noticed

69
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:23,505
 that even when thousands still suffer,

70
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:26,565
 the world doesn't seem to care at all.

71
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:28,832
 Isn't that just ridiculous?

72
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:31,418
What was that?

73
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:34,420
 That is indeed ridiculous.

74
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:41,110
 Those with power enjoy life, untouched, and even get away with murder.

75
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,906
 Didn't you know?

76
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,973
 I killed Kim Yi Seol.

77
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,921
She must have gone crazy!

78
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,309
Are you out of your mind?

79
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,143
Why did you do that?

80
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,076
The PR Department will announce that she is suffering from

81
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:24,028
the mental trauma of Kim Yi Seol's death.

82
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:28,191
Master Joon Hyeok's election camp will issue a statement today, as well.

83
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:34,204
If you wanted a divorce, you should have talked to me first.

84
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:37,019
How will you clean up this mess?

85
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:43,109
I started with nothing to my name, but I thought I was smart enough

86
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:48,399
to work my way into the great Sungjin family and gain power.

87
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,725
I thought I'd be able to do that.

88
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:54,070
What I didn't know is that

89
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,654
I would have to trample on others to make that happen.

90
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:02,692
I pitied my poor existence

91
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:05,395
but also despised you people for your haughtiness.

92
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,998
I pushed myself hard

93
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:11,514
so that I could beat you all.

94
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:15,504
But I now realize

95
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:19,706
that I have become the same kind of person as you.

96
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:21,477
That's why

97
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:24,647
I'm trying to go back to my old self.

98
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:27,550
Don't you think it's too late?

99
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:39,729
You've done so many dirty things. Your little stunt won't change anything.

100
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:46,948
No. Nothing will change,

101
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:50,120
including the fact that Yi Seol's dead.

102
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:56,073
But I'm doing this because you hurt my pride.

103
00:07:56,073 --> 00:08:00,308
You may think that I'm the type that's all words and no action

104
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:03,353
when it comes to doing the right thing.

105
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:08,558
You might have thought that even after you killed someone

106
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,813
you could scare me into giving up

107
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:15,532
even the slightest idea of going against you.

108
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:21,154
I cannot stand the thought of that.

109
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:28,304
You know perfectly well that

110
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:33,016
I'm not the kind of person that can stand this kind of ridicule.

111
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:38,008
Right.

112
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:43,475
You might want to pretend that you do have some conscience.

113
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:46,114
But you know,

114
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:50,008
you have to be human first in order to have a conscience.

115
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:55,638
Just because we both have the body doesn't mean that we are both human.

116
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:58,311
I agree.

117
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:01,430
That's why I'll reveal the truth about you

118
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:04,847
for the whole world to see.

119
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:29,044
It's going to be okay.

120
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:32,007
Mother will take good care of it.

121
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:36,212
I'd rather you insult me

122
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:41,050
so that I can at least make an excuse.

123
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,576
It has always been this way.

124
00:09:54,246 --> 00:10:00,536
When I would break a window at school or beat up a classmate,

125
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:06,010
she didn't scold me but pretended that nothing had happened.

126
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:12,620
She never asked if they were mistakes or if I had a reason for doing them.

127
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:17,932
I never had a chance to explain myself.

128
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:22,600
Because…

129
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,862
nobody would listen to me.

130
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:28,831
So,

131
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,836
what about it?

132
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:41,869
For every little mistake, I was scolded

133
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:45,419
and ridiculed for being a bastard

134
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:51,489
of a man that I've never known in my life!

135
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:56,225
That's how I lived.

136
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:03,797
- Am I to blame for that?  
 - Am  I?

137
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:08,304
Out of their own insecurities,

138
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:11,296
my mother tortured you,

139
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,201
and your father tortured me.

140
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:20,517
I have no idea how it's going to end.

141
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:23,613
You always live the way you want.

142
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:27,240
And I never do anything I want.

143
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:30,991
I don't know what choices we'll make in the end.

144
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,935
Contact SVP Kim of the legal team to file for Joon Hyeok's divorce.

145
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:07,245
Retrieve any classified information that Jae Hee might have acquired.

146
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:13,740
Madam, it might be better that I turn myself in to the police.

147
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:18,907
Do you want to leave?

148
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:21,654
No.

149
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:27,404
Or are you punishing yourself for giving Kim Yi Seol's letter

150
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:30,010
to Jae Hee behind my back?

151
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,936
I see you wanted to act out of conscience at least once.

152
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:46,278
This can be an opportunity for you to see your limits.

153
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,652
I'm the one to decide your punishment.

154
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:56,231
Don't overstep.

155
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:12,440
I appreciate your hard work.

156
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,359
Goodbye.

157
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:15,186
Where are you going?

158
00:16:15,186 --> 00:16:17,605
Hyeon Woo's kindergarten.

159
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:18,745
What's that suitcase?

160
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:22,152
I'll stay with him somewhere else for a few days.

161
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:24,929
We can't let him see this mess.

162
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,720
This is already tough to handle.

163
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,490
Stay here and stop making more trouble.

164
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:35,297
Let's talk later.

165
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:38,283
Won't you listen?

166
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:41,896
There's only one way to stop me.

167
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:47,240
Tell the truth to the public and give up running for President.

168
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:51,111
Jae Hee!

169
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:02,602
She had company accounting records and photos of Master Joon Hyeok.

170
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:04,530
Good work.

171
00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:16,681
Do you have a solution to this?

172
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:24,717
Why are you quiet?

173
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:30,195
Do you think Joon Hyeok is president material?

174
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:32,403
Why are you asking that?

175
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:36,098
Are you suggesting he should give up the presidency?

176
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:41,541
I'm asking how much you're willing to risk for him.

177
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:46,176
He was successful as an anchor before you dragged him into this.

178
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:48,349
It is your responsibility to protect him.

179
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:51,994
Also, him becoming President is not the issue at hand right now.

180
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:57,445
If he backs out now, that means we're admitting everything Jae Hee said.

181
00:17:57,445 --> 00:18:01,496
We cannot let her taint Joon Hyeok's reputation.

182
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:06,693
I take it you're willing to risk anything in order to

183
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:10,390
protect Joon Hyeok.

184
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:20,170
This smells amazing!

185
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:23,370
It's ready!

186
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:28,682
Help yourself, sweetie.

187
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:32,008
Thank you, Auntie.

188
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:36,203
What a good boy you are! I'm sure you take after…

189
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:37,976
I'm sure that

190
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:41,604
Mommy would be proud of you.

191
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,892
So, you were never going to make me director of the CIO in the first place.

192
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:54,103
You were going to leave that up to Seo Han Sook

193
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:58,608
in exchange for her support in making Joon Hyeok president.

194
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:01,449
And she was planning to give it to Min Seong Sik

195
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:04,399
and control him like a puppet.

196
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:13,293
I was double-crossed by both, you and Seo Han Sook.

197
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:15,320
I was the fool.

198
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,330
What will you do?

199
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,240
What is it that you want?

200
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,813
First, I will expose that she was the one that had Yi Seol murdered.

201
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,630
Then I'll reveal everything one by one.

202
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,099
How your wife ended up committing suicide,

203
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:37,013
how No Young Joo died,

204
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:40,509
and the tragedy seven years ago.

205
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:45,220
I'll find out what really happened.

206
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:53,360
You're going to need cards to play against her.

207
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,692

208
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:09,056
I sneaked some useful information out of the secret file.

209
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:11,104
 Kim Yi Seol

210
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,560
 did not commit suicide.

211
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:19,390
 She had no reason to do so.

212
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,854
 This all began

213
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,691
 because of Jung Joon Hyeok.

214
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:31,489
 Seven years ago, Yi Seol was raped

215
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:35,900
 by Jung Joon Hyeok.

216
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,570
 She later gave birth to his child.

217
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:46,637
 Then, one day,

218
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:51,558
 we saw the news that Cho Kang Hyeon was going to be Secretary General.

219
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:53,904
 Then, Kwon Min Seon, Cho Kang Hyeon's wife,

220
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:56,845
 hired somebody to assault Young Joo.

221
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:59,229
 Young Joo reported Kwon Min Seon to the police

222
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:03,400
 and she was found dead soon after.

223
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,195
 Her death was also concluded a suicide.

224
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:09,040
 Yi Seol and I couldn't believe that.

225
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,840
 Seon Mi.

226
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,804
 Yes, Madam.

227
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:16,410
 Fetch me Cho Kang Hyeon's file.

228
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,820

229
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:26,760

230
00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:47,642
 He has got to be old-fashioned.

231
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:50,880
 We have good razors at home.

232
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,699

233
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:16,999
 How dare she!

234
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:20,418
 I'll have to give her another thrashing.

235
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,000

236
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,000

237
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,600

238
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,980
 What the hell do you think you're doing?

239
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,320
 I wonder what's gotten you so angry.

240
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,590

241
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:11,008
 How dare you fool around with me?

242
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:12,400
 No Young Joo!

243
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,126
 I'll get you for this.

244
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:20,805
 You're clearly not suitable to be wife to the Prosecutor General.

245
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:23,640
 Who are you?

246
00:23:24,598 --> 00:23:26,710
 This is Seo Han Sook.

247
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:34,639
 Madam Seo, why are you…

248
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:38,883
 You'll see what this is about next morning.

249
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:41,359
 What are you talking about?

250
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,168
 Before that,

251
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:50,013
 could you explain how you have No Young Joo's phone?

252
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,470
 She's dead.

253
00:23:56,403 --> 00:23:59,114
 Tomorrow morning, you will be arrested

254
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:05,132
 for murdering her, your husband's mistress.

255
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,699
 My sympathies.

256
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:18,460
 It's such a shame that all your efforts will come to nothing.

257
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:26,570
 Madam, please don't do this,

258
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:31,694
 and let's meet now

259
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:34,566
 and talk in person.

260
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:36,824
 I'd like to…

261
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:41,080
 apologize for all that I've done wrong.

262
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:47,724
 Madam, please…

263
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,900
 Have mercy just this once.

264
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:58,557
 I'll give you the opportunity to save your honor.

265
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:01,740
 I hope you make a wise choice.

266
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:29,298
Find Park Yong Seob.

267
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:38,807
We cannot let Jae Hee use him to her advantage

268
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:43,991
and talk on live broadcast like she did today.

269
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:48,818
We'd better get rid of him first.

270
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:59,230
This is your punishment.

271
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,770
Show me that you're still a loyal servant of mine, Seon Mi.

272
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:10,806
Yes, Madam.

273
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:18,010
We cannot let Seo Han Sook get to Park Yong Seob first.

274
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:23,618
His phone is turned off so we cannot track him.

275
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:28,731
He must be watching everything even in hiding.

276
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:32,497
Is that why you pulled that stunt today?

277
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:33,847
For him to see?

278
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:37,409
It was the only way to let him know that

279
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:39,481
I haven't given up.

280
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,410
Where is this bastard, anyway?

281
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,814

282
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:55,204

283
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,820

284
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:10,730
Here come desserts!

285
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,985
It's time for you kids to go inside.

286
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,900
I'm not a kid.

287
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,832
Let's go.

288
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:25,311
- What's your favorite game? 
 - Dominoes!

289
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:38,760
Thank you.

290
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,730
Aren't you hungry?

291
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,155
Let's go!

292
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:51,140
Let's go! Let's go!

293
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:55,942
Hey! Hey! Give me that!

294
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:59,785
- I can pour my… 
 - Just give it to me!

295
00:28:01,106 --> 00:28:04,005
Okay. Pour me one.

296
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,644
Your turn.

297
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,372
Cheers! Cheers!

298
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:31,350
Whenever I would see the wrongdoings of others,

299
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:35,950
I would think to myself that I'd never do such things.

300
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,492
I hated dealing with men who wanted me to drink with them

301
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:43,742
and promised myself that I'd never be so low.

302
00:28:44,602 --> 00:28:50,943
Later I realized that I just wanted the satisfaction of feeling superior.

303
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:53,053
Who doesn't?

304
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:55,256
When people see others litter,

305
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:58,030
the first thing they do is give a diatribe when they could

306
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,498
pick it up themselves.

307
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:06,800
They could have kept quiet.

308
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,995
But they say those things just to feel superior.

309
00:29:11,995 --> 00:29:15,873
As if they never do anything wrong themselves.

310
00:29:19,854 --> 00:29:22,752
When everything's revealed,

311
00:29:22,752 --> 00:29:27,301
everybody will blame and point fingers at me.

312
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:30,121
The whole world will.

313
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,917
And Hyeon Woo will suffer because of me.

314
00:29:37,105 --> 00:29:40,625
There will come a time

315
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:45,790
when he grows sick of all that and hates me for what I did.

316
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:55,397
But I will endure that.

317
00:29:55,397 --> 00:30:00,970
I won't let the fear of being hated defeat my conscience.

318
00:30:07,254 --> 00:30:09,066
Have another.

319
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:17,004
Cheers!

320
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:20,763
What do you mean you'll reveal the adoption?

321
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:22,598
Listen to me, Joon Hyeok.

322
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,196
This is the only way for you to come out unscathed.

323
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:30,409
It's God's honest truth that Hyeon Woo is your own son.

324
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:32,196
What's important right now

325
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:36,723
is to get Jae Hee out of the picture so that you're safe.

326
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:44,208
We already have the narrative that she only feels morally responsible.

327
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,199
She'll come back to her senses soon.

328
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:51,605
It looks like Cho Kang Hyeon has chosen to side with her.

329
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:55,709
He has stalled the proceeding of the impeachment.

330
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:59,409
The primaries are coming soon. We need this taken care of.

331
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:01,549
I know this is not the best option.

332
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:04,455
But we need to kick her out

333
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:08,373
for adopting a child in secret before she gives us more trouble.

334
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:12,714
That way, you'll be safer, and we'll keep Hyeon Woo.

335
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:33,260
I'll take good care of Hyeon Woo, so don't worry.

336
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,402
Say goodbye to your mother.

337
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:39,970
Mommy, I'll have a good time with Gyu Seong, so don't worry.

338
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:42,870
I'm sure you will.

339
00:31:43,845 --> 00:31:45,935
I'll see you.

340
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:50,980
- Now, let's go and have some fun! 
 - Let's go!

341
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,060

342
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:17,607
Oh, you came?

343
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,987
Have a seat. You must be tired.

344
00:32:27,222 --> 00:32:31,122
How do you like the art studio?

345
00:32:34,838 --> 00:32:38,213
Most other kids there are better than me.

346
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:41,599
Perhaps, I shouldn't have started there.

347
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:45,242
I'm not good enough for top colleges.

348
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:48,724
Let me tell you a secret of mine.

349
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:54,697
I actually wanted to become a painter.

350
00:32:54,697 --> 00:32:56,791
That's a lie.

351
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,924
You're just making that up to comfort me.

352
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:01,293
It is true.

353
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:08,295
Had it not been for my siblings

354
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:11,717
and parents, who sacrificed everything for my success,

355
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:17,101
I would have pursued my dream and lived the way I wanted.

356
00:33:20,254 --> 00:33:21,970
Do you have regrets?

357
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:24,776
None.

358
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:30,880
Now, I have you, and that's enough for me.

359
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:38,631
So, Jae Hee, be true to yourself.

360
00:33:38,631 --> 00:33:40,982
Be true to your conscience.

361
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:43,404
And do what you want to do.

362
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:57,133
Isn't it nice that there's a hairdresser here?

363
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:01,242
It's nice not having to go out to find one.

364
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:09,481
Dad. I'll be busy for a while,

365
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:12,501
so I won't be able to visit.

366
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:19,790
Make sure you eat well and stay in good health, okay?

367
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,797
I can take care of myself. You don't have to worry.

368
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:40,602
I'm going to visit my father.

369
00:34:40,602 --> 00:34:42,624
How many days?

370
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:45,991
It'll be a quick visit.

371
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:49,119
I'm going there to explain what's going on.

372
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:03,020
Will you let Mother handle everything forever?

373
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,802
She'll be gone some day.

374
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:14,227
Then, we'll be the ones running this family.

375
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:18,487
We need to make sure not to inherit anything that we can't handle

376
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:20,750
before that happens.

377
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,330
 Let me handle everything in my family.

378
00:35:29,117 --> 00:35:32,000
What do you mean by that?

379
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,547
I won't let Hyeon Woo live in disgrace.

380
00:35:36,547 --> 00:35:40,412
Even if the entire Sungjin family might be in jeopardy?

381
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:43,840
Sungjin has to remain strong for your own success

382
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,004
and for Hyeon Woo's protection.

383
00:35:48,557 --> 00:35:52,590
I can take care of Jae Hee. I will.

384
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,430
I'll say no more.

385
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:41,879
You look well.

386
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,510
Thanks to you.

387
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,481
Is it okay for your to be out in public?

388
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:55,450
There must be tons of reporters after you after what happened yesterday.

389
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,699
Madam Seo will handle it.

390
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:01,547
Also, I'm sure

391
00:37:01,547 --> 00:37:06,030
that you'll help me out for old time's sake.

392
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,955
I can get you an interview whenever you want.

393
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:13,390
That'd be good for me, too.

394
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,605
When Cho Kang Hyeon was about to become Prosecutor General

395
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:34,908
and his sex video was released,

396
00:37:34,908 --> 00:37:40,613
you showed me your true passion as a journalist, going after the truth.

397
00:37:44,587 --> 00:37:46,296
What about that?

398
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,040
I hope you always remember who you were back then.

399
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,540
You have no right to say that.

400
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:02,505
Out of anyone in the entire world,

401
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:06,155
I should be the one to say this to you.

402
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:09,490
Because you're like me.

403
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,711
You always believe yourself to be just

404
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:16,815
and feel superior by pointing out the wrongdoings of others.

405
00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:20,091
Yet you abandon your conscience when necessary

406
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:24,970
and manage to find excuses for those occasions.

407
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,632
But I'm sure

408
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:35,020
even in those moments of cowardice, a part of you still believed in justice.

409
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:40,690
I wanted to tell you not to lose that.

410
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:47,395
Because I don't want you to go through the same things that I did.

411
00:38:47,395 --> 00:38:53,010
Also, you will never be able to forget about Yi Seol.

412
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:16,013
This has the list of those responsible for the Hyeongsan-dong tragedy.

413
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:21,712
I'll let you decide whether to report this or not.

414
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,209

415
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:19,024
Are you ready to provide an account?

416
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:24,744
I am.

417
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,531
Let's begin.

418
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:38,199
My name is

419
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:43,910
Yoon Jae Hee, and I'm wife to Jung Joon Hyeok of the Sungjin family.

420
00:40:44,898 --> 00:40:49,330
For my husband's presidential campaign,

421
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,709
I took the lead in gathering slush funds

422
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:55,610
under the order of Seo Han Sook.

423
00:40:56,991 --> 00:41:03,709
In order to hide the fact that I adopted Hyeon Woo through illegal means,

424
00:41:04,707 --> 00:41:07,103
I connived at the crimes

425
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:13,010
of Jung Joon Hyeok and Seo Han Sook.

426
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,076
 Director Yoon Jae Hee of the Sungjin Gallery

427
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:18,395
 made a voluntary appearance at the Prosecutor's Office.

428
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:22,780
 In a recent TV interview, she claimed involvement in the death of Kim Yi Seol,

429
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,595
 and much speculation has followed on the reason behind her appearance.

430
00:41:26,595 --> 00:41:28,448
 Some say that Yoon’s move

431
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:32,799
 is an attempt to steal a march on the Prosecution…

432
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:38,200
Do you have an idea how much she has told them?

433
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:41,902
I see.

434
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:45,386
Let me know if anything new comes up.

435
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:51,111
Why such a serious face?

436
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:57,557
It looks like Cho Kang Hyeon turned his back on us to join Yoon Jae Hee.

437
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:03,287
He wouldn't dare to betray us.

438
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,990
Isn't it obvious?

439
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:10,798
Imagine what Madam Seo would do if he did.

440
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:13,586

441
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:37,302
This is my present for you, Professor Yoo.

442
00:42:37,302 --> 00:42:39,216
Oh dear.

443
00:42:39,216 --> 00:42:42,259
I am indeed honored, Madam.

444
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:47,248
I already knew you have great taste in art,

445
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:52,461
but I must say you once again surprise me.

446
00:42:56,565 --> 00:43:02,384
Joon Hyeok's wife made an appearance at the Prosecutor's Office.

447
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:03,494
Yes.

448
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:08,447
I was surprised to hear the news.

449
00:43:08,447 --> 00:43:11,416
It is my fault that this happened.

450
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:14,399
Nobody would think so.

451
00:43:15,604 --> 00:43:18,796
I am ready at your command.

452
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,687
I will handle the situation so that

453
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:24,508
this gives you no more trouble.

454
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:32,930
Will you tell me the real reason why you wanted to join us?

455
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:43,607
Let me just say I had my own interpretation

456
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:49,698
as to why you picked Jung Joon Hyeok

457
00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:54,200
to be President of this country.

458
00:44:05,902 --> 00:44:09,850
For 30 years since my father's passing,

459
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:14,290
I've contributed to running this country, as well as Sungjin,

460
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:20,630
and presidential elections have always been the most difficult of all tasks.

461
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:26,691
Even though everyone has a different level of intellect and sophistication,

462
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:30,809
they all have the same voting rights.

463
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:35,131
It must have been difficult.

464
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:40,639
I had to make sure that the President of this country was decided

465
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:47,518
by a council of cultured and responsible people.

466
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,090
Words of true wisdom.

467
00:44:56,606 --> 00:45:02,140
Gather supporters to help bring constitutional amendment.

468
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:05,970
As you command.

469
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,802
Don't worry about Yoon Jae Hee.

470
00:45:08,802 --> 00:45:13,110
She won't pose an obstacle in Joon Hyeok's way to the Blue House.

471
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,940

472
00:45:41,192 --> 00:45:45,770
 Hyeon Woo's doing well, so don't worry.

473
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,590

474
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,802
How have you been?

475
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,920
I wasn't going to call you.

476
00:46:24,192 --> 00:46:27,018
I was worried about you.

477
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,709
No.

478
00:46:29,817 --> 00:46:32,289
I don't trust anybody anymore.

479
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:38,522
I thought I could trust Reporter Han.

480
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,036
He was the one that Yi Seol trusted.

481
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:46,836
Before she died, she asked me to send him the packet

482
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:50,108
if anything were to happen to her.

483
00:46:52,757 --> 00:46:55,921
If only I had taken a look at it myself,

484
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:59,598
there would be at least something I could do now.

485
00:47:01,123 --> 00:47:03,060
None of this is your fault.

486
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,495
I thought it would solve everything if it went on TV.

487
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:10,529
That's why I trusted him with the video.

488
00:47:11,392 --> 00:47:14,499
Jung Ho would understand.

489
00:47:16,415 --> 00:47:19,683
I will not trust either

490
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,710
you or him.

491
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,994
Think about it.

492
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:29,121
This all began with Young Joo.

493
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:33,751
We were only trying to find out who killed her and why.

494
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:36,816
Had it not been for that, Yi Seol would

495
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:41,898
still be alive.

496
00:47:41,898 --> 00:47:47,014
It would have been better if she hadn't known about her child.

497
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:59,293
After all, both, you and Prosecutor Park

498
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,920
are with Cho Kang Hyeon.

499
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:09,590
We thought that he would never have killed No Young Joo.

500
00:48:12,734 --> 00:48:14,630
You didn't know that for sure.

501
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:20,446
You wanted to believe that because that would work better for you.

502
00:48:20,446 --> 00:48:23,799
You believed what you wanted to believe.

503
00:48:25,298 --> 00:48:27,829
You may be right.

504
00:48:28,915 --> 00:48:32,004
That's why I'm trying to rectify everything.

505
00:48:33,415 --> 00:48:37,518
I will find out the truth behind everything

506
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:41,319
that I've ignored and turned a blind eye to.

507
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:46,260
I'm going to find the story that Yi Seol wanted to tell.

508
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:52,724
Help me, Yong Seob.

509
00:49:16,657 --> 00:49:19,998
You probably don't feel comfortable about this.

510
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,415
But you can be honest with me.

511
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:26,942
I can help you find a solution.

512
00:49:26,942 --> 00:49:28,923
I could persuade Jae Hee…

513
00:49:28,923 --> 00:49:31,100
That's impossible.

514
00:49:43,387 --> 00:49:47,805
If we reveal that Hyeon Woo was adopted illegally,

515
00:49:47,805 --> 00:49:51,709
we'll be denying him being my own son.

516
00:49:52,547 --> 00:49:56,222
We'll create a narrative that you're still

517
00:49:56,222 --> 00:50:00,330
protective of your adopted son, which will only make you

518
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,609
a noble and responsible parent.

519
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:10,480
Jae Hee can be tough to handle sometimes,

520
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:14,533
but I won't ruin everything between us.

521
00:50:17,865 --> 00:50:20,501
Do you still love her?

522
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:30,926
Then, you shouldn't have played around with other women.

523
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:37,000
Human conscience is like

524
00:50:37,805 --> 00:50:42,917
a prank that the emotion plays on you.

525
00:50:47,472 --> 00:50:53,716
Let me tell you a story that will put you at ease.

526
00:50:58,592 --> 00:51:04,220
It's my past story with Mrs. Yoon.

527
00:51:21,207 --> 00:51:23,492
You, son of a bitch!

528
00:52:06,547 --> 00:52:09,505
Thank you for the good work.

529
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:14,540
When everything's done, I'll send you the painting.

530
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,940
We have Park Yong Seob's location.

531
00:52:34,302 --> 00:52:38,133
Make sure there are no mistakes.

532
00:52:38,972 --> 00:52:40,797
Yes, Madam.

533
00:52:50,322 --> 00:52:52,768
Good morning, Sunbae.

534
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:55,310
I'm Kang Ho Seong, a new recruit.

535
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:58,509
- Oh, yes. Nice to meet you. 
 - You, too.

536
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,880
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

537
00:53:04,364 --> 00:53:06,498
How's work so far?

538
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:09,909
Probation period tends to be easier.

539
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,920
I'm loving it.

540
00:53:13,507 --> 00:53:20,724
Why do we skip the proper honorifics for everyone, even the director?

541
00:53:20,724 --> 00:53:23,031
Everyone finds that weird at first.

542
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:28,118
You'll grow used to it. Everyone does eventually.

543
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,685
I don't know if it's true, but there is a rumor.

544
00:53:33,685 --> 00:53:37,294
We do that so anyone can voice their opinion freely

545
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:41,190
and establish themselves as journalists.

546
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,910
That's very profound.

547
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:48,391
But now it's a mere formality that lost significance.

548
00:53:49,613 --> 00:53:51,560
It will be restored.

549
00:53:54,645 --> 00:54:00,816
By the way, I wanted to ask you about Director Yoon Jae Hee's interview.

550
00:54:00,816 --> 00:54:05,211
The Sungjin Group's explanation was that she was only feeling morally responsible.

551
00:54:05,211 --> 00:54:06,850
What I find weird is that

552
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:10,924
she said that she'd killed Kim Yi Seol, not that she was at fault.

553
00:54:10,924 --> 00:54:16,212
So, I did some research and found some information on Kim Yi Seol's background.

554
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:21,722
She was living in Hyeongsan-dong when the tragedy occurred seven years ago.

555
00:54:21,722 --> 00:54:24,730
Her grandmother was a victim.

556
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,200
So?

557
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,123
The person responsible for the tragedy was

558
00:54:31,123 --> 00:54:35,588
Jung Pil Sung, the CEO of Myeongseong industry,

559
00:54:35,588 --> 00:54:37,974
who is also Yoon Jae Hee's father-in-law.

560
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:41,304
And Kim Yi Seol was her favorite employee.

561
00:54:41,304 --> 00:54:44,020
This cannot be a coincidence, right?

562
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:51,818
Are you saying Kim Yi Seol's death has to do with the Hyeongsan tragedy?

563
00:54:52,894 --> 00:54:57,883
It's also weird that Kim Yi Seol died at Jung Joon Hyeok's office building.

564
00:54:57,883 --> 00:55:02,839
At first they said it was a suicide, and after you got Park Yong Seob's testimony,

565
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:06,367
Park Jung Ho was apprehended and released.

566
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:11,610
And then Yoon Jae Hee's suspicious interview…

567
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:16,307
There is something behind all this, but I don't know what it is.

568
00:55:18,892 --> 00:55:20,920
Is this too much of a stretch?

569
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,215
You should keep investigating.

570
00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:29,315
You may not find what you suspected, but it might lead somewhere.

571
00:55:29,315 --> 00:55:31,575
That's journalism.

572
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,287
Thank you!

573
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:42,170

574
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:52,900

575
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:05,090

576
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:52,180

577
00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:03,180

578
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:10,712

579
00:57:10,712 --> 00:57:14,140

580
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,290

581
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:19,470

582
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,414
April 16th.

583
00:57:22,414 --> 00:57:25,027
March 12th.

584
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:34,850
I'm sorry.

585
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:39,072
Don't apologize for something you didn't do.

586
00:57:39,072 --> 00:57:41,290
You've been through a lot.

587
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:45,223
How are the preparations going?

588
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:50,423
When the documents are set, your bench warrant will be issued.

589
00:57:50,423 --> 00:57:52,470
Once you're in custody,

590
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,210
we can summon Seo Han Sook and Jung Joon Hyeok

591
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:59,510
as referential witnesses, as well as the rest of the family.

592
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,550
I'll be waiting.

593
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,094
Okay.

594
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,590
I'll see you.

595
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:05,026
What is it?

596
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:07,704
Take a seat.

597
00:59:30,954 --> 00:59:33,088
Would you like coffee?

598
00:59:33,728 --> 00:59:36,125
Or wine?

599
00:59:49,815 --> 00:59:53,110
Stop now or you'll be in trouble.

600
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:59,307
Because of you, Hyeon Woo might forever be labeled a bastard.

601
01:00:02,395 --> 01:00:04,714
Don't say that.

602
01:00:05,848 --> 01:00:09,107
If you're really worried about him,

603
01:00:09,107 --> 01:00:12,850
what you have to do is to stay by his side

604
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:16,091
through any hardship and protect him.

605
01:00:20,508 --> 01:00:22,190
Those are some good words to hear,

606
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:28,424
but you should already know the reality isn't so easy.

607
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,311
Isn't that why you relied on Yoo Jin Seok for success?

608
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:55,160
Sungjin Trade won't be participating in the bid for Hyeongsan-dong's redevelopment.

609
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:59,490
The bid is but a formality. Everything's already been arranged, why now?

610
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,496
We will be pursuing other projects abroad.

611
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:06,405
Myeongseong Industry should also back out from the demolition.

612
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:11,570
Compensate your partners for any unfair profits you took from them.

613
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:15,570
Also, you have to compensate the evictees for

614
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,110
all the damages you've inflicted on them.

615
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:17,927
Joon Il!

616
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:19,858
Please respect his decision, Father.

617
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:22,220
I understand your reason for that,

618
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,190
but somebody will take advantage of it, anyway.

619
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,361
We'll be letting it go to waste!

620
01:01:27,361 --> 01:01:33,311
I will not do anything that I cannot handle anymore.

621
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:37,695
I won't let past mistakes repeat themselves.

622
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:44,000
I appreciate that you're trying to right our mistakes of the past.

623
01:01:45,203 --> 01:01:47,170
Then,

624
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:53,180
how do you suggest I pay for having Kim Yi Seol murdered?

625
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:57,550
Mother…

626
01:02:00,915 --> 01:02:05,810
To protect this family, I had Kim Yi Seol and No Young Joo murdered

627
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:09,160
and drove Kwon Min Seon to suicide.

628
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:15,324
I was also responsible for the deaths in the Hyeongsan-dong tragedy.

629
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,099
Tell me.

630
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:24,640
What do you suggest I do to pay for everything I've done?

631
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:34,620
 I'll forgive you for everything if you stop and come back.

632
01:02:36,214 --> 01:02:38,676
We can put the past behind us.

633
01:02:38,676 --> 01:02:40,820
For you, me, and Hyeon Woo.

634
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:44,600
I can do that for the future of our family.

635
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,930
I can't.

636
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,556
I realized that

637
01:02:49,556 --> 01:02:54,540
Yi Seol's death was not the fault of just a single person.

638
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,980
Before,

639
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:01,999
I never really cared about the Hyeongsan-dong tragedy.

640
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,212
I only pitied their poor existence,

641
01:03:07,965 --> 01:03:12,469
and I thought that was enough for me.

642
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:15,800
Father's company drove out those innocent people

643
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,627
and offered politicians sex for favors for greater profits.

644
01:03:21,906 --> 01:03:24,613
Knowing all that,

645
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:28,775
I believed myself to be conscientious enough

646
01:03:28,775 --> 01:03:32,803
for criticizing him and distancing myself from him.

647
01:03:34,127 --> 01:03:39,626
But I was no better, being a member of the Sungjin family,

648
01:03:39,626 --> 01:03:43,395
who did all those terrible things,

649
01:03:43,395 --> 01:03:49,230
and striving for their acceptance and my own success.

650
01:03:50,112 --> 01:03:53,409
That's all I cared about.

651
01:03:55,117 --> 01:04:02,510
And I enjoyed an affluent life with that dirty money.

652
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:06,021
Fine.

653
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:08,650
I understand you.

654
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:12,797
You didn't want to be driven back out to the world you barely escaped.

655
01:04:12,797 --> 01:04:16,060
You deceived me and adopted a child because

656
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:19,630
you had to stay at my side no matter what, right?

657
01:04:20,394 --> 01:04:22,934
That was a wrong choice.

658
01:04:22,934 --> 01:04:25,830
I should never have done it.

659
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:31,724
How can we call ourselves good parents

660
01:04:31,724 --> 01:04:36,008
for Hyeon Woo with such dirty conscience?

661
01:04:36,008 --> 01:04:38,980
That's why we have to right things–

662
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,691
Exactly.

663
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:44,406
We can right the wrongs now. I can do that.

664
01:04:44,406 --> 01:04:47,750
I can change the world that Hyeon Woo will live in.

665
01:04:57,399 --> 01:04:59,851
I only made one mistake without even knowing,

666
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:02,113
and I can't blow my chance because of that.

667
01:05:02,113 --> 01:05:06,802
That would be too harsh.

668
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,450
Let's think about Hyeon Woo.

669
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,721
We have to give him a better world.

670
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:18,410
I can make it happen.

671
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:24,108
I'll bring hope to this world, and I need your help for that.

672
01:05:28,732 --> 01:05:34,830
That "hope" you speak of, who is it for?

673
01:06:05,686 --> 01:06:10,730

674
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:21,100

675
01:06:29,033 --> 01:06:30,830
 - Hyeon Woo! Hyeon Woo!
 - What?

676
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:35,160
You will tell everyone that I raped Yi Seol to keep Hyeon Woo?

677
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,730
 Jung Joon Hyeok abandoned his wife and took Seo Han Sook's side.

678
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:41,029
 He's determined.

679
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:45,128
 I need your support so that I can make a better world for our children,

680
01:06:45,128 --> 01:06:50,352
 including my own, where nobody will be faced with discrimination of any kind.

681
01:06:50,352 --> 01:06:54,373
 What did you tell him to turn him into a monster?

682
01:06:54,373 --> 01:06:55,986
 I didn't do that.

683
01:06:55,986 --> 01:06:57,680
 I was scared.

684
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,725
 You did, Jae Hee.

685
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:00,929
Good for you.

686
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:02,218
 I was anxious.

687
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,820
You don't have to be anxious anymore.

688
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:09,930
 Right. It is bound to happen.

689
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:14,950
 Everyone pays for what they've done in the end.

690
01:07:16,758 --> 01:07:19,100
 That has to happen.

691
01:07:20,677 --> 01:07:25,904
