1
00:00:02,307 --> 00:00:03,815

2
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:06,131
 That day seven years ago…

3
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:10,987
 You already knew about everything

4
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:15,085
 that happened that day, didn't you?

5
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:20,096
 So, what are you going to do about it?

6
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:25,399
 I'll take some time to think about it.

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,852
 About how you people have wronged us

8
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:32,571
 and how to make you pay.

9
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:37,740
 And… you'd better be ready for that.

10
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:42,325
 "You people" and "us."

11
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:45,105
 Us?

12
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:53,189
 Since when are you and Kim Yi Seol "us?"

13
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:59,595
 Come back to your senses.

14
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:04,000
 Have you forgotten the goal you've been striving for all this time?

15
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:10,120

16
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:19,816
 Will you be so daring to choose to side against me?

17
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:28,358
 What do you think you could do in opposition to me?

18
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:32,519
 If I can't have it all,

19
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:36,066
 I'll ruin it all.

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,102
 Wait for it.

21
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:44,004
 I will ruin everything completely.

22
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:14,298

23
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,980
 Oh my god! What is it?

24
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:52,457

25
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:00,337
No! No!

26
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:04,109
That wasn't Yi Seol, was it?

27
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:06,042
I have to go and check. I didn't see—

28
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:08,994
That was Yi Seol!

29
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:11,223
It was Yi Seol!

30
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:14,481
Your husband contacted her to come and meet him.

31
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,272
I was worried and followed her.

32
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:20,990
Mrs. Yoon. You have to go.

33
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,800
You have to run away!

34
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:27,828
They killed Young Joo, and now Yi Seol…

35
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,803
Mrs. Yoon. You've to pretend you know nothing and run away.

36
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:35,765
Quick!

37
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:43,513
If that person is indeed Yi Seol,

38
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:50,773
I cannot leave her like that.

39
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:56,033
I never will.

40
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:21,214
I heard a crashing sound, and when I came, she was already dead.

41
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,221
- Where were you when this happened? 
 - I was just out doing…

42
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:26,516
Okay.

43
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:31,039
- She doesn't have an ID. 
 - What about her cellphone?

44
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,429
- You still haven't found it? 
 - No.

45
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,404
We might need a fingerprint scan for identification.

46
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:39,269
Her name's Kim Yi Seol.

47
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,997
Oh! Mrs. Yoon!

48
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:45,475
She texted me to meet her here.

49
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:48,418
How do you know her?

50
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:57,925
Could you spare some time to talk with us?

51
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:27,116
 Did you just say I raped you?

52
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,645
 You drank all the drinks I offered with a smile on, too.

53
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,403
 Even when you were drunk, you were still so eager to talk to me.

54
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,116
 I thought you also wanted to have fun.

55
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:46,207
 You call that a rape?

56
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:50,039
 I had to make a good impression.

57
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,780
 I was about to get evicted from my apartment.

58
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:57,814
 And I needed help from someone with power.

59
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:04,653
 But I never gave you permission to do anything like that.

60
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,825
 Okay. Fine.

61
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,708
 So, there was a slight misunderstanding between us back then.

62
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,653
 That doesn't make me a rapist.

63
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:20,880
 And that was seven years ago!

64
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,548
 I didn't even remember any of that until you just told me. Do you understand?

65
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:27,749
 The trauma of that day has haunted me until this very moment.

66
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,580
 And that's my fault?

67
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:34,334
 That was your lapse of judgment.

68
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,609
 You're right.

69
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:39,788
 It was a lapse of judgment.

70
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,557
 That day…

71
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:53,552
 I should've stood up against you right when it happened.

72
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:56,120
 Had I done that…

73
00:08:57,724 --> 00:08:59,774
 my child...

74
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:05,112
 wouldn't be living with you right now.

75
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,982
 What did you just say?

76
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:19,572
 Your child is living with me?

77
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:24,808
 You still didn't know that?

78
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:31,307
 Answer me! What does that mean?

79
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,881
 I'm the one who gave birth to Hyeon Woo.

80
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,523
 Mrs. Yoon adopted him, not knowing.

81
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:45,254
 And Chairwoman Seo Han Sook was behind it.

82
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:59,101
 Now, it's time for each of us to pay

83
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:01,695
 for the wrongs we did.

84
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:05,975
 Look.

85
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,500
 What makes you think I'll buy that?

86
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,215
 It is true.

87
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,753
 How dare you!

88
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,389
 Why are you doing this?

89
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,058
 Who is it? Tell me who it is!

90
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:25,261
 Who put you up to this?

91
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,067
 Tell me!

92
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:34,704
 Who is it? Who put you up to this?

93
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:38,048
 Who told you to threaten me like this?

94
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:39,709
 Tell me right now!

95
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:42,110
 Tell me right now!

96
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,044
I hope nobody saw you then.

97
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:20,033
So, Kim Yi Seol texted that she wanted to meet up?

98
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:34,464

99
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,326
I heard she had quit the gallery.

100
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,747
She did.

101
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,214
May I ask why?

102
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:48,017
Just personal reasons…

103
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:53,296
That's weird…

104
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,656
Why would an ex-employee

105
00:11:55,656 --> 00:12:01,422
suddenly want to meet her ex-boss so late at night?

106
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,953
When do the autopsy results come out?

107
00:12:09,953 --> 00:12:13,205
Tomorrow or the day after at the earliest.

108
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:14,923
But…

109
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,192
Why do you ask that?

110
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:22,712
That will reveal the true cause of her death.

111
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:29,109
Is there anything suspicious you know of?

112
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,883
Don't answer that.

113
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:40,695
- Who are you? 
 - I'm Joo Sang Jin, her attorney.

114
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:01,832
So, Jae Hee told you to come find me?

115
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:03,512
Yes.

116
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:06,387
She said you'd know what to do.

117
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:10,550
She told me to share everything I know with you.

118
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,917
You should stay here until this is over.

119
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,720
So…

120
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,210
What will happen?

121
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:25,619
Jae Hee will make sure the news of her death gets publicity.

122
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:33,688
That's why she'll pretend not to know about Joon Hyeok and Yi Seol's meeting.

123
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,106
An official investigation will never work for people like him.

124
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:39,718
So, she'll find another way.

125
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:45,228

126
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:52,376
Hello, Sir.

127
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:59,405
No. I haven't heard anything from Mrs. Yoon.

128
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,113
Yes.

129
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:04,087
Sure. I'll be right over.

130
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,841
Sungjin Group has called for a meeting.

131
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:18,219
Get some shut-eye.

132
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:21,907
If anyone calls, don't answer.

133
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:23,432
Okay.

134
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:50,360

135
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:05,995
I've told the police to keep quiet about it.

136
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:11,014
But the reporters have found out somehow and they're 
already asking questions.

137
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:15,401
We have to act quickly in a situation like this.

138
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:19,118
We first need to know exactly what happened

139
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,955
before we discuss our plan of action.

140
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:25,699
Can someone first tell me what happened?

141
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:30,783
An ex-staff member of the gallery died.

142
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:32,301
What?

143
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:39,910
We all know news of a death always carries weight.

144
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,956
But it doesn't really make sense that you had to call

145
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:45,620
the prosecutor general, a politician, and a former minister

146
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,637
in the middle of the night just over a former gallery staff.

147
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:50,824
Her name is Kim Yi Seol.

148
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,254
Apparently, she said that she had been raped by Joon Hyeok and had his child.

149
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:59,469
It's nothing but a lie, a cunning attempt to threaten us.

150
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:03,166
She jumped from Joon Hyeok's office building and died.

151
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,135
Mother will figure out the situation herself.

152
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:08,937
We wait till she does and calls us.

153
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:16,147
Why did you?

154
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:19,601
Why did you have to make it worse like this?

155
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:22,487
Is this your revenge on me

156
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:25,479
for being a bad stepson?

157
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:29,853
Were you planning this the whole time when I thought you were working with me?

158
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:32,729
You'd better watch your words.

159
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:38,200
You can blame me all you want.

160
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,502
And I never really expected you to be grateful for even

161
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,182
accepting you as a stepson.

162
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:49,101
But don't blame yourself or have any regrets

163
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:52,613
over a nobody like Kim Yi Seol.

164
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,984
For the likes of her,

165
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:08,890
it is in their destiny to live lives of little significance.

166
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,709
Don't let someone like that trouble you in any way.

167
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,109
I already knew you're a cruel person, but this is beyond what I could imagine.

168
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,945
Are you saying

169
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:33,087
that perhaps I should've gone around talking to people

170
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:37,982
about this incident and how you've always caused trouble?

171
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:51,653
Remember, I'll do anything it takes

172
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,587
to protect you.

173
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:57,909
So, you put your trust in me.

174
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,363
And don't forget.

175
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:06,791
You've never even seen Yi Seol today.

176
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,816
Understood?

177
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:29,508
You must be shocked.

178
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:37,508
What are you doing here?

179
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:41,372
Did Mother call you in?

180
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,038
What's with that tone?

181
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,178
Are you suspecting me?

182
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,627
Why are you overreacting?

183
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,189
I'm just asking to make sure–

184
00:18:58,189 --> 00:18:59,752
You fooled me,

185
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:02,697
adopted a child born from a girl like her,

186
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:05,794
and raised him as my son! And, what?

187
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:10,904
Now you're saying I'm a murderer?

188
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:13,311
How did you know

189
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:16,830
that Yi Seol was Hyeon Woo's mother?

190
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,913
You met her, didn't you?

191
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:27,207
She must have told you about it.

192
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:31,584
She probably said she would expose you for raping her.

193
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,317
Is that why you killed her?

194
00:19:33,317 --> 00:19:35,003
How dare you even speak of such things?

195
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:37,318
Stop, both of you!

196
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,006

197
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:03,126
You should first take a look at this before we continue.

198
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,510

199
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,997
Apparently, she left this where she jumped.

200
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,907
 To Mrs. Yoon,

201
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:20,391
 thank you for everything.

202
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:24,696
 I'm sorry to go without a proper goodbye.

203
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:27,720
 Please take good care of Hyeon Woo.

204
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,714
All those lies she told must have put her under a lot of pressure.

205
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:41,907
So, perhaps she wanted to meet you for the last time and apologize.

206
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,846
Then perhaps she lost the courage to do that.

207
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:51,317
Kim Yi Seol…

208
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:57,149
Let's have pity on her poor soul and

209
00:20:57,149 --> 00:21:01,189
not make big news out of her death.

210
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:10,296
Mommy, where are we going?

211
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,970
Hmm? Where are we going?

212
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:22,250
You both look distraught.

213
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:28,755
Let me just say, some things just happen when you least expect them.

214
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:33,090
This, too, shall pass, so don't stress over this too much.

215
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:36,690
Do we have to bring our son?

216
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:43,600
It'll be only courteous to bring him with you.

217
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,697
Come on, let's go.

218
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,279
 Kim Yi Seol, a narrator at the Sungjin's gallery,

219
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,504
 who collaborated with the popular presidential candidate

220
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:11,319
 Jung Joon Hyeok in his talk concert, passed away last night.

221
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:15,925
 As the police continues the investigation on her death,

222
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:21,480
 the Sungjin's gallery has provided a venue for her funeral at the Sungjin Hospital.

223
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:43,120

224
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,735
 I said, don't go!

225
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:02,234
 You've no reason to meet Jung Joon Hyeok!

226
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:06,589
 - This is none of your business! 
 - Don't just say that.

227
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:13,650
 Okay. I'm sorry. That was inconsiderate.

228
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,152
 - I'm worried about you. 
 - Okay!

229
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:22,252
 I'll be back soon. Let's have fried chicken later.

230
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,968
 - Don't worry too much. 
 - How can I not worry?

231
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:27,238
 What are you going to do?

232
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:30,592
 I'm telling you! Don't go there!

233
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:34,614
You helped Joon Hyeok with the talk concert, right?

234
00:24:34,614 --> 00:24:36,591
Did you know that girl?

235
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,380

236
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,120

237
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:49,320

238
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,560

239
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,500

240
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,620

241
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,891

242
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:21,429

243
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:25,090

244
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,370

245
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,926
After the report on the Sungjin Foundation holding Kim Yi Seol's funeral,

246
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:37,359
they'll mention that you'll be stepping down as chairwoman

247
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,939
and that Joo Yeon will be the new leader of the foundation.

248
00:25:43,507 --> 00:25:46,214
Were it not for the news of Yi Seol's death,

249
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:52,797
we could face criticisms for nepotism, which could affect Joon Il's succession.

250
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:57,293
It seems her death was not completely in vain, after all.

251
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:17,560

252
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,757
Aren't you Mr. Han Dong Min?

253
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:13,349
Open the door for your wife and then hold your son's hand.

254
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:16,554
Then, the three of you can walk in together.

255
00:27:16,554 --> 00:27:19,840
Put on a solemn expression.

256
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:13,846
How do you feel? One comment, please.

257
00:28:13,846 --> 00:28:18,786
Is it true that Kim Yi Seol was close to your family?

258
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:21,788
Do you know of anyone that possibly held a grudge against her?

259
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:24,090
When did you last see her, Mrs. Yoon?

260
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,500
Anything you want to say in her memory?

261
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,940
One comment, please.

262
00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:34,354
I was a journalist until recently,

263
00:28:34,354 --> 00:28:37,520
so I understand your passion for reporting.

264
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,190
But I'd also like you to understand that we just lost someone

265
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:50,189
that was indeed precious to us and have some empathy.

266
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:52,788
I hope…

267
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:56,817
you and the viewers would understand this

268
00:28:56,817 --> 00:29:04,550
and let us mourn her unfortunate death and commemorate her in peace.

269
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:20,730
You must be devastated.

270
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:30,340
We were not particularly close, so…

271
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:37,918
You say so, but I'm sure you're mourning her deep in your heart.

272
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:40,656
There is a complicated issue behind this,

273
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:48,608
which put me in a position where I must let reason guide me, not my emotions.

274
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:53,090
And I'm rather surprised that

275
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,697
you're paying so much attention to the funeral of a mere ex-staff member.

276
00:29:57,697 --> 00:30:03,422
You must have been particularly close to Ms. Kim Yi Seol, Chairwoman.

277
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:07,016
Well...

278
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:14,534
Mr. Han, I'm not really sure what you mean by "particularly close."

279
00:30:15,741 --> 00:30:21,185
Last night, I saw her going out to meet Joon Hyeok.

280
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:25,530
And this morning, I heard the news of her death.

281
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:31,308
I also received a letter she had sent me before she died.

282
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:35,564
It said that seven years ago, on the day of the Hyeongsan-dong tragedy,

283
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:38,289
she was raped by Joon Hyeok,

284
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:45,110
and you made it so that Jae Hee adopted Joon Hyeok's child that she gave birth to.

285
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:52,650
She sent you a letter like that and then committed suicide?

286
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,310
She was already expecting danger coming her way when she wrote it.

287
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,830
Given this, it is highly unlikely

288
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,203
that it was suicide.

289
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:08,695
Then, why are you talking to me about this?

290
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:11,162
Why not go to the police, the prosecutor's office,

291
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:16,092
or try to find the truth yourself like a reporter should?

292
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:24,160
Is it because you don't fully trust what she wrote?

293
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:33,160
Or is it because of Jae Hee?

294
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:41,631
I heard that she once stopped your report from going out.

295
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:47,094
If it's her that's making you hesitate, you don't have to worry.

296
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:53,010
Trust me. I can stop her from doing anything like that.

297
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:58,450
But remember, you'll have to take the responsibility for whatever you do.

298
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:29,184
 Do you mind if I become someone that

299
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:33,220
 you can rely on and ask for help?

300
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:54,318
Reporter Han.

301
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,210
Oh, yes.

302
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,119
Hello.

303
00:33:01,698 --> 00:33:06,918
I should have had more courage and told you

304
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,519
when you came to me looking for Soon Ok's family.

305
00:33:11,546 --> 00:33:15,298
If I had done that, she'd still be alive.

306
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:20,562
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

307
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:23,429
It's not your fault at all.

308
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:26,398
Calm down.

309
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:50,596
Please, don't cry, ma'am.

310
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:55,260
It aches my heart to see you cry.

311
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,540
Let's go in.

312
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,302
Are you okay?

313
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,639
I'll be back in a moment.

314
00:34:49,342 --> 00:34:51,130
Wait!

315
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,678
Like you said, I should do something about this.

316
00:34:59,678 --> 00:35:03,900
And as long as I take the responsibility, I can do whatever I want, right?

317
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,440
That is what I said.

318
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:20,919
Then will you help me as I handle this?

319
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:04,766
Mommy, why is there a picture of Yi Seol here?

320
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:09,022
I'll tell you later.

321
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:11,191
This will be over soon.

322
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,560

323
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:33,039
The same goes for the reporters.

324
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,352
You don't have to mind them too much. They won't be too big an obstacle.

325
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:40,305
Just stay the course.

326
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,780

327
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:21,609
 Because I need you.

328
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:23,992
 I need you, Yi Seol.

329
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,720
 I feel so lucky that I have you.

330
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,023
 But… How can you trust me telling me all this?

331
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:33,123
 I just want to get close to you and be friends with you.

332
00:37:33,123 --> 00:37:36,906
 I have myself. And I have you.

333
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:40,290
 Stay on my side at any time.

334
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,193

335
00:39:04,587 --> 00:39:08,085
 Now, it's our turn to make a move.

336
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:15,494
You can start.

337
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:41,936
Kim Yi Seol

338
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:45,750
did not commit suicide.

339
00:40:04,478 --> 00:40:08,110
Since when did you know Hyeon Woo was adopted?

340
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,350
Is that why you're always so affectionate to him?

341
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:16,026
Do you sympathize with him?

342
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:22,659
I was surprised Jae Hee adopted him without us knowing.

343
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:25,293
But what surprised me more is how Mother handled it.

344
00:40:25,293 --> 00:40:28,311
I wonder what she was thinking.

345
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:36,443
As for Hyeon Woo, I'm sure the matter will stay within the family.

346
00:40:36,443 --> 00:40:41,921
But, did Kim Yi Seol really commit suicide?

347
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:47,313
Is it true that she was raped by Joon Hyeok?

348
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,759
You said that after playing golf,

349
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:57,845
Joon Hyeok went to the office building with Professor Yoo, right?

350
00:40:57,845 --> 00:41:01,199
They didn't have a drink after. That's why you were back early.

351
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:08,570
And how did Kim Yi Seol die at Joon Hyeok's office building?

352
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,380
If it wasn't a suicide, what are you going to do?

353
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:24,280
Do you… know what really happened?

354
00:41:26,388 --> 00:41:29,311
Everyone's saying it was a suicide.

355
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:34,211
That's all we need to know.

356
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:42,512
I have a question for you.

357
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,109
What does it feel like to live with secrets?

358
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:51,513
When you see people who don't know the truth, do you feel guilty?

359
00:41:51,513 --> 00:41:58,380
Or do you feel superior that you know what others don't?

360
00:42:09,536 --> 00:42:13,400
You'll get to experience that yourself this time.

361
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:35,310
What are you doing, sweetheart?

362
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:39,200
Wait. Let me finish this.

363
00:42:47,552 --> 00:42:49,535
What are you doing?

364
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:58,152
Take this to the gallery tomorrow and give it to Yi Seol.

365
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:20,759
Make sure to tell her it's a gift from me, Mommy!

366
00:43:21,597 --> 00:43:24,870
Okay. I will.

367
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:45,818
Let's have a talk.

368
00:44:02,622 --> 00:44:04,695
What are you going to do about this?

369
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,205
Because of you, I now have a child born out of wedlock.

370
00:44:12,205 --> 00:44:14,142
Hyeon Woo's your son.

371
00:44:14,142 --> 00:44:17,709
I never wanted a child born like this.

372
00:44:27,913 --> 00:44:30,694
Hyeon Woo wants me to give this to Yi Seol.

373
00:44:30,694 --> 00:44:33,570
He said she liked apples best, just like he does.

374
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:37,182
What I'm going to do is to think about

375
00:44:38,655 --> 00:44:40,980
Yi Seol's pain,

376
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:44,503
her death,

377
00:44:45,952 --> 00:44:49,416
and how to explain those to Hyeon Woo.

378
00:44:50,908 --> 00:44:53,841
I have to tell him about all that.

379
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,030
You'd do that without my permission?

380
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,610
Huh?

381
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,220
Then why did you have to make this mess in the first place? Why?

382
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:38,231
If you can't accept Hyeon Woo as your son,

383
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,957
we can get a divorce.

384
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:43,840
Thank you for everything.

385
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,180
Let me know how things go.

386
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:50,340
Sure. Take care.

387
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:43,277
How do you have my number?

388
00:47:43,706 --> 00:47:48,773
I had yours because Yi Seol gave it to me.

389
00:47:48,773 --> 00:47:51,226
When you work as a reporter,

390
00:47:51,226 --> 00:47:55,102
one skill that you absolutely need is finding information.

391
00:47:57,484 --> 00:48:01,480
I received the letter from Yi Seol.

392
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:06,415
That was a letter?

393
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:10,804
I had no idea what was in the packet.

394
00:48:11,337 --> 00:48:17,543
Yi Seol just gave it to me in case something bad happens.

395
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:20,129
And I only had guesses.

396
00:48:22,998 --> 00:48:30,881
Do you have anything to tell me about her death?

397
00:48:33,841 --> 00:48:37,780
I'm with you on this. You can trust me.

398
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,625
Don't worry.

399
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:45,490
Everything will be out soon.

400
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:50,730
Mrs. Yoon and Prosecutor Park are helping me.

401
00:48:51,307 --> 00:48:54,677
We'll first reveal that her death was not a suicide.

402
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:58,111
And we'll make sure whoever killed her

403
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:01,333
pays for what he did.

404
00:50:00,913 --> 00:50:03,913
I know it's your favorite since childhood.

405
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:09,799
Your mother was a good cook, and her eel seaweed soup was unrivaled.

406
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,697
This is probably not as good as hers,

407
00:50:12,697 --> 00:50:17,855
but I got it from a decent place, so I'm sure it's good.

408
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:24,606
You lived with her until you were three.

409
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:26,546
Do you remember anything?

410
00:50:26,546 --> 00:50:33,530
She would do the extra work to remove all the bones for you…

411
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,698
I'll stop talking. Keep eating.

412
00:50:38,698 --> 00:50:40,616
Go ahead.

413
00:50:48,885 --> 00:50:52,385
I believe in you.

414
00:50:52,385 --> 00:50:56,027
You would never do such an unspeakable thing.

415
00:50:56,027 --> 00:50:58,902
You're my own son, so I know.

416
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:03,600
I hate that I'm your son.

417
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,284
I've hated that all my life,

418
00:51:06,284 --> 00:51:08,940
and I forever will.

419
00:51:10,088 --> 00:51:11,710
Right.

420
00:51:12,399 --> 00:51:17,506
I'm okay with that. That's what fathers are for, anyway.

421
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:22,920
But... don't be harsh on Hyeon Woo, after all

422
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,700
he's your own son.

423
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:28,512
As pathetic as I am, you turned out a real success.

424
00:51:28,512 --> 00:51:33,241
And imagine how great your son will grow up to be.

425
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:39,783
He's not a Seo nor a Yoon. He's a Jung.

426
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:46,810
You know very well why Joon Il never really lived out his potential.

427
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,320
Don't let that happen to Hyeon Woo.

428
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:56,150
Don't let him suffer the same ridicule.

429
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:23,180
Long time no see, Mrs. Yoon.

430
00:52:26,636 --> 00:52:28,720
How have you been?

431
00:52:29,596 --> 00:52:34,209
I have been well, but you don't look like you are.

432
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:42,949
Has something happened?

433
00:52:45,897 --> 00:52:48,840
A person died because of me.

434
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,000
Won't you scold me for that?

435
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,829
That must be tough for you.

436
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:04,400
Well, I'm not really sure.

437
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:08,607
I just know that I'm scared.

438
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:12,311
And a part of me says it wasn't my fault.

439
00:53:14,617 --> 00:53:19,630
And I just want to run away from all this.

440
00:53:22,297 --> 00:53:27,436
If you could, then you wouldn't be thinking about that.

441
00:53:29,732 --> 00:53:33,334
I only wanted to be successful.

442
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:38,479
I thought everything would fall into place with enough effort.

443
00:53:39,627 --> 00:53:45,703
I never thought that looking out for my own success could sometimes

444
00:53:45,703 --> 00:53:48,395
hurt other people.

445
00:53:50,652 --> 00:53:56,830
I still don't understand what I've done so wrong.

446
00:53:57,965 --> 00:54:02,840
I don't know what I have to do next.

447
00:54:04,552 --> 00:54:10,210
I'm sure you'll find a way to handle this.

448
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:16,057
Don't talk as if that'd be easy.

449
00:54:17,084 --> 00:54:22,726
I still hate you so much, Dad.

450
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:00,800
This has the video testimony of Park Yong Seob and the text file.

451
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,400
Have you found Yi Seol's phone yet?

452
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,886
I've searched the entire building

453
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:14,410
and the surrounding area, but it's nowhere to be found.

454
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:19,297
And the CCTV data for the past month had already been deleted.

455
00:55:23,655 --> 00:55:27,893
Are you sure it was Joon Hyeok who did this?

456
00:55:29,899 --> 00:55:31,732
Well…

457
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:36,616
When I first started suspecting him,

458
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:41,374
I was scared that a part of me still believed in him.

459
00:55:42,741 --> 00:55:46,165
And when I started growing certain of it,

460
00:55:46,165 --> 00:55:51,294
it scared me that my own husband did such a thing.

461
00:55:53,512 --> 00:55:59,319
He's still Hyeon Woo's father. So, it'd be better if he hadn't.

462
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:08,988
What if he's free from all charges regarding Yi Seol's death?

463
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,594
I'd still have to get a divorce.

464
00:56:12,598 --> 00:56:17,740
I don't think he'll truly accept Hyeon Woo as his son.

465
00:56:18,762 --> 00:56:20,650
What about the grandfather?

466
00:56:21,176 --> 00:56:26,901
You'll lose custody if he reveals that Hyeon Woo was adopted in secret.

467
00:56:26,901 --> 00:56:33,705
If that were to happen, they might change all of Hyeon Woo's records.

468
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:36,643
That's not going to happen.

469
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:42,219
They won't reveal anything that might be a weakness for them.

470
00:56:43,878 --> 00:56:48,170
That's what led to all this, after all.

471
00:57:59,115 --> 00:58:01,060
Hyeon Woo.

472
00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:06,593
Miss, where's Hyeon Woo?

473
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:09,930
Welcome home.

474
00:58:13,652 --> 00:58:19,590
Hyeon Woo's with his grandfather, so don't worry.

475
00:58:27,992 --> 00:58:31,730
You should have called beforehand.

476
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:35,133
Were you out on an appointment?

477
00:58:36,741 --> 00:58:41,750
No, I just visited my father.

478
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,658
Right.

479
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:48,680
So, how is he doing?

480
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:56,913
He's doing well, as always.

481
00:58:56,913 --> 00:59:00,890
Doing well, as always…

482
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:04,120
That's a privilege not everyone's given.

483
00:59:10,438 --> 00:59:13,640
Why the sudden visit, may I ask?

484
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:22,040
You said you'd ruin it all if you can't have it all.

485
00:59:25,786 --> 00:59:28,600
I heard you've found a way.

486
00:59:46,905 --> 00:59:50,959
You can do it like this.

487
00:59:50,959 --> 00:59:53,493
Boy, you're smart.

488
00:59:53,493 --> 00:59:57,820
Sweetie, can you help me out, too?

489
01:00:00,644 --> 01:00:02,668
Daddy!

490
01:00:07,822 --> 01:00:09,810
Hi, Joon Hyeok.

491
01:00:29,431 --> 01:00:33,064
- Are you having fun with Grandpa? 
 - Yeah!

492
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,530
You can keep playing.

493
01:00:46,496 --> 01:00:49,110
How did you know?

494
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:55,183
I warned you there are things that you simply can't manage.

495
01:00:55,183 --> 01:00:58,910
Joon Hyeok called Yi Seol to his office.

496
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:01,397
And he lied about that.

497
01:01:01,397 --> 01:01:05,982
You don't know the difference between a secret and a lie.

498
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:10,722
He must have done something he had to hide.

499
01:01:10,722 --> 01:01:13,931
That's merely a guess of yours.

500
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:19,300
He did not murder Kim Yi Seol.

501
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:27,240
You say so, but that's also a mere guess.

502
01:01:28,331 --> 01:01:30,319
Kim Yi Seol,

503
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,693
I had her killed.

504
01:01:38,935 --> 01:01:44,290
Master Joon Hyeok called Kim Yi Seol to his office.

505
01:01:46,021 --> 01:01:51,290
Does he know what she's been saying about him?

506
01:01:56,496 --> 01:02:00,688
 I gave birth to Hyeon Woo.

507
01:02:00,688 --> 01:02:03,490
 Mrs. Yoon adopted him, not knowing.

508
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:07,460
 - And Chairwoman Seo Han Sook was behind it. 
 - Hey.

509
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:10,392
 What makes you think I'll buy that?

510
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:13,060
 It is true.

511
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,800
 How dare you?

512
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,540
 Why are you doing this? Who is it?

513
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,595
 Tell me who it is!

514
01:02:20,595 --> 01:02:23,670
 Who put you up to this?

515
01:02:27,214 --> 01:02:29,110
 Tell me!

516
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,850
 Who put you up to this?

517
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,106
 Who told you to threaten me like this?

518
01:02:36,106 --> 01:02:37,817
 Tell me right now!

519
01:02:37,817 --> 01:02:40,014
 Tell me right now!

520
01:03:19,776 --> 01:03:22,630

521
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:24,315
Hello?

522
01:03:24,315 --> 01:03:26,551
Are you with Kim Yi Seol?

523
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:29,310
What is she even talking about?

524
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,010
Is it true?

525
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,990
I'll explain everything.

526
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:36,020
Come over to the house.

527
01:04:53,990 --> 01:05:01,550

528
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:11,790

529
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,980

530
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,420

531
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:17,030

532
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:39,667
 I'll do anything it takes to protect you.

533
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:41,918
 So, you put your trust in me.

534
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:43,570
 And don't forget.

535
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:48,470
 You've never even seen Yi Seol today.

536
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,418
 Understood?

537
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:04,380
I'm sure you understand the situation.

538
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:11,090
If you stop now, I'll forgive you for everything.

539
01:07:13,097 --> 01:07:16,770
But if you choose to go against me,

540
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:21,370
I assure you that everything you've accomplished

541
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:25,050
will go to complete ruin.

542
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:30,303
 Kim Yi Seol...

543
01:07:31,072 --> 01:07:32,873
 did not commit suicide.

544
01:07:32,873 --> 01:07:37,440
 The police have put the man in the video under witness protection

545
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,963
 and investigating the possibility of murder.

546
01:07:41,963 --> 01:07:46,908
 The prime suspect is known to be a prosecutor currently in office.

547
01:07:46,908 --> 01:07:52,450
 And the police have already identified his whereabouts.

548
01:07:56,615 --> 01:07:58,494
Mr. Park Jung Ho?

549
01:08:00,404 --> 01:08:04,730
You are under arrest for the murder of Kim Yi Seol.

550
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:17,095
The choice is yours.

551
01:08:18,197 --> 01:08:20,630
What will it be?

552
01:08:37,388 --> 01:08:42,420

553
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:52,090

554
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:06,050
 A prosecutor sold a child to help his lover.

555
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:11,941
 And to hide that fact, he killed Kim Yi Seol, the biological mother.

556
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:13,617
 When will Jung Ho be released?

557
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:16,360
 You know who'll be next after him.

558
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,290
 How have you been, Mrs. Yoon?

559
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:20,956
 I want you out of the picture before Joon Hyeok starts his campaign.

560
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:23,300
 - You crazy bitch! 
 - Hey!

561
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,400
 - Are you crazy? 
 - I am, bitch!

562
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,770
 I'd say, good for you.

563
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:31,170
 I'm sure it makes you feel less guilty

564
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:34,862
 to know that the one that killed her is doing so well.

565
01:09:34,862 --> 01:09:37,310
 You're not even human.

566
01:09:38,794 --> 01:09:40,695
 That's what I'm going to tell myself.

567
01:09:40,695 --> 01:09:45,380
 And although I'm scared of you, in a way I'll feel superior to you.

568
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,482
 Like that…
