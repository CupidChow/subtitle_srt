1
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:04,615

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:13,130

3
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,649
 Mrs. Yoon will be here soon.

4
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:08,066
 Right now,

5
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:12,206
 it's only the two of us.

6
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:51,945
 I've never…

7
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:56,019
 lived my own life before.

8
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,930
 I've always had to do as others wanted.

9
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:08,273
 We are not supposed to do this.

10
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:21,701
 With you,

11
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,016
 I can truly be myself

12
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:31,437
 in just a small aspect of my life.

13
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:38,987
 You… have a wife.

14
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,766
 I know perfectly that Yoon Jae Hee is a great mother

15
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:53,120
 and a remarkable woman, indeed.

16
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,912
 But she doesn't make my heart race.

17
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:12,006
 Then...

18
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:16,889
 Can you divorce her?

19
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:26,196
 Is that what you want?

20
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:30,800
 Answer me.

21
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:35,824
 Can you… divorce your wife?

22
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,072
Where do you think you're going?

23
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:47,725
You haven't answered me yet.

24
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:51,479
We can talk again when you've made up your mind.

25
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:57,736
I see you're quite confident.

26
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:40,955
Do you want a divorce?

27
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:48,719
Stop wasting time on insignificant things.

28
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,891
I didn't think you'd need another explanation.

29
00:05:58,284 --> 00:05:59,774
Are you…

30
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:02,799
jealous?

31
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,525
Would you like a taste

32
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:12,761
of the consequences of those "insignificant things?"

33
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,075
Where is Mrs. Yoon?

34
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:19,470
Probably at the concert hall.

35
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,574
I told her Mr. Jung was here, and she left.

36
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:38,161

37
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,621
Where are you?

38
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:19,047
 I know perfectly well

39
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:23,949
 that Yoon Jae Hee is a great mother

40
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,017
 and a remarkable woman, indeed.

41
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:30,691
 But she doesn't make my heart race.

42
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,196
Where are you? I'll come to you.

43
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:26,806
No, don't come.

44
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,410
 With you,

45
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,616
 I can truly be myself

46
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:51,403
 in just a small aspect of my life.

47
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:13,513

48
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,950

49
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,499

50
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:38,034
Hello, sir.

51
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,713
Sit.

52
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,570
Open it.

53
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,200

54
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:51,581

55
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:57,386
Take a look at it before we summon all those involved.

56
00:11:57,386 --> 00:12:01,289
Make sure they don't have anything up their sleeves.

57
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,725
Did you… receive this from Sungjin?

58
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,197
What does it matter where I got it from?

59
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:15,550
Hey, Jung Ho.

60
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,510
Yes.

61
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:20,285
Each one of us, 2,292 prosecutors in Korea,

62
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:23,700
are an independent investigator in their own right.

63
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,831
But when a prosecutor discovers a crime,

64
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,585
what does he do?

65
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,490
It's not like I'm making you do anything wrong.

66
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:39,187
I'm not even asking you to make something up out of thin air.

67
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:41,888
It's their fault for breaking the law.

68
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:43,477
Am I wrong?

69
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:51,381
There are times when everyone's fate converges into one outcome.

70
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,520
We all used to stand alone,

71
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,262
but now we're uniting under one mission

72
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:59,712
to make Jung Joon Hyeok president.

73
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:06,001
You don't have to if you don't want to.

74
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,690
There are plenty who would love to have the opportunity.

75
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,184
Let's be honest.

76
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:16,915
Who do you think wants this to happen the most?

77
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:18,967
Isn't it Yoon Jae Hee?

78
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:21,978
So what is stopping you?

79
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,661

80
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:57,307

81
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,350

82
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,150

83
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,050

84
00:14:21,418 --> 00:14:23,156
One second.

85
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,043
Jae Hee!

86
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:41,023
Are you all right?

87
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:46,721
There.

88
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:49,905
- I'm sorry to be bothering you like this. 
 - Don't say that.

89
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,666
I wasn't sure what to get,

90
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,611
so I got these.

91
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,921
This will do.

92
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:00,620
Oh, okay.

93
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,434
By the way, why did you walk all the way here from the gallery?

94
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,382
Just because…

95
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:16,512
You know, sometimes,

96
00:15:17,303 --> 00:15:19,756
you just feel like taking a walk.

97
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:29,327
And this is where you ended up?

98
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,312
Isn't that something?

99
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:35,320
It's just a coincidence, really.

100
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,117
Well, I'm sure it was.

101
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:41,225
I think both you and Joon Hyeok are awesome people.

102
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,513
I-I'm curious

103
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:45,810
h-how the preparations are going for the talk concert.

104
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,625
Oh, I… I can give you a lift home.

105
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:54,107
No, it's fine. You should get back to work.

106
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:56,587
Just wait here a bit. My car's parked nearby.

107
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:57,906
You shouldn't walk with that foot.

108
00:16:57,906 --> 00:16:59,720
I said I'm fine.

109
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,460
You don't have to worry.

110
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:06,556
I'm just worried Joon Hyeok might be disappointed that I didn't help you.

111
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:08,105
Don't worry about that.

112
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:10,363
- Still… 
 - Dong Min.

113
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:16,282
Just because I'm smiling doesn't mean I'm not serious.

114
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:22,356
Wouldn't it make you uncomfortable

115
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:24,680
if I turned you down with a frown?

116
00:17:29,202 --> 00:17:30,942
Thanks anyways.

117
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,740

118
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,854
Ms. Kim Yi Seol.

119
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,609
Mrs. Yoon isn't here.

120
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,629
Actually, I'm here to talk to you about No Young Joo.

121
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,177

122
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:17,220
Ms. Yoon doesn't know about you and No Young Joo, yet.

123
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,158
She'll be shocked if she finds out about your hidden intention.

124
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,900
Ms. Kim Yi Seol.

125
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:34,602
Ms. Yoon does not have anything to do with No Young Joo's death.

126
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:40,046
I did everything myself, from reporting her death and taking care of her belongings.

127
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:47,990
Please leave before she finds out about this.

128
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,536
If I just leave,

129
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:56,602
do you think

130
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,900
she won't have any more problems?

131
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,360

132
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,370

133
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:15,650
I heard the birth mother was in a top university.

134
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:18,850
There are quite a few girls like that working as escorts.

135
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,074
It looks like No Young Joo brought somebody she knew.

136
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:24,264
Have you found the broker yet?

137
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,230
Don't get me started.

138
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,422
It looks like word got around,

139
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:31,353
and the guy reached out to me first so I ran a check on his number.

140
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:34,818
It was a burner phone. This guy is a professional.

141
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,570
When he sent me this document, he said

142
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:41,695
he wanted to talk about money after we've seen the document.

143
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:45,347
He knew that it would make us more generous

144
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:49,135
when we learned that we'd lost a healthy child.

145
00:20:49,135 --> 00:20:52,303
That must have been his strategy.

146
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:56,120
By the way,

147
00:20:57,271 --> 00:21:01,116
are you sure it will be good for us to find the child at this point?

148
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:04,529
- What about for Joon Hyeok? 
 - You don't have to worry.

149
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,784
I've come up with a plan.

150
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:18,077
Cho Kang Hyeon has started the investigation on the Minister of Land.

151
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:23,545
Then I'll have my people lobby the Redevelopment Association.

152
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:27,136
This is for Joon Hyeok's presidential election.

153
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:30,830
Be careful not to let it drag on for too long.

154
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,536
It's for our oldest son. Of course, I'll be careful.

155
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:35,815
This has to go well

156
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:39,586
to make sure there's enough money to buy Sungjin Electronics shares.

157
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:46,346
But what good is all this effort going to do

158
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,904
without a grandson to inherit Sungjin?

159
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:52,052
Yu Ri will marry and join another family.

160
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:55,532
Remember not to speak of such things in front of Joo Yeon.

161
00:21:55,532 --> 00:22:00,204
Why bother nagging a daughter-in-law when she's already quite old?

162
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:04,090
I don't think the bloodline should matter too much.

163
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,471
Adoption could be a way to add a valuable asset to the family.

164
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:11,147
We'll be setting an example.

165
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:15,283
If an adopted child inherits Sungjin,

166
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:18,569
nobody will criticize us for nepotism.

167
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:23,430
Although for some, this might only complicate things.

168
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:08,291
 You're invited to join the family breakfast.

169
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,326
 Would you like a taste

170
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:28,601
 of the consequences of those

171
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:31,089
 "insignificant things?"

172
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,410

173
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:06,365
 You're invited to join the family breakfast.

174
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:49,315
 I know perfectly that Yoon Jae Hee is a great mother

175
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:53,090
 and a remarkable woman, indeed.

176
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,084
 But she doesn't make my heart race.

177
00:26:02,522 --> 00:26:08,296
 With you, I can truly be myself

178
00:26:09,363 --> 00:26:11,146
 in just a small aspect of my life.

179
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,082
♫  I used to believe I could have it all  ♫

180
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:25,054
♫  The traces I left as I fought my way  ♫

181
00:26:25,093 --> 00:26:31,851
♫  God help me to see all the things I have done that I didn't deserve  ♫

182
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:36,893
♫  In the past  ♫

183
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:47,909
♫  Let me be there  ♫

184
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:56,367
♫  So that I can find myself  ♫

185
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:04,121
♫  Hold me, please  ♫

186
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:13,840
♫  To find myself someday  ♫

187
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:52,640
 This is your last chance.

188
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,232
 You can tell me if you don't want this.

189
00:27:56,437 --> 00:27:59,109
 You know I'm not a good man, right?

190
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:02,916
 Are you scared that I'll abandon you?

191
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:07,080
 A good man is not what I need.

192
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:11,675
 There is only one thing I expect from you.

193
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,850
 To have the world at your feet.

194
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:24,873
♫  Don't leave me alone  ♫

195
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:32,696
♫  In the darkness of this city  ♫

196
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:40,646
♫  As I struggle to reach  ♫

197
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:49,292
♫  The dim light  ♫

198
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,880
♫  Let me be there  ♫

199
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:07,888
♫  To find myself someday  ♫

200
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:56,108
Up to this point, it's going to be similar to the script you wrote.

201
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,117
There won't be much that's new.

202
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,629
Except for this last one.

203
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:09,869
I've never seen this piece myself.

204
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:12,301
I don't even know who owns it.

205
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:16,520
The painter couldn't even afford paints when he first started.

206
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,620
Later he started making his name

207
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,679
and living in comfort when he painted this.

208
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,308
It's a memory of his life in poverty

209
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:31,527
which now hangs in some rich person's living room.

210
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:34,350
I wonder how he'd feel about that.

211
00:30:39,196 --> 00:30:42,665
You must be offended by what my husband did.

212
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:48,960
Are you okay?

213
00:30:50,737 --> 00:30:52,968
Well, I…

214
00:30:55,595 --> 00:31:00,204
To be honest, I suspected you.

215
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:03,890
I thought you might be one of those

216
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,799
trying to seduce him, hoping to take my place

217
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,307
by his side.

218
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:13,315
- Mrs. Yoon. 
 - I knew you'd never do such a thing.

219
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:18,976
If this were just your problem,

220
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:25,017
I would have taken your side like any good friend would.

221
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,144
Actually,

222
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:32,735
I would have jumped right in and given him a good slap.

223
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:37,268
But weirdly enough,

224
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:40,844
I found myself

225
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:45,602
doubting your intention, thinking you might have

226
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:48,976
let him make a move on you.

227
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:51,990
The more I thought about it,

228
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:58,507
the more I found myself blaming you

229
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:01,940
for not being careful enough.

230
00:32:05,462 --> 00:32:09,746
He also knows about the relationship between us.

231
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,289
And I didn't want to even entertain the thought

232
00:32:15,563 --> 00:32:18,690
that it was just him all along.

233
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:26,984
It would have been too humiliating for me.

234
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:33,830
So you would rather be suspicious of me?

235
00:32:46,612 --> 00:32:50,082
You once asked why I married a man like him.

236
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:55,396
 No, no. Don't touch. Wait.

237
00:32:55,396 --> 00:32:57,029
 - Are you ready? 
 - Yes.

238
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:00,450
 - Are you excited? 
 - Yes, I am.

239
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,320
 Now, I'm going to count down.

240
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,883
 - Are you ready? 
 - Yes!

241
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,038
 - Here we go. 
 - Yes!

242
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,516
 Three, two, one!

243
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:12,408
 Go!

244
00:33:15,904 --> 00:33:17,578
 We did it!

245
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,870
 Yes!

246
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,020
 I did it, Mom!

247
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,986
 That was awesome!

248
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,169
My son is my reason.

249
00:33:39,424 --> 00:33:41,474
He was adopted.

250
00:33:41,474 --> 00:33:43,670
And nobody knows.

251
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,974
I had to protect my position as Jung Joon Hyeok's wife.

252
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,740
Seol,

253
00:34:03,264 --> 00:34:06,430
I love that man so much.

254
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:11,474
Will you help me

255
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:18,020
so that I won't have doubts about you?

256
00:34:24,243 --> 00:34:28,544
I need to know that you're truly loyal to me.

257
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:51,712
If my parents say anything that disturbs you, just ignore it.

258
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:52,947
What's up?

259
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:54,683
What?

260
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:57,575
Or they might not say anything.

261
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:06,709
Why are you alone? Where is Jae Hee?

262
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:10,204
Oh, she's not feeling well.

263
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:12,410
Did you have a fight?

264
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,550
Stop talking about such nonsense.

265
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:22,390
Jun Il!

266
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,749
What's up with Joon Hyeok?

267
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:30,551
It looks like Jae Hee's not well.

268
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:32,516
What? Is she sick?

269
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:34,994
How would he know?

270
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:37,953
You can ask Joon Hyeok yourself.

271
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:41,490
Or is my husband just easier to talk to?

272
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,519
Let's go.

273
00:35:57,264 --> 00:35:59,573
How's everything going?

274
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:04,759
I heard you're working late preparing for the concert.

275
00:36:05,754 --> 00:36:10,670
I heard Jae Hee had to go out to meet some potential panel guests.

276
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,621
I'm excited to see what brilliant people she'll bring on board.

277
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:19,582
I thought she was home resting because she's sick.

278
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:27,960
Was she not home last night?

279
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:32,130
What?

280
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,800
You don't even know where your wife is and with whom?

281
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:43,054
I don't know what this is about, but you need to fix this soon.

282
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:46,597
Her presence will be indispensable in many events.

283
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:49,910
I'm sure that you know better than anyone else how instrumental

284
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,710
your wife was in getting you to where you are right now.

285
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,750
It's hard to find anyone with such devotion, these days.

286
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,850
Devotion to his success or her own?

287
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,606
She's as cunning as a fox.

288
00:37:02,606 --> 00:37:06,190
A great wife would have told her husband

289
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,634
if she wasn't going to be home.

290
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:12,068
There must be a reason.

291
00:37:12,068 --> 00:37:15,316
She would have come home if there hadn't been

292
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,734
some kind of a problem.

293
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:20,270
Think about that.

294
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:33,217
Why did you just do that?

295
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,618
Even if you noticed something was up,

296
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:38,233
you didn't have to bring that up, did you?

297
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:40,325
Why start trouble?

298
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:44,769
You talk as if I'm causing all conflicts in this family.

299
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:48,905
Why can't you try to be on good terms with everybody?

300
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:51,140
Let me ask you this.

301
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:56,100
Why are you so obsessed with being on good terms with everybody?

302
00:37:57,042 --> 00:38:00,600
That's… because we are family.

303
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:05,604
So you want me to keep my mouth shut

304
00:38:05,604 --> 00:38:07,630
for your fantasy of a happy family?

305
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,344
Joo Yeon, why are you being so offensive?

306
00:38:10,444 --> 00:38:12,628
You pity your father and Joon Hyeok,

307
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:14,607
and in the meantime,

308
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:16,980
you wish that Mother were kinder to them

309
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,130
and that Joon Il would be more understanding.

310
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,323
- And I'm sick of that goody-two-shoes act of yours. 
 - Joo Yeon!

311
00:38:22,323 --> 00:38:24,710
Consider yourself lucky

312
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,482
that you aren't involved in any of the fights and keep it that way.

313
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:30,880
And stop judging me.

314
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:36,780
Oh, and I suggest

315
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,383
you stop doing anything stupid

316
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:42,322
like telling my husband to look after Joon Hyeok.

317
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:53,717
After the talk concert,

318
00:38:53,717 --> 00:38:57,713
we will conduct another poll on presidential candidates.

319
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:00,165
If you're one of the top three,

320
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:01,881
we will have Congressman Min Seong Sik

321
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,599
lead a task force team in your support.

322
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:07,330
I'll have to think about whether it will be the right move

323
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,905
to join the Liberty Reformation Party.

324
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:10,817
Congressman Min

325
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:14,241
is a real strategist who has made two presidents.

326
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:19,058
Although politics in Korea depends more on people than parties,

327
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:23,100
it is impossible to win the presidency without a party's support.

328
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,738
But still, the public perception of that party is…

329
00:39:26,738 --> 00:39:30,188
Well, that's why they need you.

330
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:36,840
I'm getting the impression that they're trying to use me.

331
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:43,720
You like to play the victim.

332
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,514
Is that a habit you've acquired playing the poor and pitiful stepson?

333
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:51,681
He's doing this to help the family.

334
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,123
Why are you being so harsh?

335
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:56,700
You don't think I have anything against Joon Il?

336
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:01,022
If you feel that you're

337
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:06,424
making a sacrifice just for the sake of others, you can quit now.

338
00:40:06,424 --> 00:40:10,602
There are always other people I can use.

339
00:40:13,281 --> 00:40:18,417
You shouldn't blame others for the problems that you created.

340
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:21,125
It's unfair.

341
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:27,151
If I have a habit of playing the victim, it's all because of you.

342
00:40:27,151 --> 00:40:31,712
You've always treated Father and me like we were your servants.

343
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:33,430
Joon Hyeok.

344
00:40:34,713 --> 00:40:38,508
You chose to marry Father to avoid the ridicule of giving birth out of wedlock.

345
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:41,600
So you shouldn't have been so hard on us.

346
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:48,450
Make up your mind.

347
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,321
Are you the pathetic bastard

348
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:54,160
who suffered from a vicious stepmother

349
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,998
or a proud son of the white knight

350
00:40:56,998 --> 00:41:00,710
who saved this single mother from misery?

351
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,693
Don't switch characters like that on a whim.

352
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:07,020
I find that quite disgusting.

353
00:41:53,402 --> 00:41:59,230
Now, everything depends on what you do.

354
00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:04,427
If I'm indeed trying to steal your husband,

355
00:42:04,427 --> 00:42:08,030
I could use your secret to my advantage.

356
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:12,870
But then,

357
00:42:15,395 --> 00:42:22,170
if I keep your secret, will you trust me?

358
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,331
If you do that,

359
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:36,630
then I'll trust you completely.

360
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:13,143
Were you not home last night?

361
00:43:14,053 --> 00:43:16,400
Did Joon Hyeok tell you?

362
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,130
You know he would never tell.

363
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,510
I hope it's nothing too serious.

364
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,580
I'm curious about something.

365
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:37,714
Why did you turn a blind eye

366
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:41,450
when you already knew Hyeon Woo was adopted?

367
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:58,412
Always so blatantly honest and tough to handle.

368
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:04,511
I'm talking about you.

369
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:12,099
Any woman in your shoes would have sided against me

370
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:16,440
because I don't favor her husband.

371
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,235
But you're not like that.

372
00:44:19,235 --> 00:44:21,620
You don't side with anyone.

373
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,960
You simply took what you needed and wanted from both.

374
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,400
It's because no one would accept me.

375
00:44:31,241 --> 00:44:35,051
I hate him to the bone.

376
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:38,950
The way he acts like he deserves everything…

377
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,808
He probably takes that from his mother.

378
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:46,575
What's even worse is the way Jae Hee treats Father.

379
00:44:46,575 --> 00:44:51,190
How dare she talk back to him and ignore him?

380
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,004
Hey,

381
00:44:53,004 --> 00:44:58,355
I didn't know you were so fond of him.

382
00:44:58,355 --> 00:45:00,728
That's not it.

383
00:45:00,728 --> 00:45:03,172
She only landed Joon Hyeok because he's a bastard.

384
00:45:03,172 --> 00:45:08,013
She never deserved to be part of this family.

385
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:12,122
But she forgets her place and acts like she's something.

386
00:45:12,122 --> 00:45:16,619
I also noticed Jae Hee can sometimes be overly confident.

387
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:19,590
We need to teach her a lesson.

388
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,113
How will you do that?

389
00:45:22,113 --> 00:45:25,153
Will you arrange a meeting with Congressman Min for me?

390
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:29,360
Everyone is the same, after all.

391
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,557
Each person has their own problems.

392
00:45:32,557 --> 00:45:36,213
Problems they won't share with anyone else.

393
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:41,720
So they come to think that they've been dealt an unfair card

394
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,679
and feel that nobody in the world understands them.

395
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:49,701
That's human nature.

396
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:10,859
 You chose to marry Father to avoid the ridicule of giving birth out of wedlock.

397
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,940
 So you shouldn't have been so hard on us.

398
00:46:25,002 --> 00:46:28,705
I thought you went out with Mother.

399
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:32,150
She sent me to fetch something.

400
00:46:34,468 --> 00:46:38,079
Well then, I'll see you.

401
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,620
She bought it herself.

402
00:47:04,645 --> 00:47:07,343
Your mother bought

403
00:47:07,343 --> 00:47:12,800
the frame herself, when she could have had me do it.

404
00:47:13,652 --> 00:47:16,552
She took her time with it,

405
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:21,798
looking through the album and picking out the photo.

406
00:47:25,795 --> 00:47:27,380
I see.

407
00:47:33,776 --> 00:47:35,890
Thank you, Seon Mi.

408
00:47:53,393 --> 00:47:58,008
 Such self-pity makes them magnanimous about their own faults.

409
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:01,910
What is this?

410
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,269
I have no idea.

411
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:07,269
- Did No Young Joo give birth to a child? 
 - No!

412
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:09,315
- When did she? 
 - I don't know.

413
00:48:09,315 --> 00:48:11,692
Where is the baby? Where did you hide it?

414
00:48:11,692 --> 00:48:14,153
I never hid anything!

415
00:48:14,153 --> 00:48:16,320
This is nonsense!

416
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,183
Get back here right now!

417
00:48:19,183 --> 00:48:22,400
Talk to me!

418
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,520
 And they think they're the ones with the deepest scars.

419
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:33,281
Well, I don't think the polls matter too much.

420
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:36,913
I just hope that you will take good care of Joon Hyeok.

421
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,680
Think of him as your own son.

422
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,099
Well, I'm just doing my job

423
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,702
as a party leader acquiring such a great asset as Joon Hyeok.

424
00:48:44,702 --> 00:48:50,264
This must be why you're so well-respected, Congressman Min.

425
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:52,500
There aren't many men

426
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,699
as kindly disposed of as Mr. Jung in my experience.

427
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:58,413
Don't you agree?

428
00:48:58,413 --> 00:49:00,399
Of course.

429
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:07,078
He's always cheerful and ebullient and quite pleasant to look at.

430
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:09,211
If he had been born into a better family,

431
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:14,220
he would never have married the likes of Seo Han Sook.

432
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,806
Don't you agree?

433
00:49:16,806 --> 00:49:19,030
Oh, sure.

434
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:23,102
In that case, would you consider switching places with me?

435
00:49:23,102 --> 00:49:24,900
I mean wives.

436
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:31,101
Come on. That was way over the line.

437
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,458
I hope you're not offended or anything, Mr. Jung.

438
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:35,272
Oh, by no means.

439
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:39,752
I would gladly switch places with you if I could.

440
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:42,448
Of course.

441
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:45,770
I told you he's a man's man, didn't I?

442
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,870
Hyungnim...

443
00:49:59,781 --> 00:50:01,767
The broker said he will give us the child's whereabouts

444
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:03,692
after he meets you in person.

445
00:50:03,692 --> 00:50:06,538
As soon as we locate the child, we can start

446
00:50:06,538 --> 00:50:09,207
thinking of a plan to bring him back.

447
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,015
- Sounds good? 
 - Sure.

448
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,667
 And they think those scars give them justification

449
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:17,643
 to commit even greater sins.

450
00:50:25,591 --> 00:50:29,443
Your father-in-law knows that Hyeon Woo's adopted.

451
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:36,384
Don't be surprised.

452
00:50:36,384 --> 00:50:41,211
He's using this as an excuse to bring home Joon Hyeok.

453
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:49,431
What will your next move be?

454
00:50:52,724 --> 00:50:57,127
Please help me so that I can make the first move.

455
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,705
- Daddy. 
 - Yes.

456
00:52:17,705 --> 00:52:19,887
When is Mommy coming home?

457
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,715
She'll be home soon.

458
00:52:21,715 --> 00:52:24,824
It's quite late. Shall we go to bed?

459
00:52:26,388 --> 00:52:28,446
It's Mommy!

460
00:52:36,997 --> 00:52:40,811
Jae Hee invited me to dinner.

461
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,408
Mommy!

462
00:52:45,408 --> 00:52:47,810
- You're here. 
 - Yes, good evening.

463
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:53,830
Yi Seol!

464
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,515
What's your favorite fruit?

465
00:53:08,515 --> 00:53:10,095
Me?

466
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:11,731
Strawberries.

467
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,467
How about you?

468
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:15,916
I like apples most.

469
00:53:18,023 --> 00:53:19,625
What are you doing?

470
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:20,806
You should have discussed it with me.

471
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:24,119
You never discuss things with me beforehand.

472
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:29,634
It's nothing but a dinner with your favorite company.

473
00:53:30,164 --> 00:53:33,243
Don't flip out over nothing.

474
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:35,701
Anyone care for some wine?

475
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:37,793
Oh, of course.

476
00:53:37,793 --> 00:53:39,703
Wine sounds nice.

477
00:53:48,348 --> 00:53:52,842
- Daddy, isn't Yi Seol pretty? 
 - Yes.

478
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:55,291
I like her.

479
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:57,776
Her favorite fruit is apple.

480
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,705
It's my favorite, too.

481
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:03,665
Okay. It's time to sleep.

482
00:54:06,825 --> 00:54:11,415
Daddy, can you invite her again?

483
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:14,875
Yes? To come over and play with me.

484
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,560
Okay, I will. Let's sleep.

485
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,321
Anything I can help with?

486
00:54:29,843 --> 00:54:31,851
Will you take these wine glasses?

487
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,259
Sure.

488
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:36,440
You're okay, right?

489
00:54:38,214 --> 00:54:40,918
This is an opportunity to prove your intention.

490
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,173
I hope you seize it.

491
00:54:45,897 --> 00:54:47,612
Let's go.

492
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:56,901
Isn't it good?

493
00:54:56,901 --> 00:54:58,332
It is.

494
00:54:58,332 --> 00:55:01,148
This is some professional work.

495
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:05,621
Why don't you say something, Seol?

496
00:55:05,621 --> 00:55:07,847
He gave you a compliment.

497
00:55:12,651 --> 00:55:15,287
Thank you, Mr. Han.

498
00:55:16,806 --> 00:55:19,616
You're a good writer.

499
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:26,290
Mr. Han.

500
00:55:27,683 --> 00:55:30,219
Thank you, Yi Seol.

501
00:55:31,992 --> 00:55:35,205
I'll have water.

502
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:39,645
Any particular reason you can't drink?

503
00:55:39,645 --> 00:55:41,370
It's just…

504
00:55:44,144 --> 00:55:45,605
There.

505
00:55:55,126 --> 00:55:57,160
By the way,

506
00:56:02,577 --> 00:56:04,530
Seol and Dong Min,

507
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,653
you'll be seeing each other a lot.

508
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:11,217
Do we need all this formality?

509
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:14,207
Dong Min calls you by your name,

510
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:17,288
but you keep calling him Mr. Han.

511
00:56:17,288 --> 00:56:19,773
You should call him by his name.

512
00:56:19,773 --> 00:56:22,366
Or how about Oppa?

513
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:24,201
Oppa Dong Min.

514
00:56:24,201 --> 00:56:27,190
Don't guys like to be called, "Oppa?"

515
00:56:31,485 --> 00:56:35,644
Well, she might… be uncomfortable with that.

516
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:41,721
Some people these days find it inappropriate to use Oppa.

517
00:56:41,721 --> 00:56:44,844
It could leave an impression that I'm above her.

518
00:56:44,844 --> 00:56:47,037
- And– 
 - Is that it?

519
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:50,140
I'm sorry, Seol.

520
00:56:50,868 --> 00:56:52,689
It's okay.

521
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:55,947
As old as I am, I still have a lot to learn.

522
00:56:55,947 --> 00:56:57,880
I hope you understand.

523
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,468
I heard something funny recently.

524
00:57:03,468 --> 00:57:06,834
Something that I simply cannot understand.

525
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,225
What is it?

526
00:57:10,225 --> 00:57:12,638
Someone told me that

527
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,852
for a man, all other women besides his wife

528
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:17,984
are nothing but toys

529
00:57:17,984 --> 00:57:21,317
to quench their desires.

530
00:57:23,827 --> 00:57:26,150
What do you think that means?

531
00:57:30,018 --> 00:57:32,824
What kind of an asshole would say that?

532
00:57:34,524 --> 00:57:35,784
What?

533
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:39,009
Whoever said that unspeakable thing must be a total moron.

534
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:40,102
You think?

535
00:57:40,102 --> 00:57:41,996
Because of those ignorant few

536
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:44,596
all men in Korea have to share the blame.

537
00:57:44,596 --> 00:57:46,382
- Sunbaenim. 
 - Yes.

538
00:57:46,382 --> 00:57:49,216
Let this talk concert be an opportunity

539
00:57:49,735 --> 00:57:51,825
to prove yourself to the public.

540
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:54,926
Show them you're the man who can resolve the inter-generation

541
00:57:54,926 --> 00:57:57,180
and inter-gender conflicts.

542
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,573
Sure.

543
00:58:00,573 --> 00:58:03,840
That will be just perfect.

544
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,563
Don't you agree?

545
00:58:12,758 --> 00:58:16,522
Well then, shall we have a toast?

546
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,516
Cheers!

547
00:58:32,194 --> 00:58:33,850
Oh, the wine…

548
00:58:36,806 --> 00:58:38,988
Oh dear.

549
00:58:38,988 --> 00:58:40,652
Some tissue…

550
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:46,247
It's cold.

551
00:58:46,247 --> 00:58:48,030
Are you okay?

552
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,008
- You can sit. 
 - Okay.

553
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:11,205
I thought you knew better than to behave like this.

554
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,771
I planned this dinner for you.

555
00:59:13,771 --> 00:59:16,120
I see you're not enjoying it.

556
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:19,813
Then what would you like?

557
00:59:19,813 --> 00:59:21,572
Should I stop everything

558
00:59:21,572 --> 00:59:25,785
and tell the world that my husband is cheating on me?

559
00:59:25,785 --> 00:59:28,047
They'll say that after all

560
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,094
you're an asshole just like your father.

561
00:59:30,094 --> 00:59:32,757
- Shall I try saying it? 
 - Hey!

562
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,181
I would sometimes pity your mother

563
00:59:37,181 --> 00:59:40,010
for having to put up with your father.

564
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:43,716
But you're just the same.

565
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:46,709
I don't expect you to be a different man.

566
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:50,199
Just be careful in front of others.

567
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:52,139
Please.

568
00:59:58,823 --> 01:00:03,087
Also, I wanted to let you know that

569
01:00:03,087 --> 01:00:05,728
Yi Seol is not interested in you.

570
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:07,595
Too bad.

571
01:00:11,888 --> 01:00:14,010
Is that what she said?

572
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,980
And you believe that?

573
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:22,024
I'd better.

574
01:00:22,024 --> 01:00:23,960
I will.

575
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:27,334
Or else,

576
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:32,000
I might slit her throat myself.

577
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:15,531
It's scary indeed how people

578
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:18,872
change their minds so easily.

579
01:01:31,734 --> 01:01:33,940
 We'll begin the surgery.

580
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,694
 Scalpel.

581
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,930

582
01:02:28,029 --> 01:02:30,750
He looks exactly like his father.

583
01:02:40,326 --> 01:02:43,852
They all use their scars as weapons

584
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:49,805
only to face humiliation in the end.

585
01:03:25,996 --> 01:03:27,756
- Oh, by the way. 
 - Yes?

586
01:03:27,756 --> 01:03:30,874
Why are you so fond of my husband?

587
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:33,180
Why all of a sudden?

588
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:37,162
Well, I feel a bit awkward to say it,

589
01:03:37,162 --> 01:03:39,382
but I think he has the potential to bring

590
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:42,172
the right change to the world.

591
01:03:42,172 --> 01:03:44,812
You know how people with power

592
01:03:44,812 --> 01:03:47,818
only seem to use it to their own advantage.

593
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:35,946

594
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:49,960

595
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:56,914
 I was quite successful as an anchor.

596
01:04:58,129 --> 01:04:59,867
 What do you mean my child?

597
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:04,100
 I will not accept a child born out of a random woman as my own.

598
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,239
 I will not let this taint my reputation.

599
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:08,872
 The peace that I have dreamed of…

600
01:05:08,872 --> 01:05:11,382
 He's just paying the price.

601
01:05:11,382 --> 01:05:13,948
 Nothing comes for free.

602
01:05:13,948 --> 01:05:17,668
 I don't understand why everybody's so hesitant.

603
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:20,285
 You can just get rid of him.

604
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:26,726
 But I find it weird that you want her to divorce him

605
01:05:26,726 --> 01:05:28,746
 because you want to protect her.

606
01:05:28,746 --> 01:05:30,918
 - Take care of this as soon as possible.  
  - Yes, ma'am.

607
01:05:30,918 --> 01:05:33,147
 Do you think I'll back down so easily?

608
01:05:33,147 --> 01:05:37,940
 After all, I'll ruin his life for good.
