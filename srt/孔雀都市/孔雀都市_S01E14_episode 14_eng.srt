1
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:05,403
 You're a lot like me.

2
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:07,745
 And perhaps I'm just

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:11,274
 compensating for my past hardships by helping you.

4
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:13,050
 Back then, I hoped

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,025
 that somebody would come to my aid

6
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:18,671
 to protect me.

7
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:20,796
 That's because my husband and I,

8
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,526
 are more important than you.

9
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:25,858
 It's more important that everything goes according to plan.

10
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:30,152
 It's more important that we don't become fodder for rumors.

11
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:33,797
 You seem to have taken the moral high ground.

12
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:38,175
 But then, instead of pretending to care about me,

13
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:42,100
 you shouldn't have slept with my husband to begin with!

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,260

15
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:24,953
Yi Seol…

16
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,125
I had no other choice.

17
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:39,417
I really had…

18
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:43,647
no other choice.

19
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:48,394
What was all that pretense for

20
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:52,265
if you were going to do this anyway?

21
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:05,211
Don't worry. I understand how you feel about me.

22
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:06,719
Instead,

23
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:10,019
you just be a good girl.

24
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:15,509
Or you might get a scolding.

25
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,240
Understood?

26
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:43,127

27
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:49,026

28
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,729
Did you sleep well?

29
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:02,398
Yes.

30
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:22,001
- Where's Hyeon Woo? 
 - He went out to get chocolate milk.

31
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,867
So early in the morning?

32
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:25,979
We can't be spoiling him like that.

33
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,620
I didn't keep the promise to play dominoes with him.

34
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,432
If you start breaking promises like that,

35
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:35,293
he'll lose all trust in you some day.

36
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,675
Be careful.

37
00:04:46,928 --> 00:04:50,901
I went over to your bedroom last night.

38
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:56,774
Did you? I didn't know.

39
00:04:56,774 --> 00:05:00,617
But I think Mr. Jung mistook my intention.

40
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:02,605
What was it?

41
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:09,731
He said he understood how I feel about him telling me not to worry

42
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,146
and then touched me.

43
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,752
Did you, really?

44
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:19,922
Why'd you do that? You made her uncomfortable.

45
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:22,630
I told you she's not into you.

46
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:25,795
You'd better apologize for that.

47
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,574
Shall we have a talk?

48
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,510
I'd love to.

49
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,331
That's Joon Hyeok's, and that's mine.

50
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:36,153
We live like this.

51
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:38,323
Oh, you've already seen it.

52
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:43,348
Would you like to try?

53
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:44,795
Which one?

54
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:48,061
Would you like Joon Hyeok's or mine?

55
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:52,726
Stop that.

56
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:56,009
Did you grandmother know

57
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,640
what dirty things you were doing with the likes of No Young Joo?

58
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,907
Don't talk like that when you don't know anything.

59
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:05,857
Why not? Are you ashamed? I'm sure you are after what you did.

60
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:08,516
Why would I be? I've done nothing wrong.

61
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:12,335
- Nothing wrong? 
 - It is you who should be ashamed.

62
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,340
You married Jung Joon Hyeok for your own ambitions.

63
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,875
And you'd do all kinds of dirty things to make him president.

64
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,468
You'd better watch your next words.

65
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:25,790
How dare you…

66
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,154
What? He mistook your intention?

67
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:33,455
- Enough with those lies! 
 - That's just what you want to believe!

68
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:34,899
I've dealt with plenty like you before.

69
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:38,863
Why do you live with an asshole like that?

70
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:40,498
Apologize.

71
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:43,107
Ask for forgiveness! Beg me to forgive you!

72
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,053
Say that you're sorry for everything.

73
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:48,137
I've done nothing wrong.

74
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,946
I…

75
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:54,910
I trusted you so much.

76
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,736
- I told you to divorce him. 
 - Shut up!

77
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:59,882
Divorce him, right now!

78
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:03,048
Let's have a talk.

79
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:10,725
I was going to tell you at the right moment.

80
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:15,091
And I think it's time.

81
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:24,878

82
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:29,234
Joon Hyeok's child is not dead.

83
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:35,576
He's healthy and living by his father's side.

84
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,546
What are you talking about?

85
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:42,451
Hyeon Woo is indeed your grandson.

86
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,980
I made it so that Jae Hee adopted him.

87
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,126

88
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:54,567
Jae Hee doesn't know about this yet.

89
00:09:56,872 --> 00:10:00,806
I'll let you decide what to do with her.

90
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:23,515
It's been a while.

91
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:28,418
I was surprised to see your text. I thought you were too busy.

92
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:35,791
I'm hungry. Can I order room service?

93
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:45,661
What are you doing?

94
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:56,739
I don't want to go crazy imagining what you might've done with him.

95
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,029
Stay within my sight until the presidential election's over.

96
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:06,885
I'll keep an eye on you watching every little move you make.

97
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:12,803
That's the price you'll pay for betraying my trust.

98
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:15,277
As you want.

99
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:18,730
But I'll make sure you divorce him.

100
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,183
Let's see who comes out on top.

101
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:41,270

102
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,950

103
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,150

104
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,881
 What do you mean, my child?

105
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:56,667
 I will not accept a child born from a random woman as my own.

106
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:01,940
 I won't let a dead bastard taint my reputation.

107
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:27,950
Grandpa!

108
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:33,689
My dear boy, Hyeon Woo!

109
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:35,944
Have you been a good boy?

110
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:41,204
Father.

111
00:12:53,056 --> 00:12:56,850
Oh, it's so cold outside.

112
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,464
I wondered why he bought so many grapes,

113
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:06,767
and it turned out they're your favorite fruit, Jae Hee.

114
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:11,240
Well he just cares so much about his daughter-in-law.

115
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:22,137

116
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:25,526
Use this for Joon Hyeok's election.

117
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:30,022
It's all my money. Not a single penny came from my wife.

118
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:32,181
So, don't worry.

119
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:37,701
Let's put the past behind us and focus on the future.

120
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,732
Did Mother say something?

121
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:45,950
I won't blame anyone for anything.

122
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,221
You reap what you sow.

123
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:51,968
That's one truth in life that I know.

124
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:55,160

125
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,300

126
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:14,658
Hyeon Woo!

127
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:18,353
What's up?

128
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:24,284
I'll lend this to you.

129
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:25,837

130
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:32,438
I told Grandpa that you like apples best.

131
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,063
Were you worried about me because Grandpa only brought grapes?

132
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:37,980
Yeah.

133
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,302
When I grow up to be like Dad and make lots of money,

134
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:47,689
I'll buy you a ton of apples!

135
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,792
Thank you.

136
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:06,576
Joon Hyeok is still quite young,

137
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:10,115
and having another young woman at his home

138
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,479
might end up being fodder for gossip.

139
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:16,688
As long as he's careful, I think it'll be just fine.

140
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:21,790
I'll handle it. Don't worry.

141
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,976
Drive safely.

142
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:55,591
Hyeon Woo. She has to rest.

143
00:15:55,591 --> 00:15:58,841
But she said she's fine.

144
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,206
Right, Yi Seol?

145
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:02,212
Yeah.

146
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,706
Don't worry about me. You can tend to your business.

147
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,070
Shall we try with this?

148
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:16,530

149
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,200

150
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,390

151
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,580
Hi, Dong Min.

152
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,710
Really?

153
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:23,016
It's weird that there were no CCTVs.

154
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,772
My guy says there's nothing else he can do

155
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:28,059
unless we officially report the incident.

156
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:31,420
Well, that's not his fault, but I feel disappointed and embarrassed.

157
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,341
Don't beat yourself over this. It's not your fault.

158
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:38,160
I'll explain to Yi Seol.

159
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,741
Okay, then.

160
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:48,860
Dong Min says he can't do much to help you.

161
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,476
And that he's sorry.

162
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:54,124
Life can be tough when you don't have power.

163
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:55,610
Don't you agree?

164
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,707
You can't protect your loved ones.

165
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:03,606
Your child

166
00:18:03,606 --> 00:18:09,124
may have died in the arms of strangers.

167
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:12,627
But mine enjoys a happy life

168
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:16,955
in the safety of his home just because he's mine.

169
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:20,983
That's why I put up with Joon Hyeok.

170
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,770
Do you understand?

171
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:29,752
Mommy! Help me!

172
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:42,490
- Like this? 
 - Right.

173
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,867
You can do it like this.

174
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:05,608
By the way, Honey,

175
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:11,517
shouldn't we get Gyu Seong's records in place before it's too late?

176
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,867
He has his biological mother right here in real life.

177
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:18,728
So, he can't be without one on paper.

178
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:24,850
I thought you were just happy to have a nice meal.

179
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,570
What is this sudden nonsense?

180
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,617
Do you even have any idea how complicated

181
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:32,609
it would be to change all the records?

182
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,440
I want to legally be your wife.

183
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,785
I knew you would say that.

184
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,731
Whatever!

185
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:53,477
What? What's he doing?

186
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:55,388
What is it?

187
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,493
What?

188
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:04,600
Was it that bitch? I mean…

189
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,820
You called for me?

190
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:25,710
I need you… to keep an eye on Jung Joon Hyeok.

191
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:33,731
I have to make sure I'm on the right guy's boat.

192
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:48,513
I think we were on pretty good terms so far.

193
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:54,346
At least until I found out about your true intentions.

194
00:20:56,491 --> 00:20:59,734
Let's at least keep saying hi

195
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:03,740
to each other when we pass each other.

196
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:07,900
Let's keep it that way for now.

197
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,794
And when it's time, I'll make sure that I forget about you.

198
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:17,703
I hope you do the same.

199
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:27,063
I already told you the reason why I cannot divorce him.

200
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:05,773
I thought you had thrown them away.

201
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:12,598
Such a beautiful child.

202
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm going to the bathroom.

203
00:22:48,915 --> 00:22:53,618
Your husband has decided to turn a blind eye about Hyeon Woo's matter.

204
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,470
You're satisfied, aren't you? With the investigation on the Minister of Land.

205
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,383
Now you have what you wanted.

206
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:31,778
It was all thanks to you.

207
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,740
It's my pleasure.

208
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,550
And I haven't done much, really.

209
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:42,998
I heard about Han Dong Min, Joon Hyeok's reporter friend.

210
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,917
That was a coincidence.

211
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,696
He has a strong sense of justice

212
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:51,900
and interested in all kinds of social issues.

213
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:59,270
It's fortunate that Joon Hyeok has a friend like that.

214
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,436
I agree.

215
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:18,317
By the way, about Joon Hyeok's dead child,

216
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:26,547
do you happen to know who the mother was?

217
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,869
Why? Are you curious?

218
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:39,150
It was my husband that found the child.

219
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,014
Would you like me to find her?

220
00:24:44,002 --> 00:24:45,920
That's weird.

221
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,390
Isn't it?

222
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:56,174
The violin teacher and the video that was fed to Yoo Jin Seok,

223
00:24:56,945 --> 00:25:00,920
all that information came from you.

224
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:06,029
Has something come up?

225
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:10,954
After I used Cho Kang Hyeon's weakness to go after Minister Park

226
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:16,459
and used that to put the redevelopment project back on track,

227
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,996
I realized how anyone with power can be manipulated with the right card.

228
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:28,200
And I guess I'm just scared that might happen to me.

229
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,085
 I don't want to live

230
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:37,270
 fearing what would happen if you decided to use

231
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,185
 Joon Hyeok's problems against me, Mother.

232
00:25:44,604 --> 00:25:47,674
You once told me

233
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:52,282
that you know better than to hurt your own family.

234
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:56,620
I am no different.

235
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:03,193
Please remember that.

236
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:11,193
And please don't treat me badly again.

237
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:14,140
Got it?

238
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,488
I won't.

239
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:30,360
From now on, I will take charge in Joon Hyeok's presidential election.

240
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,600

241
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:08,855
Hi, Jung Ho.

242
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:13,672
A woman?

243
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:15,319
Just let him.

244
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,992
You don't have to…

245
00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:19,384
I don't care.

246
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,187
I understand Cho Kang Hyeon might not feel safe.

247
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:28,150
Tell him I'll take care of it. Tell him to trust me.

248
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:31,590
By the way…

249
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:40,760
Is that really necessary?

250
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,097
Yeah.

251
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:45,955
I'll make sure she suffers.

252
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,785
- Evening. 
 - Hey.

253
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:19,828
Drunk already?

254
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,847
I feel embarrassed.

255
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:24,813
And that's keeping me from getting drunk.

256
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:29,130
Hey. Are you really into Yi Seol?

257
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,105
You can do better.

258
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,443
Joon Hyeok.

259
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:45,097
I think what's most important in life is authenticity.

260
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:47,401
I believe that dreams come true if you try hard enough

261
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:49,996
and that no matter how tough life is

262
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:54,137
we can find hope in good people like you.

263
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:59,469
I met this inspector when I was doing some research.

264
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:06,764
My father started from the bottom and retired as a senior policeman.

265
00:29:06,764 --> 00:29:09,607
I was just happy to have a cop friend.

266
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:13,399
And an officer, too.

267
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:17,211
He told me to contact the CCTV Control Center.

268
00:29:19,452 --> 00:29:22,706
Anyone can find that on the internet.

269
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:28,094
Even I already knew about it, and that's all that he told me.

270
00:29:28,094 --> 00:29:32,123
Of course, that's the only option. That's what I have to do.

271
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:38,518
But I found myself disappointed and embarrassed.

272
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:44,001
I told Yi Seol I would do anything to help.

273
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:46,250
I'm not doing this for myself.

274
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,258
I'm doing everything for Yi Seol and for you, too.

275
00:29:51,258 --> 00:29:53,698
I'm just helping others.

276
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:58,623
So why can't he just help me out this once?

277
00:29:58,623 --> 00:30:02,673
Perhaps he might have been more willing, if I were a famous anchor.

278
00:30:02,673 --> 00:30:04,573
Try it.

279
00:30:05,746 --> 00:30:09,373
- What? 
 - Being a famous anchor.

280
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:12,939
Then, you'll find out the answer to that.

281
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:14,886
How could I…

282
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:18,032
There's nothing you can do then.

283
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,315
Hey, what's up?

284
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,568
Now?

285
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:36,167
Can't we just talk on the phone?

286
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:50,935
What is it? What?

287
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,057
What about these people?

288
00:31:08,057 --> 00:31:11,004
Do you remember the gathering you had seven years ago,

289
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:13,783
right before the Hyeongsan-dong tragedy?

290
00:31:13,783 --> 00:31:16,490
That was a long time ago.

291
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,623
What about it?

292
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,490
Who is this?

293
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,137
The girl you bedded that day.

294
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:32,163
What do you think you're—

295
00:31:32,163 --> 00:31:34,383
It's Kim Yi Seol.

296
00:31:48,192 --> 00:31:49,126
What?

297
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:52,360
You need to resolve this as soon as possible.

298
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:11,262
Does my wife know?

299
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,790
No. Not yet.

300
00:32:41,857 --> 00:32:46,520

301
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,564
 I gave him the packet.

302
00:33:34,538 --> 00:33:36,864
What are you doing?

303
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:39,071
She's not there.

304
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:09,973
You should fire Kim Yi Seol.

305
00:34:09,973 --> 00:34:13,393
I don't like it that you have her around.

306
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,540
Why?

307
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,740
Didn't you see how she behave?

308
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:23,045
I've noticed you're letting her get in your head sometimes.

309
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:26,045
And I'm starting to doubt your judgment.

310
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:29,739
- There is something you don't know. 
 - What is it?

311
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:32,359
She once gave birth.

312
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:36,406
What about that?

313
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:39,574
She had to send it away for adoption.

314
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:41,874
And she found out that the child died.

315
00:34:43,353 --> 00:34:45,919
That explain it.

316
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,928
It must have hit her hard.

317
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:52,472
Shocking news like that changes people sometimes.

318
00:34:54,152 --> 00:34:56,299
But what I wonder is

319
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:58,219
what kind of an asshole was the father

320
00:34:58,272 --> 00:35:00,692
to let all this happen.

321
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:03,239
It happened seven years ago,

322
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:06,379
and she was only twenty years old back then.

323
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:09,779
He got her impregnated and just abandoned her.

324
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,383
Perhaps, he had his own reasons.

325
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:17,656
Right? Also, she was also at fault

326
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:21,263
doing naughty things at such a young age.

327
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,749
- You think so? 
 - Yeah.

328
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:28,076
I remember you said she's well-educated and from a decent background.

329
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,596
Perhaps, I picked the wrong person.

330
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:59,494
 Your child may have died

331
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:03,575
 in the arms of strangers.

332
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:07,134
 But mine enjoys a happy life

333
00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:10,500
 in the safety of his home just because he's mine.

334
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:15,474
 That's why I put up with Joon Hyeok.

335
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,210
 Do you understand?

336
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,260

337
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:35,260
I've told Joon Hyeok everything.

338
00:37:31,982 --> 00:37:37,142
You said I'd better remember how we first met.

339
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:39,289
Was this the reason why?

340
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:41,948
This is pathetic.

341
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:45,688
What do you want? Money?

342
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:50,042
You know what you did.

343
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:53,928
What I did… I think I already

344
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:57,661
paid you for everything seven years ago.

345
00:37:57,661 --> 00:38:03,448
I remember you were already quite pathetic back then.

346
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,633
You said your family was in trouble, didn't you?

347
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:12,421
You came to me because you needed money.

348
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:15,230
You were so young and stupid.

349
00:38:16,174 --> 00:38:19,955
Back then, I pitied you for all your plights

350
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:24,134
because you were so young. So, I was extra nice to you.

351
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:27,348
But aren't you old enough to know better after all these years?

352
00:38:27,414 --> 00:38:30,601
And my wife has nothing to do with this.

353
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:32,588
And you're using her

354
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:34,960
to get to me and threaten me. You should be ashamed.

355
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,674
Do you want me to reveal everything?

356
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:41,941
What happened that day seven years ago.

357
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:44,287
Listen, Yi Seol.

358
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:48,420
I don't even understand why you're doing this,

359
00:38:48,454 --> 00:38:51,767
but this won't do you any good.

360
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:53,654
Do you think that revealing

361
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:57,114
what happened between us will give you any sense of worth?

362
00:38:57,114 --> 00:38:58,413
Huh?

363
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:00,607
Just because your own life is miserable

364
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:03,980
doesn't mean you can make others suffer, too.

365
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:08,080
You gave birth to my child without my consent.

366
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:20,838
It's not fair that you're using that to shake me down.

367
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:24,572
If you're in need of money, you can simply ask for help.

368
00:39:28,842 --> 00:39:32,342
To you, I can be generous. Okay?

369
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,194
Mrs. Yoon.

370
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:15,267
You have a visitor.

371
00:40:47,954 --> 00:40:51,901
I am glad to finally show you today

372
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,714
a true work of art that has been missing for 35 years.

373
00:40:56,714 --> 00:41:00,473
This would have been impossible without the help

374
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:02,700
of Ms. Kim Yi Seol who is currently working

375
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:06,480
at our gallery as a docent. Ms. Kim?

376
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:16,580
Isn't she the narrator from the talk concert with Mr. Jung Joon Hyeok?

377
00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:18,178
She is.

378
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:21,080
She was the one that wrote the script.

379
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:23,357
Although art was not her specialty,

380
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:26,604
she joined us as a temporary docent

381
00:41:26,604 --> 00:41:29,737
and has proven herself a valuable asset.

382
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:33,830
She is also a beneficiary of the Young Artist Funds

383
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:37,796
provided by the Sungjin Foundation.

384
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:42,040
She will be narrating at more gallery events to come.

385
00:41:42,076 --> 00:41:44,542
I'm sure you're all excited.

386
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:48,935
And the Sungjin Foundation will continue its efforts

387
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:52,215
to find and support young talents like Ms. Kim Yi Seol here.

388
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,920

389
00:42:03,923 --> 00:42:08,970

390
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:14,487
This piece is not what you might call a masterpiece.

391
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:19,200
But then, why did you try so hard to find it?

392
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:26,980
When I first saw this piece, "Irony," in the brochure,

393
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:29,505
I felt ashamed and embarrassed.

394
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:34,345
But weirdly enough, I also found comfort in it.

395
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:39,372
It helped me confront a part of me that I'm not particularly proud of.

396
00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:42,298
I once stole a pair of sneakers when I was young.

397
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,439
Wow.

398
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:46,897
By the way, I was a good student and popular among the boys.

399
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,256
I was even prettier back then.

400
00:42:50,343 --> 00:42:53,276
But my family was not that rich,

401
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:57,116
and I couldn't afford things that were popular among my friends.

402
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,736
I felt it was unfair.

403
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:05,610
I dreamed of a bright future where everyone would appreciate and admire me.

404
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:10,590
For that, I had to earn the respect of others.

405
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,896
But I just couldn't wait.

406
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,251
Now, back to the painting.

407
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,524
Do you see that painting hanging in the living room of a rich family?

408
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:24,777
 Yes.

409
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:29,391
That painting inside this piece was also the work of the same artist.

410
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:32,791
His painting was probably sold for a good price.

411
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:35,644
Isn't that what all artists dream of?

412
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:38,190
It is.

413
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,957
An artwork that portrays

414
00:43:39,957 --> 00:43:43,470
the lives of the poor and only recognized for the money

415
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,470
that a rich collector paid for it.

416
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:48,164
Do you see the irony in that?

417
00:43:48,224 --> 00:43:51,310
- Also-- 
 - Just like how you committed a crime

418
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,804
in order to feel admired and appreciated?

419
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,150
Right. That's true.

420
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:05,116
I stole those sneakers to feel admired and appreciated.

421
00:44:05,116 --> 00:44:09,553
A great work of art like this one makes its viewers reflect on themselves.

422
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:13,339
And I hope you all create great artworks like this one in the future.

423
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:15,793
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

424
00:44:20,097 --> 00:44:22,397
With Jung Joon Hyeok!

425
00:44:22,397 --> 00:44:24,823
Here, now, us!

426
00:45:06,422 --> 00:45:07,910

427
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,753
That's a nice picture.

428
00:45:17,753 --> 00:45:20,272
You look really nice in it.

429
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,773
No one would be able to tell

430
00:45:23,773 --> 00:45:26,019
the kind of life you've led.

431
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:31,977
I give up.

432
00:45:34,157 --> 00:45:37,277
I've realized that there's really

433
00:45:37,942 --> 00:45:39,808
nothing I can do.

434
00:45:40,742 --> 00:45:42,449
It must be tough.

435
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:45,235
Hang in there.

436
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:47,542
After this passes,

437
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:51,842
you'll live a life you've never imagined.

438
00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:56,188
I would like to leave.

439
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:00,135
Please let me leave.

440
00:46:02,188 --> 00:46:05,296
It's not your choice.

441
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:09,000
The only choice you have is to do as I say.

442
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,799
If your child were still alive,

443
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:19,413
you could have shown him how you've succeeded.

444
00:46:19,413 --> 00:46:22,586
It's a pity. Right?

445
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,603

446
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,200

447
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,600
According to the polls,

448
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,973
Master Joon Hyeok is rising rapidly in the polls.

449
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:24,686
He's almost caught up with Congressman Min Seong Sik.

450
00:47:24,686 --> 00:47:27,499
He is receiving absolute support

451
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:29,899
from voters in their twenties.

452
00:47:29,899 --> 00:47:32,632
Is the task force ready?

453
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:34,413
Yes.

454
00:47:34,413 --> 00:47:37,393
So, why don't you have them start?

455
00:47:37,393 --> 00:47:40,779
I'll run it by Madam Yoon, first.

456
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:56,752
What brings you here?

457
00:47:56,752 --> 00:48:00,125
We're getting a divorce.

458
00:48:02,192 --> 00:48:04,865
Has Joon Il agreed to this?

459
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:08,252
It's what I want.

460
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,665
I can't bear it any more.

461
00:48:15,503 --> 00:48:19,022
Tell me, what exactly is your problem?

462
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:28,423
You should know, Mother.

463
00:48:28,423 --> 00:48:30,583
I've tried to bear

464
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:33,703
Father and Jae Hee's rudeness until now.

465
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:39,497
Mother, I know how hard it must be to be patient with Father.

466
00:48:39,497 --> 00:48:43,343
But sometimes, it seems uncomfortable.

467
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,476
So?

468
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:49,070
What do you want?

469
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,803
I don't want much.

470
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:55,663
I just want to live with a little class.

471
00:48:57,326 --> 00:48:59,260
Class?

472
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,193
You mean you want to live a life of privilege and luxury,

473
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,486
surrounded by servants,

474
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:12,779
without having to lift a finger?

475
00:49:13,613 --> 00:49:15,860
Admit it.

476
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:20,713
You can't bear it to have Jae Hee lord it over you.

477
00:49:20,713 --> 00:49:23,060
Isn't that why?

478
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:28,374
You should never have started a fight you couldn't win.

479
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:34,801
You can have your divorce.

480
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:40,286
I'll discuss it with your father and decide on the terms so wait.

481
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:45,146
No. I'm going to hire a lawyer and sue for divorce.

482
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:52,342
I won't accept your terms for alimony and settlement.

483
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,767

484
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,470
Dear! Dear!

485
00:51:07,474 --> 00:51:08,541
Dear!

486
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:11,607
Dear! Dear!

487
00:51:13,013 --> 00:51:15,680
- Madam! Madam! 
 - Dear!

488
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:20,287
- Dear! 
 - Madam!

489
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:25,125
We're going to select the core members of the task force.

490
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,293
I'll text you the time and place

491
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:30,986
so head there directly after your morning appointment.

492
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:33,879
Okay. Bye.

493
00:51:50,935 --> 00:51:52,650
Hi, Eun Jung.

494
00:51:54,235 --> 00:51:57,747
What? Mother?

495
00:52:25,181 --> 00:52:27,728
What in the world happened?

496
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:30,987
Joo Yeon is the cause of this.

497
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:35,474
She knows how precious Joon Il is to her,

498
00:52:35,474 --> 00:52:37,353
but she's suing for divorce.

499
00:52:37,353 --> 00:52:38,960
Damn it!

500
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:54,552
So, Mrs. Yoon asked us to wait?

501
00:52:54,552 --> 00:52:56,311
She didn't say anything else?

502
00:52:56,311 --> 00:52:59,090
How many times do I have to tell you?

503
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,037
If you're so tired of waiting,

504
00:53:02,037 --> 00:53:04,997
line up those chairs and sleep.

505
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:12,264
Haven't you been able to reach Joo Yeon?

506
00:53:12,264 --> 00:53:13,743
No.

507
00:53:13,743 --> 00:53:15,490
Joo Yeon and Han Sook

508
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:17,363
aren't the kind of women

509
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:21,343
who'd stay so quiet for this long.

510
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:24,000
It must be game over.

511
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,959
Yoon Jae Hee must have all the power.

512
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:29,233
It can't be.

513
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:32,466
Today might be our final chance.

514
00:53:41,405 --> 00:53:45,531
 Mother had a fainting spell and admitted into the hospital.

515
00:53:45,531 --> 00:53:47,391
What is she trying to do?

516
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,900

517
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:58,974
I know what this is.

518
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:02,288
She's testing our loyalty.

519
00:54:02,288 --> 00:54:04,835
For crying out loud!

520
00:54:04,835 --> 00:54:06,450
Jeez.

521
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,790

522
00:54:22,044 --> 00:54:25,203
 We've all decided that our appointment

523
00:54:25,203 --> 00:54:27,450
 with you is more important.

524
00:54:31,223 --> 00:54:32,863

525
00:54:32,863 --> 00:54:35,283

526
00:54:35,283 --> 00:54:37,503
 When are you coming?

527
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:01,043
Mom! Are you all right?

528
00:55:01,043 --> 00:55:03,357
Go fetch Dr. Jang.

529
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:16,720
Tell Jae Hee to leave.

530
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,019
- Mom… 
 - Now.

531
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,653
Will you leave us for a moment?

532
00:55:30,653 --> 00:55:33,133
It'll only take a minute.

533
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:36,313
I have something to discuss with Mother.

534
00:56:04,173 --> 00:56:07,020
Just accept it.

535
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,233
It's over for you, Mother.

536
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:14,180
All the people who were under your protection

537
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,580
have turned their backs on you.

538
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,013
If you treat me with respect

539
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:26,867
and prove you haven't outlived your usefulness,

540
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:30,187
I'll protect you and make sure that

541
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:32,326
no one treats you disrespectfully.

542
00:56:54,902 --> 00:56:56,720

543
00:56:58,675 --> 00:57:00,393
 You've passed the test.

544
00:57:00,393 --> 00:57:02,642
 Welcome to the task force.

545
00:57:02,642 --> 00:57:04,681
Yes!

546
00:57:15,108 --> 00:57:16,786
 You've passed the test.

547
00:57:16,786 --> 00:57:19,806
 Welcome to the task force.

548
00:57:26,784 --> 00:57:31,576
Jae Hee is a woman of her word.

549
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:36,196
 She might come from a poor background,

550
00:57:36,196 --> 00:57:37,742
 but she's quite clever.

551
00:57:37,742 --> 00:57:41,409
 Joo Yeon could never outsmart her.

552
00:57:58,254 --> 00:57:59,961
Let's eat.

553
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:04,468
Have a drink, Congressman Park.

554
00:58:04,468 --> 00:58:07,941
- It's a great occasion. 
 - Have a drink.

555
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:16,759
The three people mother trusted most and Cho Kang Hyeon

556
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:20,284
have all joined the task force.

557
00:58:20,284 --> 00:58:22,184
Even Min Seong Sik?

558
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:24,344
Don't be so surprised.

559
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:26,930
Those people can't be trusted.

560
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:30,403
They're people we should discard after we've used them.

561
00:59:03,429 --> 00:59:04,969
I'll take a picture.

562
00:59:05,697 --> 00:59:08,350
One, two, three!

563
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,413
 I would like to leave. Please let me leave.

564
00:59:58,413 --> 01:00:01,298
 It's not your choice.

565
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:05,240
 The only choice you have is to do as I say.

566
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,184
Why did you want to see me at this time?

567
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,744
Dong Min,

568
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:50,838
I need to ask you for a favor.

569
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:52,725
Sure, tell me Yi Seol.

570
01:00:55,998 --> 01:00:58,824
It's all right. What is it?

571
01:00:58,824 --> 01:01:00,417
You can tell me.

572
01:01:50,728 --> 01:01:53,574
Hello. What is it?

573
01:01:55,901 --> 01:01:57,335
What?

574
01:02:00,127 --> 01:02:01,734
I see.

575
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:04,093
I'll call you again.

576
01:02:19,285 --> 01:02:23,965
 Kim Yi Seol is looking for her child.

577
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:37,246
A mother looking for the traces of her deceased child…

578
01:02:37,246 --> 01:02:39,706
I feel for her.

579
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:44,979
I'll have to help her.

580
01:03:05,514 --> 01:03:08,308
- What are you doing here? 
 - Why didn't you answer your phone?

581
01:03:08,308 --> 01:03:11,414
What's the matter? What is it?

582
01:03:22,472 --> 01:03:26,372
 Hyeon Woo's biological mother says she wants to see you.

583
01:03:26,372 --> 01:03:29,016
 She says if you don't, she'll tell everyone about the adoption.

584
01:03:29,016 --> 01:03:31,249
 She knows who you are, Jae Hee.

585
01:04:30,831 --> 01:04:32,838
What are you doing here?

586
01:05:23,721 --> 01:05:25,494
Mommy!

587
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:53,950

588
01:06:00,275 --> 01:06:03,780

589
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:08,970
♫  Let me be there  ♫

590
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:17,160
♫  So that I can find myself  ♫

591
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,520
♫  Let me be there  ♫

592
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,565
 - You're right. I'm crazy. 
 - Hi, Yi Seol!

593
01:06:27,565 --> 01:06:29,565
 How could I be sane?

594
01:06:29,565 --> 01:06:32,578
 Nothing gets better no matter how hard I try!

595
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:35,018
 Are you scared? Scared that I'll take everything from you?

596
01:06:35,018 --> 01:06:37,138
 Just pretend that he's dead.

597
01:06:37,138 --> 01:06:38,945
 I won't let my child

598
01:06:38,945 --> 01:06:42,557
 live under the same roof as Jung Joon Hyeok.

599
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:45,245
 This is all your fault.

600
01:06:45,245 --> 01:06:47,878
 Do you think I'm scared of you?

601
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,851
 I just don't want Hyeon Woo to get hurt.

602
01:06:49,851 --> 01:06:52,085
 You knew about what happened

603
01:06:52,085 --> 01:06:54,357
 that day seven years ago?

604
01:06:54,357 --> 01:06:57,237
 Kim Yi Seol wants you to get a divorce.

605
01:06:57,237 --> 01:06:59,170
 Hyeon Woo is my son,

606
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:00,637
 and my husband, Jung Joon Hyeok,

607
01:07:00,637 --> 01:07:02,437
 is the future president of this nation.

608
01:07:02,437 --> 01:07:04,923
 Nothing is going to change.

609
01:07:05,533 --> 01:07:07,540
 I'll make sure of that.
