1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:08,200

2
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,840

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,945
 How about you, Yi Seol?

4
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,514
 I just wonder

5
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:46,931
 how those people are doing.

6
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:52,448
 Those people were chased out of their homes.

7
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:59,224
 I wonder where they're and what they're doing.

8
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:06,586
 Even though they might not even be alive.

9
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:12,317
 I'm sure they're fine.

10
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,360
 They're probably living in some city

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,856
 in cozy homes of their own.

12
00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:25,154
 That's what we should think.

13
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,365
 But for whom?

14
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:49,287
Where have you been hiding all these years?

15
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:54,393
Add that to your narration.

16
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:57,059
I mean, our conversation just now.

17
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:59,550
You can ask that question to the audience

18
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,557
and show them how art should be interpreted.

19
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:22,759

20
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:26,788

21
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,406
I'm really all right.

22
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,794
It's too late for you to go home alone. I'm almost done.

23
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:39,192
I just need to clear the seat of Hyeon Woo's things.

24
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:52,256
 Where are you?

25
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:57,961
 I'm home.

26
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,565
 Why do you ask?

27
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,198
 I'll be there in a bit.

28
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:06,998
 What?

29
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm done. Get in.

30
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:23,031
What the hell?

31
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:30,092
 The receiver's phone is currently off. Please leave a message after the beep.

32
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,237
Where do you live?

33
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:48,014
You can drop me off near Hyeongsan Station.

34
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:53,092
Have you lived there long?

35
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,889
I was born in Hyeonsan-dong.

36
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:00,232
I moved around in Hyeongsan-dong a lot

37
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:02,536
and settled in my current neighborhood just recently.

38
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:05,222
Did you move because of your dad's job?

39
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,574
Both my parents have passed away.

40
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:13,732
I lost my mother when I was seven,

41
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:16,104
and my father passed when I was eleven.

42
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:20,248
I lived with my grandmother since then,

43
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:23,810
until she passed away seven years ago.

44
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,120
Oh my, so she passed when you were nineteen?

45
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,964
It was right after I turned twenty.

46
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,965
I'm glad that she got to see me enter college.

47
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:41,567
I majored in Korean Literature because of her.

48
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:46,253
My grandmother wanted me to become a teacher.

49
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,114
There are many other jobs though.

50
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:55,675
Grandmother said that clever people needed to become teachers

51
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:58,060
to make a better world.

52
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,098
So have you been living alone since then?

53
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:09,192
For the moment, I'm staying at my brother's place

54
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:12,133
because there's a slight problem with my house.

55
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:17,565
I'm sure you only have happiness to look forward to.

56
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,876
Do you think so?

57
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:25,121
Of course, I do.

58
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:56,085
Thank you. Drive carefully.

59
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:58,402
All right. Good night.

60
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:50,519

61
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,342
Hey, what are you doing here?

62
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:59,362
Don't worry, I didn't get off near your house.

63
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,490
You'd better not involve me in this!

64
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,795
Did you make the delivery?

65
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,975
Wait here.

66
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:35,909
Here is your half as promised.

67
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,142
- What the hell. 
 - Hey.

68
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:42,550
Don't worry. I won't ask for more.

69
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:46,042
I didn't rip you off.

70
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:49,854
So you only received 10 million won?

71
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:53,421
You're such an idiot. That was a rare opportunity.

72
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:55,371
Opportunity? Jeez!

73
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:59,267
Do you have no heart?

74
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:02,450
Don't you feel guilty towards No Young Joo?

75
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,959
What about No Young Joo?

76
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,598
What is she to me?

77
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:17,621
No one forced her to live and die as she did.

78
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:43,395
Anyway, from now on, I have nothing to do with this.

79
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,461
So what are you going to do?

80
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:48,669
Those people are really serious.

81
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,032
They're different from you and me.

82
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,031
Hey! Hey!

83
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,599
 I'm done taking care of No Young Joo's things.

84
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,992
Then why do you sound so uncomfortable?

85
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,354
Is it because you went against your principles?

86
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:32,337
I'm just concerned that she had a roommate.

87
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,431
Even if anything happens,

88
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:36,825
I'll make sure you're unaffected.

89
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:44,881
 Hello?

90
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:49,107
It's obvious.

91
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:52,953
She was probably living with her lover.

92
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:56,172
I bet she was supporting him.

93
00:09:56,743 --> 00:10:00,214
He let her work as a hostess at a seedy bar.

94
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:05,110
He disappeared after her death so he wouldn't have to talk to authorities.

95
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,781
Why would he appear and create problems?

96
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:13,107
- And what kind of problems could he possibly create? 
 - Okay.

97
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:16,243
Also, Seo Han Sook,

98
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:18,717
my mother-in-law is extremely meticulous.

99
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:21,531
She knew there would be no problem.

100
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:26,371
That's why she sent that video to Madam Kwon pretending to be No Young Joo.

101
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:30,701
I guess you're right. I won't worry about it anymore.

102
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:33,690
Okay. Bye.

103
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:12,607
Here you go.

104
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:15,543
- Can I have another towel? 
 - Okay.

105
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,821
- Thank you. 
 -  That's our news for tonight.

106
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:26,910
 Also, I must say my final farewell.

107
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,901
 I've had the pleasure of delivering you news for seven years and five months.

108
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,515
 Many things have happened during that time

109
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:37,440
and I have learned many things.

110
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,265
I would like to thank you for watching me during that time.

111
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:47,157
I'm sure JBC will continue to deliver top-notch news to you in the future.

112
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:49,909
So I will say my final farewell.

113
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,987
Farewell and good night.

114
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,757
This is so unexpected.

115
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:09,832
Why are you quitting all of a sudden?

116
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:12,839
It's all right if you're moving on to a better job.

117
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,878
But if it's because of that news about the Sungjin Group…

118
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,657
You all take care.

119
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:28,484
Thank you.

120
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:31,717
- Thank you for everything. 
 - Good night!

121
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,007
This is so uncalled for.

122
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:37,471
They forced him to quit his job as a prosecutor then made him work here.

123
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:40,890
Now that he's become a top anchor, they're forcing him to quit again.

124
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,315
They want their bastard son out of the spotlight, I bet.

125
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:49,712
Thank you for everything. We hope you can continue to help us.

126
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:53,507
I hope you can continue to help us, Madam Yoon!

127
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,812
You don't have to be so polite to me all of a sudden.

128
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,338
You should get used to it.

129
00:12:57,338 --> 00:13:01,296
Give us the date you wish us to report his appointment,

130
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:03,456
and we'll prepare it right away.

131
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:08,410
It's been an honor working with you.

132
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,721
Will you give it a rest?

133
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:15,395
Enough people are unhappy you kowtowed your way up to station manager.

134
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:01,378
 You're sad to leave, even for a new position, aren't you?

135
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:04,404
You don't even get to have a proper farewell party.

136
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:08,118
There's nothing we can do about it.

137
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:11,793
These days, image is everything when it comes to politics.

138
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:14,716
You know that well.

139
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:17,473
We can play the sympathy card

140
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,211
by making you look like the ill-treated bastard son.

141
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:25,764
And that's not entirely untrue, either.

142
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:33,316
In that sense, image is more important for politicians than even celebrities.

143
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:38,934
The storytelling has to be top-notch.

144
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:41,435
It's not easy to win people's approval–

145
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:46,242
What about sinceritry?

146
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:47,670
What?

147
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,791
I know that sincerity and honesty can't be

148
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:56,342
the be-all and end-all in this day and age.

149
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:03,508
But how do you expect me to react when you tell me about

150
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,700
such dishonest crap?

151
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:10,545
I'm sorry for being so thoughtless.

152
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,163
I'm really sorry that I didn't consider how you would feel.

153
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,533
Oh?

154
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:45,463
Don't worry about it. He just takes after his father.

155
00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:49,992
He doesn't like to show that he's pleased.

156
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,761
He pretends that he carries the world's burdens on his back.

157
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:57,889
He thinks that people will take him more seriously that way.

158
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:02,428
What can you do?

159
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,350
You have to play along

160
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,989
and make sure that he doesn't create any trouble for himself.

161
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:12,645
You and I are the same in that regard.

162
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:16,850
I don't want to be annoyed at him,

163
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:19,991
but it's difficult.

164
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,491
I'm sorry, Mother.

165
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:29,433
I understand how you feel.

166
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:38,200
Make sure Joon Hyeok attends the family gathering tonight.

167
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,732
Yes, Mother.

168
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:45,452
You know how he likes to upset his father.

169
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,234
When he passed the bar exam

170
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:53,653
and saw his father excitement, he treated him

171
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:58,091
with such meanness that I felt sorry for him.

172
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:07,128
Do you think his father deserves such treatment?

173
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,899
Are you taking your husband's side on this matter?

174
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,159
Playing the faithful wife despite all his faults?

175
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:20,367
I'll make sure he attends, Mother.

176
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:27,241
This family gathering is meaningful to you, isn't it?

177
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:29,488
After all, it's the first time since you got married.

178
00:17:30,376 --> 00:17:31,698
Yes, Mother.

179
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,655
Make sure to keep the position you worked so hard to attain.

180
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,625
Yes, Mother.

181
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:48,966
They're some delicate photographs.

182
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:50,989
We can't have them

183
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:55,015
fall into the wrong hands.

184
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:31,602
I've missed you so much.

185
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:37,278
But it's only been a few days.

186
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:41,619
Hey, come over here!

187
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:44,064
You'll never catch me!

188
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,788
Hello, Mrs. Yoon.

189
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:10,588
It's all right. Go ahead.

190
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:16,383
I hope I'm not bothering you when you're busy.

191
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,888
I don't think that Hyeon Woo

192
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:21,956
can make his lesson today.

193
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm sorry I didn't inform you earlier.

194
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:31,858
His father just received some good news

195
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:34,420
so we're going to celebrate with his parents tonight.

196
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:37,820
Miss…

197
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:43,949
I'd like to ask you a question if you don't mind.

198
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:50,130
Are you, by any chance, seeing anyone at the moment?

199
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,484
A boyfriend? Well…

200
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,381
I'm so busy with school and work that I don't have time.

201
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:04,914
Yes. I'm very busy.

202
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:06,564
Yes.

203
00:21:08,322 --> 00:21:10,984
So you're single?

204
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:17,183
I actually wanted to set you up with someone.

205
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,070
Don't think about it too much.

206
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,453
Okay. I'll call you again.

207
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:25,102
Bye.

208
00:22:00,657 --> 00:22:04,704

209
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:20,522
Mrs. Yoon, I need to discuss the selection with you.

210
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,077
Okay.

211
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:25,467
Works like "My Mother," "Forever Out,"

212
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:29,652
and "Only a Rose" are extremely impactful,

213
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:33,165
but they aren't conducive to smooth storytelling

214
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,941
within the framework of the theme.

215
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:38,767
Mrs. Yoon?

216
00:22:40,145 --> 00:22:41,656
Yes?

217
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:46,530
I'm sorry. Can we take a break?

218
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,538
Would you like some tea?

219
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,547
No, I just need some rest.

220
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:59,944
I saw you on the phone.

221
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:03,841
I couldn't hear what you were saying.

222
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,787
I got caught.

223
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:12,280
I'm glad you couldn't hear me.

224
00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:21,163
You seemed upset and angry.

225
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:27,656
There are secrets that I can't reveal even though they're not my fault.

226
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,202
Unfortunate situations

227
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:32,733
and family matters.

228
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,130
That's because

229
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,870
there are people who raise issues with such things,

230
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,654
and you don't want to argue with them

231
00:23:47,654 --> 00:23:49,870
because it's a hassle.

232
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,331
But you shouldn't think of it as a dirty secret.

233
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:13,441
 Where are you?

234
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:17,688
 We should head out for the gathering together.

235
00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:25,819
Is that your wife?

236
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:29,047
So what's the good news? I hear you were celebrating.

237
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,930
What did she say? Do you have to go?

238
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:38,906
What did she say, Joon Hyeok?

239
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,325
Joon Hyeok!

240
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,577
Thanks.

241
00:24:56,695 --> 00:25:00,029
Stop being so whiny. It's no fun.

242
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:03,328
Okay. It's beautiful.

243
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,238
When is Daddy coming?

244
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:44,841
 I'm sorry about earlier. It wasn't any of my business.

245
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,330
Daddy!

246
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,227
- Did you miss me, Hyeon Woo? 
 - Yes!

247
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,166
Have you waited long?

248
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:08,303
No, we just arrived.

249
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:10,505
Why are you lying, Mommy?

250
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:12,955
We got here a while ago.

251
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:15,771
He says that you're lying, Honey.

252
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:21,103
You're looking especially dashing today.

253
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:23,625
And you smell good, too.

254
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,430
I like it.

255
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:47,314
Don't apologize. I'm grateful for your comfort.

256
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:59,347
She's her lackey.

257
00:26:59,347 --> 00:27:02,544
She would follow Kwon Min Seon around

258
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:06,611
and call her, "Madam."

259
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:10,642
Then brownnose her and do things for her.

260
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:12,224
Hey!

261
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:16,388
- You have lots of money. 
 - That's not true.

262
00:27:20,061 --> 00:27:22,975
I understand that.

263
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,445
But why would she help her even after she's dead?

264
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:30,620
She got Young Joo declared dead and even cleared her things.

265
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,952
I guess she was really close to Kwon Min Seon.

266
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,508
Hey, Yi Seol.

267
00:27:39,513 --> 00:27:43,934
How much money are you trying to get?

268
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,988
- Let me have another burger. 
 - Hey!

269
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:11,867
"Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be."

270
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:15,063
I'm getting goosebumps!

271
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:18,814
I wonder what brilliant man created such a fitting

272
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:21,374
carving for Joon Hyeok.

273
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,342
This doesn't just apply to Joon Hyeok.

274
00:28:24,342 --> 00:28:27,952
It applies to me, Jung Pil Sung, Joon Hyeok and Hyeon Woo.

275
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:32,659
Our family will prosper for generations.

276
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:37,462
 Grandpa!

277
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:40,745
My boy! You're here!

278
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,773
- Did you miss me? 
 - Yes!

279
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:47,676
Grandpa missed Hyeon Woo, too!

280
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:51,315
I've prepared lots of delicious goodies for you.

281
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:53,621
- So you have to eat a lot. 
 - Welcome!

282
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:55,831
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

283
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:07,427
Grandpa has lots of tasty goodies for you.

284
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:16,420
Isn't it tiring to always do the cooking, Mother?

285
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,331
You have so many other things to attend to.

286
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:21,258
You don't have to comfort me.

287
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:24,424
Your father-in-law's always been clueless.

288
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:26,843
You're very clever.

289
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:29,914
He wouldn't be so confident

290
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:33,291
if he didn't have Hyeon Woo.

291
00:29:34,828 --> 00:29:37,352
I know you're very busy,

292
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:41,906
but you have to learn to cook for guests.

293
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,002
There are many people

294
00:29:44,002 --> 00:29:47,956
that you must cajole until Joon Hyeok becomes president.

295
00:29:47,957 --> 00:29:50,778
They're all from elite families

296
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:53,686
and have stubborn beliefs.

297
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:57,287
You can talk all you want about gender equality

298
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:00,021
but they won't listen.

299
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:03,080
They'll just look down on you.

300
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,211
I'll make sure to do as you say, Mother.

301
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:15,560
Okay. We will see if you do.

302
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:22,322
I'm here.

303
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:29,619
I never doubted that a day such as this would come

304
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:33,735
when I'd sit at a table with my son, his wife, and his son.

305
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:35,759
I started from the bottom,

306
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,419
wiping shoes and driving cars for a living

307
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:42,829
while everyone looked down on me.

308
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:45,013
I am finally being repaid for those years.

309
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:50,511
There were times when I wanted to complain and give up,

310
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:56,015
but my sense of responsibility as head of this family

311
00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:59,829
allowed me to soldier on.

312
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:05,705
Joon Hyeok will soon become the president of this land.

313
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:09,836
So make sure there are no obstacles

314
00:31:09,836 --> 00:31:13,034
in his way, Joon Il.

315
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:14,847
Yes, Father.

316
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:17,415
And Jae Hee.

317
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:18,259
Yes?

318
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,694
No matter how talented a woman is,

319
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:24,098
she must live beneath her husband's shadow.

320
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:26,069
Just look at your mother-in-law.

321
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,881
Although she only married me,

322
00:31:27,882 --> 00:31:30,251
so she wouldn't have to have her son out of wedlock,

323
00:31:30,252 --> 00:31:35,119
she has spent her entire life trying to make people respect me.

324
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,531
Don't say anything. That'll just make him go on.

325
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,554
So Jae Hee,

326
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:45,731
stop being so ambitious about your career

327
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:49,167
and think about having another baby.

328
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,215
It'll be good for Hyeon Woo.

329
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:54,547
That's me and Joon Hyeok's business, Father.

330
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:59,157
Dad, I'm hungry.

331
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:01,813
Can we eat now?

332
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:07,180
Thank you for the food, Mother.

333
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,570
Thank you for this gathering.

334
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:32,288
How old is Yoo Ri?

335
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:34,369
She's fifteen.

336
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:38,272
Isn't she too young to study abroad?

337
00:32:38,272 --> 00:32:41,252
She's still young to be by herself.

338
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:42,710
Be by herself?

339
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,035
She has five people working for her not including her private tutor.

340
00:32:47,035 --> 00:32:49,807
You're such a cold bitch.

341
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:51,442
You can't talk to your sister-in-law like that.

342
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:55,721
Hey, I've known you forever, since you were little.

343
00:32:56,865 --> 00:33:01,170
So when are they going to announce your appointment?

344
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:05,470
If you're as popular as him, you can be a candidate for the presidential position.

345
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,527
I'm surprised that you're curious about something other than luxury brands.

346
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:11,017
Hey!

347
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:13,048
We'll need some time

348
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:15,485
to show people that he's a candidate who can

349
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:19,051
carry out reforms and fulfill the needs of the voters.

350
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:22,891
So it wasn't enough to throw my husband under the bus?

351
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:27,292
We made sure Joon Il wasn't hurt, didn't we?

352
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:29,304
That's not true, Yoon.

353
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:31,603
You can't call your sister-in-law, "Yoon."

354
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:33,347
The hell, I can't.

355
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:38,640
You and I've been friends since childhood but not Jae Hee, so show her some respect.

356
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:51,724
Joon Il, you'll wake him up.

357
00:33:54,592 --> 00:33:58,821
Why don't you have a son for Joon Il?

358
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:01,058
That's uncalled for, Honey.

359
00:34:01,058 --> 00:34:03,227
I'm just worried I'll have a son like you.

360
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:06,535
Why would that happen? Joon Il and I don't share a drop of blood.

361
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:10,083
If you had a son, he'd be like Joon Il.

362
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:13,800
Joon Il is really popular with the ladies, you know.

363
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,574
Right?

364
00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:19,834
As Vice Chairman of the Sungjin Group, he's the dream of all Korean women.

365
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:22,968
Surveys say that women think of him as the perfect husband.

366
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:25,003
I don't trust such surveys.

367
00:34:25,003 --> 00:34:27,789
Women nowadays are really smart.

368
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:30,970
Why would they marry into a family like this?

369
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:39,717
I guess that came out wrong.

370
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:42,451
What you said is true.

371
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:46,013
If Joon Hyeok had married her before I got married,

372
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:49,910
I would have never married Joon Il.

373
00:34:58,646 --> 00:35:01,893
 Joo Yeon has always been a rude bitch.

374
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:04,135
She, Joon Il, and I

375
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,762
went to the same schools since we were young

376
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:10,324
even though I don't know how she got into the same high school.

377
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:14,471
But she couldn't get into the same college.

378
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:17,296
That's why she feels inferior to you.

379
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:20,135
But she's the only daughter of the Hanju Daily's owner.

380
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:24,799
Most of that paper's revenues come from the Sungjin Group.

381
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:27,947
Make sure that she gets it if she ever treats you with disrespect.

382
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:29,988
She says that she studied abroad

383
00:35:29,988 --> 00:35:32,999
just because she went to some design school in the States.

384
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:35,802
She's so annoying.

385
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:39,742
You're being so nice to me today.

386
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:43,645
Well, it's up to me to take care of my husband.

387
00:35:44,661 --> 00:35:47,541
I'm all finished, sir.

388
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,713
Thank you.

389
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:59,116
What's the scented oil that's supposed to help you sleep?

390
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,437
Lavender. Why?

391
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:04,014
Don't you think you can sleep?

392
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:07,772
Too excited and happy to sleep?

393
00:36:07,772 --> 00:36:10,057
I'm not a kid, you know.

394
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:15,952
What happened to Cho Kang Hyeon's wife makes me feel uncomfortable.

395
00:36:15,952 --> 00:36:19,540
I know she was a proud woman, but how could she kill herself?

396
00:36:25,522 --> 00:36:28,802
Are you sure it works?

397
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,280
He pushed her over the edge.

398
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,352
There's only so much that a person can bear.

399
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:38,203
I feel sorry for her.

400
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:47,545
You know, Honey.

401
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:49,179
What?

402
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:55,345
If something like that were to ever happen to us…

403
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:57,605
you wouldn't do that, would you?

404
00:37:00,147 --> 00:37:04,625
I mean, I wouldn't act so recklessly like Cho.

405
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:07,534
But misunderstandings could arise.

406
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:09,557
Don't worry.

407
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,775
I would never kill myself.

408
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,857
Right?

409
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:18,870
You're too smart for that.

410
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:23,177
I'd kill you and the whore.

411
00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:54,154

412
00:37:56,497 --> 00:38:03,720

413
00:38:16,308 --> 00:38:18,395
It's so pretty.

414
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:21,312
It's almost too pretty to eat.

415
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:26,153
You're moved by such small things.

416
00:38:26,153 --> 00:38:29,143
His gifts must delight you.

417
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,754
Pardon?

418
00:38:30,754 --> 00:38:34,747
You're so young and pretty that you must be popular with men.

419
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:37,895
That's not true.

420
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:42,685
I heard that you don't have any siblings.

421
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:45,120
Do you live with your parents?

422
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,550
My father passed away when I was young, so I live with my mother.

423
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,902
Then how do you make ends meet?

424
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:56,447
My mother has a small hair salon.

425
00:38:56,447 --> 00:39:01,555
Oh my. That's impressive.

426
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:04,026
It must have been expensive to teach you violin.

427
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:06,492
I'm very grateful.

428
00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:10,593
I want to make it so I can repay for her sacrifice.

429
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,548
You're a good daughter.

430
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:24,830
You should take a look before you go out on your blind date.

431
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:29,277
Ma'am, I know that you only have the best of intentions,

432
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:32,641
but I'm not ready.

433
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:35,810
I didn't think it was polite to turn you down over the phone so I came.

434
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:40,300
Why don't you take a look inside first?

435
00:39:57,504 --> 00:39:59,801
What do you think?

436
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:02,987
I hope the guy is to your liking.

437
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:05,990
- Ma'am. 
 - Shut the hell up.

438
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,768
Just because you're an immoral whore

439
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:27,034
doesn't necessarily mean that you don't care about your mother.

440
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,676
What do you think? Shouldn't we inform her?

441
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:36,682
She needs to know what kind of life her daughter is leading.

442
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,801
Mrs. Yoon,

443
00:40:40,876 --> 00:40:44,141
I know you must be very angry.

444
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,375
And I really have no excuse.

445
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:56,085
But he and I…

446
00:40:56,085 --> 00:41:00,920
It's not what you think.

447
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:05,257
You talk as if you're in love with him.

448
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,838
Get a grip.

449
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:11,462
You're just another sex partner to him.

450
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:14,687
The purse and shoes you posted on your SNS

451
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:19,656
and that necklace… Do you think they're gifts?

452
00:41:19,656 --> 00:41:21,793
They're payments.

453
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:25,889
You must've been in love.

454
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:27,734
But…

455
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:31,623
do you know what Joon Hyeok did

456
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:37,228
while you were posting pictures of his gifts?

457
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,595
Until you said,

458
00:41:39,595 --> 00:41:43,600
"Mr. Jung plays basketball every third weekend."

459
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,736
As if you knew everything about him,

460
00:41:46,736 --> 00:41:49,626
I had no idea what was going on.

461
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:52,776
You probably think that

462
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:56,420
there was nothing between my husband and I during that time,

463
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:00,743
but we still had sex.

464
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:06,376
You should never have

465
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:10,242
continued on with a man whose feet were the only thing

466
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:13,030
you could post on social media.

467
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,754
Here's your compensation.

468
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:23,220
Thank you for keeping my husband company.

469
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:43,592
If I were her, I'd celebrate the promotion.

470
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:46,931
Mrs. Yoon is quite odd.

471
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:49,640
She's so obsessed with her work.

472
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,779
I bet she'll spend most of her time here instead of her new office.

473
00:42:56,047 --> 00:43:00,929
You know, she's responsible for the young artists' scholarship program.

474
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:05,575
She said that we can't let artists quit because they don't have money.

475
00:43:05,575 --> 00:43:08,781
She received such criticism for that.

476
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:10,210
Why would people criticize her?

477
00:43:10,243 --> 00:43:16,462
They said that she was using poor artists to enhance her image.

478
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:21,004
What is this doing here? This is Mrs. Yoon's.

479
00:43:21,004 --> 00:43:22,727
I'll take it to her.

480
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:24,540
Okay.

481
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:38,557
Thanks for organizing my things.

482
00:43:38,557 --> 00:43:44,583
Da Eun was mentioning that you should celebrate your promotion.

483
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:47,537
She makes me out to be so humble.

484
00:43:47,537 --> 00:43:49,972
Are you not?

485
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:51,912
Do I seem that way?

486
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:57,520
It's just a way to hide my dirty ambitions.

487
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:02,936
Thanks. You're dismissed.

488
00:44:27,757 --> 00:44:29,953
So they didn't take my gift?

489
00:44:29,953 --> 00:44:32,944
It's because they disrespect me.

490
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:35,090
They don't disrespect you.

491
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:37,359
It just wasn't to their taste.

492
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,060
And she made a fool out of me in front of the family.

493
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:47,223
You didn't say anything so why did she attack me like that?

494
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,020
Why are you so quiet?

495
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:54,536
I didn't say those things to criticize you.

496
00:44:57,116 --> 00:45:01,637
There was a man who lost all his children and wealth

497
00:45:01,637 --> 00:45:05,934
and fell seriously ill, all in one day.

498
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:08,566
How unlucky.

499
00:45:08,566 --> 00:45:11,412
A friend tried to comfort him

500
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:14,567
by telling him that everything would work out.

501
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:16,034
What an idiot.

502
00:45:16,034 --> 00:45:18,487
How is that supposed to help?

503
00:45:18,487 --> 00:45:21,484
He didn't want to hear his friend complaining.

504
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:24,357
He didn't want to hear him complaining?

505
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:30,157
So then what happened?

506
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:33,482
That's it.

507
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:36,828
The friend told the man,

508
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:41,822
"Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be."

509
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,879
What are you using that quote for?

510
00:45:44,879 --> 00:45:47,263
If you're feeling better,

511
00:45:47,263 --> 00:45:51,084
come outside, and I'll cook you some porridge.

512
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,851
What the heck?

513
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:55,929
Why is she so annoyed?

514
00:45:59,285 --> 00:46:02,140

515
00:46:08,175 --> 00:46:13,274
I must be crazy to think that he would ever understand.

516
00:46:14,482 --> 00:46:18,820

517
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,590

518
00:46:36,865 --> 00:46:39,240

519
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:46,590

520
00:46:50,384 --> 00:46:53,153
What's with the serious expression?

521
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:56,545
It's just weird how Joon Hyeok quit.

522
00:46:56,545 --> 00:46:59,878
Yes, it's very weird.

523
00:46:59,878 --> 00:47:03,764
What can we do if the Sungjin Group is behind it?

524
00:47:03,764 --> 00:47:05,585
So should we just let it be?

525
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:08,209
Then do you want to risk your job?

526
00:47:08,209 --> 00:47:12,570
I guess it's worth the risk if you've paid off your student loan.

527
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:19,040

528
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,960

529
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:32,167
About Yoon Jae Hee.

530
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,378
Sir?

531
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,442
Why don't you pay attention?

532
00:47:39,467 --> 00:47:42,951
You couldn't even interrogate a suspect with that attitude.

533
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:50,593
I heard that Jung Joon Hyeok knows that you two dated in school.

534
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:55,085
Hey, are you still involved?

535
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:57,816
- No, sir. 
 - That's too bad.

536
00:47:57,816 --> 00:48:00,015
That could have been useful.

537
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:05,033
Stop scowling.

538
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:08,656
I know that you would never do such a thing.

539
00:48:08,656 --> 00:48:11,724
I'm sorry, sir.

540
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:18,940
How much clout does that woman carry at Sungjin?

541
00:48:19,803 --> 00:48:22,423
I'd see her from time to time when my wife was still alive.

542
00:48:22,423 --> 00:48:27,551
She seemed very nice and even ran errands for my wife.

543
00:48:29,104 --> 00:48:32,073
Does she think she's all

544
00:48:32,073 --> 00:48:35,361
high and mighty because she has Seo Han Sook's backing?

545
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,890

546
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,702
Here's the list of people to invite to your inauguration ceremony. If you–

547
00:48:48,702 --> 00:48:51,684
The invitation should be for the exhibition opening.

548
00:48:51,684 --> 00:48:55,271
- But they're both on the same day. 
 - Exactly.

549
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:58,772
The opening is the main event.

550
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:00,447
Yes, ma'am.

551
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:29,323
Yi Seol, may I speak with you?

552
00:49:42,298 --> 00:49:44,784
It's a little burdensome

553
00:49:48,197 --> 00:49:52,534
when you look at me as if in expectation.

554
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:54,739
Why?

555
00:49:54,739 --> 00:49:57,613
I know that you are a clever and precise person.

556
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:01,898
Are you worried that you'll disappoint me?

557
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:06,070
I'm not a good person.

558
00:50:07,147 --> 00:50:10,113
I hide my dirty secrets

559
00:50:10,113 --> 00:50:13,502
while revealing the dirty secrets of others.

560
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:17,180
That's how I am.

561
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:20,667
Most people are like that.

562
00:50:24,277 --> 00:50:27,639
I punished a girl today.

563
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:33,250
But... I used the fact that she lives alone with her mother to do it.

564
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:38,931
I watched as she cried tears of shame

565
00:50:40,058 --> 00:50:43,825
and I felt both a sense of relief and guilt.

566
00:50:44,648 --> 00:50:49,603
I was no different from the people I despise.

567
00:50:56,614 --> 00:50:59,293
So don't act like that in the future.

568
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,084
Do you see that painting?

569
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:17,385
Where is that light heading?

570
00:51:17,385 --> 00:51:20,903
Is it going away or drawing near?

571
00:51:20,903 --> 00:51:23,533
I change my mind every time I look at it.

572
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:28,621
It's approaching.

573
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:32,042
If it were going away,

574
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:36,231
they wouldn't just be huddling in the shadow,

575
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:42,585
especially if they ever experienced warmth.

576
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,363
I'm sure you can behave differently in the future.

577
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,658
Will you wait and see?

578
00:51:59,146 --> 00:52:01,076
If you let me.

579
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,400
Gosh.

580
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:38,128
I can't believe I'm doing all this cooking for him.

581
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:45,149
Just wait until he registers the marriage. I'm going to give him hell.

582
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,731
Who is it?

583
00:53:11,878 --> 00:53:14,170
What are you doing after work?

584
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,051
Mrs. Yoon.

585
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,394
I finished mailing all the invitations.

586
00:53:20,395 --> 00:53:21,776
Good work.

587
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:23,998
I've also sent electronic invitations

588
00:53:23,998 --> 00:53:26,607
to all the people who registered their emails.

589
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:30,515
I'll draw up a list of participants as soon as I receive all the replies.

590
00:53:30,516 --> 00:53:32,112
Thank you.

591
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:36,628
Why don't we all go to dinner together?

592
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,685
You two should discuss what we'll eat.

593
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:41,841
Can it be expensive?

594
00:53:44,362 --> 00:53:46,395
Do you like beef?

595
00:53:46,395 --> 00:53:49,762
How about beef omakase?

596
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:53,512
What is it?

597
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:22,200
- Please go wait in the room. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

598
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:35,270
Only the maids are here, and they don't know much.

599
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,708
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting. 
 - It's all right.

600
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:40,268
- Take a seat. 
 - Okay.

601
00:54:40,268 --> 00:54:42,512
I've heard a lot about you from Joon Hyeok,

602
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,281
but this is our first meeting. Isn't it?

603
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,989
We met at your son's birthday party.

604
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:50,900
Oh, of course.

605
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,924
What are they saying? I can't hear a thing.

606
00:55:11,524 --> 00:55:15,436
I was friends with Mrs. Kwon so I visit once in a while to take care of things.

607
00:55:15,436 --> 00:55:18,937
It shows that the mistress of the house isn't here anymore.

608
00:55:20,753 --> 00:55:22,581
Is she the late Mrs. Kwon?

609
00:55:22,606 --> 00:55:25,616
She frequently suffered from an illness.

610
00:55:25,616 --> 00:55:29,057
She must have experienced such anxiety.

611
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:31,007
People are really scary.

612
00:55:31,007 --> 00:55:33,687
How could they blackmail her like that?

613
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:37,276
So is the child with his birthmother now?

614
00:55:37,276 --> 00:55:41,198
The child did nothing wrong. It's all the adults' fault.

615
00:55:41,198 --> 00:55:42,986
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be obtrusive.

616
00:55:42,987 --> 00:55:45,043
People are like that.

617
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:48,395
They don't understand the suffering they cause.

618
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:55,878
Just like Joon Hyeok,

619
00:55:55,878 --> 00:55:59,542
I was against reporting on the video.

620
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:02,738
I didn't think we had enough to report on.

621
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:07,474
But I had to agree when I learned about the woman in the video,

622
00:56:07,474 --> 00:56:10,260
even though everything's been revealed now.

623
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,290
At first, when I heard about No Young Joo,

624
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:18,131
I let my emotions get the best of me.

625
00:56:18,131 --> 00:56:20,859
She died without any next of kin.

626
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:22,637
Yes.

627
00:56:22,637 --> 00:56:25,226
And she grew up in an orphanage.

628
00:56:39,325 --> 00:56:40,792
I'll get going then.

629
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:42,681
Okay. Goodbye.

630
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,646
What did he say?

631
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,926
Why is he asking around about No Young Joo?

632
00:56:59,926 --> 00:57:04,047
He won't find out about our lie, will he?

633
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:08,545
I had a long talk with him, so I'm sure he won't be back.

634
00:57:08,545 --> 00:57:10,468
Thank you, Jae Hee.

635
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:14,716
- You should discuss what you'll do with Cho Kang Hyeon. 
 - What?

636
00:57:14,716 --> 00:57:16,956
About your relationship with him.

637
00:57:16,956 --> 00:57:18,456
You can't keep living like this.

638
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:21,729
People are watching, you know. It could be embarrassing.

639
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:31,412
Bye, Jae Hee. Thanks.

640
00:57:34,495 --> 00:57:39,614
That girl has a knack for making people feel bad.

641
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:54,915
I feel so sorry for Madam Kwon.

642
00:58:04,724 --> 00:58:06,412
Hello, Mother.

643
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:19,711
I understand. You must all be so busy

644
00:58:19,711 --> 00:58:25,107
with your duties at the assembly.

645
00:58:25,107 --> 00:58:26,370
I understand.

646
00:58:26,395 --> 00:58:32,607
But it's to commemorate the 100th birthday of my late father.

647
00:58:32,607 --> 00:58:37,462
But it's being held along with Yoon Jae Hee's inauguration as CEO.

648
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:42,940
It makes it difficult for us to attend.

649
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,820
Will you hit the ball?

650
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,650
- Are you stupid or what? 
 - Shut up!

651
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:54,988
Yes, so… we're concerned that there's no justification

652
00:58:54,988 --> 00:58:57,176
for appointing Yoon Jae Hee as CEO.

653
00:58:57,177 --> 00:58:59,560
I understand.

654
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,910
Bye.

655
00:59:06,927 --> 00:59:09,336
They are all declining the invitation

656
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:12,970
to the exhibition opening because they won't recognize you as CEO.

657
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:17,456
Who's behind this?

658
00:59:18,243 --> 00:59:21,459
It seems that Cho Kang Hyeon's behind it.

659
00:59:23,487 --> 00:59:25,395
Don't be so surprised.

660
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,432
He's trying to assert his dominance.

661
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:32,147
Now that he's attacked us first,

662
00:59:32,147 --> 00:59:34,481
we'll have to fight back.

663
00:59:34,481 --> 00:59:37,242
That's true, Mother,

664
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:40,074
but this is all so sudden.

665
00:59:40,074 --> 00:59:43,563
Why? Don't you think you can fight back?

666
00:59:44,992 --> 00:59:48,333
I just can't think of what to do.

667
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:50,122
How about that key?

668
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:52,478
Have you forgotten about it?

669
01:00:06,665 --> 01:00:09,110

670
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:23,859
 - Daddy!  
 - Yes?

671
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,112
Can you give me a bath?

672
01:00:26,137 --> 01:00:28,797
- Do you want a bath? 
 - Yes!

673
01:00:28,797 --> 01:00:31,774
Okay. Let's go!

674
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:50,787
 If you tell me when you're narrating, I'll make sure to visit.

675
01:01:07,255 --> 01:01:09,277

676
01:01:17,629 --> 01:01:18,910

677
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:20,577

678
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:25,035
Oh my. You seem surprised.

679
01:01:25,035 --> 01:01:28,115
But there's nothing to be surprised about.

680
01:01:28,115 --> 01:01:31,482
She was married to a man like Cho.

681
01:01:32,584 --> 01:01:35,433

682
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:38,655
Now, let's catch a squid.

683
01:01:38,656 --> 01:01:40,629
It's a big one!

684
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:44,664
- We caught an octopus! 
 - Yes!

685
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:49,358
Next, I'll try to catch a lobster.

686
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:51,413
I'll reel him in!

687
01:01:51,413 --> 01:01:54,379
Okay, now you do it, Hyeon Woo.

688
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:01,989
 Thank you for your interest.

689
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,508
She was blackmailed

690
01:02:28,508 --> 01:02:31,970
by the person No Young Joo was living with.

691
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:35,182
I thought you had it under control

692
01:02:35,182 --> 01:02:37,693
so I didn't say anything.

693
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:52,006

694
01:03:52,006 --> 01:03:53,867

695
01:03:54,722 --> 01:03:57,942

696
01:04:05,581 --> 01:04:09,047

697
01:04:16,945 --> 01:04:19,256

698
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:56,580

699
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:08,990

700
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:20,557
 She'll either tame me and make me run errands or discard me.

701
01:05:20,557 --> 01:05:25,117
 Do you know No Young Joo? She used to live here.

702
01:05:25,117 --> 01:05:26,429
 Did that reporter return?

703
01:05:26,454 --> 01:05:31,588
 Just make sure she doesn't find out who you are.

704
01:05:33,009 --> 01:05:36,489
 - Did I keep you waiting? 
 - No, I just got here.

705
01:05:36,489 --> 01:05:37,375
 We meet again.

706
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:40,837
 I'm going to obtain evidence first.

707
01:05:42,207 --> 01:05:44,304
 - Are you going to scare her? 
 - Yes.

708
01:05:44,305 --> 01:05:48,399
 She betrayed me after everything I did for her.
