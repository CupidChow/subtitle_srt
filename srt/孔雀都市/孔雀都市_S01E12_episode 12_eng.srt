1
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,719

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,380

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,285
I feel the chills and loneliness in the dark

4
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,616
and refine the language of my inner self that squeals in pain.

5
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:25,995
I learn to paint through practice and discipline.

6
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:28,244
My desires project onto the canvas,

7
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:31,740
a portrait of myself that I cannot deny,

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,361
that of my life in the shadows, a child of desperation,

9
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:39,678
and that of my liberation from all

10
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,123
that encumbers me.

11
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:50,602
 Your child is dead, Joon Hyeok!

12
00:00:59,732 --> 00:01:02,918
 Pil Sung! Calm yourself.

13
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:05,832
 What if anyone hears us?

14
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:12,219
 What happened is, we heard that

15
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,799
 a woman that you bedded once had a child, so we looked into it, and…

16
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,666
 My grandchild… My grandchild…

17
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:25,771
 He didn't even get to meet his father!

18
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:30,064
 My poor grandson!

19
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:31,821
 Be quiet.

20
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:34,644
 I understand your pain.

21
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:37,425
 I know you're as devastated as I am.

22
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:40,524
 I said be quiet!

23
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:46,194
 What do you mean my child?

24
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:51,069
 I will not accept a child born from a random woman as my own.

25
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,686
 I won't let a dead bastard taint my reputation.

26
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:04,638
 It's true. He was your child.

27
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:15,866
 If you ever speak of this again,

28
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:21,349
 I will never talk to you again. Got it?

29
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,043
A painting is the child of

30
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:36,840
the artist's own life and experience.

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,355
That's why I always include myself in my paintings.

32
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:45,586
I step out of the hectic moments in life,

33
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:48,953
and only then can I truly understand

34
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:55,175
the reality, history, and pain of others.

35
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,265
 Mommy!

36
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:12,895
Oh, Hyeon Woo!

37
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:17,931
How are you doing? Give me a second.

38
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:23,608
 The child is dead.

39
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:39,102
 And as I live amongst those people,

40
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:43,870
I only strive for authenticity in this cold-hearted city.

41
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,956
And that is my sole mission.

42
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,390
Please.

43
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,575

44
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:19,771
 One day he quit the news,

45
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:24,036
 and on the next, he was turning down a job at the Blue House.

46
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:27,873
 Today, we have here with us former Anchor Jung Joon Hyeok.

47
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:43,804
I'm sure everybody wants to hear about

48
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:46,658
the reason why you turned down the big offer.

49
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:51,034
But you said you wanted to tell us about a painting first.

50
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:53,828
So what can you tell us about it?

51
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:59,389
Well, what do you see?

52
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:03,490
To be honest,

53
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,440
I was just thinking about how much the piece would be worth.

54
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:11,603
I'm sure a lot of people would think about that, too.

55
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:16,459
I think this may have been the area of present-day Sangam-dong.

56
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:21,822
And some people think they should have bought some of that land

57
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:25,487
before it was urbanized. At least, that's what Jae Hee told me.

58
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:29,424
And that must be your wife, if I'm correct?

59
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,542
Yes.

60
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:34,880
Yoon Jae Hee, who is running this art gallery

61
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:38,916
and the Sungjin Foundation, is my wife.

62
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:44,706
I didn't think her titles would be the first things you say about her.

63
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:46,158
But I did

64
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:54,212
because those are the proud results of her lifetime of hard work.

65
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:59,453
And I, of all people, know best the story behind her success.

66
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:21,765
I'm nervous. Shall I talk about my story now?

67
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,588
I was born out of wedlock.

68
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,403
Perhaps that's why

69
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:35,575
I've always felt empathy for those that are alienated in society.

70
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:39,073
I would think about the people who suffer injustice and inequity

71
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:41,943
and it would keep me up at night.

72
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:46,858
So I was always looking for a way to help them.

73
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:51,255
Then one day, I was offered the Senior Secretaryship of Civil Affairs.

74
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:53,433
And as we have all heard,

75
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:56,849
you turned down the offer.

76
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:02,388
And I think what everyone wonders is why you did that.

77
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:03,702
Of course.

78
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,903
To be honest I was glad

79
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:13,184
that I was given an opportunity to contribute to society.

80
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:17,885
But then, when my wife showed me

81
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:20,338
this painting, it felt like

82
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,274
my heart…

83
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:27,350
stopped for a second.

84
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:42,782
The dirt road glows white like the snow

85
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:46,343
under the scorching summer sun.

86
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,022
It pained me to think of the people who had been

87
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:55,090
driven to homelessness.

88
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:59,741
So I dreamt of helping those people.

89
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:03,060
But I felt ashamed.

90
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:16,859
As you may all know, I was quite successful as an anchor.

91
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,730
Before that, I was a prosecutor with great promise.

92
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:29,420
I attended a top university, and although I was born out of wedlock,

93
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:32,444
I am a member of the Sungjin family.

94
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,207
I...

95
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:42,220
have never lost a home…

96
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:49,436
or gone hungry for even a single day.

97
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:53,349
So I could only imagine the pain

98
00:09:54,086 --> 00:09:56,939
of living in poverty,

99
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,977
never knowing what it truly feels like.

100
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:05,388
That's why I wanted to help them.

101
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:20,864
I wondered if my altruism

102
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:27,661
was truly for their sake or mine.

103
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:13,385
 They won't doubt that the child is dead.

104
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:18,010
How do you feel about your first talk concert?

105
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,491
A lot of people helped, especially my wife…

106
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:27,907
Desperation can be blinding.

107
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:31,675
- Did you all have a good time? 
 - Yes.

108
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,429
Mother.

109
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:37,537
Shouldn't you be there supporting him?

110
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:40,602
I'm only trying to be a good daughter-in-law.

111
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:44,664
How was the concert?

112
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:47,520
It seemed that everybody liked it.

113
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,398
Did you?

114
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:54,581
Well, you're both quite skilled at earning people's favor.

115
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:59,373
And I think your strategy really did the work.

116
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:03,182
That's a compliment, right?

117
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:06,846
Well that depends on how you see it.

118
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:13,844
By the way,

119
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:20,067
it looks like Joon Hyeok also heard from his father

120
00:12:21,846 --> 00:12:24,261
about the child.

121
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:32,966
He must have been so anguished to have to hide that.

122
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:41,429
Well, he's just paying the price. Nothing comes for free.

123
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,510
You're right.

124
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,399
But take good care of him.

125
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,618
If you're not going to abandon him,

126
00:12:56,394 --> 00:13:00,789
you'd better make sure to take good care of him.

127
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,965
How can Mr. Jung be so perfect in every regard?

128
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:20,889
He's handsome, successful, and kind-hearted.

129
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,880
Wasn't he just amazing?

130
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:27,337
"I wonder if I'm doing it truly for their sake."

131
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:32,518
I've never seen any man so pure at heart.

132
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,609
I hope Gyu Seong grows up to be like him.

133
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:41,458
Don't you say that about Gyu Seong in front of me!

134
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:47,068
You shouldn't just go gaga over any other guy.

135
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:50,876
Yes, just any other guy than you.

136
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:54,820
That's how I ended up being your wife.

137
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:56,619
Give me the key.

138
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:00,074
Hate him so much.

139
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:02,852
Not again.

140
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:08,389
Why is nobody picking up?

141
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:17,707
Why are you standing here all alone?

142
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:23,873
Oh, they didn't tell me where they were going,

143
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:27,311
so I was just waiting for them

144
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:29,505
but their cars are gone.

145
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:34,527
Did they really go somewhere without you?

146
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:37,476
It looks so.

147
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:48,576
- So, nobody told you about this, Congressman Kwak? 
 - What?

148
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:53,364
They went to see the Little Fox, and it looks like you were not invited.

149
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:10,279
I heard you will be leading the task force team.

150
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,878
Two presidential elections, three general elections, and three local elections.

151
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,678
That's how many elections we've won under Congressman Min's command.

152
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,475
He's unrivaled.

153
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:24,250
And at times like this, when young voters are quite sensitive

154
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:26,794
to political conflicts,

155
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:32,097
Congressman Min will be the perfect leader

156
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,815
to unite all party members under one slogan.

157
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:38,556
Jung Joon Hyeok for president!

158
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:42,019
But if you think about it,

159
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:48,292
it doesn't really have to be Jung Joon Hyeok, does it?

160
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:56,892
Well,

161
00:15:56,892 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

162
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,875
Drop the pretense.

163
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:08,037
I'm sure you have your own intention in joining us today.

164
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,265
For your support for Joon Hyeok, you were promised directorship of CIO.

165
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,124
Is that good enough for you?

166
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:21,704
Or what?

167
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:25,399
Well, you can run for president yourself.

168
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,576
Why wait until the next term?

169
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:35,318
Well, in that case…

170
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:38,633
It'll be tough to find the right person to lead the CIO.

171
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:44,936
I know you don't want the CIO to fall into the hands of Assemblyman Kwak.

172
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:49,303
I don't understand why everybody's so hesitant.

173
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:52,190
You can just get rid of him.

174
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:58,604
Right. There are already enough conflicts between the police and prosecution,

175
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:02,822
and this directorship issue

176
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:08,380
will only cause even more chaos.

177
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:11,128
And to prevent that,

178
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:15,009
you gave up running for president and volunteered to join the CIO.

179
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,891
And even besides that promise you made to my mother-in-law,

180
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:21,718
you also want the CIO to be an upper-tier institution to prosecution

181
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:28,025
so that you can give leverage to your old prosecutor friends.

182
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:34,755
But there's one thing that you're missing here.

183
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,983
Do you really think Yoon Jae Hee will honor the deal?

184
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:50,315
Don't you remember Cho Kang Hyeon turned his back on Chairwoman because of her?

185
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,764
She'll make Joon Hyeok President and give Cho Kang Hyeon the directorship of CIO,

186
00:17:57,765 --> 00:18:01,052
and then she'll have

187
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:04,010
both, Sungjin and the Prosecutor's Office in her hands.

188
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:16,375
I will talk to the Chairwoman if you stop Joon Hyeok from running for president.

189
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,910
I hope you'll give him a nice send off.

190
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,269
But don't ruin him completely.

191
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:28,291
After all, he's still… family.

192
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:58,677
Thank you for your help today.

193
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:01,888
My pleasure. You were amazing.

194
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,534
Thank you.

195
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:09,253
And good job, Yi Seol.

196
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,772
Thank you.

197
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:13,959
- Get home safe, you two. 
 - We will.

198
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,629
Take care, Jae Hee.

199
00:20:33,972 --> 00:20:35,658
Honey.

200
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,635
Aren't you hungry? You skipped dinner.

201
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,486
No, I'm not.

202
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:45,716
But still…

203
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:21,745
Welcome.

204
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,978
Where is Father?

205
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:46,321

206
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:53,729

207
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,177
My dear boy, Seo Joon!

208
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:16,944
 I hope you understand him.

209
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:20,660
He just cares so much about his bloodline.

210
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:24,700
Are you saying that's not your problem?

211
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,342
Well, I've had enough trouble

212
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:32,239
with children born out of wedlock.

213
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,822
Pick the ones that look nice and cut them evenly.

214
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:49,177
Do you know what he said

215
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:53,716
after trying my homemade beef jerky for the first time?

216
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:58,672
He lamented that the rich are enjoying delicacies like this

217
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:05,237
while poor people were starving all over.

218
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:10,763
So, I brought out all the beef jerky in the pantry,

219
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:14,771
and told him that he could help the poor

220
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:17,329
by giving out all of it.

221
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,630
So did he do that?

222
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:27,482
Of course, he didn't.

223
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:36,011
You only come to truly appreciate things when you possess them.

224
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:03,600
Take a look into the investigation on the Minister of Land.

225
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,607
We'll have to show our gratitude

226
00:24:07,608 --> 00:24:10,990
to all those who helped us.

227
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,219
And I hope that happens before the monsoon season arrives.

228
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,703
Okay. I'll tell him to pick up the pace.

229
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:20,412
By the way,

230
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:25,284
does Cho Kang Hyeon think he will be the director of CIO?

231
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:28,446
Yes, for now.

232
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:32,764
He'll be outraged when he finds out

233
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:36,319
that you have no intention to give him that.

234
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:40,305
We'd both better be careful.

235
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:45,813
Yes, Mother. I will.

236
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:01,659
Have you thought about my offer?

237
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:06,234
I already told you. I cannot leave now.

238
00:25:06,234 --> 00:25:10,843
You did. You'll stay until Jae Hee gets a divorce.

239
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:14,445
But I find it weird

240
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:20,904
that you want her to get a divorce because you want to protect her.

241
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,191
I'm asking you again.

242
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,673
Please, leave her as soon as possible.

243
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,289
Jae Hee has gone through a lot of hardship so far.

244
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:38,876
She has a lot of enemies and a lot of problems to handle.

245
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,750

246
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:08,206
June 5th, 2014.

247
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:12,555
That's when I met Yeon Joo for the first time at the villa.

248
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:17,375
The picture that she received was taken on that day.

249
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:22,578

250
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:31,449
Are you saying Joon Hyeok was involved in this?

251
00:26:37,203 --> 00:26:40,345
You may not know everything,

252
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:47,123
but I'm sure now you understand why I can't just leave.

253
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:54,934
Are you saying you'll expose who really is Jung Joon Hyeok?

254
00:26:54,934 --> 00:27:00,502
That will come later. My priority is to protect Mrs. Yoon.

255
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,186
I need your help.

256
00:28:01,227 --> 00:28:05,646

257
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:11,986
How much more trouble will he be making?

258
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:17,533
It's been taken care of.

259
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,661
Good job.

260
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:22,291
Did you make sure that she'll keep quiet about this?

261
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:27,626
All she asked was funding for her postnatal care center.

262
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:32,553
So she likes spending other people's money.

263
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:37,697
 You should go. I'll just wait until you go inside.

264
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:06,066
 That girl from seven years ago is now working for Jae Hee?

265
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:11,018
 It turned out that Kim Yi Seol was No Young Joo's roommate.

266
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,017
 It was my fault

267
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:20,774
 for not running a background check on the docent applicants.

268
00:29:20,774 --> 00:29:25,144
 Does she know that Hyeon Woo's her child?

269
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:27,181
 Not yet, it seems.

270
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,495
 Take care of this right away.

271
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:34,352
 Yes, ma'am.

272
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:36,009
 Actually,

273
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:41,247
 let's wait until the investigation on the Minister of Land is over.

274
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:44,075
 Just give her a warning for now.

275
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:49,457
 Let her know that somebody's watching her.

276
00:29:55,855 --> 00:29:59,983

277
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:11,954

278
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,683

279
00:30:16,124 --> 00:30:18,962

280
00:30:44,315 --> 00:30:49,090
Now, Kim Yi Seol is all that's left to handle.

281
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,960

282
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,363
Oh, you came.

283
00:31:10,364 --> 00:31:12,409
Hey. Where is Yi Seol?

284
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:18,172
She went out on some personal business. It's been 30 minutes.

285
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,930
Where have you been?

286
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:48,489
What's with that look?

287
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,060
I need you to take a look at something.

288
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:14,542
I know you were disappointed that this piece was not included.

289
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:20,410
We couldn't because we don't have the original.

290
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:26,313
The concert audience would want to see the art pieces in person.

291
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,069
That's why I wanted to find it for you.

292
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,633
I told some of the audience about this piece

293
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:40,895
and asked them to post the pictures on SNS.

294
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:46,367
It might take some time, but I'm sure we'll find it.

295
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:51,149
Mrs. Yoon.

296
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:57,112
Have trust in me.

297
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:05,713
I talked with Prosecutor Park.

298
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:12,367
I heard that you asked him to find out who sent that picture of me.

299
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,132
He said you worried about me

300
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:21,300
and told him that I've had a tough life.

301
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:29,471
I want to be of help to you, as well.

302
00:33:31,394 --> 00:33:33,513
Give me a chance.

303
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:54,347
Thank you for doing all this.

304
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,651
I hope we do find the painting.

305
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:48,518
This suits you better than I thought.

306
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:50,431
It's a compliment.

307
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:53,438
Well, it just doesn't sound like one.

308
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:56,646
What are you here for?

309
00:34:58,622 --> 00:35:00,794
You and I…

310
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:06,379
How do you think we would have been, had we met outside of the Sungjin family?

311
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:14,513
If I had met you ten years ago as an employee in my gallery,

312
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:19,415
I think I would have been quite fond of you.

313
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:25,213
I would have admired your talent and skills and pitied your humble background.

314
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:27,907
So I think I would have

315
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:30,600
been nice to you.

316
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:35,940
Actually, I treated you with kindness when you first joined the family.

317
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,716
Didn't I?

318
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:41,650
With kindness and contempt, as well.

319
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:44,907
Is that wrong?

320
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:51,079
What? Do you think you deserve better?

321
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,173
I think you're just insecure.

322
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:57,475
That's why you're never thankful for anything.

323
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:05,492
I came to give you my last warning.

324
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:10,949
If you learn your place and start behaving yourself,

325
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:13,981
I won't be too harsh on you.

326
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:52,607
I was quite surprised when you

327
00:36:52,607 --> 00:36:55,022
invited me to lunch alone.

328
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:56,874
Do you remember?

329
00:36:56,874 --> 00:37:03,232
You got me a lunch reservation here when you were a new prosecutor.

330
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:07,558
I was surprised to see a young man appreciate this dish,

331
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,992
so I still remember that.

332
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:15,825
It was my father's favorite.

333
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:20,010
I heard that your father was a well-respected scholar.

334
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:25,333
He was respected, but could barely afford his children's tuition.

335
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:29,120
He may not have been affluent,

336
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,798
but he did make you a man of fine character.

337
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:41,570
Certainly different from the likes of Jung Joon Hyeok.

338
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:49,486
Is this about that secret meeting you had last night?

339
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,987
Did you break a deal with the Little Fox?

340
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:58,276
What if the Big Fox finds out?

341
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:02,389
More like an Old Fox.

342
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:09,450
The Old Fox won't stay in power forever.

343
00:38:09,973 --> 00:38:13,140
Isn't it a shame that a man like you

344
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,787
is serving the wrong master?

345
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:35,356
 Joon Hyeok, I heard your son died.

346
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:38,404
 What happened is, we heard that

347
00:38:38,405 --> 00:38:42,651
 a woman that you bedded once had a child, so we looked into it, and…

348
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:46,566
 My grandchild… My grandchild…

349
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:52,657
 He didn't even get to meet his father!

350
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:57,522
 My poor grandson!

351
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:30,068

352
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:31,129

353
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:52,353
Mrs. Yoon.

354
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,588
So what did you tell him?

355
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:06,451
I told him I'd think about it.

356
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:10,746
I couldn't just say no right away.

357
00:40:10,746 --> 00:40:14,004
Give me some space, okay?

358
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:17,053
How's the investigation going?

359
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:19,944
Jung Ho is already on it.

360
00:40:19,944 --> 00:40:21,981
You know he always goes strictly by the book.

361
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:27,321
I'm sure he would have looked everywhere to confirm what's in the documents

362
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:32,698
and everybody would have heard the news, but nobody's doing anything.

363
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:35,906
I'm not sure if this means that nobody cares about prosecutors

364
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:38,998
or that Congressman Min has taken measures to cover this up.

365
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:43,845
But if this drags on for any longer, I might end up losing everything.

366
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:47,864
I'm risking everything in this, too.

367
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:53,630
It would be perfect if someone leaked some information to the press.

368
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:59,683
But Choi Hee Joong works for Joo Yeon, and Joon Hyeok isn't doing anything about it.

369
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:04,886
I think I know a guy who can help.

370
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,722
Who?

371
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,459
Oh, that…

372
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:15,841
Just wait for a bit. It'll be taken care of soon enough.

373
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,234
Why am I always surrounded by tough women?

374
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:26,093
By the way,

375
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,283
you could have ditched me then joined Joo Yeon.

376
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:41,325
I'm actually quite scared of women that are resourceful.

377
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:45,434
My father was intelligent, but also naive.

378
00:41:45,434 --> 00:41:49,494
With him being no help, my mother had to work in the market

379
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:55,440
and managed to send all her three children to college.

380
00:42:24,397 --> 00:42:27,560
Have a great time with your friends, Hyeon Woo.

381
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,823
And you have a great time with Daddy. See you later

382
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:34,937
Let's go.

383
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:36,650
Thank you.

384
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,483
Wake up.

385
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:17,009
I said wake up.

386
00:43:17,009 --> 00:43:21,928
Forget about presidency. You won't even come close if you're like this.

387
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:27,339
Get yourself together. Get up.

388
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,286
We have a long way to go.

389
00:43:51,286 --> 00:43:54,204
And you're already getting complacent after the talk concert?

390
00:43:54,205 --> 00:43:56,647
It's not that.

391
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:04,383
It's not too big of a problem, but something has come up.

392
00:44:04,384 --> 00:44:07,896
Don't make any excuses or explanations.

393
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:10,706
No explanations.

394
00:44:10,706 --> 00:44:16,986
You cannot owe any explanations to anyone, understood?

395
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,309
Is he skipping another meal?

396
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:25,323
No. He's just not there.

397
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,784

398
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:07,687
Mother told me when I first joined the family

399
00:46:07,687 --> 00:46:11,605
that Joon Hyeok's biological mother was enshrined here.

400
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:17,750
This is my first time here. I wasn't sure what Mother would think.

401
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:23,521
I thought that this was perhaps her way of testing me.

402
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:27,911
I thought about that for a while before I decided to just ignore it.

403
00:46:28,627 --> 00:46:33,779
After all, neither you nor Joon Hyeok ever came here.

404
00:46:33,779 --> 00:46:40,392
Well, Joon Hyeok and I are in the same shoes as you in that regard.

405
00:46:40,392 --> 00:46:44,042
It'd have been better if you didn't wrong her.

406
00:46:44,891 --> 00:46:47,820
I heard about Joon Hyeok's bastard.

407
00:46:49,784 --> 00:46:52,742
I heard you were quite depressed.

408
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:56,129
What about you? You've deceived the entire family and—

409
00:46:56,129 --> 00:46:57,452
adopted Hyeon Woo.

410
00:46:57,453 --> 00:47:00,866
- You cunning— 
 - Just deal with it.

411
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:05,444
You may hate me, but I'm still part of this family.

412
00:47:05,444 --> 00:47:10,002
I can easily get you divorced.

413
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:13,416
Do you think I'll back down so easily?

414
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:18,416
If I get a divorce and Joon Hyeok's not my husband anymore,

415
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:22,341
I'll ruin his life for good.

416
00:47:26,297 --> 00:47:29,035
For the sake of your own son,

417
00:47:29,035 --> 00:47:33,626
shouldn't we try to help each other?

418
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:47,276

419
00:47:47,276 --> 00:47:50,618

420
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:11,017
Dong Min.

421
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:13,841
Oh, hello, Jae Hee.

422
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:16,666
- You're here. 
 - Yes.

423
00:48:19,734 --> 00:48:22,676
It was Yi Seol's idea. Isn't it great?

424
00:48:22,676 --> 00:48:24,857
Of course. I agree.

425
00:48:24,857 --> 00:48:30,983
It would be really helpful if this went on the news. Don't you agree?

426
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:33,070
I think so.

427
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:37,275
The problem is that this gallery belongs to the Sungjin Group.

428
00:48:37,275 --> 00:48:41,237
Otherwise, I would totally get you an interview.

429
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:49,572
Why do you have to be so careful? Because we're Sungjin?

430
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:56,282
I think journalistic objectivity is of utmost importance.

431
00:48:56,282 --> 00:48:59,229
And that's why we need to be careful.

432
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,597
I just saw the protestor outside. Is it because of the talk concert?

433
00:49:15,597 --> 00:49:20,797
It looks like some people are spreading the wrong message.

434
00:49:20,797 --> 00:49:26,243
Some people think that Joon Hyeok will be a tough competition for them.

435
00:49:26,243 --> 00:49:30,453
I think it could be the man Joon Hyeok investigated on his prosecutor days.

436
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:35,866
He just didn't know that man would later become Minister of Land.

437
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:38,685
Park Man Jae, the current Minister of Land?

438
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:43,395
Oh, I don't think I should be telling you this.

439
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:54,063

440
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,563
We didn't get to do an after party for the talk concert.

441
00:50:03,563 --> 00:50:07,182
So I thought we should have a meal together at least.

442
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:11,730
You can head over to my place with Dong Min.

443
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,554
Dong Min, could you wait until she clocks out?

444
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,959
Of course.

445
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:19,059
What about you?

446
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:21,992
I have to get some groceries on the way.

447
00:50:23,332 --> 00:50:25,885
- I'll see you later. 
 - Okay.

448
00:50:37,141 --> 00:50:41,613
Hyeon Woo, Grandfather misses you a lot.

449
00:50:41,613 --> 00:50:46,836
Of course, he does. He's just been busy.

450
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:49,250
Okay, have fun.

451
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,653
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

452
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:54,317
Okay. Love you!

453
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:26,030
My dear boy, Hyeon Woo.

454
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,889
I missed you, Grandpa.

455
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:37,574
Of course. I also missed you

456
00:51:37,574 --> 00:51:40,350
so much.

457
00:51:41,753 --> 00:51:45,525
I'm sure you'll be a good boy, Hyeon Woo.

458
00:51:45,525 --> 00:51:47,216
I'll come to pick you up tomorrow.

459
00:51:47,216 --> 00:51:49,259
Okay.

460
00:52:11,104 --> 00:52:13,809
Let's go.

461
00:52:26,705 --> 00:52:29,876
I hope the boy likes the gift.

462
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:35,470
Can we… just wait outside?

463
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:40,652
Sure thing.

464
00:52:47,335 --> 00:52:52,845
How did you become so close to Jae Hee?

465
00:52:52,845 --> 00:52:57,042
At first, I thought you guys were related.

466
00:52:57,042 --> 00:53:00,504
There's something similar between you two.

467
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:06,891
Mrs. Yoon is such a good person.

468
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:12,575
I agree. She's remarkable and charming.

469
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,074
I once suspected she might be a bad person.

470
00:53:16,074 --> 00:53:17,198
Jae Hee?

471
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:22,878
But she gave me her trust without a single doubt

472
00:53:22,878 --> 00:53:28,515
and listened to me and helped me.

473
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:33,451
She was indeed very nice to you.

474
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:37,968
And I will make sure to repay her.

475
00:53:58,571 --> 00:54:01,010
- Hey. 
 - Hi.

476
00:54:03,303 --> 00:54:06,744
What are you doing out here? The cleaning lady's there.

477
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,249
Just waiting.

478
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:11,492
- Let's go in. 
 - Yes.

479
00:54:16,305 --> 00:54:18,729
Hi, Honey.

480
00:54:18,729 --> 00:54:23,653
Where are you? I'm almost there. Just a minute.

481
00:54:23,653 --> 00:54:26,174
Where are Yi Seol and Dong Min?

482
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:33,002
Okay, but I have a lot to carry.

483
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:37,165
Will you do that? Okay. See you soon.

484
00:54:43,536 --> 00:54:47,355
She's almost here, and I'll have to carry some stuff. You should go in.

485
00:54:47,355 --> 00:54:49,654
We'll also help.

486
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:55,342
There she comes.

487
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,374
It's her.

488
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:03,875
Did I keep you waiting?

489
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:06,720
No, we just arrived.

490
00:55:21,503 --> 00:55:24,479
Honey! Honey!

491
00:55:25,527 --> 00:55:27,351
- Are you okay? 
 - Stop right there!

492
00:55:27,351 --> 00:55:29,378
Are you okay?

493
00:55:30,553 --> 00:55:32,468
Are you okay?

494
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:36,725
Honey.

495
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:44,989
Are you okay?

496
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:54,750

497
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:11,091
Shouldn't we call the police?

498
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:15,284
It will only cause more trouble. And I don't want to worry anyone.

499
00:56:15,284 --> 00:56:17,756
Why would anyone do such a thing?

500
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:19,903
It was probably one of Joon Hyeok's competitors.

501
00:56:19,903 --> 00:56:22,324
I still don't understand.

502
00:56:22,324 --> 00:56:25,429
He hasn't even declared candidacy yet.

503
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:29,235
Because you drew the Hyeongsan-dong card first.

504
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,173
They must have freaked out.

505
00:56:32,173 --> 00:56:36,230
The son of Myeongseong Industry CEO is running for president.

506
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,802
But he turned that vulnerability into an advantage.

507
00:56:38,802 --> 00:56:43,313
However, he turned down a job at the Blue House out of guilt

508
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:47,682
and even held a talk concert to deliver a sincere apology in public.

509
00:56:47,682 --> 00:56:51,030
So what should we do now?

510
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:57,417
Joon Hyeok, I heard that you once led an investigation on the Minister of Land.

511
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:59,038
What?

512
00:56:59,038 --> 00:57:01,291
I told him about that.

513
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:05,516
Oh, what about it?

514
00:57:05,516 --> 00:57:08,093
Can I take a look at the file?

515
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,084
What are you going to do?

516
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:15,770
I will give that crook a taste of justice.

517
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:38,460

518
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:45,158
What's your favorite fruit, Grandpa?

519
00:57:45,158 --> 00:57:48,041
I don't like fruits.

520
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:51,944
Really? Daddy also hates fruits.

521
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:54,539
But I like apples.

522
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:57,678
I know you like apples.

523
00:57:57,678 --> 00:58:01,598
Mommy likes grapes the most.

524
00:58:01,598 --> 00:58:02,709
Sure.

525
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:07,080
And Yi Seol likes apples, just like me.

526
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,353
Who is that?

527
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:10,861
- She works for Mommy… 
 - Jung Hyeon Woo!

528
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:14,515
- Granduncle! 
 - My dear boy!

529
00:58:17,485 --> 00:58:19,415
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

530
00:58:19,415 --> 00:58:21,341
I've missed you!

531
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:22,590
That bitch.

532
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:25,040
- Did you miss me? 
 - Yes.

533
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,726
- Hello. 
 - How have you been?

534
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:34,754
- Good afternoon. 
 - I didn't expect to see you here.

535
00:58:34,754 --> 00:58:37,891
- You don't have to. 
 - We can give you a hand.

536
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:40,266
- Your forehead… 
 - Oh, it's nothing.

537
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,221
I hope it doesn't scar.

538
00:58:43,221 --> 00:58:44,784
We're really okay.

539
00:58:44,784 --> 00:58:47,070
Thank you.

540
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:57,278
Any comment on the dismissal of the Minister of Land?

541
00:58:57,278 --> 00:59:01,815
Why was the investigation conducted so abruptly?

542
00:59:01,815 --> 00:59:04,183
Was there an internal investigation beforehand?

543
00:59:04,183 --> 00:59:08,060
Is it true that he has committed illegal real estate speculation?

544
00:59:54,237 --> 00:59:58,700

545
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:12,943
What is this?

546
01:00:12,944 --> 01:00:17,070
Ew, that smell. Who likes beef jerky anyway?

547
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:27,070
Oh my, look at all this money!

548
01:00:30,497 --> 01:00:35,170
 Reporter of the Month Award, News, Reporter Han Dong Min of JBC.

549
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:38,650

550
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,252
- Thank you. 
 - Congratulations.

551
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,960
Thank you.

552
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:04,710

553
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:16,450

554
01:01:34,823 --> 01:01:38,372

555
01:01:38,372 --> 01:01:40,530

556
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:44,572

557
01:01:44,572 --> 01:01:46,669
Yes, Prosecutor Park.

558
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:54,298
Yes. I will tell her everything today.

559
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:57,439
Right now?

560
01:01:58,676 --> 01:02:00,923
Give me a moment.

561
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,880

562
01:02:11,722 --> 01:02:13,418
Wait.

563
01:02:17,307 --> 01:02:19,203
There.

564
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:28,617
 I have something important to tell you. Meet me at my place.

565
01:02:30,398 --> 01:02:31,360
What is it?

566
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,400
Nothing. You can go in first.

567
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,010
What?

568
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:04,787
Yi Seol.

569
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,806
Yi Seol?

570
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,377
Yi Seol.

571
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,617
Yi Seol.

572
01:03:37,661 --> 01:03:40,042
 Was it because of the child?

573
01:03:45,028 --> 01:03:49,090
Is that why you want her to divorce him?

574
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:24,930

575
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:57,050

576
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:30,500

577
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:40,120

578
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,444
 Why does Jae Hee have to suffer

579
01:05:51,444 --> 01:05:53,362
 because of something that happened between you and Joon Hyeok?

580
01:05:53,362 --> 01:05:56,963
Do you think I'm trying to steal her husband?

581
01:05:56,963 --> 01:06:01,997
 He might be a total moron, but I chose to live with him. Who are you to butt in?

582
01:06:01,997 --> 01:06:04,073
Yi Seol! Yi Seol!

583
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:06,335
I did that. I faked it.

584
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:10,875
 Are you crazy? How do you think Dong Min will react to this if he found out?

585
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:14,963
 It's weird. The door's open, but there's nobody inside.

586
01:06:14,963 --> 01:06:18,188
 You made the wrong choice marrying Jae Hee.

587
01:06:18,188 --> 01:06:20,897
 Jung Joon Hyeok is mine. I made him what he is.

588
01:06:20,897 --> 01:06:25,890
 No, I think it's just beginning.
