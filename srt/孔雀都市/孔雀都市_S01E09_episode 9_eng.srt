1
00:00:00,475 --> 00:00:01,945

2
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:06,215
It is the seventh anniversary of the tragedy at Hyeongsan-dong,

3
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:10,210
and the venue is still crowded with mourners even after the ceremony.

4
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:15,442
Despite the public's call for transparency, the police remains silent.

5
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:17,982
Several years have already passed, but the ban on forced eviction

6
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:21,192
is still only under discussion in the National Assembly.

7
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:25,200
The Victims' Representative claims that it was the violent suppression

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,498
that caused seven senseless deaths…

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,560

10
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:39,083

11
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:48,486

12
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:53,197

13
00:00:57,082 --> 00:01:00,839
You should be thankful for how lucky you are.

14
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:07,626
You know there's no such thing as a free lunch, don't you?

15
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:13,832
What's with that face, you idiot?

16
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:18,325
Didn't I make myself clear?

17
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:22,726
Tell me right away when you get in touch with No Young Joo's roommate.

18
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:27,635
I… I really have no idea.

19
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:31,814
- That bitch took off right after Young Joo died. 
 - What?

20
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:37,571
So the roommate was a girl, not a guy.

21
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:41,326
- No, it's not that— 
 - Oh, right. I see.

22
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:45,012
I think I know what I need, so get out.

23
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:47,437
Get out.

24
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:07,704
You should go. I'll just wait until you go inside.

25
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:12,696
Go.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,467
Who is it?

27
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:19,502
 It's me.

28
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,398
Hey, what are you doing here?

29
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:33,602
I already gave you the money to find a place!

30
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:35,817
What happened here?

31
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,514
What is it? What happened?

32
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:48,512
What is it?

33
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:54,332
Hey. You should stop whatever you're doing and leave.

34
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:57,820
Go as far as you can. I can give you the money.

35
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,725
Hey!

36
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,309
It's over for us.

37
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:08,420
Yoon Jae Hee knows everything.

38
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,803
I've never seen such a heinous bitch in my life.

39
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:27,602
How can anyone watch her husband's sex video

40
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:30,710
without even blinking an eye?

41
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:38,828
What's your plan anyway?

42
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,895
What happened to you all?

43
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:50,328
You had a piece of the pie seven years ago.

44
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:55,321
Can you be more careful with the words you use?

45
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:58,413
I'm sure you would at least have something

46
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:01,485
to handle the protestors at Hyeongsan-dong.

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,486
I'm sure none of you can deny that.

48
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:10,101
I only received a bit of help over a trivial misunderstanding.

49
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,318
Oh, do you mean when you were sued by an aide for sexual harassment?

50
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:26,895
I never really got anything.

51
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:31,904
It had already been decided that I was running for office.

52
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:37,321
I was already determined to step down as Commissioner General,

53
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,623
and Chairwoman Seo knew of my honorable intention.

54
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:42,514
So what happened?

55
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,590
And… I was promised an official nomination

56
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,112
and a little bit of financial support.

57
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:04,031
I only received help on some personal issues I was dealing with.

58
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:10,004
My son-in-law was given a position at the Sungjin BioLab in New York.

59
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:12,223
Come on.

60
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:19,817
And a small house near the lab… Oh dear…

61
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,650
Hey.

62
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,810
Hey.

63
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,132
- What about you, Mr. Cho? 
 - Exactly!

64
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:35,221
I really received nothing from her but a painting the size of that door.

65
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:53,616
 You're messing with the wrong person! Get me the Prosecutor General!

66
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:57,420
 Bring Cho Kang Hyeon here, right now!

67
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,432
You don't seem to understand the gravity of this situation.

68
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,647
What?

69
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:19,746
You're known to have some influence among members of the ruling party.

70
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:25,235
Do you think a regular prosecutor could arrest you like this?

71
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:29,642
It was Prosecutor General Cho who provided the evidence.

72
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:34,770
To hell with that ungrateful bastard!

73
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,832
You'd better answer my questions if you don't want a press conference.

74
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:44,201
Tell me everyone who knows about my husband's video.

75
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:53,325
It's not too big of a deal that a man had some fun with a girl.

76
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:58,942
That video was nothing but a prank on you.

77
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:02,000
By the way…

78
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,710
Do you really not know why your husband

79
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,829
was rejected at the Blue House? 
  (T/N: South Korean President's Residence)

80
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:16,540
I expected the Sungjin Group to be quicker in collecting information.

81
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,410

82
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,423

83
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:23,960

84
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,446

85
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:40,123

86
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:43,537

87
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,840

88
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:47,051

89
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:52,336

90
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,029
What do you mean the assignment was canceled?

91
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:08,826
Did Yoo Jin Seok already give them the video?

92
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:13,615
No, he was sour it wouldn't do him any good after all.

93
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:15,715
Then what is it?

94
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:19,935
It's because of Father.

95
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:24,987
Myeongseong Industry was responsible for the tragedy at Hyeongsan-dong.

96
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,415
And he was its owner at the time.

97
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:36,831
It turns out, all our efforts were in vain.

98
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:40,009
Sometimes, I don't understand you.

99
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:45,134
You have all the power and influence in this world but married the wrong man.

100
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:50,229
A wrong choice indeed, despite your difficult situation.

101
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:56,715
I didn't want to. I was terribly against it.

102
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,161
People would gossip that

103
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:04,090
I had a child out of wedlock and married

104
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,309
the family chauffeur to hide it.

105
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,548
It was deeply embarrassing.

106
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:18,112
All the while, my husband would show off his sudden stroke of fortune,

107
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:21,848
and I wished he would die.

108
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:27,634
Then... Why did you accept him?

109
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:38,320
He protected me from those bastards that ridiculed me

110
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,646
and laughed at me for being a single mother.

111
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:53,542
He'll probably be devastated when he finds out

112
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:57,510
that he derailed Joon Hyeok's political career.

113
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:00,893
Father deserves the blame for this,

114
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:05,514
but we cannot let this ruin Joon Hyeok's career.

115
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:09,517
Didn't you say once

116
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:14,243
that becoming Secretary was a stepping stone to the Presidency?

117
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,118
I will not back down just because of a single setback.

118
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:09,117
Where are we going?

119
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:14,817
You'll have to look polite and serious as well as easygoing and warm-hearted.

120
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,823
This looks okay.

121
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,091
Why didn't you tell me?

122
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:36,831
It will look more natural this way.

123
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:41,020
 Have you heard that the Chairman of Audit and Inspection is to become Secretary?

124
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,687
 You have not confirmed whether you will be joining the Blue House.

125
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:49,706
 There are speculations that you were denied because of Myeongseong Industry,

126
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:52,232
 your father's company. Any comments?

127
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:55,445
Why did you hide the fact that your father is the owner

128
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:58,648
of the company responsible for the seven deaths?

129
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:02,018
We are afraid we do not have any comments for now. Sorry.

130
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,829
Let's go.

131
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,411
Will you add just one comment?

132
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,826
Just one comment.

133
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,221
You never mentioned there was a problem.

134
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,312
Just wait a bit. You'll find out soon.

135
00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:46,210
Let's go, Dong Min.

136
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:53,318
They're here.

137
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,221
I'm glad you're here.

138
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:02,345
We are sorry we didn't visit earlier.

139
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:03,517
Don't be.

140
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:05,513
Isn't the family member of a victim?

141
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,321
I think she is.

142
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:09,312
Come this way.

143
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:19,718
 It will first be covered in the Hanju Daily,

144
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:24,337
 and later discussed in JBC's evening news.

145
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,821
What's the title?

146
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:34,417
"Jung Joon Hyeok, the Primary Candidate for Secretary of Civil Affairs."

147
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,118
The former anchor refused appointment, feeling morally responsible

148
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:42,151
for his father's wrongdoings.

149
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,823
Jae Hee handled things quite well.

150
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:50,690
Cho Kang Hyeon, Yoo Jin Seok, and then this,

151
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,610
she found a solution to everything.

152
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:00,718
It is good that these problems were dealt with

153
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:04,425
before they got any bigger.

154
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:07,446
Indeed.

155
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:18,106
Why don't you get up to at least offer words of gratitude?

156
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:23,532
Mr. Jung Joon Hyeok was so thoughtful to visit us.

157
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:26,787
They even paid for this VIP room.

158
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:29,207
This is not what I asked for.

159
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:34,525
All I want is justice for my late husband.

160
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,070

161
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,820
 This will be on the paper tomorrow.

162
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,920

163
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,275
I think you should wait outside.

164
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,220

165
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,865
 He's here.

166
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:24,082
 Did they ask you to leave?

167
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,349
 How do you feel about being denied appointment?

168
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,924
 Is your father really the owner of Myeongseong Industry?

169
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:31,711
 Did you come to ask for forgiveness?

170
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:34,544
 What are your future plans now that you've been denied appointment?

171
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:37,684
 - Just one comment, please. 
 - Will you issue an official statement?

172
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:41,287
 - Just one comment, please. 
 - Just one comment, please.

173
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,926
I'll apologize on her behalf.

174
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:46,632
She spent the last seven years

175
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:50,525
trying to make sense of her husband's death.

176
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,407
But that only left her heartbroken and devastated.

177
00:16:55,407 --> 00:17:00,406
Otherwise, I'm sure she would have greeted you with courtesy.

178
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,990
Why are you apologizing? We've done nothing wrong.

179
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,930
I don't want people to think we're being unreasonable because of our grievances.

180
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:19,646
I understand. You don't have to explain anything.

181
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:24,124
When I heard you were hurt, I felt that I had to help.

182
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:27,835
I hope you will recover soon.

183
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:31,719
You can be honest about your intentions

184
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,633
and save the pretense for the reporters.

185
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:44,500
You're right.

186
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:50,814
You should go now. You've shown the world that you care.

187
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,914
We're not the richest of people,

188
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:57,235
and I just wanted her to have some proper rest.

189
00:17:57,235 --> 00:18:02,416
So I had her moved to this room despite her protests.

190
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,616
In that case, I think you can at least see us off with a smile.

191
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:10,865
 When will you issue an official statement?

192
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,532
 Just one comment, please.

193
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:14,765
 Did you come to ask for forgiveness?

194
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,594
 Was Myeongseong Industry involved in the tragedy seven years ago?

195
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,640
 - When will you issue a statement? 
 - Just one comment, please.

196
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,316
 How do you feel?

197
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:25,647
 When will you issue a statement?

198
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,240
 Just one comment, please.

199
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,600
 Just one comment, please.

200
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,499
 - Did they go up or down? 
 - What floor are they going to?

201
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:36,481
 Let's go this way.

202
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:38,830
 Hey, this way.

203
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:54,039
I see you love surprises.

204
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,310
I had even bigger surprises myself.

205
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,290

206
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:03,641
You could've had a sex scandal like Cho Kang Hyeon.

207
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:07,833
Or perhaps, just like somebody said,

208
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,349
"It's not too big of a deal that a man had some fun with a girl."

209
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,730
I don't care what anyone says. I only care about how you feel.

210
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,900
It doesn't matter how anyone feels as long as it's dealt with.

211
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,441
I think you should talk to your father.

212
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,236
I recently heard that

213
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:31,684
his company wins all the construction contracts

214
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:34,424
from the Sungjin Group.

215
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:39,921
It's not my business that he's taking advantage of Sungjin for his own gain.

216
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:43,218
But tell him to be careful not to cause problems for you.

217
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:47,290
Or does he simply not understand the gravity of a sex scandal?

218
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:52,590
Well, that's the way he is.

219
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,518
Exactly.

220
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:10,341
I thought she had some potential,

221
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:14,710
but who knew that she'd be this good?

222
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,941
So do you want to be her new best friend?

223
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:21,090
I'm just saying.

224
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,429
Well, she may be the woman of the hour right now,

225
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:28,132
but she'll be done when she loses Mother's favor.

226
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:34,022
But it doesn't seem like she'll easily lose that favor, does it?

227
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:38,529
Jae Hee's the center of adoration

228
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,736
while you've become an albatross.

229
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,721
Our family is just full of drama, isn't it?

230
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,100
No, not yet…

231
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,200
I'm fine. Don't worry.

232
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,530
Young Joo got us into all this.

233
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,986
Don't talk about her that way.

234
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:07,242
Had it not been for her, I'd be dead already.

235
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:09,705
So what are you going to do?

236
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:11,840
Are you going to stick around?

237
00:21:12,816 --> 00:21:14,467
I am going to tell her.

238
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:15,902
What?

239
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:20,018
That I am No Young Joo's roommate.

240
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:23,650
Hey. Are you out of your mind?

241
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,820
Do you want to end up dead like her?

242
00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:28,750
Don't worry. I have someone who can help.

243
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,610
Who? Yoon Jae Hee?

244
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,104
 Are you crazy? She's on their side.

245
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:38,718
She just doesn't know yet.

246
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:43,321
When she hears the truth, she will definitely help.

247
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:13,708
I knew you wouldn't like it, but I had to handle the situation.

248
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:17,018
You can't expect me to discuss everything with you.

249
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:22,710
Were you thinking about this when we did it last night?

250
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:26,516
I wasn't thinking about anything.

251
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:31,410
You always do it just to quench your physical desires.

252
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,620
And I just wanted to try that and understand you better.

253
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,289
I didn't enjoy it.

254
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:44,296
It was no fun. Especially feigning orgasm.

255
00:23:47,898 --> 00:23:51,633
 Hey. Is that what you're going to wear?

256
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:06,639
 Put this on, instead.

257
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,607
 Are you all having a good time?

258
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:33,982
 This is a special group I've prepared just for you.

259
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,180
 They're all nice and pretty.

260
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:42,300
 Look up and give them a smile.

261
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:45,527
 Now, let's get started.

262
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:49,433
 Hey, you! Come here!

263
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,538
 Hey, who said you could pick first?

264
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:55,409
 Well then, I'm getting two. You in the red dress.

265
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:58,367
 And you there! Come here!

266
00:24:59,423 --> 00:25:03,149
 You're just my type.

267
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:20,235
 Seol… Seol…

268
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,850
Why are you so deep in thought?

269
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:39,227
I have something to tell you.

270
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,050
So what is it you wanted to tell me?

271
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:55,742
I moved out of your apartment.

272
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:02,931
Was it too much perhaps?

273
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:08,313
If you gave it some time, you'd get used to it.

274
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:13,108
What is it? Did it hurt your pride?

275
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:18,190
Why did you marry a guy like Joon Hyeok?

276
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,810
I don't understand.

277
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:29,720
Did he do something to you?

278
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,324
You should have married someone you can trust.

279
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:36,360
You're a good person.

280
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:41,220
Why him?

281
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,810
I don't know what it is, but can't you let it slide?

282
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:48,780
Just this once. For me.

283
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,616
You could divorce him, couldn't you?

284
00:26:56,284 --> 00:27:01,460
Do you... love him?

285
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:15,240
If you could call it guilt love, I love him very much.

286
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:24,297
And he might not love me back for the rest of my life.

287
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:35,435
What I mean is I could never leave him unless he leaves me.

288
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,525
Thank you for your concern, and for being honest.

289
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:48,688
It must have been tough for you to go through such a thing.

290
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:52,970
I'll make sure nothing like this happens again.

291
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:58,241
So please stay by my side.

292
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,128
You can park the car.

293
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,047
Secretary Go!

294
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:23,292
All right.

295
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:24,601
How have you been?

296
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:28,310
What do you think you're doing? Did you bring him here?

297
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,460
Well… he was just in the office.

298
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,410
Come on, dude!

299
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,314
And then I suddenly got a call.

300
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:43,927
Oh, it was Joon Hyeok. He asked me to bring him.

301
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,914
Are my parents inside?

302
00:29:08,403 --> 00:29:10,080
Please sit, Mother.

303
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:39,030
This is no way to treat your father. Especially with others present.

304
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,399
How old are you, Mr. Yang?

305
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,625
Oh… forty-eight.

306
00:29:57,106 --> 00:30:01,038
How are your teeth? Are they all there?

307
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:07,640
Oh, my teeth are–

308
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:26,319
You should leave.

309
00:30:44,897 --> 00:30:50,207
I'm not sure if you remember, Mother, but when I was eight,

310
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:55,620
I was secretly playing tops with Joon Il one day,

311
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,813
and you showed up out of nowhere and slapped him in the face.

312
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:04,327
I was so shocked

313
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,585
that I couldn't even think about why you hit him.

314
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:18,490
I just thought, "It's my turn next."

315
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,160
"She will slap me, too."

316
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:24,727
My heart was beating so hard,

317
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,641
but you just looked at me

318
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:32,720
and smiled.

319
00:31:38,915 --> 00:31:41,740
I was happy I didn't get slapped.

320
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:46,008
But even to this day,

321
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:50,250
I clearly remember the look on your face.

322
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:09,095
Do not think of me simply as your puppet.

323
00:32:10,716 --> 00:32:16,125
And ask me first when you need me.

324
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:22,119
Do you understand?

325
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,911
What were you thinking?

326
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:13,644
I understand you're mad, but don't do anything to trigger her.

327
00:33:13,644 --> 00:33:17,425
Will you just stop, Father. Why don't you grow some balls?

328
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:19,813
What do you even mean by that?

329
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:23,770
I am but a dear husband to your mother.

330
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,388
You should be careful not to

331
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:29,698
let Jae Hee manipulate you.

332
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:33,916
Worry about yourself. I can handle my own business.

333
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:41,302
Pathetic boy!

334
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:46,625
He doesn't even know that the boy is not his.

335
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:04,099
This is exactly why

336
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:09,131
I wanted to make Joon Il Chairman as soon as possible.

337
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:15,219
And now I have to put up with Joon Hyeok's tantrums.

338
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:19,390
Life is full of ironies, isn't it, Seon Mi?

339
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:26,805
Let us see

340
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:31,336
if he's truly worth the patience I've shown.

341
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:43,504
Da Eun, can you get me the visitor count report?

342
00:34:43,504 --> 00:34:45,347
Sure, ma'am.

343
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,504
So where are you staying tonight?

344
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:04,792
The sauna? Or your brother's?

345
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:09,191
I found a few places that are available right away.

346
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:11,424
So I'll check them out after work.

347
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,595
Do you want me to come with you?

348
00:35:18,193 --> 00:35:20,050
It's fine.

349
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:25,714
Okay. Good luck.

350
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:27,220
Okay.

351
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:37,736
I'll invite you when I find a place.

352
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:03,414
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Yes. Drive carefully.

353
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:05,110
Thanks.

354
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:29,311
I'm home.

355
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,476
Hyeon Woo.

356
00:36:32,476 --> 00:36:35,524
 Mom, come take a look!

357
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:46,605
Welcome home.

358
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:50,105
We made your favorite soy bean soup and some fish, too.

359
00:36:50,902 --> 00:36:54,292
It's probably not as good as your late mother's, but it'll be decent.

360
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:57,397
Mom, take a look. Isn't this great?

361
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:04,004
Wow, my boy's a top chef.

362
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:07,294
You're a big boy now, aren't you?

363
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:10,013
Dad, can we cook it now?

364
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:13,786
Just give me five minutes, Chef Jung.

365
00:37:13,786 --> 00:37:15,261
Aye! I got it!

366
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:17,933
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

367
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,819
Oh, it's hot.

368
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:36,117
Wow, you're so good at this.

369
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:44,991
We're almost there. This way.

370
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:56,317
500,000 won monthly, or you could pay a higher deposit.

371
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:07,020
The previous tenants put this here.

372
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,400
You can just scrub it off, I think.

373
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,902
Take a look inside. It has some basic furniture.

374
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:16,522
You won't find a place like this.

375
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:25,544

376
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:38,350

377
00:39:49,002 --> 00:39:52,811
 I'm going to make sure they pay for what they've done.

378
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:56,699
 How can you say that? You know what happened to Young Joo.

379
00:39:57,494 --> 00:40:00,028
 Are you sure this is the place?

380
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:05,007
 Kwon Min Seon has pilates here every day.

381
00:40:05,007 --> 00:40:10,430
 She was discussing a hearing with some other woman.

382
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:15,960
 What was her name… It was Yoon Jae Hee.

383
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:22,723
 Your body needs food like this after pilates.

384
00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:25,028
 You just need the extra sugar.

385
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:26,893
 - Three times a week? 
 - Yes. Three times.

386
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:30,608
 My husband doesn't care, but I've got to stay in shape.

387
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:35,522
 By the way, how are things going?

388
00:40:35,522 --> 00:40:38,670
 Will the hearing be okay?

389
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,754
 I'm not sure.

390
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:42,899
 You fox.

391
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:48,120
 I'm busy preparing for the exhibit. I don't want to disappoint anybody.

392
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,519
 I'll tell you when it's time.

393
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:53,228
 I know how meticulous you are.

394
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:56,715
 Oh, right. When can I borrow that painting?

395
00:40:56,715 --> 00:41:00,875
 I'll bring it to you as soon as I get the Copyright Agreement.

396
00:41:02,104 --> 00:41:05,422
 The place was nothing but a playground for rich housewives

397
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:09,917
 before you turned it into a gallery. I'm impressed.

398
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:15,726
 Why is Joo Yeon still running it when she doesn't know anything about art?

399
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,726
 - What? 
 - You know why.

400
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:28,015
 Don't worry about Joon Hyeok. I've secured his position.

401
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:29,610
 I'm deeply impressed by your work.

402
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:34,489
 He was demoted just seven years ago, but now he's the next Prosecutor General.

403
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:37,526
 Can you introduce me to your friend at the Blue House?

404
00:41:37,526 --> 00:41:40,139
 You really want me to share everything with you.

405
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:43,224
 I'm sure your husband will handle things on his end,

406
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:47,196
 so have some trust in him.

407
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,950

408
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,010
 Ms. Kim Yi Seol.

409
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,721
 Yes.

410
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,609
 Here.

411
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,300

412
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,950

413
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,810

414
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,760

415
00:43:05,706 --> 00:43:08,422
 What if she finds out that you sent her the files?

416
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:10,799
 I did it on office Wi-Fi.

417
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:15,403
 She got a message from a dead person, and she will check the IP address.

418
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:19,020
 And she'll first suspect Yoon Jae Hee.

419
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,318
 We will expose everything at the right time.

420
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:24,817
 You only need to get Jung Joon Hyeok's video before that.

421
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:29,110
 I'll keep this here for now.

422
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,023
 Just keep an eye out for any unwanted visitors.

423
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:33,393
 Okay.

424
00:43:33,393 --> 00:43:37,118
 So did you want revenge?

425
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:39,317
 Is that why you did this?

426
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:44,921
 Did you have to be so harsh as to drive her to suicide?

427
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:47,514
 What did you just say?

428
00:43:48,717 --> 00:43:51,102
 Suicide?

429
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:05,327
 If you could call it guilt love, I love him very much.

430
00:44:06,508 --> 00:44:12,031
 What I mean is I could never leave him unless he leaves me.

431
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:17,020
 So please stay by my side.

432
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,252
Young Joo…

433
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:43,843
What should I do now?

434
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,060

435
00:45:26,095 --> 00:45:27,619
I put Hyeon Woo to bed.

436
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:30,520
You must be tired.

437
00:45:35,506 --> 00:45:38,707
You've been through a lot because of me, lately.

438
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,731
Aren't men just pathetic?

439
00:46:22,002 --> 00:46:29,329
Even the smartest ones can't control their desires.

440
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:36,628
Don't talk as if it's inevitable.

441
00:46:40,502 --> 00:46:42,636
You know what?

442
00:46:44,293 --> 00:46:50,200
To a man, his wife is the only woman in the world.

443
00:46:57,687 --> 00:47:00,918
All the other women are just…

444
00:47:10,198 --> 00:47:12,211
nothing

445
00:47:13,385 --> 00:47:17,340
but toys to quench their desires.

446
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,140

447
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:31,080

448
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,000

449
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,360

450
00:48:45,044 --> 00:48:49,322
 It has been confirmed that Jung Joon Hyeok was the frontrunner

451
00:48:49,322 --> 00:48:54,812
 for Secretary of Civil Affairs, but he turned it down when he learned

452
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:58,626
 that his father shares responsibility in the Hyeongsan incident.

453
00:48:58,626 --> 00:49:04,000
 In 2014, in Hyeongsan-dong six evictees were…

454
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,017

455
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:15,620

456
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,400
So his father's a liability on a whole new scale, right?

457
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:24,206
Did you know

458
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:28,514
that Joon Hyeok's father is the owner of Myeongseong Industry?

459
00:49:28,514 --> 00:49:31,692
Sometimes, you have to feign

460
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:34,897
ignorance even though you know something.

461
00:49:34,897 --> 00:49:38,326
It's not like Joon Hyeok was responsible for the tragedy.

462
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,400
That's true.

463
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,960
But thinking about the victims,

464
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:46,690
I feel a bit… uneasy.

465
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,858
Thanks.

466
00:50:10,611 --> 00:50:13,218
My father called.

467
00:50:14,897 --> 00:50:19,511
He sold his land and started purchasing shares in Sungjin Electronics.

468
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:24,917
You know, it's always been his dream to found an university.

469
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:28,629
That's why he had bought the land.

470
00:50:31,783 --> 00:50:36,216
He has given up his life's dream just for you.

471
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:41,728
Send him my apologies.

472
00:50:43,028 --> 00:50:48,514
Jae Hee's been blackmailing me, saying I'm embezzling your money for my family.

473
00:50:48,514 --> 00:50:51,311
That's something I can put up with.

474
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:55,826
But you see, my patience is growing thin.

475
00:50:55,826 --> 00:51:00,630
And at any moment, I might file for divorce and throw the family into chaos.

476
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:05,817
So I suggest you start treating me right as your wife.

477
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:49,628
Since the Hanju Daily ran the story, Master Joon Hyeok's topped the opinion polls.

478
00:51:49,628 --> 00:51:51,319
What do you think?

479
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:55,441
It would have been impossible without you, Mother.

480
00:51:56,201 --> 00:52:00,499
I really mean it. I learned so much from you.

481
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:07,983
At first, I thought blackmailing Cho Kang Hyeon would make him obsequious.

482
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:14,632
But I learned that he'd do more for you if you cover up his weaknesses.

483
00:52:15,315 --> 00:52:18,330
When Joon Hyeok is President,

484
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:23,724
we've to first unite the prosecutorial jurisdiction under his command.

485
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,704
Or else,

486
00:52:25,704 --> 00:52:31,418
all the information I've collected will be worthless.

487
00:52:31,418 --> 00:52:33,650
I'll keep that in mind.

488
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:38,841
When will Cho begin the investigation on the Minister of Land?

489
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:43,533
He says it will begin when Joon Hyeok's one of the top three favorites.

490
00:52:43,533 --> 00:52:47,501
So he wants to buy some time

491
00:52:49,093 --> 00:52:53,881
to come up with a contingency plan in case things go south for him.

492
00:52:53,881 --> 00:52:58,581
That's why I already gave him an extra card that he can play.

493
00:53:01,302 --> 00:53:03,915
So he won't have to waste time.

494
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:11,229
Honey!

495
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:15,215
What? What is it?

496
00:53:15,215 --> 00:53:17,400
This is from Jae Hee.

497
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,407
I've had enough of her already.

498
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:28,528
 A late present for becoming Prosecutor General. From Yoon Jae Hee.

499
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:33,150

500
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,420

501
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,440
Honey? What is it?

502
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,561
 Did you just lock the door?

503
00:53:44,561 --> 00:53:49,820
 What is it? Talk to me.

504
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:55,400
 Why don't you talk to me about it? What is it?

505
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,500
 What is it?

506
00:53:58,645 --> 00:54:02,919
Hello, did you like my present?

507
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:05,082
Why are you doing this to me?

508
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:08,950
I thought we were finally on good terms, aren't we?

509
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:12,508
Don't be sad. The child is still alive.

510
00:54:12,508 --> 00:54:17,330
I'm just glad that there are a lot of things I can do for you.

511
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:21,431
By the time Joon Hyeok reaches the top three for president,

512
00:54:21,431 --> 00:54:25,817
I'd like a briefing on the results of the investigation.

513
00:54:25,817 --> 00:54:28,027
Please, be prompt.

514
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:32,210
Hello? Jae Hee! Jae…

515
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:37,441
What am I going to do with her?

516
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,792

517
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,560

518
00:54:59,956 --> 00:55:03,930

519
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:22,160
 I found a place thanks to you. From Kim Yi Seol.

520
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,417
- Is this it? 
 - Right.

521
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,380
You can use this.

522
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,010
Okay.

523
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:45,124
We make sure to double check everything,

524
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:49,290
but always end up finding an error afterward.

525
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:11,531
I'm fine. It's just that my jaw still hurts, and I can't eat as much.

526
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:14,400
My teeth are fine, too.

527
00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:23,678
I heard that Joon Hyeok's getting good poll results.

528
00:56:23,678 --> 00:56:26,027
Some say it's better that he didn't become Secretary.

529
00:56:26,027 --> 00:56:29,727
They say he's not to be blamed for his father's wrongdoings.

530
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:34,035
He's won the favor of a lot of people.

531
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:39,887
Just quit talking, you idiot.

532
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:48,680
By the way, why do you keep–

533
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,420
Just leave it there.

534
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,878
I'll get rid of it soon.

535
00:56:53,878 --> 00:56:55,811
But still…

536
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:05,500
Oh? What is this?

537
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,943
 Something has to be done.

538
00:57:06,943 --> 00:57:10,284
No Young Joo gave birth through C-section?

539
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:15,215
But a stillbirth? Oh, dear, the baby was dead.

540
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:20,523
But what does Cho Kang Hyeon want me to do about this?

541
00:57:24,882 --> 00:57:29,317
 The child lives. The child has to be tracked down for contingencies.

542
00:57:29,317 --> 00:57:35,203
Hmm? Huh? But when did she give birth anyway?

543
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:39,011
She never looked like she was pregnant.

544
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:41,831
And who's the baby's father?

545
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:46,630

546
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:02,450

547
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:08,740

548
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:19,810

549
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,323
Hi, Honey.

550
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:34,150
Now?

551
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,813
Yes. Let's have lunch.

552
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:40,130
I also have something to discuss.

553
00:58:42,097 --> 00:58:47,210
Okay. Let me just check an email quickly.

554
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,206
Okay.

555
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,411
Da Eun, do I just put it here?

556
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,010
Oh, right. A scraper.

557
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:13,390
Hold on. Let me bring one.

558
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,180

559
01:01:20,455 --> 01:01:25,810

560
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:37,020

561
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:48,423
 What did you think I was doing?

562
01:01:48,423 --> 01:01:50,073
 It looks like he's a bit disappointed.

563
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,830
 What does that have to do with Yi Seol?

564
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:56,122
 Somebody sent her a picture of me on that day.

565
01:01:56,122 --> 01:01:59,818
 That child was conceived on that day seven years ago, right?

566
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:01,715
 Do you feel bitter?

567
01:02:01,715 --> 01:02:07,730
 By the way, how did you support yourself after your grandmother passed?

568
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:10,696
 Are you curious?

569
01:02:10,696 --> 01:02:12,700
 Hush.

570
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:15,870
 Never mind.

571
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:19,490
 Now, it's just the two of us.

572
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:22,290
 I don't want to be nosy.
