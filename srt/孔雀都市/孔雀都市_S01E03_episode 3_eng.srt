1
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:03,197

2
00:00:03,197 --> 00:00:07,550
We'll add masterpieces as the exhibition continues.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,332
We're planning to hold a special event

4
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:15,149
related to storytelling in conjunction with the special exhibition.

5
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,712
Some people may say it's ordinary,

6
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:20,695
but true connoisseurs of art

7
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:25,311
despise things that are too eye-catching.

8
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:30,092
You'll have to make sure you don't raise any eyebrows.

9
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:31,976
Yes, Chairwoman.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:42,270

11
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:55,004
 What is it that you want?

12
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:59,501
 Everything. Everything you have.

13
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:02,301
 Do you think you're capable of taking it?

14
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:05,039
 You'll have to help me.

15
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:08,696
 No one is born ready.

16
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:13,366
 How can I trust that you have the best interests of Joon Hyeok in mind?

17
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:17,231
 If you're not interested in helping me,

18
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:21,140
 Vice Chairman Jung Joon Il will be arrested.

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,176
 I called in a favor from Cho Kang Hyeon.

20
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:28,531
 That and I'll reveal all of Joon Hyeok's infidelities.

21
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,240
 If I'm going to lose it all anyway,

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,909
 then I guess I have nothing to regret.

23
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:42,367
 So what shall I do?

24
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:50,406
 Fine. I will try to help you.

25
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:53,875
 I know that you are clever,

26
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,906
 and the fact that you asked for my help shows me you know your limits.

27
00:01:56,906 --> 00:02:00,023
 I like the fact that you have clear ambitions.

28
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:04,611
 What shall I teach you first?

29
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:12,225
 You'll have to apologize first, for testing me.

30
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:16,299
 What?

31
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,288
 For what you did to Madam Kwon.

32
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,544
 I was a bit surprised.

33
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:25,579
 So you think I cause the death of Cho Kang Hyeon's wife?

34
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:31,360
 I wouldn't have even started if I thought I would back down.

35
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:43,725
 Why did you start?

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,725
 Kneel. And bow your head.

37
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:54,507
 Tell me that you are sincerely sorry

38
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,818
 and cry some alligator tears for good measure.

39
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,314
 - What? 
 - I know you can do it.

40
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:06,814
 You even married your driver

41
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:11,850
 so your son wouldn't be a bastard child.

42
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:19,505
 You even accepted another woman's son as your own.

43
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,580
 Kneeling should be nothing.

44
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,980
 Would you rather send your only son to prison?

45
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,714
 That's enough.

46
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:03,292
 I said, enough.

47
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:09,880
 I'm not such a fool as to ruin a good thing.

48
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,297
 You, Mother, are the embodiment of the Sungjin Group.

49
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:25,900
 You should always remain graceful.

50
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:37,633
 Just make sure to remember who holds the key to the castle.

51
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:13,473
Yoo Jin Seok will narrate the special exhibition, right?

52
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:14,497
Yes, Mother.

53
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:18,330
The minister said he would take the time to help us.

54
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,341
It's been over ten years since he was the minister.

55
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:24,960
He mustn't have accomplished much

56
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,293
if he still uses his tenure as a government minister to get jobs.

57
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:30,960
That's why I was thinking,

58
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:37,046
I don't think Yoo Jin Seok would be appropriate to narrate the exhibition.

59
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:40,273
Look, Jae Hee… The minister

60
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,224
graduated from a top art school and directed the Biennale numerous times.

61
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:46,843
He was also the Minister of Culture.

62
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:49,505
He is a frontrunner for the directorship of the Museum of Modern Art.

63
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:52,250
If he isn't appropriate, then who is?

64
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,924
That's my point.

65
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:59,191
I don't want the speaker to steal the spotlight from the message.

66
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:01,398
You're acting so childish.

67
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:04,655
I don't know what to say to you.

68
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,606
I wonder.

69
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:12,343
You two discuss it among yourselves.

70
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:14,332
Yes, Chairwoman.

71
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,340

72
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,571
Dong Min, go to the Prosecutor's Office and get an insert.

73
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:22,641
All right.

74
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:25,013
- Hurry. 
 - All right.

75
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,760

76
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,190
Oath. I swear that as candidate

77
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:33,526
for Prosecutor General, I will answer

78
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:37,522
all questions put forth to me by the members of

79
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:41,564
the National Assembly of Korea truthfully.

80
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:45,319
Candidate Cho Kang Hyeon.

81
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:52,570

82
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,710
Mother, does Jae Hee have something on you?

83
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,015
How else could you let her behave impudently like that.

84
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:14,216
This is why you won't get anywhere.

85
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:16,529
You're always whining.

86
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,540
You'll have no one to blame but yourself if you lose everything to Jae Hee.

87
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:30,313
Mrs. Yoon, that was really impressive.

88
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,797
But do you have anyone else in mind to narrate the exhibition?

89
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:37,961
Or you could do it yourself.

90
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:40,980
Can you make an appointment with Kim Yi Seol for me?

91
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,544
- Kim Yi Seol? 
 - I'd like to have a simple lunch with her.

92
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:46,690
Oh, of course.

93
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:00,625
What's so urgent?

94
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,986
I ordered for you. I know it's your favorite.

95
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:06,001
You'd always insist on eating here

96
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:09,610
even when I suggested much more expensive places.

97
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,741
That was years ago.

98
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:13,286
Do you remember this place?

99
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,130
The owner would chide you for eating too much kimchi

100
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,840
with a single bowl of stew.

101
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,453
Don't do this.

102
00:09:19,453 --> 00:09:21,624
What did I do?

103
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:26,800
Eat. We can talk afterward.

104
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:40,915
Welcome.

105
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:47,424
How about a cup of coffee?

106
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:49,320
I'd rather not.

107
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:57,577
This is the record from No Young Joo's obstetrician.

108
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,960

109
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:05,716
She gave birth.

110
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:07,918
Although the record says that it was

111
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:11,119
a stillbirth, the nurse says the child was sent away for adoption.

112
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:14,024
So it was Cho Kang Hyeon's child?

113
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:16,366
That's possible considering the period.

114
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:20,011
What a dirty man.

115
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:24,555
If Seo Han Sook is behind all this as you said,

116
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:28,248
shouldn't you look for someone else to ally yourself other than Cho?

117
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:31,353
What other options do I have?

118
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:34,203
He's a dirtbag for sure,

119
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:36,711
but that's why he's working with me.

120
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:42,192
Also, I've invested too much time until now.

121
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:46,411
Find out everything you can about No Young Joo.

122
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:49,713
Everything pertaining to her relationship with Cho.

123
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,214
This is my last opportunity.

124
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:59,010
What about the adoptive parents?

125
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,304
They even faked the child's death.

126
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,422
They're probably unaware that anyone knows about the child.

127
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:14,672
Hey, why are you looking at me like that?

128
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:20,025
How is Hyeon Woo doing?

129
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:26,010
How Hyeon Woo is doing is none of your business.

130
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,221
- Jae Hee– 
 - Don't overstep your bounds

131
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,114
and find out more about No Young Joo.

132
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:32,288
I'll pay you plenty,

133
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,911
including today's meal.

134
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,560

135
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:13,609
I'm back, Madam.

136
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:17,712
So what did they say?

137
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:19,338
They'll announce the appointment

138
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:23,115
for Civil Affairs Secretary three weeks after Cho has been confirmed.

139
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:30,757
Should we notify the station about Master Joon Hyeok's resignation?

140
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,824
First, let's see what Jae Hee does.

141
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:41,636
It's cute how she thinks she owns the castle just because she holds the key.

142
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,423
But if she somehow were to lose the key,

143
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:48,085
she wouldn't be able to come back to the castle.

144
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:52,789
There won't be anyone there to greet her.

145
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:07,767
- I think this needs a little more soy sauce. 
 - Okay.

146
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,593
 - Daddy! 
 - Hi!

147
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:12,514
You surprised me!

148
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:15,889
Daddy, Mom says that we'll have a party.

149
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,279
Really?

150
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,247
You should have used the doorbell. I would have come out to greet you.

151
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:22,081
Wow, something smells fantastic.

152
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:24,290
I've cooked something special.

153
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,591
I'm hungry. Why don't we eat?

154
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:28,589
Sounds like a plan.

155
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:30,890
What did you do today?

156
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,407
Son, have a drink.

157
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:37,910
A drink before dinner helps with digestion.

158
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:46,525
You've been through a lot.

159
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:57,976
As your wife said, I rushed into marriage

160
00:13:57,976 --> 00:14:02,321
with your mother without any preparation.

161
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:06,634
And I was a poor dad and husband.

162
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:09,612
It's not your fault that you were born out of wedlock.

163
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:13,410
But it wasn't Joon Hyeok's fault either.

164
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,906
The fact that I had a son as clever as Joon Hyeok

165
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:21,620
after a single mistake that I made,

166
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,158
makes me think that the heavens have taken pity on me.

167
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,128
Please don't hate Joon Hyeok.

168
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:32,853
Because he was my son,

169
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:36,134
he could only realize a fraction of his enormous potential.

170
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:38,009
He doesn't hate Joon Hyeok.

171
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:40,214
Just look at his wife.

172
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:44,113
He had to marry far beneath his station.

173
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:45,851
Fine.

174
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:50,632
So I sold your son off to marriage to help him.

175
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:54,582
If you're so unhappy, why don't you have Joon Hyeok get a divorce and find him another woman?

176
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:57,734
I would love to do that

177
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:01,332
if only it weren't for Joon Il.

178
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:06,046
Drink.

179
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:14,281
"The Moon Rabbit spread his arms and said,

180
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:18,954
Daddy Rabbit's arms are much longer than mine.

181
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:20,987
Daddy…

182
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:26,181
loves you this much."

183
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:31,626
I wish my arms were long too.

184
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,496
You should sleep.

185
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:37,917
I love you so much, Daddy,

186
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,342
that I love you as much as the river is long.

187
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:47,625
I love you so much that my love could reach the moon

188
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,712
and come all the way back to earth.

189
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,934
I love you, Hyeon Woo.

190
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:26,290
He's so cute when he tries to stay awake when he's sleepy.

191
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,809
He's at an age when he looks up to his dad.

192
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:33,390
He wants to be like you in every way.

193
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,714
Someone sent you a text.

194
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:46,028

195
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:53,031
How about you? How did you feel about your father?

196
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:56,681
I felt very differently about him. You should know that, Honey.

197
00:16:56,681 --> 00:17:01,997
That's why you should try to set a good example for our son.

198
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:05,638
Of course.

199
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:10,222
But setting a good example isn't enough.

200
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:13,508
You can't just take care of your own children.

201
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:18,464
You have to create a better world for all the children of the future.

202
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:22,566
We have to approach our plans in that way, all right?

203
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:27,105
They're all talking about my conflict

204
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:30,569
with my brother. They don't know anything about it, yet they keep talking.

205
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:34,726
It's not like I've allied with Cho because I like him.

206
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:37,982
But if you want to work for the greater good,

207
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:41,217
sometimes, you'll have to roll in the dirt.

208
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:45,192
People think they're so clean, but they're powerless to effect change.

209
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:47,857
You're going to change all that.

210
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:52,753
Shut those people up for good.

211
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:09,703
You should have seen how Jae Hee behaved.

212
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:13,276
It was quite annoying.

213
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:17,456
She was talking to the chairman of the Sungjin Group.

214
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:23,697
Yet, the way she behaved showed how crass and vulgar she is.

215
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:27,811
Then, why did you give her the company documents?

216
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:30,483
Thanks to you, Joon Il almost went to prison.

217
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:34,037
That's because she was threatening me.

218
00:18:34,037 --> 00:18:38,922
She threatened my only son-in-law

219
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:40,897
so what could I do?

220
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:46,242
I couldn't let him go to prison just because he made one mistake.

221
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:50,532
She thinks she's well-connected just because her friend

222
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:52,789
is a prosecutor for the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

223
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:56,834
Does Jae Hee have a prosecutor friend?

224
00:19:52,673 --> 00:19:54,050
Good morning, Da Eun.

225
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,798
Hello.

226
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:59,761
Which restaurant did you reserve for lunch with Kim Yi Seol?

227
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:03,009
Well, the thing is…

228
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:08,988
She said she didn't have the time because of work.

229
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:12,308
She neither accepted nor turned it down.

230
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:29,916
You acted like that because Mrs. Lee was rude to you, right?

231
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,449
Yes.

232
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:38,316
Would it make you feel better if I apologized in her stead?

233
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:40,143
Why should you apologize?

234
00:20:40,143 --> 00:20:42,714
Because I need you.

235
00:20:42,714 --> 00:20:44,891
I need you, Yi Seol.

236
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:51,005
I came here to apologize and ask you for a favor.

237
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,019
I'm so relieved.

238
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:03,592
I've been wondering about why you wanted to see me.

239
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:05,454
I was also worried.

240
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:08,641
Why? Did you think I wanted to fight?

241
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:11,323
I'm not that kind of person.

242
00:21:12,723 --> 00:21:15,390
I wanted to impress you.

243
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:21,920
You know, they call me a docent, but the exhibit is narrated by someone else.

244
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:28,118
It's just a euphemism for exhibition guide.

245
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,500
- Did it make you feel uncomfortable? 
 - Yes.

246
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,564
Without any substance.

247
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:38,916
They give you a respectful title

248
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,706
to show how classy they are.

249
00:21:42,706 --> 00:21:45,775
I can't say that I'm innocent.

250
00:21:47,588 --> 00:21:51,623
There are lots of hypocrites who will deny that.

251
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:58,039
I didn't know you were the argumentative type.

252
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:05,098
That's why I wanted to impress you.

253
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:11,916
I see that you wanted to act like a real docent.

254
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,959
Yes.

255
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:17,122
And, is that why you wrote the report on your own?

256
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:18,555
Yes.

257
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:23,804
Congratulations, Yi Seol.

258
00:22:25,207 --> 00:22:27,581
Your plan succeeded.

259
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:29,786
 Everything is the same.

260
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:34,158
 I just need to change the picture on the profile.

261
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:36,389
Okay. Okay.

262
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:39,317
I'll send you the revised file right now.

263
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,936
All right.

264
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:57,204
Minister Yoo! It's been so long!

265
00:22:57,204 --> 00:23:01,416
It seems that you haven't aged a bit.

266
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:04,259
It feels like we just met yesterday.

267
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:07,409
Still as silver-tongued as ever, I see.

268
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,754
- Let's go. 
 - Sure.

269
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,934
Yi Seol, your report was excellent.

270
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,606
We just need to make some revisions and it will be perfect.

271
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:20,519
And we'll have multiple rehearsals.

272
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:27,315
Seeing how you fought with Mrs. Lee makes me think you have guts.

273
00:23:27,315 --> 00:23:29,521
Let me know when you decide

274
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:32,321
whether you'd rather be a fulltime employee

275
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:36,403
or a docent for the Sungjin Culture Foundation and I'll help you.

276
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:38,175
Okay.

277
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:41,530
I'd better get going now. Good luck with work.

278
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,704
Please take a look at the brochure before it goes to print.

279
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:59,606
We'll reserve a studio for a photoshoot if you don't like the picture.

280
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:05,087
A photoshoot? That sounds uncomfortable.

281
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:09,110
I don't know how people manage to work in front of the camera.

282
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,514
You have to get used to it. It's a visual age, after all.

283
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:21,603
Let's see the brochure.

284
00:24:21,603 --> 00:24:24,156
We want to see if the minister's profile is correct.

285
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:26,594
What?

286
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:30,138
Show us the brochure.

287
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,679
Hi, Da Eun.

288
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,820
I'm almost there. I'm in the parking lot.

289
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,341
What?

290
00:24:56,606 --> 00:24:58,106
Okay.

291
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:05,145
If the Insurance Business Act is passed,

292
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:09,616
you'll have to sell over half of your shares to Sungjin Life.

293
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:14,042
If the merger between Sungjin Trade and Apparel falls through,

294
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:17,320
you might lose your control of the group.

295
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:22,214
That is troublesome.

296
00:25:22,214 --> 00:25:25,825
Jae Hee is quite clever

297
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,130
and observant.

298
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,922
Maybe you should get rid of her now?

299
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:35,794
Seon Mi.

300
00:25:35,794 --> 00:25:38,125
Have you ever hunted rabbits?

301
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,041
I went a couple of times with the previous chairman

302
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:44,011
and Master Joon Il as well.

303
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:49,850
I hated rabbit hunting when I was young.

304
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,189
At least you can eat pheasant meat.

305
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:58,330
But rabbits are useless creatures.

306
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,605
Also, my dad always took Ruby.

307
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:06,319
Do you mean the German shepherd that you raised?

308
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:11,136
I even put her in socks that I knitted

309
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,227
so I was annoyed how my dad would take her out on the dirty ground.

310
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:17,747
Once, she hurt her leg during the hunt.

311
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:21,414
Do you know what I did?

312
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,996
I yelled at my dad

313
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:28,079
and blamed him for hurting my dog.

314
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:35,311
I was quite impudent for a nine year old girl.

315
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:39,586
I raged at him thinking he would scold me

316
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:42,752
but instead, he thought it was cute.

317
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:45,212
Then he told me

318
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:48,322
that you shouldn't raise a dog to be soft.

319
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:51,735
A true dog should be able to protect her master.

320
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:59,034
I hadn't realized that my dad took Ruby out to train her.

321
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,137
He wanted Ruby to be able to protect me

322
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:05,013
because he was worried about me.

323
00:27:07,702 --> 00:27:10,644
It would have been nice

324
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:14,645
had he lived to see his hundredth birthday.

325
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,309
I think there must have been a misunderstanding.

326
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,242
I thought that the Chairwoman had consented,

327
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:30,113
and you hadn't said anything much.

328
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:35,131
How dare you act so insolently!

329
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:43,517
You think you can do whatever you want, don't you?

330
00:27:48,312 --> 00:27:52,411
I've taken the liberty to rehire Kim Yi Seol.

331
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:56,109
I read her critique of the exhibition.

332
00:27:56,109 --> 00:28:00,330
She has a special insight into art.

333
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,034
Also, she's about to graduate from the University of Korea.

334
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:05,989
So she thinks that she can

335
00:28:05,989 --> 00:28:08,144
come into my house

336
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,141
and steal everything just because she's clever

337
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:13,694
even though she doesn't have shit? Just like you!

338
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:17,540
Why? Didn't you think you stole enough by yourself?

339
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,989
So you went and invited your beggar friends?

340
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:23,901
You don't have to be so offensive.

341
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:27,937
I'm not stealing, I'm taking.

342
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:31,439
And also, Joo Yeon, I'll make you

343
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:35,694
and all your high and mighty friends kneel to people like me

344
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:37,920
and beg for mercy.

345
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,104
How dare you!

346
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:45,792
Things won't be easy for you anymore.

347
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:50,043
You lived a life of luxury as the child of the owner of the Hanju Daily.

348
00:28:50,043 --> 00:28:53,409
Then you married the son of a wealthy corporation.

349
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:57,450
You didn't do anything to get the things you have.

350
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,379
You little…

351
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:11,677
So… you'd better think carefully about how you behave in the future,

352
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:14,309
you dumb bitch.

353
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,515
Seon Mi.

354
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:41,797
Do you know what happened to Ruby?

355
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,313
I killed her.

356
00:29:55,216 --> 00:29:58,823
She was loyal, even until old age.

357
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,406
She guarded the house and caught rats.

358
00:30:05,985 --> 00:30:09,241
Then one day, when I was pregnant with Joon Il,

359
00:30:10,302 --> 00:30:15,013
she bit me while I was putting ointment on her leg

360
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,543
that was injured in a mousetrap.

361
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:21,183
She must have been in such misery.

362
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:23,474
It must have been agonizing.

363
00:30:24,316 --> 00:30:28,994
So I did her a favor

364
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:32,625
with my dad's hunting rifle.

365
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,423
 Hello, I'm Yoon Jae Hee and I'm in charge of protocol.

366
00:31:13,995 --> 00:31:17,723
 How are the preparations going?

367
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:23,819
 Not as well as when you were director, Minister Yu.

368
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:26,708
 Did you major in art? Where did you study?

369
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:28,784
 I studied Western Painting at the University of Korea.

370
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:31,141
 I didn't ask about your school.

371
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:36,039
 I guess experience is more important when you plan exhibitions.

372
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:39,856
 You're quite impudent.

373
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:44,197
 Will the Korean art world improve if there are more people like you?

374
00:31:44,197 --> 00:31:46,266
 I doubt it.

375
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:53,677
 I heard that the Ministry of Culture

376
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:56,682
 was sponsoring an exhibition for new artists.

377
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,190
 So?

378
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:02,475
 I would love to be part of it, if you'd let me.

379
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,539
 Give me your business card.

380
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:14,629
 I'm currently working as a curator at an art gallery.

381
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:19,267
 Art galleries don't have curators. You should call yourself a dealer.

382
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,413
 I understand, Sir.

383
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:31,102
 You're quite pretty.

384
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,811
 Thank you for your compliment.

385
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:40,099
 I'm very curious

386
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:43,694
 about how far you're willing to go.

387
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:58,202
 Minister Yoo, it's time for the tape cutting.

388
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,541
 Let's talk privately afterward.

389
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,410

390
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,862
 Why is Minister Yoo so nice to her?

391
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,184
 I don't know.

392
00:34:25,184 --> 00:34:27,542
 She's the youngest manager at the National Museum of Modern Art.

393
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:30,826
 She graduated from Illinois University and got her doctorates at Yale.

394
00:34:30,826 --> 00:34:35,268
 She's going to direct the New Artists' Exhibition.

395
00:34:35,268 --> 00:34:38,514
 Her father is a member of the National Assembly.

396
00:34:38,514 --> 00:34:40,401
 Let's go eat. I'm hungry.

397
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:43,314
 - I bet you envy her. 
 - No, I don't.

398
00:34:58,334 --> 00:35:02,008
 I got money from my tutoring job. I wanted to treat you to something nice.

399
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:05,327
 - Jung Ho. 
 - What do you want to eat?

400
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:08,420
 Among Ministers, Assemblymen and Judges,

401
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:11,113
 who has the highest position?

402
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:15,880
 They represent the three different branches so how can you compare?

403
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,191
 That's not what I mean.

404
00:35:20,811 --> 00:35:24,811
 Assemblymen are as high as assistant ministers.

405
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:29,195
 Judges are only as high as ministers if they are in the high court,

406
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:32,319
 so ministers are the highest.

407
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:36,106
 What if that person also has a lot of money?

408
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:38,144
 Then he's on top of the world.

409
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:43,873
 How about prosecutors? That's what you want to be, right?

410
00:35:44,511 --> 00:35:47,789
 Prosecutors are considered level four or three officials.

411
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:51,119
 But not all prosecutors are the same.

412
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,430
 If you go to the top high schools and universities

413
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,608
 then pass the bar exam, do you know what you'll be?

414
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:01,477
 You'll be part of the Invincible Family.

415
00:36:01,477 --> 00:36:03,139
 That's so corny.

416
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:07,459
 It is. I admit it, but…

417
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:10,382
 most of the highest positions of the land belong to them.

418
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:12,319
 No one can match their power

419
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:16,591
 unless it's the chairman of the Sungjin Group.

420
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,853

421
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:28,911
 Make sure to get rid of unwanted acquaintances before you see Madam Seo.

422
00:36:28,928 --> 00:36:31,145
 There will be three dates with Master Joon Hyeok

423
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:34,139
 before the wedding takes place.

424
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:38,840
 You'll find all other details in the prenuptial agreement.

425
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,660

426
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,410

427
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,520

428
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,076

429
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:40,460

430
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:13,307
Prosecutorial reform is what the entire nation wants.

431
00:38:13,307 --> 00:38:17,326
Why? Because prosecutors have all the power.

432
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:21,845
They don't want prosecutors to influence politics.

433
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:25,334
So who'll achieve reform?

434
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:28,092
Well? Who'll do it?

435
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:29,920
Of course, it's me!

436
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,183
I, Cho Kang Hyeon will do it!

437
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:35,391
I didn't have any connections,

438
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:38,639
but I served the Prosecutor's Office loyally.

439
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,350
I'm the man for the job!

440
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,937
Right? Yes…

441
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:49,841
Hey. Hey.

442
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,662
Your phone's ringing.

443
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,250

444
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:00,001
Sunbaenim.

445
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,637
Excuse me.

446
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:04,124
Am I right or what?

447
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:08,398
Think about it. What this era needs is…

448
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:26,071
What if someone sees us?

449
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:27,826
Who cares?

450
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:30,177
How did you know I was here?

451
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:34,504
I'm aware of everything in my husband's schedule.

452
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,896
Where is No Young Joo's home?

453
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:18,456

454
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:20,480

455
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,571

456
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:27,078

457
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:29,103

458
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:35,761

459
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:27,690
So she committed suicide?

460
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,590
She jumped into the Han River.

461
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,791
They say she was deep in debt.

462
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:37,406
I read the police report.

463
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:41,400
How do you close a suicide case?

464
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,775
Try to close it right away.

465
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:44,695
I can't do it yet.

466
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,405
I can close the case if the next of kin shows up.

467
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:49,534
That's all the more reason to close the case now

468
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,874
so that there are no problems.

469
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,218
What's with that expression?

470
00:42:57,227 --> 00:42:59,802
- Do you have to do this? 
 - Then?

471
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:03,908
I should ruin my life

472
00:43:03,908 --> 00:43:06,608
because of some floozy who worked in a bar?

473
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,610
I know you pity her.

474
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,326
She grew up in an orphanage

475
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:16,400
and dreamt of a happy marriage even as she worked at a bar.

476
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:21,999
Also, she was penniless and committed suicide.

477
00:43:23,825 --> 00:43:25,842
But you know what?

478
00:43:27,323 --> 00:43:29,724
I pity myself even more.

479
00:43:29,724 --> 00:43:34,219
I had parents and my dad was a judge.

480
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:36,597
I was a good student, too.

481
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:40,756
You know, it's not easy to get into University of Korea even as an art major

482
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,594
even though it's a walk in the park compared to the bar exam.

483
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:47,200
- Jae Hee… 
 - But people still look down on me.

484
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,024
People like Lee Joo Yeon

485
00:43:50,024 --> 00:43:53,361
whose husband my dad saved by giving up his principles.

486
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:55,905
And people like my mother-in-law.

487
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:59,608
You were the one who chose to marry Joon Hyeok.

488
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:02,921
It's not too late to stop if it's so hard.

489
00:44:02,921 --> 00:44:04,931
I chose it?

490
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:09,313
Did I choose to hang onto a thread of hope with all my strength?

491
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:15,193
You're working under a scumbag like Cho because you want to succeed.

492
00:44:15,193 --> 00:44:17,741
It's the same with me.

493
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:21,811
You may have a choice other than Cho Kang Hyeon,

494
00:44:21,811 --> 00:44:25,605
but for me this is my safest bet.

495
00:44:29,397 --> 00:44:32,089
The fact that you are always by my side,

496
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,308
that is your choice.

497
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:37,897
It's not too late to stop if it's so hard for you.

498
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:19,103

499
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:34,149
What did I do to deserve such treatment!

500
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:36,434
Honey…

501
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:38,762
Will you get a hold of yourself?

502
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:42,349
Hey, Ms. Oh!

503
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:48,918
You know that I would never leave my wife, don't you?

504
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:53,780
- You know it, right? 
 - Of course. I'm sure.

505
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,695
Mi Seon! Kwon Mi Seon!

506
00:45:58,695 --> 00:46:02,265
Wife! Honey! My dear wife!

507
00:46:02,265 --> 00:46:04,672
Honey, where are you going?

508
00:46:04,672 --> 00:46:06,216
Take me with you, dear!

509
00:46:06,216 --> 00:46:09,563
I'm so sorry, dear!

510
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:12,319
Take me with you!

511
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,681
Dear!

512
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:17,805
- Please take me with you! 
 - Jeez, you imbecile!

513
00:46:17,805 --> 00:46:19,507
Take me with you!

514
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:23,615
Mi Seon! Where are you going?

515
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:26,161
You can't do this to me!

516
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,772
This marriage won't end

517
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:32,583
just because you leave!

518
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:37,474
Ms. Oh, what's the bill?

519
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:38,970
Shut up!

520
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,876
Want to go to a hotel?

521
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,569
- Try to get up! 
 - All right!

522
00:46:44,574 --> 00:46:48,947
Why the hell is he so heavy?

523
00:47:25,664 --> 00:47:29,123
Why haven't you quit smoking yet?

524
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,252
It's hard to wash the clothes of a smoker.

525
00:47:36,298 --> 00:47:38,647
I'll just throw them away.

526
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,800
Here.

527
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:46,520
Take a spoonful every day.

528
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,686
And don't stand there in the cold. Go inside.

529
00:47:49,686 --> 00:47:53,787
You shouldn't smoke or stand in the cold with your weak lungs.

530
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:58,708
You're always thinking of new ways to torture your mother, aren't you?

531
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:04,692
The fact that I exist is torture to you, isn't it?

532
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:10,847
I've reclaimed the shares of

533
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:13,002
Sungjin Trade that I had entrusted to your aunt

534
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:16,433
and split them up in accounts under aliases.

535
00:48:16,433 --> 00:48:20,308
We don't have to worry even if they pass the Insurance Business Act.

536
00:48:20,308 --> 00:48:24,693
Sungjin Trade can purchase the shares of Sungjin Life.

537
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,448
We shouldn't have tried to merge Sungjin Trade with Apparel.

538
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:30,802
That's why we committed accounting fraud.

539
00:48:30,802 --> 00:48:34,279
When Joon Hyeok becomes Senior Secretary of Civil Affairs,

540
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,822
we can get the rights

541
00:48:36,822 --> 00:48:39,873
to develop the remainder of the land in Hyeongsan-dong.

542
00:48:39,873 --> 00:48:42,233
That is a project worth seven trillion won.

543
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,873
It'll be worth even more when they start demolishment.

544
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:48,598
Sungjin Trade's value will return

545
00:48:48,598 --> 00:48:51,521
and we'll have enough money to buy shares of Sungjin Life.

546
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:56,703
Are you going to use Dad's company for demolishment?

547
00:48:56,703 --> 00:49:00,144
Yes. Your father needs to earn his keep.

548
00:49:00,144 --> 00:49:03,609
Have you already forgotten what he did?

549
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:08,061
Joon Il, I don't care about anything else.

550
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:11,279
All my life, my only goal has been

551
00:49:11,279 --> 00:49:14,071
to make you the chairman of the Sungjin Group.

552
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,162
You know how I've lived until now.

553
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:25,814
Joon Il.

554
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:28,160
You must become chairman

555
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,103
in order to protect Sungjin Group and me,

556
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:37,298
so that no one can ridicule me for giving birth

557
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:39,797
to a child out of wedlock.

558
00:50:18,055 --> 00:50:20,749
- Nice shot! 
 - Nice!

559
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,877
Excellent!

560
00:50:22,877 --> 00:50:26,615
Nice shot! He's so strong!

561
00:50:26,615 --> 00:50:28,508
Jae Hee,

562
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:32,408
I heard you receive your husband's itinerary every morning.

563
00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:35,613
If he's doing anything with my husband,

564
00:50:35,613 --> 00:50:37,875
please give me a heads up, won't you?

565
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,823
Didn't he say he was golfing?

566
00:50:39,907 --> 00:50:42,711
Then you should just believe him.

567
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:45,984
He said he'll golf so he'll golf.

568
00:50:45,984 --> 00:50:49,242
But it's what happens afterward that's the problem.

569
00:50:50,883 --> 00:50:53,306
Why are you laughing? I'm wracked with worry!

570
00:50:53,306 --> 00:50:55,609
- You got what you deserve. 
 - What?

571
00:50:55,609 --> 00:50:59,709
Madam Kwon acted the same way because of you.

572
00:51:07,476 --> 00:51:08,621
This place is so nice.

573
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:12,280
What do you want? I'll buy.

574
00:51:16,613 --> 00:51:20,097
It won't be my break for a while.

575
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:22,774
I came here to give you this.

576
00:51:22,774 --> 00:51:25,368
- What is it? 
 - It's a gift.

577
00:51:25,368 --> 00:51:28,724
Come to the gallery wearing this for tomorrow's rehearsal.

578
00:51:30,615 --> 00:51:32,003
Thank you.

579
00:51:32,003 --> 00:51:34,899
Thank you for not turning me down.

580
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:36,810
See you tomorrow.

581
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,729
Who was that?

582
00:51:51,729 --> 00:51:55,130
You can stay here if you want. I have another appointment to go to.

583
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:59,330
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

584
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,430
Jae Hee!

585
00:52:03,303 --> 00:52:05,500
Jae Hee!

586
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,627
How can you be cold!

587
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:10,290
All you have to do is tell me

588
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,926
what they're going to do after they golf.

589
00:52:12,926 --> 00:52:15,146
When I think of the sins I committed to my late Big Sister…

590
00:52:15,146 --> 00:52:16,942
 No Young Joo's case has been closed.

591
00:52:16,942 --> 00:52:19,770
You can hate the sin, but don't hate the sinner.

592
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,285
- And think of my poor Gyu Seong! 
 - Ye Rin…

593
00:52:23,285 --> 00:52:26,596
Ye Rin? Me?

594
00:52:26,596 --> 00:52:31,623
Just try to believe what your husband says and go home.

595
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:38,292
What if you find anything out?

596
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:40,367
What are you going to do?

597
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:42,778
You can't even be a mother to your son.

598
00:52:42,778 --> 00:52:46,641
Even if you find out where he went, there's nothing you can do.

599
00:52:48,602 --> 00:52:52,625
Your words are so mean.

600
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:55,656
Fine. I understand what you mean.

601
00:52:55,656 --> 00:52:57,560
I'll go.

602
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,570
What else can I do, after all?

603
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,702
You won't even listen to me.

604
00:53:02,702 --> 00:53:06,711
And it's obvious what he'll do after golf.

605
00:53:31,515 --> 00:53:33,333
Yes, Prosecutor General.

606
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:36,534
Yes, I have the car.

607
00:53:36,534 --> 00:53:41,004
Then I'm going to send you an address. Come to that place.

608
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,720
Yes, I understand, Sir.

609
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:07,028
Hello, Mother.

610
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:23,408
Why did you call me to this place?

611
00:54:23,408 --> 00:54:27,923
I don't think I've ever treated you to a meal.

612
00:54:27,923 --> 00:54:30,205
When I first got married,

613
00:54:30,205 --> 00:54:32,730
I was scared of you and hated you.

614
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,308
But I wanted to get on your good side

615
00:54:35,308 --> 00:54:38,158
so I thought about what I should do,

616
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:42,938
whether I should buy you a gift, and what gift I should buy.

617
00:54:42,938 --> 00:54:46,192
Then I understood.

618
00:54:46,192 --> 00:54:49,823
There was nothing I could give you.

619
00:54:49,823 --> 00:54:52,089
You already have everything.

620
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:56,116
There is nothing you can't get if you want it.

621
00:54:57,542 --> 00:55:00,578
I wonder why you're explaining yourself

622
00:55:00,578 --> 00:55:04,590
to the mother-in-law you force to kneel.

623
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:08,025
The case has been closed on the suicide of No Yeong-ju,

624
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:10,696
the woman in the sex video.

625
00:55:10,696 --> 00:55:13,411
I see. Well done.

626
00:55:15,316 --> 00:55:18,260
- I want to get along with you, Mother. 
 - Is that so?

627
00:55:18,278 --> 00:55:21,700
It's a good thing to get along with others.

628
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:27,816
You've tied up loose ends with Cho. Now, it is Joon Hyeok's turn?

629
00:55:30,095 --> 00:55:34,906
Why? Don't you think you can take care of your husband's affairs?

630
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:36,224
No.

631
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:42,593
I'll need more strength in order to take care of his mistress.

632
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:44,686
Please give me the shares to

633
00:55:44,686 --> 00:55:48,557
Sungjin Trade you promised to Hyeon Woo.

634
00:55:55,118 --> 00:56:00,510
Joon Hyeok will have to make his assets public after he becomes Secretary.

635
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,295
Are you sure it'll be all right?

636
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:04,702
I plan to donate them to the Sungjin Culture Foundation

637
00:56:04,702 --> 00:56:08,700
in return for its control.

638
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:31,649
That was a good shot.

639
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:33,383
Did you wash up?

640
00:56:33,383 --> 00:56:37,671
Now, it's onto the next destination.

641
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:44,129
Thank you. You're dismissed.

642
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,764
We're off!

643
00:57:10,412 --> 00:57:15,745

644
00:59:02,089 --> 00:59:04,034
What the hell!

645
00:59:08,182 --> 00:59:10,251
What if someone sees you?

646
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:11,731
So what?

647
00:59:14,049 --> 00:59:14,913
Are you angry?

648
00:59:14,913 --> 00:59:19,026
You must not know where your husband is, if you think someone could see us.

649
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:24,113
I'm sure he's off somewhere partying with some floozies.

650
00:59:24,113 --> 00:59:26,549
Are you here to rub it in?

651
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:28,705
Why didn't you bring some pictures?

652
00:59:28,705 --> 00:59:32,742
It didn't look like he had a shred of guilt as he went to cheat on you.

653
00:59:32,826 --> 00:59:35,091
I don't want to hear it. There's no reason to.

654
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:37,301
Is this your thread of hope?

655
00:59:37,301 --> 00:59:38,973
Don't play the sympathy card.

656
00:59:38,973 --> 00:59:41,696
This is all because of your ambition.

657
00:59:41,696 --> 00:59:44,138
You have a nice house and a nice car,

658
00:59:44,138 --> 00:59:47,789
but still, nothing is enough to satisfy your dirty ambitions.

659
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:51,729
What's so dirty about my ambitions?

660
00:59:52,906 --> 00:59:55,483
Do you know what's really dirty?

661
01:00:00,403 --> 01:00:03,705
This is what's really dirty. Got it?

662
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:08,416
It's being used and mocked because you're in love with me.

663
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:12,007
I don't want to be treated like that.

664
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:15,870
That's why I'm doing all this. Do you understand?

665
01:00:53,704 --> 01:00:55,849
Good morning.

666
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,212
- Have you had breakfast? 
 - Yes, Mother.

667
01:01:17,824 --> 01:01:19,320
Let's go.

668
01:01:30,422 --> 01:01:34,214
Sister-in-law and her husband seem happy today.

669
01:01:34,214 --> 01:01:36,310
Really?

670
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:40,168
I haven't been myself today.

671
01:01:40,895 --> 01:01:43,411
You look a little pale, Mother.

672
01:01:43,411 --> 01:01:45,614
I think it might be indigestion.

673
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:48,111
Let me get you some ginger tea.

674
01:01:48,111 --> 01:01:50,906
No. There's no need.

675
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:53,015
Instead,

676
01:01:56,106 --> 01:01:59,240
there is a folder on the desk in the vault.

677
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,798
Please bring it to me.

678
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:03,042
Yes, Mother.

679
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:55,794
You've had me tailed until now

680
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:59,381
and waited for this day, didn't you?

681
01:02:59,381 --> 01:03:00,818
You're very patient.

682
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,217
Joo Yeon gave it to me.

683
01:03:03,217 --> 01:03:08,409
She said she didn't want to give you control of the Sungjin Foundation.

684
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,739
What do you think I should do?

685
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:17,389
Please let me talk first.

686
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:20,799
Kneel.

687
01:03:21,516 --> 01:03:23,634
Get on your knees and bow your head.

688
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:26,275
Tell me that you're sincerely sorry

689
01:03:26,275 --> 01:03:28,616
and beg me to spare you.

690
01:03:31,117 --> 01:03:35,714
And cry some alligator tears for good measure.

691
01:03:45,293 --> 01:03:47,189
Please, spare me.

692
01:03:48,008 --> 01:03:50,027
Spare me, Mother!

693
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:54,419
I just wanted to live in style.

694
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:09,880
What do you think you're doing?

695
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,681
If you'll use this incident to treat me like shit,

696
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:14,237
I would rather die.

697
01:04:14,237 --> 01:04:17,007
I won't live like that anymore! I can't!

698
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:18,624
Let go!

699
01:04:18,624 --> 01:04:20,389
Promise me!

700
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,797
Promise me that you'll treat me well!

701
01:04:22,797 --> 01:04:24,498
You're out of your mind!

702
01:04:24,498 --> 01:04:27,159
Or shoot me! Shoot!

703
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:29,060
You're capable of anything, Mother!

704
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:31,935
Let go! Let go!

705
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:35,328
Shoot me!

706
01:04:39,898 --> 01:04:42,028
What was that sound?

707
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:18,350

708
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:30,878

709
01:05:50,086 --> 01:05:51,744
 I wanted to ask them…

710
01:05:51,744 --> 01:05:56,523
 That's nothing if you want to become a part of the Sungjin Group's family.

711
01:05:56,523 --> 01:05:59,923
 What did I do wrong?

712
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:02,022
 I'm Kim Yi Seol.

713
01:06:03,094 --> 01:06:07,805
 She's not some young floozy.

714
01:06:07,805 --> 01:06:11,707
 I'm interested in you, Joon Hyeok.

715
01:06:11,707 --> 01:06:15,895
 I can't wait. Since you want to die.

716
01:06:15,895 --> 01:06:19,090
 Are you all right, Yi Seol?

717
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:23,100
 It seemed my husband made you uncomfortable.

718
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,979
 What kind of man did

719
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:29,213
 Yoon Jae Hee choose?

720
01:06:29,213 --> 01:06:31,335
 That's what I was curious about.
