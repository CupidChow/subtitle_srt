1
00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:05,787
Yes, I'm really sorry, Chairwoman.

2
00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:07,624
Yes, Chairwoman.

3
00:00:07,624 --> 00:00:09,924
All right. Goodbye.

4
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,720
What did she say?

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,504
Did she give you an earful?

6
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:17,369
There's no need to be tense.

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,412
- It's not like we are opposing her directly. 
 - Aigoo.

8
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:23,802
I'm sorry I'm late!

9
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:27,327
I shouldn't have been tardy, especially since I invited you here.

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,795
You must be so busy moving into your new office

11
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:32,227
and getting used to your new job.

12
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:35,398
I'm sure Prosecutor General Cho has nothing to worry about.

13
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:39,522
He's probably prepared for everything.

14
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:49,634
I informed the chairwoman that we won't be attending as you asked.

15
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,631
I hope she understands the situation.

16
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:54,486
Of course.

17
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:59,104
You've been under her influence for a long time

18
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:01,219
so I understand your concerns.

19
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,425
You should relax.

20
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:05,174
Relax.

21
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:06,782
Give me my racquet.

22
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:11,005
It's time for some tennis.

23
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:15,529
I can't wait!

24
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:24,823
Don't be so surprised. He's trying to assert his dominance.

25
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:28,332
Now that he's attacked us first,

26
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:30,117
we'll have to fight back.

27
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:32,218
That's true, Mother,

28
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:35,305
but this is all so sudden.

29
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:39,304
Why? Don't you think you can fight back?

30
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:42,396
I just can't think of what to do.

31
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:46,620
How about that key? Have you forgotten about it?

32
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:51,122
She was being blackmailed

33
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:54,295
by the person No Young Joo was living with.

34
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:57,511
I thought you had it under control,

35
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:00,422
so I didn't say anything.

36
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:20,133

37
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,770

38
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:28,932

39
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:31,714

40
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:40,905

41
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:52,161

42
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:01,414
 How you use this on Cho is up to you.

43
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:14,862

44
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,288

45
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:31,309

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,580

47
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,685

48
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:03,306
Hello?

49
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:08,837
Is anyone there?

50
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:12,049
No one lives there.

51
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:18,213
Did a lady named No Young Joo live here?

52
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:23,718
I'm Han Dong Min, a reporter for JBC.

53
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,293
Most of the apartments here are empty,

54
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:32,526
and the residents change frequently so I don't know anything.

55
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:35,915
I understand, ma'am.

56
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,345
Where should I go?

57
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,694

58
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,460

59
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,780
 Thank you for your interest.

60
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:13,715
I caught a turtle! It's so heavy.

61
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:48,720

62
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:06,784
 Only the maids are here, and they don't know much.

63
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,022
 - I'm sorry to keep you waiting. 
 - It's all right.

64
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:11,630
 - Take a seat. 
 - All right.

65
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:20,104
Why would they hide anything?

66
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:24,123
Cho Kang Hyeon, Kwon Min Seon, Oh Ye Rin,

67
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:27,325
and Joon Hyeok's wife.

68
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,269
What's going on?

69
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,854

70
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:45,979
Hello.

71
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,632
A reporter? So what did he say?

72
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:03,295
I have to go.

73
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,618
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

74
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,899
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:15,521
I'm so sorry.

76
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:16,987
It's fine. I'm not hurt.

77
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:21,808
Why don't you call me later just in case?

78
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:28,987
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:31,031
Please call me.

80
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:33,229
I'm fine.

81
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,928
Call me!

82
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:37,996
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:49,033
So what was the name of the reporter?

84
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:55,493

85
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,993
Let's put on some lotion.

86
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:12,006
Show me your cheeks.

87
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,691
Let's do this.

88
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:14,930
Show me your cheeks.

89
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,918
Jeez!

90
00:08:19,537 --> 00:08:22,725
Stop it, or I'll beat you up!

91
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,860
Hyeon Woo, you're so strong!

92
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,780
Does that hurt? Aren't I a strong puncher?

93
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:34,225
Daddy!

94
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:42,917
Daddy, can you stay home with me every day?

95
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:44,711
Shall I?

96
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:56,918
You're late.

97
00:08:58,682 --> 00:09:00,444
What's up?

98
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,998
You look like you just saw a ghost.

99
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:08,705
Is Hyeon Woo asleep?

100
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:13,207
Yes. He was so excited that I barely put him to bed.

101
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:16,197
He seems happy that I'm home with him.

102
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:19,309
He wants me to stay home every day.

103
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,080
I see.

104
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:25,671
What's wrong?

105
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,528
It's nothing.

106
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:36,289
I'm just a little scatterbrained these days.

107
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,639
But you're so young and you received a clean certificate of health from the last checkup.

108
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,020
Did you order something from the Internet?

109
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,695
I'm so scared.

110
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,429
Are you going to nag at me?

111
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:53,117
I'm just asking.

112
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,531
Actually, that package is for you.

113
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,949

114
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,004
Who is it?

115
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,512
Why haven't you change your passcode?

116
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:31,926
I just bought it thoughtlessly.

117
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:35,199
I knew that you've give me an earful,

118
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:38,835
but I sent it to you anyway.

119
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:43,913
Who do you think you are sending me this? It's true that I'm angry–

120
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:47,506
You said you'd ask me for help if you need it

121
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,316
and that you wouldn't apologize, didn't you?

122
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:59,104
It's fine, tell me.

123
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,811
I think No Young Joo

124
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:09,530
didn't commit suicide.

125
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:27,718
Did Yoon Jae Hee say anything to you?

126
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:29,909
What do you mean?

127
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:35,114
Did she ask you about me,

128
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:38,589
and what I've been doing?

129
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:42,212
I didn't think you needed to know so I didn't tell you,

130
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,926
but I caused a misunderstanding with Chairwoman Seo.

131
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:48,705
So my friendship with Jae Hee is a little difficult, right now.

132
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:53,415
So is there still a spark between you and her?

133
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:05,211
So Kwon Min Seon hired someone to kill No Young Joo,

134
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:10,728
and Cho Kang Hyeon used his influence to make it look like a suicide?

135
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:13,449
And that's why the person who lived with No Young Joo took revenge?

136
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,710
I didn't even know this

137
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,220
so I helped Cho become Prosecutor General and forged a partnership with him.

138
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,297
He can make a deal with Chairwoman Seo for the Directorship of the CIO so…

139
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:29,604
He wants to tame me to become his errand girl

140
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:32,106
or discard me.

141
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:50,113
If Yoon Jae Hee asks about me by any chance,

142
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:52,398
put in a good word.

143
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:51,834

144
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:54,501
They're sending us a sign by using their wives

145
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,409
to send congratulatory wreaths.

146
00:14:58,392 --> 00:15:01,234
They want to make it clear that

147
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:05,621
they're going after you, not me.

148
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:14,926
So have you found a way to teach Cho a lesson?

149
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:19,434
I can't fight him without decisive evidence.

150
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:26,932
I'm going to obtain evidence that Cho can't deny.

151
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:28,684
That video isn't enough.

152
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:32,712
So you'll blackmail him with his dirty secrets?

153
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:38,432
Yes. He betrayed me after everything I did for him.

154
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:46,903
What is it?

155
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:49,307
I'm sorry, Mother.

156
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:54,605
The hundredth year celebration for your father is such an important event.

157
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:58,034
It's an important event in name only.

158
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:02,590
But Father is no longer with us, so what's the use

159
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:05,116
of celebrating his birthday?

160
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:13,027
There is a gathering between the wives

161
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:15,728
of billionaires and politicians.

162
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,324
First, make these women your allies.

163
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,504
Do your best to win them over.

164
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:35,809

165
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,424
Hello?

166
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:41,125
What about Joon Il's tailor?

167
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,620
What?

168
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:47,075
But Joon Hyeok has lots of suits.

169
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:51,023
Ouch, my ear.

170
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:55,394
All right. I'll find out and call you back.

171
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,050

172
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:15,708

173
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:24,301
Is there a business called Minerva in this building?

174
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:25,678
Minerva?

175
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:29,228
Well, they sell alcohol and food.

176
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:32,102
It's like a wine bar, I think.

177
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:38,017
I'm sorry, but we don't have an F &amp; B division.

178
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:41,999
I see. Thanks anyway.

179
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,204
Did that reporter return?

180
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:54,019
I don't know. It's not like I stay home all day, you know.

181
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:58,028
If he does return, be careful not to raise any suspicions.

182
00:17:58,028 --> 00:18:02,859
You be careful and don't get found out by that woman.

183
00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:05,285
One of these days you'll get some scolds.

184
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,851
"Get some scolds," blah, blah, blah.

185
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:12,514
That little…

186
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:23,992
Hello, Da Eun.

187
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:29,909
I'll be right there. Bye.

188
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:38,276

189
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,727
- Where should I leave this? 
 - Leave it there.

190
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:51,829

191
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:55,422
- Hello. 
 - You're here.

192
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:01,016
Who is that from?

193
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:06,110
Madam Kwon Min Seon. Secretary Go said we shouldn't leave it in the lobby.

194
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:14,290
You're dismissed.

195
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,407
- Enjoy the food. 
 - Thank you.

196
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,694
Mrs. Yoon doesn't have any parents.

197
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:43,610
That's why she was very close to Madam Kwon. They were like sisters.

198
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:48,513
I don't know why she acted like that just now.

199
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:57,596
Madam Kwon was a regular here for thirty years.

200
00:19:58,105 --> 00:20:01,300
Thanks to you, I come here once in a while.

201
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:07,308
- Enjoy. 
 - Okay.

202
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:12,100
I didn't think you'd like this kind of food.

203
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:17,433
Have you talked to Mr. Cho? Is he going to register the marriage?

204
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:23,302
He should be happy that I'm willing to marry an old man like him.

205
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:26,429
But he's changed completely.

206
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:29,615
He used to buy me luxury handbags and shoes.

207
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:31,969
But now, he checks my spending.

208
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:35,612
I can't even go to the nail shop.

209
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:39,413
I lost my Bluetooth earphones so I have to buy new ones,

210
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:42,215
but I can only afford the cheapest ones.

211
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:43,963
Don't you think it's unfair?

212
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:47,418
You shouldn't have sent me that potted plant.

213
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:50,506
Kang Hyeon asked me to send it to you

214
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:54,631
and Big Sis would have done it if she were still alive.

215
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:58,197
And I took the opportunity to skim a little for myself.

216
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:00,405
Good.

217
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:07,210
By the way, have you ever seen No Young Joo?

218
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,806
Yes, once or twice.

219
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:13,221
Madam Kwon as well?

220
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,407
She didn't just see her.

221
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:19,195
She did a lot more than just see her.

222
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:25,893
You were on good terms with Sister so you probably have no idea

223
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,841
what a scary person she was.

224
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:31,147
Does Mr. Cho know?

225
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:35,012
Of course, he does. He lived with her for over twenty years.

226
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:40,709
Do you know what he said to me after I'd taken a walloping from her?

227
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:45,914
He told me to make sure to not tell anyone.

228
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:54,429
You've been through quite a lot, I see.

229
00:21:57,897 --> 00:22:03,809
My mother always said that you shouldn't cry while you eat.

230
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:08,940
Why did you have to get me so emotional?

231
00:22:12,003 --> 00:22:17,431
Hold on! It's on me!

232
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:20,948
It's only fair that I pay for today's lunch.

233
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:24,017
It's only decent.

234
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:27,404
The food was delicious.

235
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,402
Thank you.

236
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,035
You know the gathering between wives that Madam Kwon used to attend?

237
00:22:39,035 --> 00:22:43,034
Do you mean the Okryeonhoe Club?

238
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:45,914
What about it?

239
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:49,398
Me?

240
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:54,016
Yes, you should attend now since you're with Mr. Cho.

241
00:22:55,184 --> 00:23:00,134
Oh my, Jae Hee... Oh better CEO.

242
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:03,015
But don't tell Mr. Cho for the time being.

243
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:08,009
Of course. There's nothing good about having a man in a woman's business.

244
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:10,613
Let's go, Jae Hee.

245
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:13,779
You're the best!

246
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:17,817
I can't make it because I have a prior engagement.

247
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:21,541
Oh no. I don't want to go there alone.

248
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:24,571
Mother knows they're all there to make amends for their husbands.

249
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,308
So I'm sure she won't be too hard on you.

250
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:32,906
Jae Hee is really making it tough for everyone.

251
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:37,425
You'll be fine, Aunt. Call me and tell me how it was. Bye.

252
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:43,706
Did you eat dinner?

253
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:46,501
I ate with Father and Mother.

254
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:50,297
Living under the same roof as Mother,

255
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:55,390
it's been too long since the house smelled of food, right?

256
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:01,205
You'd cook us pasta once in a while when Yoo Ri was here.

257
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:07,321
Isn't it uncomfortable to eat with Father?

258
00:24:09,688 --> 00:24:12,687
I never thought of it that way.

259
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:16,114
Why don't we eat separately from now on?

260
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:19,227
Mother would be hurt if we do.

261
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:30,707
Don't you think you're drinking too much these days?

262
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:33,500
It's not wine. It's pomegranate juice.

263
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:36,908
They say it's good for women.

264
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:56,806
You practically made me beg so we could have Yoo Ri.

265
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:59,228
Were you jealous of Joon Hyeok's son?

266
00:24:59,228 --> 00:25:03,200
You never smiled at Yoo Ri like you did to him.

267
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,132
Why do you want a son all of a sudden?

268
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:10,847
It's not like that, Joo Yeon.

269
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:14,315
Then? What is it like?

270
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:49,021
Hello, Sister.

271
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:50,408
Hello.

272
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:53,696
You look much more relaxed than I expected.

273
00:25:53,696 --> 00:25:58,501
I was worried that you'd all be tense.

274
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,340
It's been a long time since we met a hotel.

275
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,887
Nowadays, there's no reason to visit hotels as there is a lot to do elsewhere.

276
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:12,021
But when we were young, hotels were the only option we had.

277
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:14,586
Everyone we knew was from elite families

278
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:18,532
so we had to meet where there were no prying eyes.

279
00:26:18,532 --> 00:26:22,412
But nowadays, a woman could cause a scandal by visiting a hotel.

280
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:25,973
Yes, even if you have coffee in the hotel lounge,

281
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:28,792
they'll start talking about you.

282
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:32,243
This must bring you back to the good old days.

283
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:37,254
I like it.

284
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:40,123
Hello.

285
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:43,515
Hello, Mother.

286
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:46,145
Everyone has been praising your choice of venue.

287
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:50,328
They tell me that coming to a hotel takes them back to the old times.

288
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:54,794
I was worried about what you might think. I'm glad you like the hotel.

289
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:58,102
Let me introduce myself formally. I'm Yoon Jae Hee.

290
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:08,403
I'm Oh Ye Rin, and I'm with the Prosecutor General.

291
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:13,420
Take a seat.

292
00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:41,904
I'm sorry, Sister, but I don't think I can let this slide.

293
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,987
Look, Jae Hee.

294
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,838
You should answer when you are addressed.

295
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:52,528
I am CEO now. Please address me respectfully.

296
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,604
Who says so?

297
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:58,986
That's not a position you can get because you say so.

298
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:02,445
Chairwoman Seo Han Sook has approved it.

299
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,216
All Right, Madam Yoon.

300
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:18,336
Yes, Aunt?

301
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:22,305
As you are well aware, I really don't like you.

302
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:25,229
I think everyone here shares my sentiments.

303
00:28:25,229 --> 00:28:28,790
But if Sister wants it,

304
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,518
I can accept you into our club.

305
00:28:32,518 --> 00:28:37,192
But not that woman.

306
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:42,716
She seduced a married man and even had his child out of wedlock.

307
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:48,087
Now, she's moved into his house and pretends to be his wife.

308
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:52,119
Do you really expect us to consort with her?

309
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,127
Yes, I'm sure you're offended.

310
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:59,804
But Aunt and everyone here,

311
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:03,324
have you forgotten why we've gathered?

312
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,897
It's to make amends to Sister.

313
00:29:06,897 --> 00:29:11,807
That's right. Because Cho instigated your husbands to go after me.

314
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:17,190
Cho is a man who had a bastard child despite the fact he was married

315
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,935
and even invited his mistress to live with him in his dead wife's stead.

316
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:26,529
Your husbands are all allied with that kind of man.

317
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,606
That's not the same thing.

318
00:29:28,606 --> 00:29:31,750
It's a completely different situation.

319
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,784
I guess I'll have to put it another way since you don't understand me.

320
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,795
Min Seong Sik.

321
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:52,423
Kwak Ki Hwan.

322
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,803
You're Choi Hee Joong's sister, aren't you?

323
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:59,200
This is for you.

324
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:07,510
These are records of your husbands and brother

325
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,925
that show their infidelities including their affairs

326
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:18,530
with women of ill repute all the way until now.

327
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:23,223
Assemblyman Min Seong Sik has never hired a hooker,

328
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:27,135
but he's been sexually harassing his aids.

329
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:31,121
How do you manage not only to consort, but to live with such men?

330
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,811
Madam Yoon, how can you do this? You're a woman, too.

331
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:39,019
Do you think your husband is any different?

332
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,221
But you don't treat me as another woman.

333
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:50,509
If you treat me as another woman and a human being,

334
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,914
I can help you

335
00:30:55,209 --> 00:31:00,223
so your husbands never cheat on you again.

336
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:15,314
Hold on! We need to talk.

337
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:17,890
I don't have anything to say to you.

338
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:25,796
You were planning to use me from the beginning, weren't you?

339
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,437
Yes.

340
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:32,573
I had no idea. I really thought you were looking out for me.

341
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:34,620
Did you trust me?

342
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:38,175
You and I aren't close enough to trust each other like that.

343
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:46,514
Don't cry in public. They'll think you're weak.

344
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:53,794
You'd better get your act together if you don't want to be used again.

345
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:59,627
You can use me just as I used you today.

346
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:10,986

347
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:16,425

348
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,511
Da Eun, why are all these people declining?

349
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:28,212
They say that they're busy.

350
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:34,501
But rumor has it that they're boycotting Mrs. Yoon's inauguration.

351
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:35,920
Why?

352
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,202
I don't know.

353
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:55,040

354
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,529
I wish you came sooner. I wanted you to see them put up the sign.

355
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,204

356
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:16,894
I prepared the exhibition for three years.

357
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:20,973
Why is everyone against you becoming CEO?

358
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:23,220
So you heard the rumors?

359
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,618
Is it true?

360
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:29,049
Get in. I'll tell you all about it.

361
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,496

362
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:57,721
I bet you've never experienced such humiliation in your life.

363
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,327
What do you think?

364
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:07,298
I'm sure they all bought it.

365
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:13,296
Even I was convinced for a second, and my husband is in the hospital.

366
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:22,808
A husband's infidelity leave a woman deeply wounded.

367
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:47,966
It smells a little like the art gallery.

368
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,308
It's paraffin oil.

369
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:53,779
You mix it into the oil paint.

370
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:55,523
That's the smell.

371
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:59,329
At first, I didn't like it.

372
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:05,791
It smelled funny and musty and it made me feel sad.

373
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:14,831
I wanted to go to a top university but my grades kept falling.

374
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:20,144
That's why I memorized how to paint for the painting test.

375
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:25,127
There's a school that teaches you how to paint for the college painting test.

376
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:30,127
So you aren't the only one who got into college like that?

377
00:35:31,186 --> 00:35:33,325
Those words are not very comforting.

378
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:43,398
The gallery vault also smells like this.

379
00:35:43,398 --> 00:35:45,431
Paraffin oil.

380
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:49,391
Even priceless paintings

381
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:54,525
carry with them the unpleasant smell of paraffin.

382
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:58,237
But that smell excited me

383
00:35:58,997 --> 00:36:03,716
and I thought I could succeed if I studied hard enough.

384
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:08,316
I was scared when we criticized each other's art.

385
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:11,289
That always made me realize that I lacked talent.

386
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:17,617
The children that didn't even have

387
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:22,896
enough money to buy paints would create stunning works of art

388
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:28,373
while the children who created mediocre paintings

389
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:32,098
carried luxury handbags that I could never dream of buying.

390
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:35,585
I was like neither of them.

391
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:39,012
So I became the object of ridicule.

392
00:36:49,302 --> 00:36:52,020
Jeez, so that's it.

393
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:57,439
I thought you were rich enough to swindle, but it turns out you're poor.

394
00:36:57,998 --> 00:37:02,641
That's why everyone opposes your inauguration and looks down on you.

395
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:33,407
Master Jung, you are growing more like your grandfather every day.

396
00:37:34,113 --> 00:37:35,243
What do you think?

397
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:37,444
Instead of deep gray, Master Jung

398
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:42,838
should wear navy blue to show that he comes from the highest class.

399
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:44,976
Granddad!

400
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:46,735
You're here, Hyeon Woo!

401
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:48,761
Good to see you.

402
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:52,009
Joon Il has been getting fitted for a suit.

403
00:37:53,206 --> 00:37:58,503
Only you can tell the Vice Chairman of the Sungjin Group to come and go.

404
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:02,387
You're here, children!

405
00:38:08,106 --> 00:38:10,805
Grandpa, I'm bored.

406
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:15,798
Oh my, are you bored?

407
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:21,610
So you're bored, are you?

408
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,127
Why don't I take you to get some chocolate milk?

409
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,266
All right.

410
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:28,806
That's good!

411
00:38:31,596 --> 00:38:34,212
We're off!

412
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:39,813
He loves chocolate milk just like you when you were young.

413
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:44,170
I can't wait to see how clever he turns out to be.

414
00:38:45,602 --> 00:38:49,514
Senior Secretary of Civil Affairs is quite a powerful position.

415
00:38:49,514 --> 00:38:53,359
You'll have enough power to do whatever you please.

416
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,816
And you can prepare to run for president.

417
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,931
It's completely different from other politicians who have to

418
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:06,766
make a living accepting bribes.

419
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:09,334
Completely!

420
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:17,417
I'm afraid I'll have to get going now.

421
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,194
I'm sorry, Joon Hyeok.

422
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:21,828
You've wasted enough time here.

423
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:25,077
Come again, Vice Chairman Jung.

424
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:32,694
Are you still in contact with your biological father?

425
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:36,027
I don't care if you disrespect me,

426
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,523
but if you even have a shred of affection for your mother,

427
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:42,394
you shouldn't be going behind her back like that.

428
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:48,228
The man punched your mother while she was pregnant with you.

429
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:51,495
It's no wonder she left him

430
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:54,435
even if it meant having you out of wedlock.

431
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:02,016
You're cold and callous

432
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:05,321
just like your biological father. Be careful.

433
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:23,215
Daddy, I'm going to eat dinner and play with blocks with grandpa.

434
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:26,199
- So don't come pick me up too early. 
 - Come late.

435
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,518
All right.

436
00:40:28,518 --> 00:40:30,210
- Goodbye! 
 - Bye!

437
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,828
Let's go!

438
00:40:40,707 --> 00:40:42,191
What is it?

439
00:40:43,428 --> 00:40:47,734
I'm just wondering how you manage to be so patient with him.

440
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:51,077
Why don't you just rebel against him?

441
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:54,909
Sons are supposed to rebel against their fathers. I did that.

442
00:40:56,513 --> 00:41:02,401
It might be hard to believe, but I've never been angry at him.

443
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:08,003
I can't rebel against him when I don't feel any anger.

444
00:41:10,086 --> 00:41:14,348
I guess he's not someone you can easily rebel against.

445
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:19,716
I thought you were so cool when I was young.

446
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,432
Now, I pity you.

447
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:31,316
Have a little dignity, will you?

448
00:41:42,495 --> 00:41:45,995

449
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:50,436
You have a healthy uterus and ovaries.

450
00:41:50,436 --> 00:41:54,026
And you have a good hormonal balance.

451
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:56,134
You've taken good care of yourself.

452
00:41:57,396 --> 00:42:00,035
Can I still get pregnant again?

453
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:05,102
Have you used birth control since giving birth fourteen years ago?

454
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:11,202
You must have relations frequently if you want to get pregnant.

455
00:42:11,202 --> 00:42:13,446
It's true that it's harder

456
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:17,396
to get pregnant when you're in your 40s.

457
00:42:17,396 --> 00:42:20,210
But that doesn't mean it's impossible.

458
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,439
Why don't you come back with your husband?

459
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:25,097
All right. I understand.

460
00:42:25,097 --> 00:42:28,806
Just try to relax.

461
00:42:28,806 --> 00:42:31,823
Your sister-in-law got pregnant

462
00:42:31,823 --> 00:42:34,600
only after she gave up on in vitro fertilization

463
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,404
and relaxed.

464
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:43,302
Let's jump! You can jump so high.

465
00:42:43,302 --> 00:42:45,383
Hello, sir.

466
00:42:45,383 --> 00:42:47,358
What is that?

467
00:42:48,588 --> 00:42:51,437
Mrs. Lee's family sent it.

468
00:42:51,437 --> 00:42:53,910
I think she's trying for a second child.

469
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,033
Hyeon Woo, it looks like you'll have a cousin.

470
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,733
I'd have dinner with you if I didn't have to pick up my son.

471
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:19,623
You know, this is the second time you're flaking on me.

472
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:21,723
I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.

473
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:25,548
It's all right. I understand. After all, you're poor.

474
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:11,779
Mr. Jung, would you like me to call your wife?

475
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:15,035
It's all right. I don't mind waiting.

476
00:44:15,035 --> 00:44:16,152
Still.

477
00:44:16,177 --> 00:44:18,600
Thanks anyway. You should go home.

478
00:44:38,096 --> 00:44:40,738
Yi Seol.

479
00:44:40,738 --> 00:44:45,392
Mr. Jung is here so please call Mrs. Yoon.

480
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:46,641
I'll see you tomorrow.

481
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:48,709
All right. See you tomorrow.

482
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:44,539
I'm so sorry. I saw you there sitting by yourself on my monitor.

483
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:47,527
How could you fail to recognize Mr. Jung?

484
00:45:47,533 --> 00:45:49,286
I'm sorry.

485
00:45:49,987 --> 00:45:51,515
It hasn't been long since he started

486
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:54,028
so he doesn't recognize all the VIPs yet.

487
00:45:54,028 --> 00:45:55,725
I'm sorry.

488
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:59,616
It's all right. Don't be too hard on him.

489
00:46:47,016 --> 00:46:48,705
We meet again.

490
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,028
I thought you had left.

491
00:46:59,488 --> 00:47:01,613
I didn't want to disappoint you.

492
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:21,303
My friend is supposed to come.

493
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:30,109
I never asked you.

494
00:48:47,572 --> 00:48:49,198
Dong Min?

495
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:52,529
Hi, Sunbaenim.

496
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,651
Long time no see. What brings you here?

497
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:56,217
What brings you here?

498
00:48:56,217 --> 00:48:58,629
I came here to meet my wife. How about you?

499
00:48:58,629 --> 00:49:00,896
Well, I…

500
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,717
Oh! I'm over here!

501
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:06,247
Did I keep you waiting?

502
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:07,474
No, I just got here.

503
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,309
So how are you feeling? Are you all right?

504
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:11,675
Yes.

505
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:15,321
I'm so relieved. I was really worried.

506
00:49:15,321 --> 00:49:19,806
I realized that I forgot to get your number after I gave you my card.

507
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:21,736
I was so disappointed.

508
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:26,511
Why don't we go somewhere and eat?

509
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:28,624
You should join us, Joon Hyeok.

510
00:49:28,624 --> 00:49:30,298
No. I should be going home.

511
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:33,446
Come with us. I have something to ask you.

512
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:36,421
We'll meet up later on.

513
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:39,216
Okay. I'll give you a call.

514
00:49:39,216 --> 00:49:42,017
- All right. Bye. 
 - Good night.

515
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:46,796
Drive carefully.

516
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:52,119
Have you eaten?

517
00:49:52,713 --> 00:49:55,486
- What? 
 - Food. Food.

518
00:49:56,405 --> 00:49:58,106
This is delicious.

519
00:49:58,106 --> 00:50:01,416
This is a lot of food for the two of us.

520
00:50:02,475 --> 00:50:04,384
Eat up.

521
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,308
Hello, ma'am.

522
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,436
Where is everyone else?

523
00:50:14,436 --> 00:50:17,023
Well, they're…

524
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:22,818
Grandpa is scolding Mommy.

525
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:29,728
I don't want to hear any excuses. Have another son.

526
00:50:29,728 --> 00:50:32,899
Hyeon Woo will be lonely by himself.

527
00:50:32,899 --> 00:50:38,100
Even though you're thirty-seven, you're still not too old.

528
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,515
These days, even women in their forties have babies.

529
00:50:41,515 --> 00:50:44,489
The clock is ticking so hurry and get pregnant.

530
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:47,743
I've gone through too much to get to where I am

531
00:50:47,743 --> 00:50:50,406
to let this opportunity go to waste.

532
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:55,106
Why won't you answer me?

533
00:50:55,913 --> 00:50:58,406
I don't know how I should answer such nonsense.

534
00:50:58,406 --> 00:50:59,507
What?

535
00:50:59,507 --> 00:51:03,786
I already told you that whether we have children or not is our own business.

536
00:51:04,516 --> 00:51:09,714
Now that you have Han Sook's backing, you've become quite insolent!

537
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:15,000
If that's how you feel, Father, that's because you fear Mother.

538
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,907
Did you already forget?

539
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:21,300
I've always been insolent from the very beginning.

540
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,615
But that never caused you to even blink.

541
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:29,811
So even though you've married my precious son,

542
00:51:29,811 --> 00:51:31,688
you'll stop with Hyeon Woo?

543
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:35,585
There will be no more children and that's final.

544
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,780
Why did you have to cause such a commotion today?

545
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,108
This isn't the first time your father-in-law has behaved like that.

546
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,620
Let Hyeon Woo sleep here.

547
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:12,321
He may seem young, but he sees and hears everything.

548
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:15,014
I'll be careful in front of Hyeon Woo.

549
00:52:15,014 --> 00:52:19,021
But I'd feel more comfortable if Hyeon Woo slept at home.

550
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:22,140
Why?

551
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,630
Is there a reason you won't let him stay here?

552
00:52:33,497 --> 00:52:35,110
No, Mother.

553
00:52:38,897 --> 00:52:40,700
All right.

554
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,280
Take a walk and calm down.

555
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,022
I want you to be smiling when you say good night to your son.

556
00:52:48,379 --> 00:52:50,203
Yes, Mother.

557
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:11,099
Mommy, did Grandpa scold you a lot?

558
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:14,503
Don't worry. He only scolded me a little.

559
00:53:14,503 --> 00:53:19,594
Okay. Go home and have fun with Daddy.

560
00:53:19,594 --> 00:53:22,016
Aunt's gonna buy me a scooter tomorrow.

561
00:53:22,016 --> 00:53:24,503
Wow, you must be so happy, Hyeon Woo.

562
00:53:24,503 --> 00:53:26,220
Yes.

563
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:32,424
Good night.

564
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,523
Good night, Hyeon Woo.

565
00:53:35,523 --> 00:53:37,829
Bye, Mom.

566
00:53:42,522 --> 00:53:45,230
Oh, my little angel.

567
00:54:09,588 --> 00:54:12,223
 I have my doctor's appointment today.

568
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,199
 I can't go with you. They're having a demonstration in Hyeongsan-dong.

569
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:20,328
 I can go alone so just focus on your work.

570
00:54:20,328 --> 00:54:24,442
 You just got the head anchorman position. Don't worry about me.

571
00:54:24,442 --> 00:54:29,220
 Still, it's our anniversary. Let's have dinner somewhere nice.

572
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,335
 I'll make a reservation.

573
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:31,927
 Sounds good.

574
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:40,448
 What's this? I've never seen this before.

575
00:54:40,448 --> 00:54:44,631
 It's your anniversary present.

576
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:08,002
 You're not pregnant.

577
00:55:10,697 --> 00:55:13,188
 Should I take a break and try again?

578
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:17,928
 I don't think that's a good idea.

579
00:55:17,928 --> 00:55:21,900
 Your hormone levels are always low

580
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,015
 and you've miscarried numerous times.

581
00:55:46,237 --> 00:55:50,527

582
00:55:55,371 --> 00:55:58,116

583
00:55:58,116 --> 00:56:01,308

584
00:56:06,623 --> 00:56:08,596
 Excuse me, ma'am.

585
00:56:08,596 --> 00:56:12,574
 I'm afraid it's closing time.

586
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:16,831
 Okay, I'm sorry.

587
00:56:27,105 --> 00:56:29,872

588
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:10,251

589
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,512

590
00:57:37,311 --> 00:57:40,310
 Your sister-in-law got pregnant only after

591
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,087
 she gave up on in vitro fertilization

592
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:45,896
 and relaxed.

593
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:02,028

594
00:58:02,028 --> 00:58:07,885
There must be a nail clipper somewhere.

595
00:58:10,382 --> 00:58:12,810
Where could it be?

596
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:27,860
 The customer cannot answer the phone. Please leave a message after the beep.

597
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,350

598
00:59:00,731 --> 00:59:05,445

599
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:15,020

600
00:59:17,094 --> 00:59:23,006

601
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:42,776
 Are you with Dong Min?

602
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:45,789
 No. Why do you ask?

603
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:47,684
 I don't know.

604
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:49,428
 I wonder why.

605
00:59:49,428 --> 00:59:51,991
 Why? Can't you handle it?

606
00:59:51,991 --> 00:59:55,184
 I misjudged him.

607
00:59:55,184 --> 00:59:57,989
 I know he's a bad man.

608
00:59:57,989 --> 01:00:01,411
 But you've known that as well.

609
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:03,797
 There are no secrets in this household.

610
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:06,519
 I saw your wife at Cho Kang Hyeon's place.

611
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,735
 It's a little fishy.

612
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:13,181
 I didn't think you'd call Prosecutor Park Jung Ho here.

613
01:00:13,181 --> 01:00:16,016
 What are you doing here?

614
01:00:16,016 --> 01:00:18,193
 I saw your phone.

615
01:00:18,193 --> 01:00:22,658
 I won't allow you to be used by your old flame.

616
01:00:22,658 --> 01:00:24,178
 What is it Daddy?

617
01:00:24,178 --> 01:00:25,942
 JH.

618
01:00:25,942 --> 01:00:29,079
 - Jae Hee. 
 - I'll raise him.

619
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:31,235
 I'll take good care of him.
