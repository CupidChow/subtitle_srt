1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,240

2
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:10,805
 I'm sure you understand the situation.

3
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:16,286
 If you stop now, I'll forgive you for everything.

4
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:21,524
 But if you choose to go against me,

5
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:26,096
 I assure you that everything you've accomplished

6
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:29,499
 will go to complete ruin.

7
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:37,023
 Kim Yi Seol did not commit suicide.

8
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:41,617
 The police have put the man in the video under witness protection

9
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:46,098
 and they're investigating the possibility of murder.

10
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:51,204
 The prime suspect is known to be a prosecutor currently in office.

11
00:00:51,204 --> 00:00:56,093
 And the police have already identified his whereabouts.

12
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,037
 Mr. Park Jung Ho?

13
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,339
 Mr. Park, you are under arrest for the murder of Kim Yi Seol.

14
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,508
 The choice is yours. What will it be?

15
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:35,027
 I'll expose everything.

16
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:37,596
 What you did to Yi Seol,

17
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:41,100
 and what you did to me.

18
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,595
 - I'll expose the truth. 
 - What truth?

19
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:50,064
 The fact that you bought a child from Yi Seol?

20
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:55,205
 Sure. If you can reveal everything,

21
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:58,021
 then you might as well go ahead.

22
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:00,878
 Don't think you can threaten me with that.

23
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:06,176
 You don't want anyone to know

24
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:09,098
 that Hyeon Woo was adopted, either.

25
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:14,410
 You wouldn't do anything to blemish the family's reputation.

26
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,409
 That is my concern.

27
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:20,076
 You should be concerned about yourself.

28
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:30,306
 A prosecutor sold a child to help his lover.

29
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:33,377
 And in order to keep that a secret,

30
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,327
 he killed Kim Yi Seol, the biological mother.

31
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:42,294
 And he has refused to name his lover,

32
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:45,268
 who is a possible accomplice.

33
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:54,477
 Do you like that story?

34
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:01,885
 You're right. Just like you said,

35
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:06,135
 I would never risk letting anyone know our family secrets.

36
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:11,987
 And I still see you as part of this family.

37
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:19,407
 But be prompt with your decision.

38
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:32,090

39
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:47,310
I'll come back in 30 minutes.

40
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:57,515
 She's visiting Park Jung Ho with Cho Kang Hyeon's help.

41
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:06,484
I'm sure she feels she owes him an explanation for what happened.

42
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,010

43
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:14,009
I can't reach Park Yong Seob.

44
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,150
He must have run away, thinking something had gone wrong.

45
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,471
But don't worry.

46
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:25,188
Even if I can't prove my innocence during the investigation,

47
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:29,698
I'll still have a trial, and everything will be okay.

48
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,418
No.

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,705
That's not how it's going to play out.

50
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:40,999
No matter what you do, you'll be tried for murdering Yi Seol

51
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:43,811
and found guilty in the end.

52
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:48,401
That's Seo Han Sook's plan.

53
00:04:52,787 --> 00:04:55,794
But there is still a way out of this.

54
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:02,980
I'll just have to continue serving the family,

55
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:07,193
struggling for their mercy and acceptance

56
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:09,218
like I always have.

57
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:13,396
If I give her that promise,

58
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:16,156
you'll be released right away.

59
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,174
You don't have to, Jae Hee.

60
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:21,123
You shouldn't.

61
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:24,419
I wouldn't stoop like that if it were just your neck on the line.

62
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:33,104
If it were, I would ask you to just hold on until I find a way.

63
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,632
But your family…

64
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:41,144
I can't make them suffer, too, because of this.

65
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:46,204
You don't have to worry about my family.

66
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:49,618
They're my problem. I'll handle it myself.

67
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,315
So, you don't have to hesitate because of me.

68
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:56,410
You have to find who murdered Kim Yi Seol.

69
00:05:56,499 --> 00:06:00,313
And that should be your first priority.

70
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,238
Yi Seol…

71
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:06,335
wasn't murdered by Joon Hyeok.

72
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:11,040
It was Seo Han Sook.

73
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:16,097
I'm scared, Jung Ho.

74
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:18,915
So, I want you

75
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:23,486
and your family to be an excuse for me to give up.

76
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:28,818
There is absolutely nothing I can do

77
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:35,825
except doing whatever she wants me to like I always have.

78
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:53,392

79
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,885
Let us pray together.

80
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:00,969
Almighty and ever-present Father,

81
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:05,462
you gave us life, at whose end we return to your arms.

82
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:09,801
For those who have sinned may not stand by your side in Heaven,

83
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:12,699
and for our bodies are but mortal without the life you gave us,

84
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:16,613
we are indeed grateful for guiding us and with the sacrifice of your own son

85
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:20,892
showing us the way to eternity and resurrection.

86
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:26,138
May the sounds of the trumpet and the voice of the archangel greet her soul

87
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:30,287
as she enters heaven to forever live in your glory.

88
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:36,513
- So we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
 - Amen.

89
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,430

90
00:07:56,888 --> 00:08:00,483
So have you made your decision?

91
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,682
I've decided not to go against you.

92
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,786
Smart decision.

93
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:13,836
When will Jung Ho be released?

94
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:15,712
Well,

95
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:19,635
that depends on how you behave.

96
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:24,654
You're not the only one in pain.

97
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:27,483
Think about how Joon Hyeok would feel.

98
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,297
You've been his wife for 10 years,

99
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:34,091
and he was already shocked to find out that Hyeon Woo was adopted.

100
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:38,075
Then you suspected him for murder.

101
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:44,428
First, you'll have to make up with him.

102
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:49,432
And make sure there are no more conflicts in your family.

103
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,401
Where's Hyeon Woo?

104
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:13,314
He just went to bed.

105
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:21,073
Why did he do it?

106
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:24,700
I heard you visited Jung Ho.

107
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:33,641
It's fortunate that we have the suspect under arrest. Isn't it?

108
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:37,213
What?

109
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:41,417
So you don't believe that he did it?

110
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:49,790
Everyone makes mistakes, you know.

111
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:56,197
But remember this,

112
00:09:56,197 --> 00:10:00,668
when it's repeated, it's no longer a mistake. Get it?

113
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:11,982
Hey. I'm about to head out. Okay.

114
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,300

115
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:39,509

116
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,783

117
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:21,925
And bow.

118
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:30,363
 His campaign began with a visit to the National Cemetery.

119
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:32,096
How are things going

120
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:37,803
with Yoo Jin Seok's new emergency committee?

121
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,116
After Minister Park was removed from office,

122
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:45,828
Cho Kang Hyeon has been under heavy criticism for political bias

123
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:51,376
and refusing to press charges against Min's supporters.

124
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:54,802
Tell Yoo Jin Seok to talk to him.

125
00:11:54,802 --> 00:12:00,218
We need this taken care of before the primaries.

126
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:02,802
Yes. I'll handle it.

127
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:06,288
How are things between Joon Hyeok and Jae Hee?

128
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,405
Is something up?

129
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:14,052
He recently started

130
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:19,219
seeing Kim Ji Soo, Hyeon Woo's former violin teacher.

131
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,144
And Jae Hee?

132
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,299
It seems she already knows.

133
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:32,021
That's not enough. She has to do something.

134
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:40,019

135
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,814
Mother will worry about this.

136
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:48,463
Pretend you didn't see this.

137
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,894
That'll be easier for you.

138
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:55,123
It seems like you have the public's favor.

139
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:59,106
They're just excited to see a new face in politics.

140
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:00,904
What's next on our schedule?

141
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:07,106
Attending an exhibit with Chairman Jung and his wife, and then dinner together.

142
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:11,960
Make sure to show that you care by discussing about

143
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,980
youth employment.

144
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,150
Yes?

145
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:43,926
I'm almost there.

146
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:15,421
I thought you hated these kinds of events.

147
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,987
You seem to have a real fondness for Joon Hyeok.

148
00:14:19,987 --> 00:14:22,498
I'm just doing what I have to.

149
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,094
Who's the one making that decision? You or Mother?

150
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:34,415
You're too old to let others make decisions for you.

151
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:41,071
But of course, no one would dare go against her will in this family.

152
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:44,720
Look how badly Jae Hee failed.

153
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:48,209
It's a pleasure to see you guys.

154
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:52,393
I'll never get used to that pretense of his.

155
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:27,386

156
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:32,606
I heard that's staying until Joon Hyeok announces candidacy.

157
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:40,806
By the way, what's the deal with a murder suspect being arrested?

158
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,498
Wasn't it a suicide?

159
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:49,498
That prosecutor they arrested, isn't that Jung Ho?

160
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:52,428
The man that was with you in the picture.

161
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,205
Did Joon Hyeok really do it?

162
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:02,510
- And they're pinning it on… 
 -  No.

163
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,747
It wasn't Joon Hyeok.

164
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,792
He may not be the best husband,

165
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:11,340
but he didn't kill her.

166
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,401
Why don't you get a divorce?

167
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:29,024
Why don't you?

168
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:32,602
I'm not in the same position as you.

169
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,795
Joon Il told me the other day.

170
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:46,493
If it's what everyone believes, that's all we need to know.

171
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:54,610
Just let me know if you can't stand it anymore.

172
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,918
I'll gladly kick you out.

173
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:10,225
I think that'll be enough. Let's go eat.

174
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,461
I'll see you later.

175
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:42,913
I have some things to discuss with Professor Yoo.

176
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:44,640
Thank you for today.

177
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,916
Take care, Madam.

178
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:59,257
It's just a gesture to highlight your wifehood to the new candidate.

179
00:17:59,257 --> 00:18:01,566
It'll help bring the focus to him.

180
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:05,997
I apologize if I made you uncomfortable.

181
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,709
Well, as long as it's for the best, I'm fine.

182
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,084
Of course.

183
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:17,670
The image of a good, loyal wife will make the perfect picture.

184
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:21,399
I'll see you, then.

185
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:23,404
- Let's go. 
 - Let's.

186
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:07,380
How have you been, Mrs. Yoon?

187
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,790
Did I keep you waiting?

188
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,420
Let's go.

189
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,094
See you around, Mrs. Yoon.

190
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:26,723
You don't have to worry about this.

191
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:31,640
I'll make sure there are no problems.

192
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:38,306
 A meeting with Madam Seo at 10:00 a.m.

193
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:40,420
 Don't be late.

194
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,460
He'll be announcing his candidacy soon. Aren't you going to do something?

195
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:59,983
You can't just sit on your hands.

196
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,666
I'm not sure what to do.

197
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,910
I still haven't made up with Joon Hyeok for what happened.

198
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:21,015
After what I've done to him, I'm in no position to make any demands.

199
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:24,615
Also,

200
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:29,837
him cheating on me is nothing new.

201
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:33,481
It's always been that way.

202
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:36,430
And it always will.

203
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:45,470
Right. You have no right to make any demands to him.

204
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,955
Still, don't you think you have to resolve conflicts in your family?

205
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:56,988
And although in name only, you're still his wife and the mother of his child.

206
00:21:56,988 --> 00:22:01,220
So, I expect you to do your best to protect your family.

207
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:12,007
So, in order to prove that I'm the biological mother,

208
00:22:12,007 --> 00:22:15,684
I'd first have to file a suit.

209
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:22,426
And when that's done, I'd have to re-register Gyu Seong as a child

210
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:24,580
born out of wedlock.

211
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,061
That is correct.

212
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:29,909
That will take ages.

213
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:35,803
And, would this have any effect on my son's inheritance rights?

214
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:41,930
Not at all. By law, a child born out of wedlock holds the same inheritance rights.

215
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:49,305
Okay. Let me take some time to think and call you back later.

216
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:50,788
Sure. Take your time.

217
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:53,916
And this is just between us, okay?

218
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,987
Of course.

219
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:37,481
I didn't think I'd see you so soon.

220
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:43,492
I didn't want to, either.

221
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:45,990
But I have to.

222
00:23:47,764 --> 00:23:50,404
Just for your information,

223
00:23:50,404 --> 00:23:55,296
he was the one that reached out to me first.

224
00:23:55,296 --> 00:24:00,791
He seemed to be under a lot of stress because of you.

225
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,108
You'll have to stop seeing him soon.

226
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,130
He's running for president.

227
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,150
Why don't you get a divorce?

228
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:14,945
 You could divorce him, couldn't you?

229
00:24:14,945 --> 00:24:17,590
 You're a good person.

230
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:23,037
You're not Hyeon Woo's real mother.

231
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:26,817
And it's not like you still have any love left for him.

232
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:31,749
Why continue a marriage that's only in name?

233
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:34,327
It's unfair for Joon Hyeok to have to

234
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:39,780
put up with you just because you're raising Hyeon Woo.

235
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:45,323
Is that what he said?

236
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,014
That it's unfair?

237
00:24:49,014 --> 00:24:51,191
That's just what I think.

238
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:56,530
He cried the other day, saying Hyeon Woo's mother died.

239
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:04,881
I've always wondered how someone like you even managed to land him.

240
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:08,106
Did you perhaps use Hyeon Woo as an excuse?

241
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,976
How shameless.

242
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:15,220
I think a divorce would be your best option.

243
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:18,898
I want you out of the picture before Joon Hyeok starts his campaign.

244
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:21,920
You crazy bitch!

245
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,933
- Look at this… 
 - Hey! Are you crazy?

246
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:27,560
I am crazy, you bitch!

247
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,388
I haven't seen a real bitch like you in a long time.

248
00:25:32,388 --> 00:25:34,950
You'd better watch your tone!

249
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,910
I can't believe it.

250
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:56,096
You were always so snobbish, but look at you now.

251
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:13,806
I heard Kang Hyeon talking on the phone and figured it out.

252
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:20,576
That Joon Hyeok raped that girl who died.

253
00:26:20,576 --> 00:26:24,702
And that he killed her because she threatened him with that.

254
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,034
The people around you

255
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:33,354
keep the most terrible secrets among themselves

256
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:35,762
while acting like they're the noblest of people.

257
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:39,237
It's disgusting, and I'm sick of that!

258
00:26:40,385 --> 00:26:42,370
You're no different.

259
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:49,107
You knew that the girl in the video was No Young Joo and turned a blind eye.

260
00:26:50,082 --> 00:26:55,420
For your own sake, you pretended not to know that dirty secret.

261
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:02,701
I did. You're right. I'm no different.

262
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:06,055
But look.

263
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:12,937
I'm a shameless bar girl that classy women like you look down on.

264
00:27:12,937 --> 00:27:15,198
But look at you.

265
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:21,703
I would have expected better from someone so high and mighty.

266
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:26,912
I used to be so jealous of you.

267
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:32,111
But it turns out, you're not worthy of that at all.

268
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:19,323
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

269
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:30,010
My name is Han Dong Min, and it's an honor to join the JBC Morning News.

270
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,380
Here's the first news of the day.

271
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,797

272
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:56,440
Hey! Hop in!

273
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,000
You'll have to keep quiet for a while.

274
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,210
Go to your parents' or something.

275
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:17,700
Jae Hee went through a lot to get you out.

276
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,200
You were released for lack of evidence,

277
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,598
but we'll have to be careful until the case is closed.

278
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:26,800
I'm looking for that son of a bitch Park Yong Seob, so–

279
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,123
- He was fooled by Han Dong Min. 
 - What?

280
00:29:31,123 --> 00:29:35,952
I filmed that video testimony.

281
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:39,250
And Han Dong Min edited it.

282
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,699
What is it then?

283
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:43,715
Was it really Jung Joon Hyeok that killed Kim Yi Seol?

284
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:48,194
And Seo Han Sook is trying to cover that up?

285
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,800
Have you heard?

286
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,192
Jung Ho's being released today.

287
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:15,706
I can't come with you today.

288
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:17,967
I have a lot of work at the gallery.

289
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:21,212
Did you make a deal with Mother?

290
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:27,808
That's the only way for him to be released so soon.

291
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:36,439
He was arrested, and the bench warrant was out, too.

292
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:40,001
In cases like that, it's unusual for anyone to be released.

293
00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:46,016
But I'll just say, good for you.

294
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,620
You must have been worried.

295
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:55,020
Why even bother to ask?

296
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,930
I'm sure you already heard about it from Mother.

297
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,489
No.

298
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:04,983
I haven't heard anything from her.

299
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:15,802
Do you have anything else to ask me?

300
00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:20,812
No, nothing more.

301
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,722
By the way,

302
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:27,571
it doesn't seem like you want to find Kim Yi Seol's murderer.

303
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:35,171
I think you're just pretending to be devastated by her death.

304
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:41,214
You just want this to pass by without incident.

305
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:44,894
Why would you think that?

306
00:31:44,894 --> 00:31:49,811
I think it'll make you feel less guilty for what you did to her

307
00:31:51,397 --> 00:31:55,352
to know that the one that killed her is still out there, unpunished.

308
00:31:55,352 --> 00:31:57,090
That way,

309
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:02,126
you can focus on your ambitions without your conscience hindering you.

310
00:32:22,312 --> 00:32:26,910
Why did Madam Seo have Jung Ho released?

311
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:32,027
I don't know what you're talking about.

312
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,192
Don't play dumb with me.

313
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:39,709
The truth of the matter is,

314
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:43,452
Kim Yi Seol gave birth to Joon Hyeok's child,

315
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:48,084
approached Jae Hee to get to him and threatened him.

316
00:32:48,084 --> 00:32:51,309
Madam Seo must have done something about it.

317
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:53,406
Are you suggesting

318
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:58,891
it was Madam Seo that had her killed?

319
00:32:58,891 --> 00:33:01,804
Be careful what you say.

320
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:03,590
Why?

321
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,209
One of my own men was framed and arrested

322
00:33:05,209 --> 00:33:10,301
in my own front yard, and I'm the Prosecutor General.

323
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:16,060
If that has happened to Mr. Park, the same thing could happen to me, too.

324
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:22,894
I'm sure you know whose turn it is after Jung Ho.

325
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:26,540
Does she have anyone in mind?

326
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:34,484
If that girl was indeed murdered like you suggest,

327
00:33:34,484 --> 00:33:40,224
it'll be interesting to see who ends up behind bars.

328
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,197
Everyone will fear that

329
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:47,408
it might be them.

330
00:33:54,955 --> 00:34:01,240
Pity for all who have history with Madam Seo.

331
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:05,958
Instead of sitting worried,

332
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:12,605
I think you should get busy taking care of what she ordered.

333
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:14,313
What?

334
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:19,930
The investigation on Min's supporters?

335
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,652

336
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:03,032
 Did you just say I raped you?

337
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:11,094
 You drank all the drinks I offered, with a smile on, too.

338
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:16,151
 Even when you were drunk, you were still so eager to talk to me.

339
00:36:16,151 --> 00:36:20,333
 I thought you also wanted to have fun. You call that rape?

340
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,983
 I had to make a good impression.

341
00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:25,600
 I was about to get evicted from my apartment.

342
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,594
 And I needed help from someone with power.

343
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:35,200
 But I never gave you permission to do anything like that.

344
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,880

345
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,234

346
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,814

347
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,518

348
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,307

349
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,210

350
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:56,805

351
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:40,969
Hello, Congressman Min.

352
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:45,436
You haven't been answering my calls.

353
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:50,005
So I didn't have a way to tell you.

354
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:53,116
Have you heard about the impeachment?

355
00:39:54,333 --> 00:40:00,196
- Impeachment? 
 - You know, the five men at your loyal service.

356
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,199

357
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,552
We'll use Yoo Jin Seok's connections in the leading party

358
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:12,680
to file for the impeachment of Min Seong Sik's supporters.

359
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:19,790
That'll give Cho Kang Hyeon a reason to start the investigation.

360
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:35,023
I have something to tell you, Mother.

361
00:40:37,956 --> 00:40:39,503
Come back later.

362
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,449
Let's do it now.

363
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:43,450
It won't take long.

364
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:47,850
- Madam Yoon… 
 - Don't get in the way.

365
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:54,716
Won't it?

366
00:40:56,196 --> 00:40:58,723
Then let me hear it.

367
00:41:06,156 --> 00:41:08,440
Stop treating me with contempt.

368
00:41:11,547 --> 00:41:14,040
You have no right to do that.

369
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:21,419
You had Yi Seol killed and threatened me.

370
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:28,601
I'll never be able to stand up against you again.

371
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:31,001
Because I'm scared.

372
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:34,806
I do want justice for Yi Seol,

373
00:41:36,045 --> 00:41:39,800
but I care more about my own safety.

374
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:46,397
Then how can you be so daring and confident?

375
00:41:47,396 --> 00:41:49,780
It's all thanks to you.

376
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:55,280
You're less than human.

377
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,934
That's what I'm going to tell myself.

378
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:07,501
And although I'm scared of you,

379
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:11,226
my contempt for you and my grudge

380
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:16,217
will keep me going.

381
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,621
This way.

382
00:42:57,548 --> 00:42:59,391
How do you like it, Father?

383
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:02,706
You'll stay here from now on. Do you like it?

384
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:04,694
Oh, of course.

385
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:09,695
Thank you for your kindness, Sir.

386
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,833
Come on. Don't call me that. Just call me Joon Hyeok.

387
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:18,015
Just like you used to in the old days, remember?

388
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:51,637
He needs to earn the support of senior citizens before joining the party.

389
00:43:51,637 --> 00:43:57,484
I apologize for rushing this without giving you proper notice.

390
00:43:57,484 --> 00:43:59,403
It's fine.

391
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:03,395
No need to pretend like you care about me at all.

392
00:44:12,798 --> 00:44:15,590
Leave it there. I'll take care of it.

393
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:27,353
You're good at drawing, too, Father.

394
00:44:27,353 --> 00:44:31,808
But shouldn't that apple be red?

395
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:47,414
Just a moment, Father.

396
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,097
I didn't expect to see you here.

397
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:56,290
Oh, and about Judge Kwon…

398
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:01,360
Where's your wife?

399
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,115
I think she went to the market with our daughter.

400
00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:08,515
They'll be back soon.

401
00:46:09,396 --> 00:46:13,823
Perhaps, I should bring out some tea.

402
00:46:13,823 --> 00:46:17,780
- I have to get going. 
 - Wait…

403
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,808
Could you…

404
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:24,569
Will you…

405
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:35,308
Will you give these to Hee Ja, my wife?

406
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:46,280
I've had it for a while, but I couldn't give it to her.

407
00:46:50,762 --> 00:46:54,410
I put her through a lot of trouble.

408
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:58,597
And this is a token of apology.

409
00:46:58,597 --> 00:47:02,980
They'll be so pretty on her.

410
00:47:06,307 --> 00:47:08,525
Why now…

411
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:16,540
I thought you hated Mother.

412
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:20,012
I thought you hated her for her humble background.

413
00:47:20,012 --> 00:47:22,410
That's why…

414
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:27,320
I tried so hard not to end up like her.

415
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:31,150
I'm very sorry.

416
00:47:32,108 --> 00:47:35,920
No, it's fine.

417
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:39,327
That doesn't matter.

418
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:43,260
It's too late, anyway.

419
00:47:59,804 --> 00:48:04,708
Slowly, slowly.

420
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:06,699
Careful.

421
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:12,760
Careful, just a little more.

422
00:48:17,556 --> 00:48:18,598
Ta-da!

423
00:48:18,598 --> 00:48:24,440

424
00:48:42,096 --> 00:48:45,091
Can I blow this out?

425
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:46,822
Yes.

426
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,220

427
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,140

428
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:50,850

429
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:53,690

430
00:50:53,690 --> 00:51:05,430
♫  Like an echo in silent despair  ♫

431
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,600
♫  Disappear in vain  ♫

432
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,590
♫  I've done it all   ♫

433
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:21,960
♫  I believed that I could've it  ♫

434
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:29,950
♫  The traces I left fighting until the end  ♫

435
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:33,629
♫  God help me to see all the things  ♫

436
00:51:33,629 --> 00:51:37,722
♫  I have done that I didn't deserve  ♫

437
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:42,010
♫  in the past  ♫

438
00:51:47,994 --> 00:51:53,780
♫  Let me be there  ♫

439
00:51:55,798 --> 00:52:01,590
♫  So that I can find myself  ♫

440
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:09,230
♫  To find myself someday  ♫

441
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:22,290
We need to discuss the details of the upcoming interview.

442
00:52:29,302 --> 00:52:35,821
Master Joon Hyeok was ranked first in the most recent poll.

443
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:37,990
His ratings saw a dramatic increase

444
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:41,394
after his visit to Judge Yoon at the nursing home.

445
00:52:42,836 --> 00:52:45,330
Mother must be glad.

446
00:52:46,042 --> 00:52:49,801
So where is the interview going to be?

447
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:55,150
It'll be held at the exhibition hall of the gallery.

448
00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:04,111
How many people have you killed at Mother's service?

449
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,119
I'm sure you were just following orders.

450
00:53:10,832 --> 00:53:13,810
I wonder how that would feel, though.

451
00:53:16,504 --> 00:53:18,970
I don't think you'd believe this,

452
00:53:20,903 --> 00:53:27,230
but I know someday I'll have to pay for everything I've done.

453
00:53:29,927 --> 00:53:33,415
You do all the dirty deeds for her.

454
00:53:33,415 --> 00:53:36,048
You have no right to say that.

455
00:53:36,854 --> 00:53:41,870
I know that people fear me because I work for her.

456
00:53:43,064 --> 00:53:49,040
But I've never used that for my own gain.

457
00:54:05,254 --> 00:54:08,900
This is the letter Kim Yi Seol left for you.

458
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,120
Why are you giving this to me now?

459
00:54:16,793 --> 00:54:20,720
You can judge that yourself.

460
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:34,170

461
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,720

462
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:22,503
 To Mrs. Yoon,

463
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:28,202
 I'm sorry to go without a proper goodbye.

464
00:55:29,122 --> 00:55:33,581
 I hated you and held a grudge against you.

465
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,570
 I felt it was unfair.

466
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:43,970
 And I couldn't bear the fact that I was the reason for your suffering.

467
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:49,329
 I wonder where it all began.

468
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:53,300

469
00:55:57,584 --> 00:56:04,230
 I went to ask the redevelopment association to postpone the demolition.

470
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:12,940
 That's when I first met Young Joo.

471
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,996
 And she told me that she knew a place where a lot of powerful people came.

472
00:56:16,996 --> 00:56:20,470
 You can wait in the car. It won't take long.

473
00:56:26,488 --> 00:56:31,960
 She took me there, and that's where I met Jung Joon Hyeok.

474
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:36,501
 I'm getting a checkup today.

475
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:40,804
 I don't think I can go. Everyone's on standby because of the protest.

476
00:56:40,804 --> 00:56:43,140
 Just focus on your work. I'll take care of everything.

477
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,544
 But it's our wedding anniversary.

478
00:56:45,544 --> 00:56:47,680
 I'll take you somewhere nice for dinner.

479
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,110
 - I'll make a reservation. 
 - Okay.

480
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:56,204
 This is my gift for our anniversary.

481
00:56:56,204 --> 00:57:00,103
 We never even belonged in the same world.

482
00:57:00,103 --> 00:57:04,640
 How did it even come to this?

483
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:13,720

484
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,470

485
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:26,190
 Hey. That's what you're going to wear?

486
00:57:31,607 --> 00:57:33,808
 Put this on, instead.

487
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,916
 Let's have some fun!

488
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:40,011
 Are you all having a good time?

489
00:57:40,011 --> 00:57:46,208
 This is a special group I've prepared just for you.

490
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,070
 They're all nice and pretty.

491
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:51,715
 - Just look at them! 
 - Look up and give them a smile.

492
00:57:51,715 --> 00:57:54,050
 Let's do this!

493
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,607
 Hey, you!

494
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:58,199
 Come over here!

495
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:01,020
 Hey, who said you could pick first?

496
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,303
 Well then, I'm getting two. You in the red dress.

497
00:58:04,303 --> 00:58:08,496
 If I hadn't gone to that place,

498
00:58:09,554 --> 00:58:13,382
 if I hadn't been born so poor,

499
00:58:14,104 --> 00:58:18,807
 or if I hadn't been born at all…

500
00:58:20,151 --> 00:58:24,260
 I blamed myself for everything.

501
00:58:38,855 --> 00:58:41,990
 The police decided to suppress the protestors by force

502
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:46,727
 and began action in Hyeongsan-dong redevelopment area 4.

503
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:50,530
 During the operation, a fire suddenly broke out…

504
00:59:06,098 --> 00:59:09,550
 That night when my grandmother died,

505
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:17,150
 our fate was decided, without us knowing.

506
00:59:18,824 --> 00:59:21,590

507
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,565

508
00:59:22,565 --> 00:59:26,370
 My pain became your hope.

509
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:48,310
 11:26 a.m., March 14th. Weight: 3.2 kg. It's a boy.

510
00:59:49,812 --> 00:59:52,178
 Would you like to see the baby?

511
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:56,909
 And my loss and despair

512
00:59:58,185 --> 01:00:01,015
 became your happiness.

513
01:00:03,782 --> 01:00:07,410
 That's why I couldn't even say sorry.

514
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:14,380
 I couldn't offer you comfort when you were suffering.

515
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:21,394
 But I sincerely hope to meet you again someday.

516
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:26,560
 Until then, take good care of Hyeon Woo.

517
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:33,319
 Thank you for everything.

518
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:06,100
Let's prepare for the interview.

519
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,960

520
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:28,860

521
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:55,610
 I'll give the earrings to Hee Ja.

522
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:27,010

523
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:46,800

524
01:03:51,405 --> 01:03:54,102
The duty of a First Lady…

525
01:03:55,482 --> 01:04:00,940
I'd have to suppose that my husband is the elected president

526
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,609
to answer that question.

527
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,727
To help the President stick to his principles,

528
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:19,106
I believe that's the duty of the First Lady.

529
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:23,397
I've always had much sympathy for people who face discrimination.

530
01:04:23,397 --> 01:04:30,505
Lots of people are discriminated against for various reasons.

531
01:04:31,718 --> 01:04:33,717
I've also noticed

532
01:04:34,944 --> 01:04:39,605
that even when thousands still suffer,

533
01:04:39,605 --> 01:04:42,697
the world doesn't seem to care at all.

534
01:04:42,697 --> 01:04:45,410
Isn't that just ridiculous?

535
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:58,106
That is indeed ridiculous.

536
01:04:59,002 --> 01:05:04,840
Those with power enjoy life, untouched, and even get away with murder.

537
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:10,423
Didn't you know?

538
01:05:10,423 --> 01:05:13,425
I killed Kim Yi Seol.

539
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:20,210

540
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:32,080

541
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:43,102
 As you know, I'm the kind of person that just can't stand this kind of ridicule.

542
01:05:43,102 --> 01:05:44,710
 I have no idea.

543
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:48,010
 You always live the way you want.

544
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,886
 And I never do anything I want.

545
01:05:50,886 --> 01:05:52,891
 I don't know what choices we'll end up making.

546
01:05:52,891 --> 01:05:56,490
 You won't speak of such things on the broadcast. Never again.

547
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,295
 We'd better take care of it ourselves.

548
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:02,027
 She won't do that again. She'll come back to her senses.

549
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:04,393
 Jung Joon Hyeok and Seo Han Sook.

550
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:07,928
 They committed crimes and I turned a blind eye.

551
01:06:07,928 --> 01:06:11,670
 Yoon Jae Hee, the director of the Sungjin Gallery turned herself in…

552
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,210
 We can still make this right again. I can change it all.

553
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:17,913
 - Don't you think it's too late? 
 - That's why I'll right my wrongs now.

554
01:06:17,913 --> 01:06:19,150
I can't do that.

555
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,113
 I'm going to find the story that Yi Seol wanted to tell.

556
01:06:22,113 --> 01:06:27,080
 I realized it was not the fault of just a single person.
