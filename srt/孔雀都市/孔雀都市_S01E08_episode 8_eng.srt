1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,455

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:15,300

3
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:47,374

4
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:52,164

5
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:56,774
 The broker said he picked the one with the closest expected delivery date.

6
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:01,260
 She must really think she's something.

7
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,206
 It's nothing too special for a woman to be pregnant.

8
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:07,388
 If she's so sick as to miss out on her father-in-law's birthday,

9
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:10,501
 how could she even have worked so far?

10
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:34,493
 My life is so full of lies, Dad. And I'll have to hide here for a few months.

11
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:16,499
 Is Hyeon Woo really my son?

12
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:30,791
No, he's not.

13
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:50,972
Are you saying that because you're angry?

14
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:57,585
I'm going to let this one pass,

15
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:01,652
but you need to behave yourself from now on.

16
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,179
Don't you ever blemish my reputation.

17
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:27,754

18
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:47,620
Yes, Mother.

19
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,656
 Are you busy with anything?

20
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,658
 Meet me at the den.

21
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:28,881
You must be surprised.

22
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:37,859
I can only imagine how anxious you would have been all this time,

23
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:44,835
how desperate you must have been,

24
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,928
and how overwhelmed…

25
00:04:55,488 --> 00:05:00,755
I have done wrong, Mother. Please help.

26
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:03,622
Please help me this once.

27
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:16,792
You may get up.

28
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,813
Mother.

29
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:22,157
I said, on your feet.

30
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:28,935
You represent me and the Sungjin Group.

31
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,525
You have to be elegant at all times.

32
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:03,980
Hyungnim. There... There he is.

33
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,708
Why is he meeting Secretary Go?

34
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:25,524
Isn't that Jae Hee's car?

35
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:33,854
- Hyungnim. 
 - Be quiet. Don't say anything.

36
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:46,052
Why are you doing all this?

37
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:53,767
Explain yourself so I can understand.

38
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:58,889
What happened to Joon Hyeok that he ran a paternity test? Is it for Hyeon Woo?

39
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:03,705
If that ever happened, you can ask him

40
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:07,213
if it was for Hyeon Woo and what the result is.

41
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:09,400
Do you think I'm stupid?

42
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,100
There must be a reason why Secretary Go was there.

43
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:25,510
Jae Hee will do anything to make Joon Hyeok President.

44
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,644
If you want to cut her off for such a small thing, then go ahead.

45
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,570
Small thing?

46
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,540
You've been fooling me for seven years. How can you say that?

47
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:37,971
I also...

48
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:43,238
didn't know that you had Joon Hyeok with that lunch lady

49
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:45,239
for at least three years.

50
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,373
So, is this revenge?

51
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:51,015
That was over 40 years ago.

52
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:57,294
Revenge? I'm disappointed you think so.

53
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:03,094
You know I've dedicated my entire life

54
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:07,366
to protect this family.

55
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:13,235
I'll let you decide whether to abandon Jae Hee

56
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:18,623
or just play with the card you drew.

57
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,880
Don't mind him.

58
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,140
You know he's always been like that.

59
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:11,582
Mother.

60
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:18,487
I will tell Joon Hyeok the truth–

61
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:20,619
Don't lower your head.

62
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:26,881
Don't say empty words to cover your guilt.

63
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,749
That doesn't make you a good person.

64
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:34,670
If you actually meant that, we wouldn't even have come to this.

65
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,999
Whatever the reason, it wouldn't make sense if you live without any worries or agony

66
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:43,723
after you've done all that, don't you think so?

67
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:54,292
Also, you know that he isn't so understanding.

68
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:59,387
When you were having a hard time getting pregnant,

69
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:02,767
did he ever tell you

70
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:07,756
that it's enough and that you can stop?

71
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:15,337
Well, what happened already happened.

72
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,567
You just have to learn to live with it.

73
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:24,208
No, I will. It'd look weird.

74
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,046
It's better that I pour my own drink.

75
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:33,812
In my high school senior year, I would practice at an art studio here,

76
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:38,280
and I came here at least three times a week.

77
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,545
Were you stressed out?

78
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:44,016
Because you didn't have the talent or luxury handbags?

79
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,752
It was shoes back then.

80
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:51,247
Do people still use the word,

81
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:53,446
"Brand name shoes?"

82
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:59,025
I really wanted brand-name shoes they sold at the department store,

83
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:03,506
but I couldn't afford those back then.

84
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:06,115
You could have gotten a part-time job.

85
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:09,226
I didn't want anyone to see me like that. I was too proud for that.

86
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,670
Isn't it weird?

87
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:19,815
I know. I've worked part-time jobs, too, and that would hurt my pride.

88
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:26,181
So... do you want to guess what I did?

89
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:30,327
I stole a pair.

90
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,818
A thieving bitch.

91
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:41,917
Hey!

92
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:46,784
Wasn't that what you wanted to hear?

93
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:51,898
Exactly.

94
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:57,603
How do you know me so well?

95
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:11,838
But… how can you trust me, telling me all this?

96
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,992
How well do you know me?

97
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:20,494
I just want to get close and be friends with you.

98
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:30,824
Give me some time then.

99
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,320
- I'll give you a ride. 
 - Stop being so nice.

100
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,120
- It makes me uncomfortable. 
 - Okay.

101
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,067
- Get her home safe. 
 - Of course.

102
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,499
- I'll see you. 
 - Bye.

103
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,111

104
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:21,053

105
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:32,042
 Are you crazy? You got beaten up. You should be scared.

106
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,220

107
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:47,854
 Let's just move somewhere nobody knows. Quit your job and change your number.

108
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:50,576
 No. I'll sue them.

109
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,962
 I have the evidence, and I will make them pay.

110
00:15:57,233 --> 00:16:02,355
 Didn't you think what people might say if this gets public?

111
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:04,912
 What have I done so wrong?

112
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:08,646
 I may not be a proud daughter for what I did,

113
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:11,150
 but I didn't do anything to deserve public shaming.

114
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,225
 I know what you did. You were paid by guys to…

115
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,218
 The guys that come to our shop are all well-schooled, smart people.

116
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:24,217
 They got good jobs, too.

117
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,715
 And they all pay for sex.

118
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:32,503
 They all know everyone does that.

119
00:16:32,503 --> 00:16:36,925
 But I've never seen anyone shaming each other for that.

120
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,180
 What a shame.

121
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:38,816

122
00:20:10,123 --> 00:20:13,989
- Mommy. 
 - Sweety.

123
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:18,863
- Did you have a good sleep? 
 - Yes.

124
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,937
Daddy.

125
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:26,628
- Did you have a good sleep? 
 - Yes.

126
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:29,490
Did you have a good sleep, Honey?

127
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,035
- Shall we go wash your face? 
 - Sure.

128
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:47,826

129
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:51,639

130
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,684
Good morning.

131
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:17,417
- Oh. Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

132
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:27,825
You look so professional and cool dressed like that.

133
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,549
You must be busy, right?

134
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,527
Oh, this is nothing, but…

135
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:41,125
I just thought you might be too busy to cook things

136
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:45,283
I just cooked some abalones and thought I might share some.

137
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:50,796
I thought you couldn't make it taste as good as Min Seon's.

138
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:52,072
Did you find her recipe?

139
00:21:52,073 --> 00:21:56,770
Yes, I found the recipe that she left,

140
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,626
and it tastes just the same.

141
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:04,217
I still get surprised at how Min Seon was

142
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:07,871
so perfect at managing the house.

143
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:11,320
Oh, and by the way, Jae Hee,

144
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:15,822
about No Young Joo…

145
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,838
- Remember? No Young Joo! 
 - Speak.

146
00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:30,475
What I mean is… Min Seon...

147
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:34,472
had a bit of temper sometimes,

148
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:40,225
but I just don't think an ordinary housewife like her

149
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,393
would have had someone killed like that.

150
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:45,574
Evidence shows that she had Young Joo beaten up.

151
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:51,273
No Young Joo reported it, but the record is gone. Then she was found dead.

152
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:53,972
And then No Young Joo's roommate blackmailed Min Seon.

153
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:59,359
But I heard that it wasn't evidence for her murder.

154
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:02,581
Did your husband put you up to this?

155
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:07,736
No, I'm just…

156
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:14,762
I just thought that your husband and mine were just on the same boat.

157
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,986
But then you came over and said those things, and I'm just scared.

158
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:22,040
I've already made myself clear to him.

159
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,950
I want him to stop getting in my way.

160
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:28,557
You should have brought an answer to that.

161
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:34,022
 Yoon Jae Hee! You got some nerve saying something like that.

162
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:37,890
-  Do you think I'll leave you alone?  
 - I'm hanging up!

163
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:42,890
Well… I was just doing as I was told…

164
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:47,418
Well done. You helped deliver my message, as well.

165
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:52,163
If you're done, you should get going. And take this back.

166
00:23:52,835 --> 00:23:54,435
Jae Hee.

167
00:24:14,665 --> 00:24:17,147
So Cho Kang Hyeon

168
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:21,060
is worried that I might just use him

169
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,674
without making him director of the CIO as promised

170
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:29,208
Well, that is one thing, but Yoon Jae Hee–

171
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,042
CEO, please.

172
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,713
Oh, sure. Sure.

173
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:41,929
The CEO used to serve under his late wife in the past,

174
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:46,038
but now that he has to work under her…

175
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:48,918
Well, I do understand what you mean.

176
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,370
Also, the way she treats and talks to others…

177
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,426
is not very polite and friendly.

178
00:24:55,426 --> 00:25:01,282
Well, I've also put up with your snide comments,

179
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:05,690
so I think they can put up with each other and find a middle ground.

180
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:12,739
By the way, I haven't heard anything about my son's appointment.

181
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:15,347
When will I hear any news?

182
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:19,639
I'm also quite frustrated about that.

183
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:24,142
I need some information to make a backup plan,

184
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:30,852
but no one is sharing any information regarding the appointment.

185
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:12,681

186
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:28,861
Now, I don't owe you anything.

187
00:26:31,452 --> 00:26:33,308
What is this? Where did you get this?

188
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:37,712
Well, I am a capable man.

189
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:40,055
Start talking, will you?

190
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,374
Tell me.

191
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:50,462
Well… I sold the Jung Joon Hyeok video.

192
00:26:50,462 --> 00:26:53,531
You said you didn't have it. Then how did you get it?

193
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:57,192
Well, there are plenty of ways to hack into security cameras.

194
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:01,160
I already had the video.

195
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:05,535
But if we had done as you said, we could be dead by now like Young Joo.

196
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:09,813
I thought the whole point was to stop them from climbing up the ladder.

197
00:27:09,814 --> 00:27:12,832
And we can get some pocket money, too.

198
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:18,910
So you can get yourself into a nice apartment

199
00:27:18,911 --> 00:27:21,694
and stop sleeping at saunas.

200
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:25,950
So who did you sell it to?

201
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:44,896
I like the exhibit, CEO Yoon.

202
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:50,854
I thought you were going to invite me to the opening ceremony.

203
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:58,988
I'm sorry things didn't work out as you had planned

204
00:27:58,988 --> 00:28:01,289
Let's talk business.

205
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:04,329
What are you doing here,

206
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:09,007
and why did you ask about my husband?

207
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:22,818
I have an appointment soon, so we can talk later.

208
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:32,282
Why don't we find some place quiet to talk?

209
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:37,456
We can also discuss what happened last time.

210
00:29:03,971 --> 00:29:06,938
Who did you sell it to?

211
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:09,504
There. This guy.

212
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:17,271
He was some minister and friends with hotshot politicians.

213
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:23,438
I heard our customers talking, and apparently he also knows the President.

214
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:27,840
He paid good money for this, so he must be loaded.

215
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:47,623
That man…

216
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:53,211
Didn't we see him at the rehearsal?

217
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:59,875
Who is he? And why does he upset you every time?

218
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,226
Upset? Can you tell?

219
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,938
I can't do nothing about it.

220
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,665
It's like your time has been folded in half.

221
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:46,514
Last time, and then today, I felt like your life in the past

222
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:50,767
cast a shadow on your current life.

223
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,457
Is that so?

224
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:59,127
You are haunted by your memories of the past,

225
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:01,882
and there is nothing you can do about it.

226
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:08,837
I hate myself for being anxious over the same tragedies happening again.

227
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:14,259
You must be scared and frustrated.

228
00:31:15,747 --> 00:31:20,525
When I'm not the same as in the past…

229
00:31:40,842 --> 00:31:44,527
About No Young Joo and Cho Kang Hyeon,

230
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:48,527
I heard the video was taken at our villa.

231
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:54,064
Then… how did it get out in the first place?

232
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:05,205
I was going to report to you when it's dealt with and over.

233
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:09,420
We have found someone

234
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:13,710
that may have hacked into the system and stolen that video.

235
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,391
We're keeping an eye on him.

236
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:21,632
He works under Yang Won Rok and is at the villa on occasion.

237
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:25,015
He was a neighbor to No Young Joo, living in the same building.

238
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:33,582
Then… he would know about her roommate, as well.

239
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:06,827
Where is this rat?

240
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,144
There he is.

241
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:51,509
I'll have somaek. 
  (T/N: Beer mixed with soju)

242
00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:58,367
I told you to have some class.

243
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:00,856
I wasn't the only one…

244
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:09,338
So the same drink as usual?

245
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,476
What is this? Where are the girls?

246
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:18,069
Well, I was told not to allow anyone else in here but the regular staff.

247
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,102
By whom?

248
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:20,291
Secretary Go.

249
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,943
What is she to say that?

250
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:24,220
It comes from Mrs. Yoon.

251
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:30,569
I could talk to her and–

252
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,217
No, never mind. Just get out.

253
00:34:33,217 --> 00:34:36,852
I'm sick and tired of her. Don't even say her name.

254
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:39,692
Then I'll bring your drinks.

255
00:34:39,692 --> 00:34:42,850
Hey, Won Rok! Hey!

256
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,928
What is this? We didn't come to party with men.

257
00:34:48,945 --> 00:34:51,884
So what are you going to do?

258
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:56,061
- You'll have to make a decision soon. 
 - What?

259
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,580
If you oppose Yoon Jae Hee like that,

260
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:01,622
Chairwoman Seo Han Sook won't be happy about it.

261
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:04,129
That's nonsense.

262
00:35:04,129 --> 00:35:06,324
Isn't it obvious?

263
00:35:06,324 --> 00:35:10,313
Chairwoman Seo has picked Yoon Jae Hee to be her successor.

264
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:20,143
There has to be something to quiet her down.

265
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:10,660

266
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,277
 I'm sorry about that morning.

267
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:28,009
It's Jung Ho.

268
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:36,185
I saw him at Cho Kang Hyeon's place the other day.

269
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:39,531
And it wasn't so pleasant.

270
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:46,529
Why does he have to text you

271
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:50,452
so late at night just to talk about that?

272
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:54,861
That woman, No Young Joo, in Cho Kang Hyeon's video

273
00:36:55,715 --> 00:37:01,282
could have been murdered by his wife, and it's possible that he covered it up.

274
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,991
Well, I knew you wouldn't like to hear about this.

275
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,401
So what are you going to do?

276
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,900
We're going to talk about it.

277
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,460
Things like this have always happened.

278
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,947
Hey, are you married?

279
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:44,490
Or do you have a girlfriend?

280
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,590
You know you're handsome, don't you?

281
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:53,385
He's smiling. You like that, don't you?

282
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:55,363
But you know what?

283
00:37:55,364 --> 00:38:01,112
It's no use for a man to be handsome.

284
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:05,804
A man has to know when to talk.

285
00:38:05,804 --> 00:38:11,109
Being tall, handsome, or rich. None of those things matter.

286
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:17,708
You've got to talk when you have to. That's what a man does. Understood?

287
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:20,963
Thank you. You can go.

288
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:25,430
How would I know anything if you don't talk?

289
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:29,609
You don't even answer my questions.

290
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:33,108
Then what am I supposed to do?

291
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:42,324
Pick yourself up, Joo Yeon.

292
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:45,669
Let's get changed and go to bed.

293
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,217
Joo Yeon.

294
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:54,404
Get up, Joo Yeon.

295
00:39:02,494 --> 00:39:04,372
Don't touch me.

296
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:34,743
You've been drinking all day.

297
00:39:38,563 --> 00:39:41,398
Stop and go to bed.

298
00:39:41,398 --> 00:39:46,520
Has Joon Hyeok caused so much agony for you?

299
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:54,629
Didn't you say that

300
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:59,629
you don't have to be called a single mother thanks to him?

301
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,034
I did.

302
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:05,676
And now you do this to me?

303
00:40:05,677 --> 00:40:08,520
How could you?

304
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,768
I understand.

305
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:15,658
Promise me one thing.

306
00:40:17,642 --> 00:40:20,497
If Joon Hyeok fails to become President,

307
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:25,631
I will get rid of Jae Hee, along with the child.

308
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:29,529
Would you like that?

309
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,729
Then it will be so.

310
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:18,590
What brings you here, CEO Yoon?

311
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:26,746
I was going to call you later tonight.

312
00:41:26,746 --> 00:41:32,582
I only came to tell you that you should be ashamed of what you did.

313
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:40,155
You don't seem to have a sense of shame, always so loud and proud of yourself.

314
00:41:40,155 --> 00:41:43,181
Hello, sir.

315
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:45,603
What will you have me do?

316
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:49,004
I could tell everybody what you did

317
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:53,867
or give you a good slap on the face.

318
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:55,267
Why are you doing this?

319
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:58,589
Which one would people like more?

320
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:02,199
You've changed a lot.

321
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:06,990
And it's weird that you haven't at all.

322
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:29,724
What do you think you're doing?

323
00:42:29,724 --> 00:42:31,397
I'll pay for that.

324
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:33,510
What the…

325
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,170
You...

326
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:43,010

327
00:43:09,072 --> 00:43:11,150
Did I keep you waiting?

328
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:16,469
Why are we here?

329
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:39,152
 I followed you after we met that night.

330
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:45,006
I didn't want to hurt you, so I pretended I didn't know.

331
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,025
But now… I think it might not be fair

332
00:43:51,025 --> 00:43:53,781
that you don't know that I know.

333
00:43:55,232 --> 00:44:00,530
I may be overstepping, but I'm going to give you some help.

334
00:44:12,155 --> 00:44:14,099
Go in.

335
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:34,266
You're a lot like me.

336
00:44:34,956 --> 00:44:41,734
And perhaps I'm just compensating for my past hardships by helping you.

337
00:44:41,734 --> 00:44:43,890
Back then, I hoped

338
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,956
that somebody would come to my aid

339
00:44:47,956 --> 00:44:50,602
to protect me.

340
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,944
How do you feel now?

341
00:44:56,184 --> 00:44:58,165
Now…

342
00:45:00,627 --> 00:45:03,105
I have myself.

343
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:06,596
And I have you.

344
00:45:38,062 --> 00:45:43,210
This comes from the Chairman. He also sent some medicine.

345
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:54,484
 Don't meddle with what goes on between us.

346
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:59,700
 I know you've been secretly sending money to your family.

347
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,470

348
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:40,843
How old is your husband?

349
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:42,364
He's 40.

350
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:44,236
Today's our anniversary.

351
00:46:44,237 --> 00:46:48,457
Then I would recommend this one. It's this year's new release.

352
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:51,824
It's the most popular in the SS collection.

353
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:55,550
The design is simple and luxurious…

354
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:29,284
Honey. I'm almost there.

355
00:47:29,284 --> 00:47:31,246
Okay.

356
00:47:36,752 --> 00:47:40,970

357
00:47:47,037 --> 00:47:50,570

358
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,490

359
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,474

360
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:14,840

361
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:32,242
- Miss Yoon. 
 - Dong Min, get in. We have two minutes.

362
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:20,151
 So are you happy to discover the true nature of your husband?

363
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:23,515
Why are you doing this?

364
00:49:23,515 --> 00:49:27,377
Well, you should have taken care of your husband

365
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:31,288
before acting out like that.

366
00:49:31,288 --> 00:49:34,884
You thought I would even flinch?

367
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:40,056
I thought you wanted to become First Lady, didn't you?

368
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:47,854
So why don't we meet up

369
00:49:47,855 --> 00:49:51,477
to discuss this matter, like I suggested?

370
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:55,623
 This is your last chance.

371
00:49:56,231 --> 00:50:00,429
 Don't be late. I hate to wait.

372
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,631
Can I ask why you chose to marry me?

373
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:22,383
Do you have to?

374
00:52:24,622 --> 00:52:28,222
I only had one reason to marry you.

375
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:34,205
Your status that you're lucky to have, born a bastard.

376
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:39,624
I was one lucky boy.

377
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:43,847
I also found it attractive that you didn't pity yourself.

378
00:52:43,847 --> 00:52:47,358
I liked you because you were honest

379
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:52,869
about your intentions without lying or faking love.

380
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,199
I looked at your phone.

381
00:53:05,463 --> 00:53:08,474
There's nothing between Jung Ho and me.

382
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:09,407
I know that.

383
00:53:09,408 --> 00:53:11,440
I thought you didn't.

384
00:53:24,086 --> 00:53:28,864
- It wasn't my suspicions that– 
 - Honey.

385
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,329
I am going to make you President.

386
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:43,276
And I will be there by your side.

387
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,189
Happy anniversary.

388
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:53,031
Where did you park your car?

389
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:55,419
Why don't you call a chauffer for yours and ride with me?

390
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,226
I have somewhere to be because of work. You can go first.

391
00:54:59,226 --> 00:55:02,337
Okay, then. See you.

392
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:06,639
Remember.

393
00:56:07,439 --> 00:56:12,262
If anything goes wrong for Joon Hyeok, Jae Hee will be out.

394
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,340
Mr. Park Yong Seob?

395
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:41,694
Joon Hyeok's sex video has been leaked.

396
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:45,729
Is that why you called everybody this late?

397
00:58:45,729 --> 00:58:47,895
At all.

398
00:58:47,895 --> 00:58:49,164
What is it then?

399
00:58:49,165 --> 00:58:52,610
Who told you to leak the video?

400
00:58:53,535 --> 00:58:55,346
Well… that was…

401
00:58:56,572 --> 00:58:57,694
Who was it?

402
00:58:57,695 --> 00:58:59,817
It was Mr. Cho Kang Hyeon.

403
00:59:05,012 --> 00:59:06,367
What?

404
00:59:10,642 --> 00:59:13,053
Prosecutor General Cho Kang Hyeon.

405
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:17,914
What is all this?

406
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:23,993
I will send this to Chairwoman Seo Han Sook.

407
00:59:27,026 --> 00:59:29,137
What is it that you want?

408
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:41,091
Coming.

409
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:54,579
Yoo Jin Seok. You are under arrest under Foreign Exchange Transactions Act.

410
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:56,390
What?

411
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:13,376
No, I'm fine.

412
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:17,132
But there is something I'd like you to take care of.

413
01:00:17,132 --> 01:00:21,818
So what you're saying is that Joon Hyeok's video was taken

414
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:26,763
at the same place as Cho Kang Hyeon's?

415
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:31,948
But then,

416
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:38,041
even if you find the person who leaked that video,

417
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:40,517
would Yoo Jin Seok listen to you?

418
01:00:40,518 --> 01:00:43,621
I have a plan for that.

419
01:00:44,438 --> 01:00:47,193
I'll report back to you when everything's dealt with.

420
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:04,686
How did it go?

421
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:11,140
Good.

422
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:04,443

423
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:17,410

424
01:03:22,307 --> 01:03:27,285
 Answer me. Who knows about my husband's video?

425
01:03:27,285 --> 01:03:31,773
 I've never seen such a heinous bitch in my life.

426
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:34,006
 I can't let anything happen to Joon Hyeok.

427
01:03:34,007 --> 01:03:37,473
 I don't care what others think. I only care about how you feel.

428
01:03:37,474 --> 01:03:40,571
 I don't think that's important, either. It's done anyway.

429
01:03:40,576 --> 01:03:44,743
 I'm going to tell her that I am No Young Joo's roommate.

430
01:03:44,744 --> 01:03:49,184
 - Are you crazy? She's on their side. 
 - Seol,

431
01:03:49,185 --> 01:03:52,057
Stay on my side at any time.

432
01:03:52,664 --> 01:03:56,520
 Don't worry. I have someone who can help.
