1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,230

2
00:00:54,288 --> 00:01:00,750

3
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:26,340

4
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:33,206
The role of the first lady…

5
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:40,293
So presuming that my husband Jung Joon Hyeok does become president,

6
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:42,701
I'll answer it in this way.

7
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:53,110
I think the role of first lady demands

8
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:58,543
that she helps her husband stay faithful to his principles.

9
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:02,809
I've been interested in the ignored and those discriminated against.

10
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:04,130
In this world,

11
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,707
there are... many kinds of unresolved discrimination.

12
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,215
But

13
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:19,013
despite their continued suffering,

14
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,111
the world just keeps on turning.

15
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:24,990
It's a real shame.

16
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:38,450
Really, it's quite a shame.

17
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:51,980

18
00:02:54,549 --> 00:03:00,670

19
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:15,840
This way, please.

20
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,693
I'll take the attendace.

21
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:31,201
In the Third Exhibit Hall, we have… Lim So Yeon?

22
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,277
Yes.

23
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,507
- Shin Su Rim? 
 - Here.

24
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:37,025
- Kim Yi Seol? 
 - Yes.

25
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:40,912
If you look at the floor plan, your sections are all marked.

26
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:43,177
Oh, there's one thing to be aware of.

27
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:46,204
Items in the designated exhibit spaces are fluid,

28
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:49,650
so we request that all of you here

29
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,922
read the distributed materials carefully.

30
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:53,215
- Okay. 
 - Yes.

31
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:55,840
Let's go to the next room.

32
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:04,821
This is the usage rights permission form we received from the family.

33
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:08,007
During the exhibition period, insurance and transportation are covered.

34
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:11,632
Lately, people are really only interested in monochrome,

35
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:14,109
so I was rather worried,

36
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:17,308
but look at what a great exhibition you've planned.

37
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:18,621
Impressive.

38
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:22,223
It's because I had a great teacher. However, I still have a lot to learn.

39
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:25,592
I have a long way to go before I reach your level, though.

40
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:29,105
Too much humility comes across as cheeky.

41
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:31,115
Don't push your luck.

42
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:33,504
Now I'm scared.

43
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,771
Here…

44
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:37,956
What's this for?

45
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:42,300
So you can look your best for the cameras at the hearing.

46
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:48,301
If I want to shine this brightly,

47
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:52,384
I'll need the permission of your mother-in-law first.

48
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:53,467
No?

49
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:57,880
Two days, and I'll have it all sorted.

50
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:02,415
You'll need to trust me.

51
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:06,470
Of course, I will. I always trust Yoon Jae Hee.

52
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,921
Your signature.

53
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:13,290
Right here, please.

54
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,925
Where is Jae Hee? Is she still not here?

55
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:39,419
Where is she now?

56
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,393
She had an exhibition planning meeting. It must have run late.

57
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:46,632
With whom?

58
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,916
Kwon Min Seon.

59
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:51,589
Cho Kang Hyeon's wife?

60
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,250
Yes.

61
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:07,122
She knows that today is the anniversary of Grandfather's death, right?

62
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:09,913
I inform her of the day's events every morning.

63
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:12,303
So she's intentionally late?

64
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:14,693
I'll try contacting her again.

65
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,255
Don't.

66
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:20,340
Work is all she's good at, that girl.

67
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:58,317
Hang it carefully, guys.

68
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,430

69
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:07,510
When our Gyu Seong's midterms are over, we should all go camping together.

70
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,367
We can watch Hyeon Woo follow him around like a puppy, too, right?

71
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,490
Sounds good.

72
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:26,904
He looks more and more like his father every year, right?

73
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,921
It's a nice guy to take after, too.

74
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:35,176
So manly, and… manly.

75
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:37,805
Nice thing in a man, right?

76
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:42,370
Why is your door wide open like this?

77
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,660
Oh, because there's a guest.

78
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,628
Hello there.

79
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:53,835
Why the sudden visit?

80
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:55,736
Because Director Go will be eating at our house tonight,

81
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:57,848
and I'm here for a bit of food.

82
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:02,724
I have no idea why my abalone never tastes the way I want it to.

83
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:05,601
Can you give me some water, please?

84
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:06,521
Yes, ma'am!

85
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:08,210
What's this?

86
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,909
Are you selling this one?

87
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:12,113
But it's…

88
00:08:15,182 --> 00:08:18,810
You need some money, right?

89
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:23,709
How much might it go for?

90
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:28,304
I'll buy it if it's not too expensive.

91
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:31,040
Don't touch the painting.

92
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:36,730
 Nanjido.

93
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,886
A village?

94
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:46,650
Nan-ji-do…

95
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:50,602
Nanjido!

96
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:53,618
Oh, this is…

97
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:57,917
This became Sangam-dong, right?

98
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:01,043
I should have bought some of that land way back then!

99
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:05,610
Oh wow, that sucks! Ah well.

100
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,510
So this is what Sangam-dong used to look like, yikes!

101
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:15,299
Drive safely.

102
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:22,025
- Call me when she leaves. 
 - I will.

103
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,040
Just a moment.

104
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:41,788
Add this to her bath. It'll help improve her mood.

105
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:44,390
All right.

106
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:55,131
There's something more important than whether Cho Kang Hyeon

107
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:57,702
becomes Prosecutor General or not.

108
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,164
Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs.

109
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:03,316
The seat is currently vacant, so who will take it?

110
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:06,927
I mean, the alliances Cho makes now,

111
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:10,202
they'll have an effect on the next election.

112
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,609
How's that?

113
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:14,327
Cho doesn't come from money.

114
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,402
So what?

115
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:17,662
That's why the people trust him.

116
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:21,899
Not having those kinds of connections helped with securing the nomination.

117
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,607
But what kind of guy is he?

118
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:27,701
Not the kind to feel satisfied leading a toothless Prosecutor's Office.

119
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:32,304
So you're saying his real goal is to lead the Corruption Investigations Office?

120
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:33,165
Exactly.

121
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,483
And he'll need the help of the Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs.

122
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:36,982
Right.

123
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:38,934
In exchange for what?

124
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:41,632
Oh, um…

125
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,896
Do you suppose he could find support and a guaranteed position for nothing?

126
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:47,606
Are we talking about some kind of angel or what?

127
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:52,305
If someone like that exists, please introduce me.

128
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:54,498
All right, let's get back to work.

129
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,461
Yes, sir.

130
00:11:02,846 --> 00:11:03,421
Understood.

131
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,379
- Tell me right away. 
 - I will.

132
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:06,838
Sunbaenim.

133
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:09,827
Did I go too far?

134
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:12,314
No, keep on it.

135
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:15,028
It might not be newsworthy yet,

136
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:17,737
but your hunch might lead you to a big story.

137
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:19,507
Go find your scoop.

138
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:22,592
Okay. But Sunbaenim,

139
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:25,928
I saw today's cue sheet and the main spot was open.

140
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:29,041
Do you maybe have something big prepared?

141
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,641
Not sure.

142
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,834
We'll see. Keep up the good work!

143
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,816
All right, Sunbaenim!

144
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:37,713
Please bring it up with the madam.

145
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:40,017
I will, don't worry.

146
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:42,034
Oh and let's hit the links one of these days,

147
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,354
grab some of that cow's head soup you like too.

148
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:48,413
Sure, let's do that. See you.

149
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:51,121
Have a wonderful day.

150
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:58,497
Oh, Jesus!

151
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:00,858
What?

152
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,475
Why? What now? What?

153
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,996
What do you mean?

154
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:10,417
Come on, you know your family.

155
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,188
Don't be like that.

156
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,068
Whatever.

157
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,296
It's not like it's the first time.

158
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:20,210
Hey, Jung. Jung!

159
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:24,722
What a difficult guy.

160
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:29,297
Enjoy.

161
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:36,766
- Madam. 
 - Yes.

162
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:38,627
Miss.

163
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,361
Why is the main spot open?

164
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:53,598
Oh, it's Joon Hyeok's story, Madam. Even the station manager doesn't know.

165
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:56,717
Does Joon Hyeok have him by the balls?

166
00:12:58,532 --> 00:13:00,633
He's a well-known, reputable anchor,

167
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:02,755
much respected in the newsroom–

168
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:07,316
Be that as it may, we can't allow him to overstep his bounds.

169
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:10,622
Oh, yes, of course.

170
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:16,687
He's useless if he can't even control his anchor.

171
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:27,899
 What are your thoughts on being nominated as the Prosecutor General?

172
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,791
 A word on how you're preparing for the hearings.

173
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,719
 I plan to be as forthright as possible.

174
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:36,614
 What are your priorities if confirmed?

175
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:42,145
 Well, I think the entire nation really hopes for a prosecutorial reform.

176
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,099
 Someone has to do it.

177
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:47,875
 Moreover, the position itself,

178
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,883
 it really demands integrity.

179
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:53,635
 I look forward to having the opportunity to prove myself.

180
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:56,168
Yes, this is Yoon Jae Hee.

181
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,288
Sorry, where?

182
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:00,372
 Please represent that in your articles.

183
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,620
 Prosecutorial reform to you–

184
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:11,314
Is she in?

185
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:22,090
It's been a long time, Aunt.

186
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,517
The more I look at you, the more stubborn you look.

187
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:42,539
You married into the family that leads the Sungjin Group.

188
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:47,704
Why are you still so ignorant of etiquette? Do you still not get it?

189
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:52,664
You keep your mouth shut until you're spoken to.

190
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:55,131
It's not even that difficult.

191
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:58,868
Even ten years after you came to us, you're still the same.

192
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:03,782
I've upset you again I see, Aunt.

193
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:14,292
This is the first time I've come to visit you here, Uncle.

194
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,998
I wasn't allowed to come,

195
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:23,543
but I often wondered how you were doing.

196
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,552
Now that I've come,

197
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:29,906
I see that it's far worse than I imagined.

198
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:37,314
But you're still the Sungjin Group Chairman, even if it's in name only.

199
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,366
You're here with the so-called wife of the Chairman.

200
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,851
I made a grave mistake today.

201
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:54,616
In general, I refuse all visitors.

202
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:59,017
I know you hate me, Aunt.

203
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:02,681
It's not like there's anyone in the family who doesn't.

204
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:06,873
You aren't intimidating me, so you can save your energy.

205
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:11,617
It must hurt your pride to need me, but the fact is that you do.

206
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,020
It's how you can protect yourself. Just think of it that way.

207
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:25,063
And if I tell my sister-in-law everything?

208
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:28,619
What might happen to you then?

209
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:32,362
Why worry about a nobody like me?

210
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:36,505
Worry about your share of the inheritance first.

211
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:39,931
He can't hold on for much longer, surely.

212
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:41,563
How dare you–

213
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,723
I had the paperwork done.

214
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:49,817
It looks like you did your very best for your son-in-law.

215
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,704
I have a friend in the Prosecutor's Office.

216
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:57,844
On a list of names caught up in a recent drug bust,

217
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:00,596
I saw one that was awfully familiar.

218
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:06,302
You really went the extra mile.

219
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:08,684
to keep it from Mother.

220
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,900
Now give me what you promised.

221
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:37,497
I can't put my gratitude into words

222
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:40,403
to you for coming here every year.

223
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:03,344
After party time?

224
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:05,107
Director.

225
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:07,175
It looks like you've finished docent orientation.

226
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:09,200
We thought you left for the day.

227
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,453
Why not go out to eat? You earned it.

228
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,321
We just felt like ordering in.

229
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:18,100
Let me know anytime if you have any problems.

230
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,008
Okay.

231
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:20,803
Enjoy the food.

232
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:23,170
Director.

233
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,210
Yes?

234
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,541
You know about the memorial ceremony, right?

235
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,402
Yes, I know.

236
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:30,570
So Chairwoman Seo and Mrs. Lee left early.

237
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,709
It's been a long day. I should get going.

238
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:36,224
Oh, hey, Honey.

239
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:45,120
The sandwiches must have been great.

240
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,822
I haven't even thought about dinner yet.

241
00:20:47,822 --> 00:20:52,987
Yes, I'm at the office. It should be safe to talk here.

242
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:56,508
Right, so did you receive it?

243
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:59,219
It sounds like you had a rough one.

244
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:01,711
Anyway, finish things up there, and I'll see you at home later.

245
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:04,400
Yes, good luck.

246
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,015
Hey. Where you at, Dong Min?

247
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:20,910
Let's make some news.

248
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,410
Right, that one. Main story.

249
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,820

250
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,908
Good luck with everything and see you at home.

251
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,080

252
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,770

253
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:56,910

254
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:02,000

255
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,920

256
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,870
Stand up straight.

257
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,800

258
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:22,530

259
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:27,270
We will now sing a hymn in remembrance of brother Seo Jong Tae.

260
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:39,430
♪ I'm pressing on the upward way ♪

261
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:50,050
♪ New heights I'm gaining every day ♪

262
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,510
- Eun Jung. 
 - It's crazy, right?

263
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,500
Mom is still like that.

264
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,610
Grandpa died 30 years ago, you know.

265
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,460
She was his favorite daughter, so it makes sense.

266
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,670
Yuck. So you've become part of the Seo family.

267
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,310
No, I'm still a Jung.

268
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,210
Father-in-law would be hurt if he heard.

269
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,820
Right, right. Sorry, Dad.

270
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:23,110
♪ Lord, lift me up and let me stand ♪

271
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:33,080
♪ By faith on heaven's table land ♪

272
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:16,022
Now, let's eat.

273
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:19,500
Anything good there?

274
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:25,275
What's this?

275
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,808
You know I don't want to be here.

276
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:30,858
Do you think life is about what you want?

277
00:24:30,858 --> 00:24:35,110
At your age, you need to be involved with your family.

278
00:24:45,772 --> 00:24:47,833
All right.

279
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:51,608
Have you found a good candidate for Prosecutor General?

280
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:56,413
Yes. A few have made it onto our final list,

281
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,625
but they're all holding back.

282
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:03,910
It's the reforms. No one wants to stab peers in the back.

283
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,130
And the job carries no power.

284
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:17,328
If I put out feelers directly, would that help?

285
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:21,812
What might you have in mind?

286
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,749
Prosecutorial reform isn't a problem.

287
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:28,083
We can put on a show and fire a few prosecutors

288
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:31,027
and the people who want reform,

289
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:33,717
they've got their own skeletons.

290
00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:38,117
They'll find out each other's dirty little secrets,

291
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:40,509
so they'll fight among themselves, right?

292
00:25:41,388 --> 00:25:43,505
Our prosecutors are working so very hard.

293
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:47,311
We should do our best to protect them.

294
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:49,952
Hurry, hurry! It's time for the desserts!

295
00:25:49,952 --> 00:25:51,944
Okay.

296
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:56,118
Oh, you'll give yourself indigestion.

297
00:25:56,118 --> 00:25:58,006
Sit and eat slowly.

298
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:59,408
Already finished.

299
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:01,776
- Can I bring you anything else? 
 - No.

300
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:05,428
The hot pepper paste is great. Wrap a little up for me.

301
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:08,316
No problem. I'll get that.

302
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,713
Hurry up, guys!

303
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:14,900
 And then…

304
00:26:15,624 --> 00:26:17,718
Director of Corruption Investigation,

305
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:21,417
we'll give that to our party representative here.

306
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:25,518
Assemblyman Kwak, here, will lead the presidential elections.

307
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:30,233
The Corruption Investigation Director and Prosecutor General will work together.

308
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:32,161
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:35,936
Ah, editor-in-chief of the Hanju Daily,

310
00:26:35,936 --> 00:26:39,016
would you like to enter the National Assembly?

311
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:43,560
Oh, I… No, ma'am.

312
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:49,735
If things work out as planned,

313
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:54,850
it would be good to get Cho Kang Hyeon on the team, as well.

314
00:26:56,593 --> 00:27:01,516
I want it to be done quickly.

315
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:06,772
Mom, so before Uncle dies,

316
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:10,271
are you setting Joon Il up to become the new chairman?

317
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:13,314
What? Can't I?

318
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:16,143
I have to stretch my legs.

319
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,517
Sit. You're the youngest one here.

320
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:22,040
How dare you.

321
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:57,608
I was wondering what you were up to.

322
00:27:57,608 --> 00:28:00,620
I said no one was to enter.

323
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:03,116
Madam…

324
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:05,210
If you've been talking for a while,

325
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:09,323
perhaps you can catch your breath while watching the news.

326
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:11,406
You'll enjoy it, Mother.

327
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:14,850
What's up with you today?

328
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:20,999
 Good evening, this JBC Nightly News.

329
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:24,714
 Our first story tonight in a JBC News exclusive,

330
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:28,415
 evidence of fraud at Sungjin Group.

331
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,682
 Leaked documents suggest that from 2012 onward,

332
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:35,710
 Sungjin Group, in advance of the Vice Chairman's planned succession,

333
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,387
 intentionally hid 4.5 trillion won and covered up evidence of wrongdoing.

334
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,819
 Reporter Han Dong Min reports.

335
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:48,819
 Confidential documents given anonymously to JBC

336
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:52,315
 detail evidence of accounting fraud

337
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:54,793
 that, in total, has sought to conceal 4.5 trillion won,

338
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:57,910
 in a concerted effort ongoing since 2012.

339
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,640
 JBC News confirms–

340
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,737
Hyeon Woo, you want to go see the new motorbike?

341
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,537
First, find the source of the leak.

342
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:10,450
Yes, sir.

343
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,268
Also, how great the leak–

344
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:17,500
Trusting cats with fish, aren't you?

345
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:26,104
It's not exactly a surprise, is it?

346
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:28,800
We should have watched Joon Hyeok from the beginning.

347
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,597
I told you.

348
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:35,370
If we had kept him here with us, that would have been so great.

349
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,335
As a member of the press,

350
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:42,519
he must have been conflicted, whether to serve family or the public.

351
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,296
Tough situation, poor boy.

352
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:49,110
Did you really not know what he and his wife were up to?

353
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,322
Or, are you pretending you had no idea?

354
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:54,493
What is she on about?

355
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:59,560
Sorry, Dad. We'll let you talk to Joon Il first.

356
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:18,028
Very outstanding.

357
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:23,430
It wasn't easy, but that just made it more fun.

358
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:28,920
All that time, shamelessly deceiving us…

359
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,707
You always told me that people never change.

360
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:40,299
You said hiding the truth is already halfway to success.

361
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,508
Never reveal the sordid truth, right?

362
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:46,242
I just did as you said.

363
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:50,105
Stop messing around and tell me what you want.

364
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:52,687
Let's hear it.

365
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:54,813
I want compensation

366
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:59,503
for all the times you used me and my husband.

367
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:03,550
All right. What compensation do you want?

368
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:11,297
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a moment.

369
00:31:11,297 --> 00:31:13,314
What might I want?

370
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:18,613
Think it over slowly and then make me an offer.

371
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:23,080
Consider whether that offer will satisfy me first, though.

372
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,693
These outsiders come in and make a mess, generation after generation.

373
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:45,712
Unnie! Don't you think that's a bit harsh?

374
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:51,716
But that's true. If it wasn't for Mother, would they be here with us?

375
00:31:51,716 --> 00:31:55,097
Living lives they don't deserve, instead of repaying us,

376
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:58,101
they act like ungrateful upstarts.

377
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,425
Honey, stop.

378
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:02,311
Why? It's all true.

379
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,523
I appreciate the input.

380
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,596
Please be forthright during the investigation, Joon Il.

381
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,823
The nation will be watching.

382
00:32:11,823 --> 00:32:15,140
Hey, Jae Hee. Do you think we'll just let you do this?

383
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,128
Everyone, stop.

384
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:20,600
We don't need this, Dad. Let's go.

385
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:34,123
Hyeon Woo! It's time to go home!

386
00:32:34,127 --> 00:32:36,387
Don't you need to head home?

387
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:40,630
I saw it all over the news sites. Today's your grandfather's memorial, no?

388
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:46,313
Everyone, everyone!

389
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,283
Being first is great, but being honest is better.

390
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:53,824
Here's to being fair and accurate.

391
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:56,419
Let's stay committed. Cheers!

392
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:58,200
Cheers!

393
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,290
Thank you.

394
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,135
Shall I get him washed up?

395
00:33:25,135 --> 00:33:28,498
No, it's fine. One night won't hurt.

396
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,949

397
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:01,301
Take the night off. I'm going to wash and head to bed.

398
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:02,454
Shall I run the water?

399
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,821
I'll do it.

400
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:17,134
 Strip.

401
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:22,088
 The wedding's next week, so we'll need final confirmation.

402
00:34:22,088 --> 00:34:27,588
 We can't let a girl who's pregnant with another man's child join the family.

403
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,711
 Don't take it badly.

404
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,918
 Even if it's just in name only…

405
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:45,758
 you'll now become a member of the Sungjin Group's family.

406
00:34:45,758 --> 00:34:48,618
 You'll have to understand.

407
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:54,921
Don't take it badly, Mother.

408
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:37,111
Mom.

409
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,599
Hey, did you sleep well?

410
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:45,298
Had a good dream?

411
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:48,124
Oh, Dad's up, too.

412
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:50,869
- Dad! 
 - Hey.

413
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:53,739
Honey, can you tell me how to get up without an alarm?

414
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:55,803
Wash your face first.

415
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:00,017
Shall we wash our faces?

416
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,102
Belief is key, really.

417
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:08,022
Sounds like cult stuff.

418
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:09,790
You don't want it enough.

419
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:13,087
So the only way to make it happen is to believe?

420
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:14,730
No time for doubt.

421
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,684
Yes, I believe. Amen.

422
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:19,947
Anything to avoid that blasted alarm.

423
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:22,709
That belief of mine made the events of yesterday happen.

424
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:26,234
"I can do this, it's possible." A little positive thinking

425
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:29,807
doesn't make you an egomaniac.

426
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,503
Mother hasn't been in contact?

427
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:35,920
Stop worrying about them.

428
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,529
It's not very attractive.

429
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:40,459
The ball's in her court now.

430
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,551
Dad, move.

431
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,740

432
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,835
So what are you up to today?

433
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:15,650
I'm taking a nap.

434
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,009
Let's get you to the salon. I'll make a reservation.

435
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:20,109
It's fine.

436
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:22,853
Come on, you need to look your best.

437
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:26,991
You have to keep your hair looking nice and tidy.

438
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:29,720
Fine, fine.

439
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:34,121
Do as you're told, kiddo.

440
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:36,407
Don't baby me.

441
00:38:36,422 --> 00:38:37,351
What about me, Mom?

442
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:40,902
- Jealous, are you? 
 - You want some, too?

443
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,718
Pinch.

444
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:44,849
Hello.

445
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:48,623
Oh, hello there.

446
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:51,096
Say hello, dear.

447
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,778
Hello.

448
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:56,051
Hi, there.

449
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:00,896
It's my husband's day off, and–

450
00:39:00,898 --> 00:39:03,012
You're the JBC anchor, right?

451
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:04,762
Yes, that's right.

452
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:07,082
I watch you all the time.

453
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:08,902
Thank you very much.

454
00:39:08,902 --> 00:39:10,961
A fan, right?

455
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,613
Call me when you're done. I'll try to come and pick you up.

456
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,242
Okay.

457
00:39:16,242 --> 00:39:18,275
Have fun at kindergarten, Hyeon Woo.

458
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:21,021
- Good luck, Mom. 
 - Good luck!

459
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:23,888
Hyeon Woo, watch your hands.

460
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:32,705
Let's go.

461
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,741
A student?

462
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:41,977
One more semester.

463
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,749
You're baby-faced, then.

464
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:47,038
One or two years difference, it still usually shows.

465
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,410
I started late, so I'm 27 now.

466
00:39:50,426 --> 00:39:52,611
You seem to be clever.

467
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:55,908
I like people who know what they want.

468
00:39:57,512 --> 00:40:01,038
You two seem quite happy.

469
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,988
My husband and I?

470
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:07,715
Glad you think so.

471
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:10,341
You must really love each other.

472
00:40:14,682 --> 00:40:16,943
Why do you laugh?

473
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:20,452
I guess I'm not used to it.

474
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:22,567
Why not?

475
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:25,903
Being so young, I doubt you'd understand.

476
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:45,215
Oh, hello.

477
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,503
How are you today?

478
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:49,238
I had planned to call,

479
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:52,929
but once I checked the time it was too late.

480
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:56,899
Oh, come on, after the mess you made?

481
00:40:56,899 --> 00:41:00,838
Do you know who I'm off to meet now?

482
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:04,646
My mother-in-law?

483
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:07,116
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

484
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:09,139
I'll call later.

485
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,795
Madam Seo?

486
00:41:11,843 --> 00:41:13,804
Come inside.

487
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,385
Director, the revisions are ready.

488
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,389
Director?

489
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:24,509
Yes?

490
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:26,619
The revisions.

491
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,408
Oh, okay.

492
00:41:28,408 --> 00:41:30,069
Let's see.

493
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:52,610
I see you've been working with my daughter-in-law.

494
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:58,433
We've known each other for a long time.

495
00:41:59,161 --> 00:42:01,610
About fifteen years now.

496
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:06,198
Enough time to build trust, then.

497
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:10,448
I think so, yes.

498
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:13,184
She said you're not one to put yourself in other's shoes,

499
00:42:13,184 --> 00:42:15,778
unable to imagine other perspectives,

500
00:42:15,778 --> 00:42:17,619
so I should believe her.

501
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,320
That's true, I'm ashamed to say.

502
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,105
I understand, though.

503
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:31,122
You've lived your whole life without ever being expected to do so.

504
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,062
That's why you asked for my husband's support of

505
00:42:36,062 --> 00:42:40,026
the Corruption Investigations Office in return for his confirmation.

506
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:45,731
Not everyone in the world is here for your benefit.

507
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:52,412
Have you spoken to her about this?

508
00:42:52,412 --> 00:42:55,433
That you'd met me first?

509
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:58,385
There's no need for misunderstandings.

510
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:03,757
If she finds out you're using her,

511
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:06,800
wouldn't she feel betrayed?

512
00:43:09,194 --> 00:43:11,917
Of course, she won't like it.

513
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:16,729
She's a woman of great ambition, Jae Hee.

514
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:21,216
But she won't do anything rash over it.

515
00:43:24,096 --> 00:43:26,798
Despite being her mother-in-law,

516
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:30,705
you know her much better than I do.

517
00:43:37,427 --> 00:43:40,199
Aside from my husband's confirmation,

518
00:43:40,904 --> 00:43:43,200
make Joon Hyeok

519
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,300
Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs.

520
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:49,307
Tell Joon Hyeok to do his best

521
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:52,225
to support my husband.

522
00:43:53,195 --> 00:43:54,978
If you support us through the reform period

523
00:43:54,978 --> 00:43:58,805
until my husband becomes the Corruption Investigations Director…

524
00:43:59,857 --> 00:44:02,318
The Sungjin Group

525
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,873
will continue to contribute to our economy

526
00:44:06,873 --> 00:44:08,986
so no need to worry.

527
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:31,975
Jae Hee, you did well.

528
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:34,520
It went really well.

529
00:44:35,695 --> 00:44:39,817
Maybe it would be better to get the full story from your mother-in-law.

530
00:44:40,783 --> 00:44:42,964
Good work, Madam Kwon.

531
00:44:42,964 --> 00:44:45,293
Drive safely now.

532
00:44:45,293 --> 00:44:48,714
Yes, I'll contact you later.

533
00:44:49,388 --> 00:44:51,049
Okay.

534
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:06,707
 He's coming out!

535
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,035
They say you volunteered to come in for questioning.

536
00:45:10,035 --> 00:45:12,191
Do you admit to the fraud allegations?

537
00:45:12,191 --> 00:45:15,028
Is it true that the slush funds were used for bribes?

538
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:18,594
Is it true that you lobbied to reduce pressure on Geumsan Logistics?

539
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:21,257
Is it true the secret funds are tied up with the Freedom Revolution Party?

540
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:24,519
Why did you volunteer to meet with the prosecution?

541
00:45:36,175 --> 00:45:38,417
And my eldest daughter-in-law?

542
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:42,092
She's at her mother's home.

543
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:45,691
Call Jae Hee.

544
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:47,469
Yes, ma'am.

545
00:46:25,189 --> 00:46:28,858
We should finalize things today, yes?

546
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:31,448
I don't want to drag this out, either.

547
00:46:32,058 --> 00:46:35,740
Will Joon Hyeok really accept the position?

548
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,769
I doubt he'll be dead set against it.

549
00:46:42,575 --> 00:46:45,509
This inexhaustible confidence of yours…

550
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:48,208
it's a strength and a weakness, you know.

551
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:51,631
Mrs. Kwon really thinks the world of you.

552
00:46:52,715 --> 00:46:54,587
How did you know

553
00:46:54,587 --> 00:46:57,456
that we're working together?

554
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:01,629
Why? Feeling suspicious?

555
00:47:01,629 --> 00:47:04,288
Are you worried about your partner's loyalty?

556
00:47:05,077 --> 00:47:09,290
And here you thought I could never get in anyone else's shoes.

557
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:15,325
But finding out who you're working with is really nothing for me.

558
00:47:15,952 --> 00:47:20,740
It doesn't matter to me whether you two made another deal or not.

559
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:31,966
Joon Il… I watched him go into the Prosecutor's Office.

560
00:47:31,966 --> 00:47:34,177
I'm sorry to hear that.

561
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:38,315
I'm betting with my son for this hand.

562
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:40,667
What are you going to bet?

563
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:45,228
Mother. We're not making a trade.

564
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:48,382
You're in the weaker position here.

565
00:47:48,923 --> 00:47:51,907
The emphasis on prosecutorial reform

566
00:47:51,907 --> 00:47:56,035
has now shifted due to the Sungjin Group investigation.

567
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:02,115
It seems you think Joon Il is my weakness.

568
00:48:02,115 --> 00:48:04,515
What if I decide right now to refuse?

569
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:07,007
What do you walk away with?

570
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:10,404
If you can't even put yourself in my place,

571
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:13,883
how will you support your husband's great ambitions?

572
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:21,011
I stayed up all night doing the homework you gave me.

573
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:23,703
I'm disappointed.

574
00:48:23,703 --> 00:48:27,798
Why did you do all this? Why go through the trouble?

575
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:31,715
You couldn't have acted so recklessly just so your husband

576
00:48:31,715 --> 00:48:34,876
could become Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs.

577
00:48:38,803 --> 00:48:40,958
So what you're hoping for

578
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:43,816
is a five year stay in the Blue House. 
  (T/N: House of the Korean President)

579
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:51,102
- Even though Joon Hyeok isn't my son– 
 - That again.

580
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:54,386
How long will you be milking that?

581
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,433
Listen until the end.

582
00:48:57,433 --> 00:49:00,406
Even if he's not of my blood,

583
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:02,521
I raised him

584
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:06,165
within my walls and with my two hands.

585
00:49:06,165 --> 00:49:09,682
Letting him work for a man like Cho Kang Hyeon?

586
00:49:09,682 --> 00:49:13,301
I would never do that. Never.

587
00:49:17,116 --> 00:49:22,126
Use Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs as a stepping stone for the presidency.

588
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,684
If he becomes president,

589
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:27,923
promise me that you'll let me decide the Corruption Investigations Director.

590
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,795
I'll give you all the help you need.

591
00:49:33,906 --> 00:49:36,912
You're not one to keep promises.

592
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,644
You said if I had a son,

593
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:45,155
you'd give me Sungjin shares…

594
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:49,877
And our son Hyeon Woo is nearly in elementary school.

595
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:54,160
So you're hung up on that, then.

596
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,468
It stung a bit.

597
00:49:56,468 --> 00:50:00,798
I decided that if you wouldn't give it, I'd just have to take it from you.

598
00:50:05,718 --> 00:50:07,579
Come with me.

599
00:51:22,102 --> 00:51:23,863
Go inside.

600
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:06,281
Compiled from long ago…

601
00:52:06,281 --> 00:52:10,402
ledgers of the dirty secrets of Korea's richest and most powerful.

602
00:52:10,402 --> 00:52:14,546
Every single infraction of every great person in the country,

603
00:52:14,546 --> 00:52:18,343
it's all compiled here in this room.

604
00:52:20,623 --> 00:52:24,225
Corruption Investigations are nothing.

605
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:29,219
My father had a saying,

606
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:33,409
"True power resides in those who have given out bribes."

607
00:52:34,377 --> 00:52:38,545
Those who take that money never realize that truth.

608
00:52:38,545 --> 00:52:42,231
They think they're being given that money because they're great.

609
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:45,809
That stupidity,

610
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:49,595
helped Sungjin Group weather its storms

611
00:52:49,595 --> 00:52:53,712
and grow into what it is today.

612
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:57,943
Corruption Investigations Director?

613
00:52:59,086 --> 00:53:03,377
Doesn't mean a thing to me.

614
00:53:03,377 --> 00:53:06,608
I just don't want another fly on the ointment.

615
00:53:08,591 --> 00:53:11,115
I want to allow our leaders

616
00:53:11,115 --> 00:53:14,808
to do their work without having to worry about being investigated.

617
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:19,268
So?

618
00:53:25,841 --> 00:53:31,002
Would this… do something to heal your pain?

619
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:43,460
However, if you fail, it's divorce.

620
00:53:44,205 --> 00:53:46,521
No alimony.

621
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:49,925
You'll leave Hyeon Woo and disappear from our lives.

622
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:53,959
Will you give me your word?

623
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:51,242
Madam Kwon. It's me, Jae Hee.

624
00:54:51,242 --> 00:54:54,500
Did you think I wouldn't know?

625
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,653
Judging by your voice, it sounds you've received something big.

626
00:54:58,653 --> 00:55:01,550
I'd hug you if you were here.

627
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:07,004
But then, you have your husband for that.

628
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:09,475
Sure, sure.

629
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:12,805
Let's throw a big party to celebrate.

630
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:16,231
Let's finally introduce our husbands.

631
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:20,630
Right, yes. Have a great night.

632
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:26,790
It sounds like good news, Unnie.

633
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,873
Shut up!

634
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,015
Are you proud of being a mistress?

635
00:55:33,015 --> 00:55:35,086
Aren't you embarrassed?

636
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:39,209
Do you call yourself a mother? Well?

637
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:40,873
Wandering house to house,

638
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:43,830
have you no sense of decency? You bitch!

639
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:46,934
Unnie, wait! Just a moment.

640
00:55:46,934 --> 00:55:49,264
Forgive me, please. Just this once.

641
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:51,906
I won't do it again, I promise!

642
00:55:51,906 --> 00:55:53,837
Sister!

643
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:24,095
Seon Mi.

644
00:56:24,095 --> 00:56:25,931
Yes, Madam.

645
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:28,973
Get me Cho Kang Hyeon's file.

646
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:35,616
What are the boys up to? It's too quiet.

647
00:56:35,616 --> 00:56:37,907
Hyeon Woo fell asleep right after eating,

648
00:56:37,907 --> 00:56:40,333
and your husband is at his games.

649
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:41,659
Must be loving that.

650
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:43,279
Can I get you dinner, ma'am?

651
00:56:43,286 --> 00:56:46,716
No. Strangely, I'm not hungry.

652
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,457
Oh, hey.

653
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:15,936
Wait, wait, just a second.

654
00:57:15,936 --> 00:57:18,418
Your hair looks great.

655
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,099
That tickles.

656
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:28,880
Be still.

657
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,196
What are you up to? Huh?

658
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:37,085
Oh my.

659
00:57:37,085 --> 00:57:39,192
That tickles.

660
00:58:11,594 --> 00:58:14,163
What a bumpkin,

661
00:58:14,163 --> 00:58:17,174
using this kind of cheap razor…

662
00:58:45,305 --> 00:58:48,341
How dare you!

663
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:51,726
How many more times before you'll learn your lesson?

664
00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:19,922
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

665
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:56,108

666
01:01:07,859 --> 01:01:11,736
Will you be loyal to me?

667
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:15,305
Of course, I will.

668
01:03:20,249 --> 01:03:25,030

669
01:03:43,673 --> 01:03:47,353
 Did she kill herself over a video?

670
01:03:47,353 --> 01:03:49,128
 Dispose of them.

671
01:03:49,128 --> 01:03:51,656
 CrazyBitch2, that's No Young Joo.

672
01:03:51,656 --> 01:03:55,186
 There's no need to use it again.

673
01:03:55,186 --> 01:03:56,879
 Right there.

674
01:03:56,879 --> 01:04:00,397
 Our teacher must be a fan of Jung Joon Hyeok.

675
01:04:00,397 --> 01:04:04,497
 Only VIPs are allowed in there.

676
01:04:04,497 --> 01:04:08,288
 Whatever happens, I'll take care of Jung Joon Hyeok.

677
01:04:09,592 --> 01:04:11,801
 They have an arrest warrant.

678
01:04:11,801 --> 01:04:14,800
 You want more, is that it?

679
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,821
 All of it. Everything you have, Mother.
