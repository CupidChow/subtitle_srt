1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,120

2
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:16,232
 Mr. Jung is here so please call Mrs. Yoon.

3
00:00:16,232 --> 00:00:17,800
 I'll see you tomorrow.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,851
 Okay. See you tomorrow.

5
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:52,690

6
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,359
 We meet again.

7
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,669
 I… thought you had left…

8
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,428
 I didn't want to disappoint you.

9
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:51,357

10
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:58,292

11
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,900

12
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,480
JH...

13
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,707
JH...

14
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,897
J for Joon Hyeok.

15
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,647
How childish.

16
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:49,219
Where is that thing?

17
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:04,629

18
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:10,371
So No Young Joo sued Kwon Min Seon for assault?

19
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:13,423
It was a tricky case because the assailant

20
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:15,591
was the wife of a prosecutor general candidate.

21
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:18,795
The police didn't even look at the case and handed it directly to the prosecution,

22
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:22,136
but all the record has been removed from the database.

23
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,648
How is that even possible?

24
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:27,224
The inspector who handled it was recently promoted

25
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:29,704
to work at the headquarter office.

26
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:32,593
There are some jurisdiction issues right now,

27
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:37,483
and without an official warrant, it could be dangerous to make further comments.

28
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,852
That's all I heard.

29
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,693
Right.

30
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:42,739
I was stupid to even ask.

31
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,788
With power, you can do anything.

32
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:47,597
What are you going to do?

33
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:50,921
Cho Kang Hyeon's keeping an eye on you.

34
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:55,933
He'll soon hear that I'm looking into No Young Joo's case.

35
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:59,608
Ask him what he's going to do.

36
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:02,777
Tell him that I'm going to just sit and watch.

37
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:06,082
And tell him it's a message from me.

38
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:07,660
This will complicate things.

39
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,053
He brought this on himself.

40
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,191
Don't do it, Jae Hee.

41
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:17,400
- I'll just report this to the Audit Department– 
 - Jung Ho...

42
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,093
You should sit this one out.

43
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:30,430
Your family depends on you.

44
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,720
You should think about them,

45
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,376
although that's the reason why I left you.

46
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:42,574
Do you know why my father cared so much about integrity?

47
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:47,854
The responsibility of being the eldest son

48
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,564
and the concern that one wrong move

49
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:55,091
would put the lives of the entire family at risk.

50
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,306
That's why he was so respected.

51
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:01,252
Respect won't feed you.

52
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:05,074
And I ruined that anyway.

53
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:14,184
It's enough that I ruined his life.

54
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:16,299
I will not ruin yours.

55
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:20,571
I'm already sorry for getting you involved

56
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,436
just because I can confide in you.

57
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,841
Although

58
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:33,001
I'm sure you already despise me after what happened with Hyeon Woo.

59
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:36,315
- Jae Hee, that was– 
 - I'll take care of him.

60
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:40,267
I definitely will.

61
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:52,105
I'm getting some Sprite, Miss.

62
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,740
It's not like that.

63
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,933
I freaked out so hard back then.

64
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:07,537
I'm glad that you're okay

65
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:10,380
and that you're here too.

66
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:13,233
I thought you wouldn't contact me.

67
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,489
You said you were a TV reporter.

68
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:18,413
Oh, right. I am.

69
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:22,253
It sure makes my parents proud,

70
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:26,823
but I still have a long way to go.

71
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:32,371
I did some searching and saw your report on Sungjin Group.

72
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,117
Oh, I see.

73
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,796
Well, that wasn't me.

74
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:41,836
I was just sitting there doing nothing. I got lucky and reported under my name.

75
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,473
It was Mr. Jung...

76
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:46,321
Jung Joon Hyeok, the anchor.

77
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:50,802
He's the one that spent the time and put a lot of effort into it.

78
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:53,349
It really was a big one.

79
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,479
Well, we also had to make a sacrifice,

80
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,090
but Mr. Jung really is an amazing guy.

81
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:03,760
I'm really nothing compared to him.

82
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:11,044
By the way, how long have you worked with his wife?

83
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:15,372
I heard that she studied Art in college.

84
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,332
I wanted to treat you to something nice, but…

85
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:23,560
Thank you for the meal.

86
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,780
Oh, it's nothing.

87
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,224
Next time, we can have beef…

88
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:36,926
But a part of me says pork would be better…

89
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:39,173
How about we add chicken and make it three?

90
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:40,765
How does that sound?

91
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:42,031
That's a bit much.

92
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:43,803
It was not entirely your fault.

93
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:45,678
I share the blame.

94
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:49,744
If I made you uncomfortable,

95
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:51,294
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,667
I think you're a nice person.

97
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,347
Oh, well…

98
00:07:58,092 --> 00:07:59,827
But…

99
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:08,804
there's a good person that does bad deeds.

100
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:12,708
Why do you think that is?

101
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:20,274
Well… perhaps, they weren't a nice person in the first place.

102
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:26,472
Then what if a bad person does good deeds?

103
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,512
Maybe they changed?

104
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:34,386
Well they say, "Hate the sin, but not the sinner."

105
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:35,589
I would forgive them.

106
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,694
Whoever that was.

107
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:45,402
What if they're also doing bad deeds?

108
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:48,586
They're giving me a headache.

109
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,386
If the world only sees the good ones,

110
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:56,604
they will only be praised, right?

111
00:08:57,616 --> 00:09:00,047
Well, for the sake of world peace,

112
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:02,111
that shouldn't be.

113
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,417
Thank you for today,

114
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,527
for showing up on such a short notice.

115
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:13,723
That cheered me up.

116
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:18,175
You can contact me any time.

117
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:20,038
And if you have time,

118
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:24,289
we could perhaps finish all three rounds.

119
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,810
All right.

120
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:55,498
 I think we should be clear.

121
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:57,033
 I don't like wasting time.

122
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:10,710
There wasn't. I looked everywhere.

123
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,639
Okay, fine.

124
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,984
Hey.

125
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,294
I don't like the way you're talking.

126
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:22,760
Okay, I'll be careful.

127
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:38,142
 I'm not sure what you're taking about.

128
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:41,016
This girl…

129
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:44,705
 Hello?

130
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:48,243
Are you with Han Dong Min?

131
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:50,036
No.

132
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:54,049
How do you know each other?

133
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,740
Why do you ask?

134
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,260
Well…

135
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,075
What do you think?

136
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:11,567
I don't know.

137
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:17,970
There are a lot of things you don't know that I can teach you.

138
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,679
What do you say?

139
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,724
 What do you say?

140
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:57,913
Before anything...

141
00:12:57,913 --> 00:13:00,902
Yes. What?

142
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:07,950
You should first figure out where you first saw me.

143
00:13:59,962 --> 00:14:04,990

144
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:27,330

145
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:32,682
 How much money does she make anyway?

146
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:37,521
 She wants to abort the baby because of work? What nonsense!

147
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:41,647
 Come out here and explain it to me!

148
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,607
 That was a long time ago.

149
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:46,032
 And it wasn't just because of her work.

150
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:48,635
 She was concerned because she had taken some medicine before she knew–

151
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:51,620
 That's why a woman has to be careful!

152
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,896
 Had it been born,

153
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:56,566
 that child could be filling our lives with joy!

154
00:14:56,566 --> 00:15:00,047
 Why did you have to come to our house and go through our stuff?

155
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:01,941
 She had miscarriages.

156
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:04,341
 Artificial insemination isn't working.

157
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,291
 So I thought I might as well

158
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,439
 give her some herbal medicine. That's why I came.

159
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,527
 Also, why that question?

160
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:13,315
 - I am your father! 
 - Father!

161
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:16,986
 It's…

162
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:22,208
 It's because you keep on acting like this that's why Mother never really appreciates you. You know?

163
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,113
 And she treats me the same way all because of you.

164
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:26,957
 Don't you understand?

165
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,773
 Please leave now.

166
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:32,671
 We have had enough.

167
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:35,117
 This is why exactly you need a son.

168
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:36,673
 There are people

169
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:40,531
 who would always look down on me because of my humble background.

170
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:46,512
 Now I have a successful son, and yours will also be successful.

171
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,318
 And when that becomes a reality, nobody

172
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:54,290
 will ever look down on us again.

173
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,442
 Now, how could she do this to you

174
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:04,120
 and ruin my future plan like this?

175
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,007
 You're not pregnant.

176
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,443
 Should I take a break and try again?

177
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:17,978
 Well… I don't think that's a good idea.

178
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:22,084
 The thing is your hormone levels are always low,

179
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:25,220
 and you've miscarried numerous times.

180
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,140

181
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,180

182
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,196
I heard about what happened at the taylor's.

183
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,726
Well, there are no secrets in this family.

184
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,087
It was nothing.

185
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,530
But see...

186
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,580
Imagine that we had a secret.

187
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:16,532
And is it that Yoo Ri's actually not your child?

188
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:19,240
And I'm hiding it.

189
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,711
Then how do you think your mother would react to that?

190
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:26,584
What's up?

191
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,258
That would be quite a scene.

192
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:35,903
What is the reason for hiding the natural pregnancy?

193
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,190
I'm off to work.

194
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,690
You should be careful, too.

195
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,153
I might also give birth to another man's child.

196
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:08,757
Honey!

197
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,086
Jae Hee!

198
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,343
Honey!

199
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:17,340
She's picking up Hyeon Woo.

200
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,160
Okay.

201
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,773
Hey, Dong Min.

202
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:38,880
What are you up to today?

203
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:07,292
Father, it's me.

204
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:11,313
Have you had breakfast?

205
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:13,820
Of course. Look at the time.

206
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:20,912
- Is Hyeon Woo– 
 - We are taking good care of him.

207
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,649
I don't know why you even have to ask.

208
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:28,273
Father.

209
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:35,840
Good morning, Mother.

210
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:40,770
Hello. Eun Jung just put Hyeon Woo to bed.

211
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,067
They went out to play together earlier,

212
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,980
and he's tired.

213
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,712
I see, Mother.

214
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:05,432
It's the perfect weather and season.

215
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,697
It takes some time to prepare the cloth,

216
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:10,898
but time does all the work really.

217
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:13,873
So it's a simple and honest procedure.

218
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,440
There.

219
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,650
Ten layers of hanji. 
  (T/N: Traditional Korean paper)

220
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:25,820
Then three layers of cloth.

221
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,589
And then you put the meat on top.

222
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:39,048
Make sure to get the hanji from Master Mun in Jeonju.

223
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,865
- That's a must. 
 - Yes, Mother.

224
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:44,755
You have to drain out the blood completely

225
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:49,210
to make the perfect beef jerky.

226
00:21:58,274 --> 00:21:59,638
Tomorrow afternoon,

227
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:03,976
your husband will officially become Senior Secretary of Civil Affairs.

228
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:07,876
They're starting a new cabinet, so he'll get busy right away.

229
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:12,303
Make sure to do some research on

230
00:22:12,303 --> 00:22:14,919
the candidates for Minister of Justice.

231
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,184
I will.

232
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:18,270
And leak some information

233
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,916
to Cho Kang Hyeon on the selection of Minister of Justice.

234
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,232
Let him feel what kind of trouble awaits him.

235
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:29,370
I shouldn't have made him Prosecutor General.

236
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,090
That was my mistake.

237
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,176
Why?

238
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:33,890
Can't you handle him?

239
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,860
- Is that it? 
 - No, it's just…

240
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,600
Never mind.

241
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:47,106
Then why do you say all this?

242
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:50,212
As if you didn't know what kind of person he is.

243
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:52,510
My apologies.

244
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:54,896
Make sure you get some results.

245
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:59,787
After all, you plotted behind my back with Kwon Min Seon to make that happen.

246
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:05,480
Don't just kill the hound dog for acting out and causing trouble.

247
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,520
Wait until it's caught a rabbit. Then, you can kill it.

248
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:15,288
When you have full control over him,

249
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:18,330
you can have him investigate the Minister of Land for corruption.

250
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,340
We need the restriction lifted on the Hyeongsan-dong redevelopment.

251
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:28,710
We will need some funds if Joon Hyeon is to run for president.

252
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,591
 There is no way that Seo Han Sook

253
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:41,620
 will give any money to her stepson for no reason.

254
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:46,078
She must have an ulterior motive as she raises funds for the election.

255
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:48,020
Don't you know anything?

256
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,692
What does that have to do with you?

257
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:54,130
I would just like to know beforehand

258
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,773
what I'll be getting into in the future.

259
00:23:56,773 --> 00:23:58,707
Remember what happened seven years ago?

260
00:23:58,707 --> 00:24:02,306
I don't want to be caught sitting like a duck.

261
00:24:04,747 --> 00:24:08,702
Or you could tell me who's going to be the next Minister of Justice.

262
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:11,568
That's for the president to decide.

263
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,740
If she doesn't like the new one,

264
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,978
she will make up some scandals and get rid of him.

265
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:21,398
If that were true,

266
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:24,223
it will be good news for the people.

267
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:28,300
At least, we won't have a crook as the Justice Minister.

268
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:33,110
I'm sure you don't mean that, do you?

269
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:03,352
Are you going to let me win?

270
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:06,594
I can barely keep up.

271
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,247
Thanks.

272
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:23,139
Aigoo.

273
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:34,174
What's up with you and her?

274
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:35,640
What?

275
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,041
At the art gallery.

276
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,333
There was a minor accident.

277
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:44,810
A one-night-stand?

278
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:48,228
No! Literally an accident.

279
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,387
Fortunately, she didn't get hurt, but I felt sorry.

280
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,361
So I just bought her a meal.

281
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:59,660
I have a lot of bills to cover this month,

282
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,468
so I asked her out for beef next month,

283
00:26:02,468 --> 00:26:04,404
and she said no.

284
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:07,870
Is that it?

285
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,840
Of course.

286
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,078
I meant just a meal, really.

287
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:14,406
- You, dog. 
 - I'm not lying.

288
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,543
Okay. Okay.

289
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:20,412
Just as an apology, no strings attached.

290
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,920
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

291
00:26:40,072 --> 00:26:41,751
Oh, by the way,

292
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:45,846
how does your wife know Cho Kang Hyeon's late wife?

293
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:47,040
Why do you ask?

294
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,080
I met her at his house the other day.

295
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:53,227
I don't know exactly.

296
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:57,050
I just know they knew each other from her past job.

297
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,590
What were you doing at his house anyway?

298
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,071
Investigating No Young Joo's case.

299
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:05,330
Right before his hearing. About that video.

300
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,943
- I thought that was over with. 
 - What are you saying?

301
00:27:07,943 --> 00:27:10,000
There is definitely something fishy behind that case.

302
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,378
Cho Kang Hyeon definitely has someone powerful supporting him.

303
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:18,170
 Oh, Mr. Jung.

304
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:21,910
Long time no see.

305
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:25,631
Nice to see you.

306
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:31,498
- Should I call you Secretary Jung? 
 - No.

307
00:27:31,498 --> 00:27:33,850
Are you really getting that job?

308
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,843
No…

309
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:38,465
It's not for certain.

310
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:41,560
- How have you been? 
 - Good.

311
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:45,116
Oh, you're already here. That way?

312
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:47,362
Oh, it's a bit hot in here.

313
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:50,168
It's that way.

314
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:53,005
Let's go.

315
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:59,732
A course meal for five then.

316
00:28:00,634 --> 00:28:02,210
Why don't you start first?

317
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,384
Yes. I'm hungry.

318
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:07,218
Well… about this meeting,

319
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:11,829
I think you might end up facing corruption charges.

320
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:16,392
Who is this guy?

321
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:19,037
This is why I said we'd eat elsewhere.

322
00:28:19,037 --> 00:28:20,154
Hey, listen.

323
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:22,744
He's a 13th and I'm a 25th graduate.

324
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,918
They're 36th, and 43rd graduates.

325
00:28:25,918 --> 00:28:30,189
We all attended the Judicial Institute.

326
00:28:30,189 --> 00:28:33,629
This is nothing but an alumni gathering over lunch.

327
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,220
What's wrong with that?

328
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:39,590
- Did you study law with Joon Hyeok? 
 - I never studied law.

329
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:41,920
- Same college then? 
 - No.

330
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,960
Then what are you doing here?

331
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,530
Get out.

332
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,430
I'm just joking.

333
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:56,095
Not funny.

334
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:57,740
You…

335
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,777
By the way, I'm impressed, Jung Ho.

336
00:29:00,777 --> 00:29:05,172
You're not even 40, and you work with the Prosecutor General.

337
00:29:05,172 --> 00:29:07,038
They always want new blood

338
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,371
saying, "Oldies are no Goodies."

339
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:14,619
Plus, I have never seen a real prospect like this one.

340
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,748
One time,

341
00:29:18,748 --> 00:29:22,700
I got demoted because somebody went behind my back,

342
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,170
and he was the only one that would help me.

343
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,804
That's why I took him under my wing.

344
00:29:29,804 --> 00:29:32,010
So don't get the wrong idea.

345
00:29:32,714 --> 00:29:36,533
I am merely returning the favor.

346
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:42,959
You were demoted for not properly investigating the Hyeongsan-dong case, right?

347
00:29:46,303 --> 00:29:47,920
That's true.

348
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,893
I think I saw your hearing back then.

349
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:53,670
I was preparing for a job application,

350
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,330
and I was reading every major newspaper.

351
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,747
So I remember everything.

352
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,955
Is that so?

353
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:06,250
That's good then.

354
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,857
JBC has some fine reporters, I see.

355
00:30:10,857 --> 00:30:14,334
I'm sure they'll do just fine even without you, Joon Hyeok.

356
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:15,654
Of course.

357
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:19,190
And it's none of your business, anyway.

358
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,823
Come on. We are just having lunch here.

359
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,794
I will pay my share of the bill.

360
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:29,920
Don't be like that, Reporter Han.

361
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,867
- I'll get this. 
 - No, you don't have to.

362
00:30:31,867 --> 00:30:37,961
You'll have to make sure that bastard knows his place.

363
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,619
If he keeps acting out like that, he'll only give you trouble.

364
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:45,168
I'll talk to him about this.

365
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:48,995
Remember, you should be careful of the company you keep.

366
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:51,520
You have a reputation to keep.

367
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,901
And that also applies to your wife. She has quite some attitude.

368
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,548
That's inconsiderate of you.

369
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:03,160
I don't think it's appropriate to speak of her right now.

370
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,995
Have you lost your mind?

371
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:09,940
I understand she's your ex-girlfriend, but right in front of her husband…

372
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:13,040
- That's not what I– 
 - It's fine, right?

373
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,880
You understand, right?

374
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's get coffee.

375
00:31:37,884 --> 00:31:40,339
- Aren't you Jung Joon Hyeok, the anchor? 
 - I am.

376
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:44,378
- Could I have your autograph? 
 - Sure.

377
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:48,784
- A pen, perhaps? 
 - Oh, what am I doing?

378
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:52,339
Let me borrow your pen.

379
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:54,480
- It's fine. I have one here. 
 - Oh, sure.

380
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,940

381
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:05,160
What's the holdup? Let's go!

382
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:20,410

383
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,497
These girls…

384
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,345
- Jae Seok. 
 - Yes.

385
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:40,470
Her name's Ji Na. Isn't she pretty?

386
00:32:44,207 --> 00:32:47,779
You'll have to be well-prepared for tomorrow.

387
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:50,668
 Do you understand that?

388
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,580
 Yes.

389
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,010
 Gosh.

390
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,140
 What's this?

391
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,590

392
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,083

393
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,660

394
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,590

395
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:57,060

396
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,960

397
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,115
 What?

398
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:16,655
Listen, it looks like the speculations were true.

399
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:20,994
We're doing a big cleanup. They'll have a party after the appointment ceremony.

400
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:24,721
It's crazy. They're going to have hookers here, too.

401
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:26,132
How about male guests?

402
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,170
- Are they all going to be there? 
 - Yes.

403
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,000
All five of them.

404
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,151
We can steal the video, too.

405
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:36,710
But shouldn't we be worried about this?

406
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,798
The Prosecutor General, and now the new Secretary.

407
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:42,780
- These people got all the power. 
 - That's better.

408
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,520
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

409
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:30,900
Why don't we go faster?

410
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,984
What fun is it alone?

411
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:38,208
He could use a little brother.

412
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,391
Stop that.

413
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:42,586
Say goodbye to your grandparents, Hyeon Woo.

414
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:45,824
You should visit us more often.

415
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:48,458
Your grandfather misses you everyday.

416
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:52,166
- I will. 
 - Oh, my dear boy.

417
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,538
Why don't I buy you a cellphone?

418
00:36:55,538 --> 00:36:57,693
- Wow, really? 
 - Yes.

419
00:36:57,693 --> 00:37:03,755
That way, whenever you miss me, we can talk or even video call!

420
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,230
Mommy, can I have a phone?

421
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,633
You don't have to ask Mommy.

422
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:12,907
We agreed that you will get a phone when you start school, didn't we?

423
00:37:12,907 --> 00:37:14,070
Yeah.

424
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,440
Grandpa.

425
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,363
You can buy me a phone when I'm in school.

426
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,994
Okay.

427
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:27,899
You should get going then.

428
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:34,236
- Hyeon Woo! 
 - Daddy!

429
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:38,268
Aren't you supposed to be busy with everything going on?

430
00:37:38,268 --> 00:37:41,011
I'm just dropping by on the way home.

431
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,751
What a sweet dad you are.

432
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:49,018
I think Hyeon Woo's looking more and more like his mother as he grows up.

433
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:51,282
Oh, the way you talk…

434
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:55,161
Are you being jealous again?

435
00:37:55,161 --> 00:37:57,182
You must be disappointed.

436
00:37:57,182 --> 00:37:58,736
It's good that he's like her.

437
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:01,408
She has got guts, brains, and looks.

438
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:02,450
Do you think so?

439
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,350
Well, that's a good way to look at it.

440
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:12,308
Now, get going. Don't mind those words.

441
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:15,025
- Bye, Hyeon Woo. 
 - We're going.

442
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:16,660
Bye!

443
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:25,867
I wonder why she said that.

444
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:28,356
I think Hyeon Woo looks just like Joon Hyeok.

445
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:32,631
Don't mind that. She's just jealous because she doesn't have a son.

446
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:35,966
Dad, why would you say that in front of your daughter?

447
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:38,760
You should first be thinking about getting married.

448
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,556
Stop wasting time writing TV show scripts.

449
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:45,732
We'll not until I've succeeded.

450
00:38:45,732 --> 00:38:47,825
Don't you agree, Mom?

451
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:52,300
You do what you want. Don't ask me.

452
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:07,093
Why are you so cold to Eun Jung?

453
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:10,307
I have always been. It's no surprise.

454
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,637
And why are you so nice to Jae Hee these days?

455
00:39:12,637 --> 00:39:14,890
She's your daughter-in-law.

456
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:19,579
If I treat her nicely, shouldn't you be glad?

457
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:25,949
We've lived together for 43 years.

458
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:30,140
I told you not to hide your intentions behind questions like this, didn't I?

459
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,685
You always side with her, and that's making me look bad.

460
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:38,350
From now on, you should be honest like this.

461
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:44,665
You should talk to her about giving Hyeon Woo a little brother.

462
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:50,735
Stop making any arguments and prepare for the Hyeongsan-dong project.

463
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:56,155
You should return to work and stop pretending to be a stone engraver.

464
00:39:56,897 --> 00:40:00,720
What? Hyeongsan-dong redevelopment?

465
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,590
I thought the remaining land was under restriction because of that accident.

466
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,429
It will be lifted soon.

467
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:19,990
Don't you ever talk back to me in front of Jung Joon Hyeok.

468
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,889
I won't do that.

469
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:26,060
And tell Yoon Jae Hee

470
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,280
that if she crosses the line,

471
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,730
she'll suffer a huge blow.

472
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,976
Yes.

473
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:37,963
And as for you,

474
00:40:37,963 --> 00:40:40,826
you act out on behalf of your ex-girlfriend,

475
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,246
and I've been turning a blind eye.

476
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:45,810
But I won't tolerate that anymore.

477
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,373
Do you understand that? Jung Ho.

478
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:50,770
Yes.

479
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,402
Welcome home!

480
00:41:07,402 --> 00:41:10,628
Home sweet home!

481
00:41:10,628 --> 00:41:13,273
Have you had dinner?

482
00:41:13,273 --> 00:41:15,268
I have.

483
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:19,414
 I will come to visit you next morning.

484
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:21,920
What the!

485
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,900

486
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,630
 Please call me when you're available.

487
00:41:41,054 --> 00:41:44,070
- Now, here goes one! 
 - Splash!

488
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,853
Here goes another one!

489
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,230
What's up Daddy?

490
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:29,313
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - I saw your email.

491
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:32,003
You could have just called me.

492
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:36,220
I just… felt like I shouldn't.

493
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,549
Do I make you uncomfortable?

494
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:42,030
No. It's just me.

495
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:45,470
I have a predicament…

496
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:50,503
 You've given me such a good opportunity.

497
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:53,581
 And you're always nice to me.

498
00:42:53,581 --> 00:42:56,213
I'm thankful for everything.

499
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,280
But sometimes I think that I can't always be thankful.

500
00:43:04,413 --> 00:43:09,607
 I was just worried you might think of me as an ingrate.

501
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:13,161
 And I just don't know what to do.

502
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:17,624
Everybody has predicaments like that.

503
00:43:17,624 --> 00:43:19,534
I do, too.

504
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:23,355
When you don't know what to do…

505
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,575
In the face of something you can't handle,

506
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:30,311
you don't try anything

507
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:34,107
 and just think it's not your fault.

508
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:36,817
 And you look for excuses

509
00:43:38,437 --> 00:43:41,997
 saying it was inevitable.

510
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:45,190
 And you're also blaming yourself at the same time.

511
00:43:46,237 --> 00:43:50,257
 But then you wish you had somebody who truly understands you.

512
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:54,721
 Right.

513
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:57,251
 That's how I feel right now.

514
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:02,910
I'm not sure what this is about, but don't beat yourself too hard.

515
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:05,198
 You don't have to, at least with me.

516
00:44:05,198 --> 00:44:08,409
 And I won't, either.

517
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:11,518
 Mommy, I'm done with the bath!

518
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:14,472
Understood? I'll see you tomorrow then.

519
00:44:14,472 --> 00:44:17,185
- I'll see you tomorrow. 
 -  Get back here, Hyeon Woo.

520
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,007
 Come back here. Now, let's put on some lotion.

521
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,381

522
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,987

523
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:17,831
Now, all that's left

524
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:20,924
is for Jae Hee to put a leash on Cho Kang Hyeon

525
00:45:20,924 --> 00:45:23,490
and make him obey.

526
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:08,093
I didn't think you'd invite Prosecutor Park Jung Ho here.

527
00:46:08,193 --> 00:46:11,700
I understand you're quite close

528
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,068
so I didn't think it would be a problem.

529
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:20,182
You're making me regret making you Prosecutor General.

530
00:46:20,182 --> 00:46:21,920
Hey.

531
00:46:24,296 --> 00:46:27,271
Didn't you give her my message

532
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:29,754
to not cross the line anymore?

533
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:33,319
I shouldn't have

534
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,771
taken care of that sex video scandal for you.

535
00:46:36,771 --> 00:46:40,383
You used me in order to garner Chairwoman Seo Han Sook's

536
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,242
support for your husband to run for president.

537
00:46:43,312 --> 00:46:47,219
Wasn't that payment enough?

538
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:49,667
Exactly.

539
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,337
I already have everything I need.

540
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:59,011
But you still haven't been promised the directorship of the CIO, have you?

541
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:04,669
You should have told me what you wanted

542
00:47:04,672 --> 00:47:07,160
instead of stabbing me in the back.

543
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,278
Your childishness caused

544
00:47:09,283 --> 00:47:11,637
many people discomfort.

545
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:20,535
If I wanted, I could have the investigation

546
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:23,680
into No Young Joo's death reopened.

547
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:28,999
So I urge you to cooperate and try not to get in my way.

548
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:45,820
Shit!

549
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:49,770
Hey!

550
00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:01,480
Shit!

551
00:48:59,115 --> 00:49:02,871
- Hello, dear. 
 - What's the occasion?

552
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:05,317
Did I interrupt your lunchtime?

553
00:49:05,326 --> 00:49:07,044
Not really.

554
00:49:09,628 --> 00:49:13,390
I heard you liked the black bean noodles here.

555
00:49:13,402 --> 00:49:18,525
I heard you still haven't forgotten how they tasted

556
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:20,309
when your mother brought you here

557
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:25,370
to celebrate your entrance into elementary school.

558
00:49:25,398 --> 00:49:27,800
That's what Secretary Go said.

559
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:43,614
Enjoy.

560
00:50:08,765 --> 00:50:12,851
Everyone at home is excited because they're announcing

561
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:14,867
Joon Hyeok's appointment today.

562
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:17,050
My parents must be elated.

563
00:50:17,794 --> 00:50:19,868
Are you all right?

564
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,196
Haven't you ever been jealous of Joon Hyeok?

565
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:25,866
He's your brother in name only.

566
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:29,152
So you ought to be jealous.

567
00:50:42,653 --> 00:50:44,340
In any case,

568
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,350
I don't want you to feel like Joon Hyeok is better off than you.

569
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,791
Let's rekindle our flame and go back to when we were newlyweds.

570
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:55,412
We should make love again.

571
00:50:55,412 --> 00:50:57,389
I know it won't be easy,

572
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:59,430
but let's also have a son.

573
00:51:11,287 --> 00:51:13,470
We can't have a son.

574
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:17,140
Please.

575
00:51:19,512 --> 00:51:21,950
How can you say, "Please?"

576
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,094
Like you're asking for a favor.

577
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:32,160
Who'd listen to a favor like that?

578
00:52:04,256 --> 00:52:06,325
 I'm not sure what this is about,

579
00:52:06,325 --> 00:52:08,990
 but don't beat yourself too hard.

580
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,279
 You don't have to, at least with me.

581
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:13,735
 And I won't either.

582
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:25,422

583
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:36,756
Joo Yeon.

584
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:40,652
Are you just returning home?

585
00:52:40,652 --> 00:52:42,895
Do you have to ask something so obvious?

586
00:52:42,895 --> 00:52:45,888
We are not close enough for small talk.

587
00:52:45,888 --> 00:52:47,580
We are still family.

588
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:51,049
I was hoping you would congratulate me.

589
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:53,703
Congratulate you?

590
00:52:55,867 --> 00:52:58,346
I do feel sorry for you.

591
00:52:58,346 --> 00:53:00,878
You were running around making coffee

592
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:03,186
for well-to-do ladies at the gallery.

593
00:53:03,186 --> 00:53:06,813
You must have gone through so much to get to where you are.

594
00:53:06,813 --> 00:53:08,702
I'm proud of you.

595
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:11,586
Good work. Happy?

596
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,600
It's going to take some time.

597
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,868
I know it isn't easy,

598
00:53:18,868 --> 00:53:21,393
but try not to be so upset.

599
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:04,379
Oh my. You're here!

600
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:06,742
Senior Secretary of Civil Affairs!

601
00:54:11,593 --> 00:54:15,490
Both parties are always looking for talented people.

602
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:19,273
Joon Hyeok has been appointed Senior Secretary of Civil Affairs.

603
00:54:19,273 --> 00:54:21,264
But if you want to win the presidential election,

604
00:54:21,264 --> 00:54:24,847
you'll have to be especially nice to Joon Hyeok.

605
00:54:24,847 --> 00:54:30,286
Joon Hyeok hasn't entirely committed to your party.

606
00:54:30,286 --> 00:54:32,041
Of course. Of course.

607
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:35,981
We can't lose such a talented man to the other party.

608
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,880
We're counting on you, Secretary Jung.

609
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,631
Please stop. You're embarrassing me.

610
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:45,350
We'll support you the best we can.

611
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:50,790
Secretary Jung, please use your superb talent to help us.

612
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,658
 Congratulations on your appointment. Here's a gift.

613
00:55:02,658 --> 00:55:04,345

614
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:17,759
 You'd better check if that Hyeon Woo is really your son.

615
00:55:36,172 --> 00:55:37,840
Honey.

616
00:55:58,551 --> 00:56:01,060
What is it?

617
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,400
Why? What's the reason?

618
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:14,114
Oh well. I understand.

619
00:56:14,114 --> 00:56:15,678
All right.

620
00:56:15,678 --> 00:56:18,780
Call me if anything else happens.

621
00:56:24,137 --> 00:56:28,128
Oh my. We have a situation.

622
00:56:55,105 --> 00:56:58,277
They said that they'd announce the appointment later,

623
00:56:58,277 --> 00:57:01,388
so why don't you rest for a few days?

624
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:41,364
It's strange that they haven't called back for a week.

625
00:57:41,364 --> 00:57:45,790
Just because one of the demonstrators got hurt.

626
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:49,220
It is unprecedented.

627
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,995
Everyone is trying to find out what happened

628
00:57:51,995 --> 00:57:55,123
so we'll know soon enough.

629
00:57:59,999 --> 00:58:03,561
Why? Are you suspicious of me?

630
00:58:04,632 --> 00:58:06,950
I can't say I'm not.

631
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:11,075
I'm suspicious of you.

632
00:58:11,075 --> 00:58:15,933
We'll suspect each other until we find out who's really behind this.

633
00:58:19,364 --> 00:58:21,722
How is Joon Hyeok faring?

634
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,570

635
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:44,534
Pil Sung!

636
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:46,567
I heard Joon Hyeok won't get to be Senior Secretary of Civil Affairs.

637
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:49,430
I ought to punch you!

638
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:53,152
He just asked me to help him get a DNA test

639
00:58:53,152 --> 00:58:55,992
so I thought he might be returning to the news.

640
00:58:55,992 --> 00:59:00,104
Joon Hyeok used to ask me for such favors when he worked at the station.

641
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:03,605
Let me see what he sent you.

642
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:06,984
What? I just sent the sample out.

643
00:59:52,385 --> 00:59:55,195
Why did you call me all the way here?

644
00:59:57,979 --> 00:59:59,570
Sit down.

645
01:00:24,698 --> 01:00:26,430
Is Hyeon Woo

646
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:31,330
really my son?

647
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:12,339

648
01:01:14,793 --> 01:01:16,440
No.

649
01:01:18,889 --> 01:01:20,690
He's not.

650
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:48,844

651
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:05,830

652
01:02:07,771 --> 01:02:09,475
 Please help!

653
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,860
 Help me this once, Mother!

654
01:02:10,923 --> 01:02:14,862
 We've found the person who leaked the video.

655
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:18,761
 You must know about the person who lived with No Young Joo.

656
01:02:18,761 --> 01:02:21,555
 It's because you're so like me.

657
01:02:21,555 --> 01:02:26,196
 I hoped that someone would help me and protect me.

658
01:02:26,196 --> 01:02:30,973
 There must be something we can use to destroy Yoon Jae Hee.

659
01:02:30,973 --> 01:02:33,658
 I sold the Jung Joon Hyeok video.

660
01:02:33,658 --> 01:02:36,768
 Do you think such a thing would even make me blink?

661
01:02:36,768 --> 01:02:39,714
 I'm going to make you President.

662
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,430
 And I'm going to be there by your side.
