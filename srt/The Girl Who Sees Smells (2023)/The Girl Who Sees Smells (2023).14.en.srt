00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,220
Hello?

5
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I was in a meeting.

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,140
So I didn't check my phone.

7
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,940
It's nothing.

8
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,500
So you just missed me.

9
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,050
But I still have a week before I can go back.

10
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,340
I know.

11
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,140
Wait for you.

12
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,340

The batch of wine that Fenfen is responsible for?

16
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,130
Yes.

17
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,579
When I saw the news,

18
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,040
I called the hotel at once.

19
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,210
We've verified it.

20
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,540
Why didn't anyone tell me

21
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,500
when such an important thing had happened?

22
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,630
It's a little weird.

23
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,430
Is there any hidden reason?

24
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,660
Book the earliest flight for me.

25
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,780
Why are you back?

26
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,700
Don't you have a couple of days before coming back?

27
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,360
Are you hungry? I'll make you something for you.

28
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,220
I knew what happened to the lounge.

29
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,820
I forgot to tell you.

30
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,019
It was my fault.

31
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,810
I chose the supplier.

32
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,620
I picked the wine.

33
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,140
I'm just an idiot.

34
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,500
I should have listened to you

35
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,360
and continued to use the previous supplier.

36
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,120
Has the company started investigating?

37
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,220
I'm suspended.

38
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,260
I don't have to go to work now.

39
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,460
I went to that lounge,

40
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,220
but no one was there.

41
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,810
I think I was scammed.

42
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,460
It's okay.

43

you will be fine.

Do you think I'm an idiot?

46
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,660
And a hopeless one?

47
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,340

48

How is it going?

51
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,740
According to the Chairwoman's order,

52
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,900
we have settled with bulk customers

53
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,580
and been compensating the retailers.

54
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,180
The patients admitted to the hospital have no major problems.

55
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,220
The company has already sent someone to visit them immediately.

56
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,880
What we need to worry about now

57
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,140
is this.

58
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,740
Behind Anda Fake Wine, the hotel operation is not good.

59
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,580
The leading enterprise sells disqualifying wine at the best quality prices.

60
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,930
This is still the result despite the fact that

61
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,860
the PR department tried hard to eliminate the effct.

62
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,350
This matter is not that simple.

63
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,460
There must be someone behind it.

64
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,160
What worries me is that

65
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,060
Xu Song will make a big deal out of it

66
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,820
in the board meeting.

67
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,340
It's too late to think about it now.

68
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,660
Did the PR department come up with a plan?

69
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,740

70
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,670
waiting for you.

71
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,620
CEO, you knew the situation.

72
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,260
It's gone viral on the internet now.

73
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,820
We can only contact them privately and ask them to delete the posts

74
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,280
to control the situation.

75
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,210
This is already in progress.

When the heat is down,

77

we'll sue the leading lemming accounts

78
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,380
to send a message to the other media outlets.

79
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,540
Also, prepare a press release

80
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,090
to post online.

81
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:03,780
Okay.

82
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,180
So far,

83
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,140
how many media outlest have reported this?

84
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,380
About 15.

85
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,380
But among these 15,

86
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
there is only one outlet aimed at us.

87
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,100
At the beginning of this matter,

88
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,830
they also had very timely news.

89
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,930
After that, many media outlets

90
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,100
forwarded their reports along with this outlet.

91
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,180
One.

92
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,140
That's all for today's meeting.

93
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Please work hard.

95
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,040
You think something is wrong too?

96
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,540
Something is fishy.

97
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,180
I think someone in the company is working with outsiders.

98
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,940
Fenfen is a young girl after all.

99
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,870
She's immature.

100
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,750
I failed to protect her.

101
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,580
The five-star hotel's lounge dared sell seconds at best quality prices

102
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,220
and sell adulterated wine to customers.

103
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,020
How can a company like this

104
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,140
have the nerve to declare

105
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,600
they make top-level wine?

110

after he drank their wine.

111
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,200
If you ask me, I think this hotel should be shut down.

112
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,230
I don't understand.

113
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,300
Does the purchasing department of the lounge have no money

114
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,340
or what?

115
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,670

I should've listened to Mingcheng.

118

It's all my fault.

119
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,740
If I hadn't been a smart alec,

120
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,740
this wouldn't have happened.

121

we would only kick Lu Fenfen out?

124

Why is the group involved now?

125
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,140

the CEO's management ability.

127
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,790
What are you talking about?

128
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,780
How do I not understand?

129
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,540
You did it on purpose.

130
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,110
You don't care about Lu Fenfen.

131
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,200
What you really want is to go against the CEO.

132
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
To be precise,

133
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,740
it should be "us".

134
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,530
I didn't.

135
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,740
I just want

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,140
to get rid of Lu Fenfen.

137
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,010
I never thought

138
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,070
to get the CEO and the group involved.

139
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,660
Really?

140
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,400
Then why did you come to me?

141
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,420
You should go to Xu Mingchen

142
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,140
and snitch on him.

143
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,980
See if he believes it.

144
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm not the one who hates Lu Fenfen.

145
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,060
Don't drink too much.

146
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,900
Eat more, okay?

147
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,500
They are all you like to eat.

148
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,560
Come on. Have some.

149
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,940
Are you blaming me too?

150
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,500
You blame me too!

151
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,140
I know it's my fault.

152
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,250
But I regret it too.

153
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,180
Mingchen.

154
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,300
You can't blame me for this.

155
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,940
You really can't blame me.

156
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,580
Alright. I don't blame you.

157
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,790
I know it wasn't your fault.

158
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,900
All right.

159
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,340
Enough. Stop drinking.

160
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,740
You've drunk a lot.

161

When will the day come to an end

162
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,440
that there is one disaster after another

163
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,420
with internal and external troubles?

164
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,510
Enough. Stop drinking.

165
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
You're good at idioms after drinking.

166
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,560
Alright, let me take you home.

167
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,300
My purse.

168
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,460
Alright, let's go.

169
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,530
Alright, let's go.

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,300
Anyone?

173
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,350
Switch. I really can't carry her anymore.

174
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,940
She's drunk. Why didn't you call us?

175
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
Be careful.

176
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,580
It slips out of my mind.

177
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,210
Hurry up. Go check on them.

178
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,620
Mingchen, I'm sorry.

179
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,500
It's okay. The most important thing is that you're fine.

180
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,300
I'm telling you,

181
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,140
I always have bad luck.

182
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,140
I was unlucky all alone before.

183
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,610
But now I give my bad luck to you.

184
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,730
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,300
You shouldn't have met me.

186
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,620
No, don't say sorry to me.

187
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,420
You saved my life.

188
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,740
I should be the one apologizing.

189
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,540
Mingchen.

190
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,740
Stop talking.

191
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,020
Look how uncomfortable she is.

192
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,220
Take good care of her.

193
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,580
Look.

194
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,180
She is going to throw up.

195
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,610
Take care of her. We're leaving.

196
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,140
Let's go.

197
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,080
I'll leave your purse here.

198
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,810
Mingchen is so nice to Fenfen.

199
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,370
I can be as good as Xu Mingchen.

200
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,100
By the way,

201
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,740
what did Xu Mingchen want to say just now?

202
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,200
What does he mean by saying he should apologize?

203
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,220
What did he do?

204
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,930
And

205
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,260
why did you cut him off just now?

206
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,380
No, no.

207
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,310
You're nervous.

208
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,900
Why should I be nervous?

209
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,830
I'm not nervous.

210
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,980
You must have secrets.

211
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,310
Absolutely not.

212
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,060
Xu Mingchen just...

213
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,420
He just exaggerated.

214
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,470
He was grateful to Fenfen for saving his life.

215
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,420
After all, compared to saving his life,

216
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,100
this is nothing, right?

217
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,940
Right. Xu Mingchen is a good man.

218
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,260
He's quite nostalgic.

219
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,820
Right?

220
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,020
It's getting late.

221
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,340
You had a long day too.

222
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,580
Let me send you home.

225
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,180
What were you going to do last night?

226
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
I really can't

227
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,060
just stand here and see Fenfen feel so guilty.

228
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,980
It was me who did...

229
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,500
Stop.

230
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,640
Mingchen, listen.

231
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,100
It's already a mess now.

232
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,230
Don't make it worse.

233
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,260
I'm just afraid you'll be impulsive,

234
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,520
so I came to remind you.

235
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,500
Mr Xu, we have a clue.

236
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,380
Hello.

237
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,380
This is the head of our Anda Group,

CEO Xu Mingchen.

239
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,460
I apologize on behalf of the hotel.

240
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,020
I'm sorry for the bad experience.

241
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,470
We will cover all your expenses

242
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,510
during your hospitalization.

243
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,380
Thank you.

244
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,820
This is what we should do.

245
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,260
I heard you almost faint

246
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,640
when your condition was at its worst.

247
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,780
I didn't expect

248
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
I would nearly die

249
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,060
for drinking adulterated wine.

250
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,540
But the report didn't say that.

251
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,660
You are very healthy.

252
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,500
Since you were hospitalized,

253
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,420
you have gone through a full medical check-up.

254
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
Nothing unusual.

255
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,700
What do you mean?

256
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,450
Are you saying that I pretend to be sick?

257
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,860
I didn't say that.

258
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,500
Unfortunately, the report is scientifically based.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Don't be nervous. I'm not aiming at you.

But if you're willing to do me a favor,

265

I'll be very grateful.

Mr. Xu, I didn't mean to do it.

I never meant to hurt you.

You know it.

274
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,720
I've always had feelings for you.

275

I've been following you.

I know I don't deserve you.

277

But I think

278
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,840
Lu Fenfen is more unworthy of you.

279
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,060
I'm worried that you'll be bewitched by her.

280
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,060
I think there's some misunderstanding.

281
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,300
I've always regarded you as my best subordinate.

282
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,700
I thought you were smart.

Yes, he has been trying to win me over.

291
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,660
But I didn't agree.

292
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,310
Until the matter with Pear in Wine,

293
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,200
Lu Fenfen got promoted because of it.

294
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,270
She's on the same level with me.

I'm afraid...

296
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,420
I'm afraid she'll surpass me on the career front too.

297
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,980
So I...

298
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,140
Do you have evidence?

299
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,430
Yes, I recorded the conversation.

What are you going to do?

301
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,420
Make everything public.

302
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,280
We have tolerated him enough.

303
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,830
I'll take care of this.

304
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,150
The recording can't be used as evidence in court.

305
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,840
I want him to quit the company.

306
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,310
It's time for him to retire.

307
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,830
What about Bai Bing?

308
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,540
She will pay for what she did.

309
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,580
You know she likes you.

310
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,830
Her love is too much.

311
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,540
I know you like Fenfen.

312
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,460
You can't tolerate anyone or anything

313
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,520
that hurts Fenfen.

314
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,590
Just leave some leeway.

315
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,580
I have watched Bai Bing grow up.

316
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,740
Her family is poor.

317
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,550
It's inevitable that she's a bit extreme.

318
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,300
She has been following you since she joined the company.

319
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,820
She's been working hard for all these years.

320
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,900
She's just totally possessed.

321
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,390
She will be over if you fire her.

322
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,800
How about this?

323
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,980
We let her retain the job but suspended her salary.

324
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,580
You can fire her after this.

325
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,700
Give her some time

326
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,940
to find another job.

327
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,110
Qingran. You decide.

328
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,350
Chairwoman.

329
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,460
What brings you here?

330
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,340
Everyone in the company is busy as hell.

331
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,760
You seem to have a lot of time to spare.

332
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,180
Yes, you're the boos. You're busy.

333
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,980
I can never be as busy as you.

334
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,500
You know

335
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,210
why I'm busy.

336
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,100
I watched the news all day.

337
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,300
The media nowadays is really interesting.

338
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,490
After patients were admitted,

339
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,690
they went in to do the follow-up report hot on their heels.

340
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,630
They are so fast that I admire them.

341
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,760
Do you think so?

342
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:05,990
Really?

343
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,550
The paparazzi nowadays...

344
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,990
There is another thing more interesting.

345
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,220
The propagandizing-for-pay accounts don't even change the title of articles.

346
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,740
They all have the same focus and photos.

347
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,780
What a coincidence.

348
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,500
It's such a big deal.

349
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,460
We can't even control it.

350
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,620
Spill it, Mr. Xu.

351
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,940
Chairwoman, what do you want me to say?

352
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,220
Good dinner is worth the wait.

353
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,860
Since it's a surprise,

354
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,140
we should make it more grand.

355
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,850
Xu Song,

356
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,350
Mingchen and I treat you as family.

357
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,720
We put up with you for everything.

358
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,020
Do you want me to give this to the cops,

359
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,950
or do you want to leave on your own?

360
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,100
We're on the same boat.

361
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,580
The group's image is damaged,

362
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,620
so your reputation won't be any better either.

363
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,980
Chairwoman, what is this?

364
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,340
Where did you get this?

365
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,300
Do you even believe that?

366
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,180
This must be a frame-up.

367
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,950
This recording is fake.

368
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,160
You won't admit it?

369
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,820
I'm also a shareholder in the group.

370
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,460
Why would I do this?

371
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,660
Mr. Xu, where did you get the confidence?

372
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,780
Is it from your little trick?

373
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,660
Uncle Ding told me

374
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,320
someone is looking for an acquisitor

375
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,230
while the group is in a scandal.

376
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,380
Xu Mingchen, you are so lucky.

377
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,460
Those women

378
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,980
are so devoted to you.

379
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,340
As the saying goes,

380
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,030
a just cause attracts much support, and an unjust one finds little.

381
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,060
Mr. Xu Song.

382
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,260
On behalf of the board, I officially inform you

383
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,790
that you've been expelled by Anda.

384
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,860
You'll no longer be involved in anything in the group.

385
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,100
Wait for the dividends at home.

386
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,080
Qingran, let's go.

387
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,730
Nana.

388
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,180
Thanks to you and your father this time.

389
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,060
Thank you.

390
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,020
Qingran, you're welcome.

391
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,780
Your business and Mingchen's business

392
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,710
are my business.

393
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,340
I'll visit Uncle in person next time.

394
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,180
Okay.

395
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,470
Let's go.

396
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,670
You're back.

397
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,340
What's going on?

398
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,580
Do we have something to celebrate?

399
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,530
We caught the culprit

400
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,340
and solved the group's crisis. Does it count?

401
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,820
Really?

402
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,780
I promised you I'd solve it.

403
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,700
Amazing. How did you solve it?

404
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,260
I really have to thank Nana this time.

405
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,300
If it weren't for her and her family,

406
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,830
it would have been a big problem.

407
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,160
I'll return this favor.

408
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,980
Don't feel too burdened.

409
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,460
But the truth

410
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,210
is not yet convenient to disclose.

411
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,820
You may have to take the blame

412
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,620
and be demoted.

413
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,060
It's okay.

414
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,980
I was framed

415
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,510
because I was careless.

416
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,010
You were very careful.

417
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,760
I asked An Wensi to check

418
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,560
the background of the supplier.

419
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,860
Before the adulterated wine incident,

420
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,320
they had a good reputation

421
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,870
and a clean background.

422
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,720
It's understandable that

423
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,860
you chose them.

424
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,010
Really?

425
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,820
Yes, let alone you.

426
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,060
I'm afraid

427
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,350
I would have walked into this trap too.

428
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,360
Are you sure you're not saying this just to make me feel better?

429
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,590
That's good.

Yes.

I have to take this.

478
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,540
Hello.

479
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,990
An intimate photo of you and Miss Lu

480
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,170
has gone viral on Weibo.

481
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:17,940
Qiao Yi.

482
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,050
Check Weibo.

483
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,660
No, don't do it.

484
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,180
Just go home.

485
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,180
What?

486
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,340
I didn't expect Lu Fenfen to be so scheming.

487
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,100
Otherwise, how would she land on CEO Xu?

488
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,660
Compared to her, we are too naive.

489
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,130
Keep your voice down.

490
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,390
If CEO Xu hears you, you will be doomed.

491
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,010
[Are all bedphotos like this?]

492
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,580
Please remember

493
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,660
that no matter what it takes,

494
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,240
what we need now is to divert the focus

495
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,540
and sincerely apologize.

496
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,820
Be quick.

497
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,280
Within two hours,

498
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,460
be sure to send me a press release

499
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,520
and a statement about this incident.

500
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,150
Chairwoman, CEO Xu is not back yet.

501
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,880
Go find him.

502
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,720
Okay, boss.

503
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,060
Hello, Mr. Xu.

504
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,660
Fenfen, you don't have to go up there.

505
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,250
Okay.

506
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,880
Let's meet after you're done.

507
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,430
I'll wait for you, no matter how late it is.

508
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,590
Chairwoman,

509
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,320
the statement is here.

510
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,040
Please have a look.

511
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,870
Chairwomen.

512
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,130
[Company Statement]

513
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Ask the technical department for help.

514
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,100
Make a statement.

515
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,780
This photo has been photoshopped to a certain extent.

516
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,300
Also, I want you to emphasize in the statement

517
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,420
the rumors outside are not true.

518
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,300
If necessary,

519
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,670
we can hint that it's the girl who released the photos voluntarily.

520
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,460
Divert the focus on her.

521
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,220
Okay.

522
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,260
HR.

523
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,580
Draft a dismissal statement and send it to Lu Fenfen.

524
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,140
Come with me.

525
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,670
Qingran, Fenfen is also a victim.

526
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,060
At this point,

527
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,780
I will do anything for the group's interest

528
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,780
at all costs.

529
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,740
Such a secret photo.

530
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,290
Who else could it be?

531
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,460
No.

532
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,860
As for the wine incident,

533
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,420
I can believe that she is immature

534
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,280
and being used.

535
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,760
But in this matter,

536
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,100
I can't think of anyone

537
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,340
but her.

538
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,900
No. She is not that kind of person.

539
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,370
Do you still trust her that much?

540
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,180
Fenfen loves you so much.

541
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,100
She's doing this on purpose.

542
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,900
She must be upset about the wine incident.

543
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,560
She feels threatened by Nana.

544
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,220
Qingran, you're overthinking. Fenfen...

545
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,100
You don't understand women,

546
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,810
especially women in love.

547
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,980
Look at Bai Bing.

548
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,380
She is so decent

549
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,700
and hardworking.

550
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,700
It's all because she was jealous of Fenfen

551
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,380
and made a mistake.

552
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,500
Then why can't Fenfen

553
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,050
take risks and tell the world you're together

554
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,820
because she is jealous of Nana?

555
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,690
She is your real girlfriend.

556
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,260
Qingran, she, and Bai Bing are different..

557
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,500
She's kind.

558
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,540
Then tell me,

559
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,830
what is with this photo?

560
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,140
Have you seen this photo before?

561
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,320
She took it without telling you?

562
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,500
She sent it to me once.

563
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,340
That means

564
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,750
this photo was indeed taken by Fenfen.

565
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,160
You've seen it too.

566
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,860
Such a private photo.

567
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,830
She will only send it to you.

568
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,860
If it's not you, it must be her.

569
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,940
Qingran, I don't deny your inference.

570
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,780
But we may not know something yet.

571
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,260
Then you tell me what it is.

572
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,740
I think I treat her well.

573
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,580
But she went too far.

574
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,250
She's a disgrace.

575
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,270
Qingran, please stop blaming Fenfen.

576
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,150
Give me some time.

577
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,670
I will find out

578
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,060
the whole story.

579
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,960
And please stop blaming Fenfen.

580
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,170
[Ding Nana]

581
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Hello, Nana.

582
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,540
Qingran, don't worry.

583
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,860
I'll ask Dad for help.

584
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,650
Don't worry.

585
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,960
Nana, thank you.

586
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,190
Sorry for the trouble.

587
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,250
Don't mention it.

588
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,020
In my heart, we are a family.

589
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,550
We owe the Ding family another favor.
