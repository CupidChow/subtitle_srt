176
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,580
♫Hearing your heartbeat♫

177
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,190
♫I'm caught unprepared♫

178
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:24,390
♫It is fate that I care about you♫

179
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,500
Will you marry me?

180
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,300
♫Intertwined or paralleled♫

181
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,430
♫I notice your news on purpose♫

♫You're everywhere♫

183

♫How should I organize my words♫

184
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,780
Sorry, Fenfen.

185
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,020
I still don't have the courage to tell you everything.

186
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,020
♫To express how I feel about you?♫

187
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,620
I just hope

188
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,180
if you know the truth one day,

189
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,500
don't blame me.

190

Xu Mingchen.

200
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,740
What's so good about that Lu Fenfen

201
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,070
that you must marry her?

202
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,650
[Bai Bing]

203
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,890
Hello?

204
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,860
Hey, Yijiang.

205
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,580
What's wrong?

206
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,220
I think I'm a loser.

207
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,220
Why is Lu Fenfen?

208
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,150
Bai Bing, where are you?

209
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
I'll come for you.

210
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,900
I'm drinking at the bar.

211
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,330
Hello? Bai Bing? Bai Bing?

212
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,060
Hello, pretty girl.

213
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,960
Who are you?

214
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,960
Fate brought us together.

215
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,150
Have a drink?

216
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,620
Come on. Drink with me.

217
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,740
Let me go!

218
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,100
You have a hot temper. I like it.

219
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,160
Come on. I'll drink with you. Come on.

220
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,590
Don't Leave!

221
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,180
Don't leave. Sit down.

222
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,300
Come on. Drink with me. Come on.

223
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,140
Let me go!

224
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,260
Sit here.

225
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,700
Drink with me.

226
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,380
Let go of her!

227
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,960
Who are you?

228
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,520
I'm her boyfriend.

229
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,740
Listen.

230
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,230
If you dare move, I'll call the police!

231
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,060
Boyfriend?

232
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,580
Move!

233
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,300
Let's go!

234
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,270
I'll get you some water.

235
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,140
Do you like me?

236
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:17,940
Bai Bing.

237
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,800
Even you refuse me.

238
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,420
Bai Bing, look carefully.

239
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,340
It's me, Jian Yijiang,

240
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,660
not Xu Mingchen.

241
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,750
Sorry, Bai Bing.

242
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,740
I offended you.

243
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,819
You should leave.

244
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,300
I want to be alone.

245
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:12,900
Okay.

246
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,180
Call me if you need.

247
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,950
Why are you smiling so happily?

248
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,980
No.

249
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,900
When I think of you rejecting me,

250
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,620
I'm still sad.

251
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,860
I told you

252
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,650
men should be the ones to propose.

253
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,620
Are you a male chauvinist?

254
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,620
No.

255
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,140
Fine, it's my fault.

256
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,500
I chose the wrong time.

257
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,180
He Le told me everything.

258
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,220
At that time,

259
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,620
it was in the key phase of your negotiation with Ding's Group.

260
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,740
If the engagement is leaked,

261
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,960
it will affect your cooperation.

262
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,460
But you did it for me anyway.

263
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,260
No, you are the most important.

264
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,900
Yijiang!

265
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,620
I'm so smart.

266
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,940
If I hadn't been smart,

267
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,930
Lu Fenfen would definitely have grilled him

268
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,540
about the failed proposal.

269
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,910
Why do I feel you're a little abnormal?

270
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,580
Looks like you've broken up.

271
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,210
Impossible!

272
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,060
You're devoted to scientific research.

273
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,920
You're not interested in dating.

274
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,020
Don't you need to go home to be with your wife?

275
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,580
Yes.

276
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,780
I just feel suffocated.

277
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,660
So I came out for some fresh air,

278
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,100
and show off to you.

279
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,500
Actually, I'm so scared.

280
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,780
Qiao Yi values Fenfen.

281
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,700
If she finds out I lied to her,

282
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,900
I'll be doomed.

283
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,150
You're really abnormal today!

284
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,070
Are you having a physiological cycle?

285
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,120
How is it? Is that tree beautiful?

286
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,020
It has been there since I was little.

287
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,460
And that basketball court.

288
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,780
Let me show you inside.

289
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,760
Cheers.

290
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,340
Here.

291
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,140
Try the braised prawns Sister made.

292
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,180
Thank you. Thank you, Sister.

293
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,110
You're welcome.

294
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,460
Sister, thank you

295
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,860
for your cooking.

296
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,380
It's just a meal. Forget it.

297
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,420
Not just a meal.

298
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,820
Thank you for everything you've done

299
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
for me and our family.

300
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,100
It's my pleasure.

301
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,190
You're welcome.

302
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,840
I hope you two will be fine.

303
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,830
About you and Mingchen,

304
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
I've known.

305
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,260
Indeed,

306
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,420
you are not the ideal one

307
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,620
as my sister-in-law.

308
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,780
But Mingchen likes you very much.

309
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,840
You are hard-working and excellent.

310
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,260
So,

311
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,980
welcome.

312
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,240
I wish you all the best.

313
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,360
Thank you, Sister.

314
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,650
It's so unreal.

315
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,260
It feels like a dream.

316
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,030
Has it come true?

317
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,230
What if someone sees us?

318
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,620
What are you afraid of?

319
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,150
You are my fiancée, anyway.

320
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,780
You really...

321
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,980
What? You don't like it?

322
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,900
I do.

323
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,220
But I didn't expect

324
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,300
you would tell others in this way.

325
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,350
Neither did I expect the attitude of Qingran.

326
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,740
My sister is a bit picky,

327
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,040
but she still wants us to be happy.

328
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,780
And Phillip.

329
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,940
Are there any misunderstandings between you two?

330
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,740
Don't worry.

331
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,740
I'm trying to solve his problem.

332
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,460
Good.

333
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,940
This is just

334
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,100
a sister-in-law who shows concern for her brother-in-law.

335
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,860
Really?

336
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,630
Why are you here?

337
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,730
Tianran.

338
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,300
I'm here to tell you

339
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,940
that Sister didn't abandon you.

340
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,940
You get her wrong.

341
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,120
I get her wrong?

342
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,900
You told me I got her wrong?

343
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,700
Sister would never abandon you.

344
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,540
You mean I remembered wrongly?

345
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,330
We were very young back then.

346
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,260
Memories and truth may not be the same.

347
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,270
If you don't believe me,

348
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,240
you can ask him.

349
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,940
Who is he?

350
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,040
He's the traffic police who saved us.

351
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,550
His contact information is behind it.

352
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,500
Did you call me?

353
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,150
Nice to meet you.

354
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,550
Sorry, I'm late.

355
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,100
It's okay.

356
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,060
I'm sorry

357
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,620
for calling you

358
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,500
to ask you out.

359
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,540
It's okay.

360
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,500
You said on the phone that

361
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,380
you wanted to learn about the car accident, right?

362
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,740
I still remember the accident

363
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,180
clearly.

364
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,420
Because the accident was very serious.

365
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,100
I remember when we went there,

366
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,180
the two people who sat in the driver's seat and passenger seat were both dead.

367
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,100
Dad.

368
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,340
Dad.

369
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,060
Dad.

370
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,580
Dad!

371
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,100
Mom!

372
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,660
Mom!

373
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,770
Dad! Dad!

374
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,260
Dad! Mom!

375
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,540
I remember when we arrived,

376
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,940
the car was almost on fire.

377
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,500
Because the gas was leaking.

378
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,060
The big boy in the back seat.

379
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,580
Mingchen!

380
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,770
It was your elder brother.

381
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,380
He was badly injured.

382
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,580
Then your sister pulled him out.

383
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,660
After that,

384
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,620
I stopped her

385
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,300
when she came back to pull you out.

386
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,060
Someone is trying to save him!

387
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,700
My brother is still in the car!

388
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,660
We're saving him! Don't worry!

389
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,010
My brother is in the car!

390
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,660
Don't worry!

391
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,580
We're saving him! Don't worry!

392
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,620
Please! Please!

393
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,380
Okay. Okay. Okay.

394
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,460
-Its gas was leaking. -Please! Please!

395
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,420
There could be on fire anytime.

396
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,020
Are you sure she went back to save me?

397
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,690
Of course.

398
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,460
Look. She bit me.

399
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,160
I tried my best to stop her.

400
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,220
Otherwise, she would have gone in.

401
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,350
She was injured too.

402
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,860
She insisted on going in.

403
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,460
But we couldn't let her in.

404
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,180
Our people were saving you.

405
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,420
Tianran! Tianran!

406
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,780
Please! Please!

407
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,500
Tianran!

408
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,980
That's the whole story.

409
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,660
So, my elder brother was worse injured

410
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,580
than me?

411
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,950
Much worse than you.

412
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,100
I was scared to death.

413
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,370
I thought Xu Mingchen and Lu Fenfen would break up.

414
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,960
Fortunately, it's a perfect ending.

415
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,250
It is all in your mind.

416
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,590
Xu Mingchen can't live without Lu Fenfen.

417
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,460
That's right. Xu Mingchen really loves Lu Fenfen.

418
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,980
Why is he so fond of her?

419
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,980
Here, have one.

420
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,500
Is it really

421
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,140
because of a kiss?

422
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,100
I didn't react that vehemently.

423
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,300
Why are you?

424
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,460
Nothing.

425
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,620
Something's wrong with you.

426
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,860
You're weird.

427
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,540
What's wrong with the kiss?

428
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,060
No.

429
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,240
What could be wrong with that?

430
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,700
Lu Fenfen

431
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,420
is Xu Mingchen's love at first sight.

432
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,950
He thinks she's beautiful and kind-hearted.

433
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,400
Your eyes are rolling.

434
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,840
Still rolling.

435
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,020
What?

436
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,680
I know you are hiding something from me when your eyes are rolling.

437
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,900
How dare I, Leader?

438
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,460
I knew it. When Lu Fenfen was proposed that day,

439
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,750
you told me it was something about Ding's interests.

440
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,100
I thought you were hiding something.

441
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
What you said seemed like an excuse.

442
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,740
It is all in your mind.

443
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,230
I'm warning you.

444
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,210
Tell me if you're hiding something from me.

445
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,140
If I find out,

446
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,330
you know the consequences.

447
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,940
I know.

448
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,180
I'll never see my child again.

449
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,630
Say it or not?

450
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,300
Tianran, the score is 8 to 8 now.

451
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,940
But I have the ball.

452
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,860
I'll beat you if I shoot at the basket one more time.

453
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,990
Your airplane model will then be mine.

454
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,270
Why are you here?

455
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,910
I came to see you.

456
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,540
Me?

457
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,560
I'll appreciate it if you won't annoy me.

458
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,980
I bought you a gift.

459
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,230
I don't know if it suits you.

460
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,300
See if you like this type.

461
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,220
Here. Let me help you.

462
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,970
I met the traffic police.

463
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,620
Ming Chen told you about it?

464
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,300
I told him not to be big-mouthed.

465
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Stand up and walk.

466
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,980
See if you like them.

467
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,980
I didn't handle

468
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,560
what happened back then well.

469
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,540
But I had no other better way.

470
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,380
I know.

471
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,260
In this world,

472
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,240
there are too many things beyond our capabilities.

473
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,770
I was very young back then.

474
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,540
And I didn't know how to be an elder sister.

475
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,040
I'm the one who should apologize.

476
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,900
Brother is right.

477
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,860
I've never been mature.

478
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,150
I've been throwing a tantrum.

479
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,780
I've misunderstood you for so long.

480
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,050
I'm sorry, Sister.

481
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,180
You're suddenly being polite.

482
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,700
I'm not used to it.

483
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,420
All these years, you've shouldered too much for this family.

484
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,060
Thank you for troubling Brother's illness

485
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,630
as well as the group.

486
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,020
Forget it. It's not easy for you these years.

487
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,710
Since we've made it clear,

488
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,620
I don't have to stay in China.

489
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,580
Are you leaving?

490
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,900
I booked a flight back to France.

491
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,500
Have a safe journey.

492
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,800
Lu Fenfen's saliva can relieve Xu Mingchen's illness?

493
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,260
Am I the last one to know?

494
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,770
No.

495
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,260
Even the person involved, Lu Fenfen, doesn't know about it.

496
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,300
Ridiculous!

497
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,360
Hush.

498
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,420
After all this,

499
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,220
Xu Mingchen pursued her just for this?

500
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,260
Isn't he a rogue?

501
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,100
Leader.

502
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,460
I beg you.

503
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,840
Don't say it to her.

504
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,510
Don't grab my phone.

505
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,620
I'm warning you!

506
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,340
Hello, Qiao Yi.

507
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:34,540
Hello, Fenfen.

508
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,139
I have something to tell you.

509
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,750
You'll take wedding photos tomorrow?

510
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,570
Yes, what do you want to tell me?

511
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:43,980
Nothing.

512
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,659
I have something to tell you about work.

513
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,540
I'm fine now.

514
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,580
Go ahead.

515
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:07,550
[Fenfen]

516
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,340
What are you doing so early in the morning?

517
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,470
It's all your fault!

518
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,540
I lied to Fenfen because of you.

519
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,220
You

520
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,820
are the culprit

521
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,700
who ruined our friendship!

522
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,300
How can you blame me?

523
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,020
Well... It's not your fault.

524
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,300
It's all because of this lie.

525
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,820
There's no chance to turn back once we lied.

526
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,820
It's Xu Mingchen's fault!

527
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,660
Anyway, I feel guilty now.

528
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,250
She trusts me completely.

529
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,100
If I hide it from her,

530
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,340
she will break off with me

531
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,740
when she finds out!

532
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,620
Don't worry.

533
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,020
Fenfen is not that petty.

534
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,260
It's not about that.

535
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,180
Is what we did

536
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,010
really good to her?

537
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,820
How do you think Mingchen treats Fenfen?

538
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,060
In all fairness, he's nice to her.

539
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,980
Then it's over.

540
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,400
As long as there's a good outcome,

541
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,860
it won't affect their happiness.

542
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,990
If you tell her everything,

543
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,980
Fenfen will be sad,

544
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,340
and Mingchen can't live.

545
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,000
Then everything will be over.

546
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,360
Leader.

547
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,140
Everyone has a different perspective.

548
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,940
The result and happiness they want are different.

549
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,540
After all,

550
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,820
as long as Mingchen treats Fenfen well,

551
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,950
and Fenfen is happy,

552
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,560
nothing else matters.

553
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,340
What are you talking about?

554
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,400
Who treats me well?

555
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,440
We're talking about Mingchen being nice to you.

556
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,050
He's always nice to me.

557
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,740
You two are so alike.

558
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,500
Get in the car.

559
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,340
Coming.

560
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,420
Who asked you to pull the curtains?

561
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,460
Jian Yijiang, can't I be happier?

562
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,480
Don't be discouraged.

563
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,040
Maybe after you let go of Mingchen

564
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,400
and everything...

565
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,860
Enough.

566
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,860
I don't want to hear this anymore.
