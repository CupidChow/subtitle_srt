4
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,460
100 years passed.

5
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,060
A prince walked into an ancient palace.

6
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,539
The princess was sleeping soundly.

7
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,259
She was so beautiful.

8
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,380
The prince stared at her for a long time.

9
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,740
He didn't even blink.

10
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,580
At last,

11
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,940
the prince bent down and kissed the princess.

12
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,860
Because of this kiss,

13
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,180
the princess woke up.

14
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,740
But wait.

15
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,420
The prince didn't get her permission in advance.

16
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,460
Would she feel offended?

17
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,860
Does the one being saved have to love the savior?

18
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,940
Is this moral blackmail?

19
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,060
Does every fairy tale

20
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,260
have a hidden dark side?

21
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,260
You're awake.

22
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,260
Don't move.

23
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,950
How do you feel? Do you want some water?

24
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,700
Come closer.

25
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
Why is he so excited?

26
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,500
I see.

27
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,460
This is his face

28
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,980
after a narrow escape.

29
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,900
He is thrilled

30
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,620
to see the person

31
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,570
who has brought him back to life

32
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,020
Sorry.

33
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,820
If you're going to pop the question,

34
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,180
I'll say no.

35
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,530
Because I already have...

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,340
I want...

37
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,100
Don't feel indebted.

38
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,540
You don't have to thank me.

39
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,700
I just saw you in danger and gave you a hand.

40
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,420
You're lucky that you survived.

41
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,500
It's no big deal.

42
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,420
Because even if

43
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,740
you were just a stray cat or a stray dog,

44
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,670
I wouldn't have let you die either.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,850
Are you crazy?

46
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,440
I'll beat you up even if you're a patient.

47
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,180
Listen.

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,829
This is sexual harassment.

49
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,100
I can sue you for it.

50
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,980
I need to make a deal with you.

51

I need your kisses.

Not just once.

Your condition is not stable now.

71
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,670
You should avoid appearing in the public.

72
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,900
It's been six months

73

how will you explain things to everyone?

He found a way to be young again.

That will cause a stir in the science world.

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,610
What should we do then?

176
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,210
Take off your clothes.

177
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,110
Fenfen.

178
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,280
You did a great job.

179
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,090
Thank you for the compliment.

180
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,530
Where's that accent from?

181
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,330
It's weird.

182
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,850
Can she speak French?

183
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,760
You haven't even been abroad, have you?

184
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,160
You did pass

185
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,750
the blind tasting test.

186
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,480
But you don't meet

187
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,070
the degree requirements for this position.

188
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,230
And you have never studied abroad.

189
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,760
As your friend, I want to help you.

190
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,040
But there's nothing much I can do.

191
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,040
It's true that I've never gone abroad

192
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,130
and can't speak French.

193
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,820
But I'm passionate about wine,

194
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,610
and it's my dream

195
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,500
to become a Master of Wine.

196
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,820
That's just your dream.

197
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,810
Sorry that we have to disqualify you.

198
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,170
I can monitor

199
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,500
your vitals through it.

200
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,720

Bai Bing is right.

219

You've never gone abroad

220
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,510
or learned French.

221
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,170
But you can't give up.

222
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,150
You'll make it eventually.

223
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,550
You'll become the best Master of Wine.

236
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,560
What's going on?

237
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,920
Mingchen!

238
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,030
Help!

239
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,140
No.

240
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,770
Are you dead?

241
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,470
Listen, you can't die here.

242
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,990
If you died here, I'd be a top suspect.

243
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,040
I'm so young.

I haven't become a Master of Wine yet.

245
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,430
I must save him.

246
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,780
You're awake?

247
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,930
Are you okay?

248
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,620
Are you okay?

249
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,020
Let me take you to the hospital.

251

Yes. I don't know who he is.

252
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,770
I don't know why he fainted.

253
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,200
I don't know why I saved him.

254
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,510
I know nothing.

255
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,900
It just happened.

256
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,200
I need to make a deal with you.

257
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,370
I need your kisses.

258
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,460
What?

259
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,960
I need to kiss you.

260
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,730
Not just once.

261
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,790
I need to kiss you

262
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,710
every day in the future.

263
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,910
Lunatic.

264
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,480
You won't do it for nothing.

265
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,740
We can sign a contract.

266
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,790
I can give you anything you want.

267
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,520

268
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,820
Yes.

269
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,920
Name your asking price.

270
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,050
Who is this man

271
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,270
kissing me the first time we met?

272
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,390
Mingchen, you should stay in bed.

273
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,300
Lie down.

274
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,700
I'm fine.

275
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,080
I feel very good now.

276
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,590
It's like I just took a hot shower

277

after a workout.

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,630
I'm full of energy.

279
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,220
But you fainted just now.

280
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,910
How is this possible?

281
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,000
Mingchen.

282
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,350
Be honest with me.

283
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,150
What did you do and who did you meet

284
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,920
after we left?

285
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,710
Don't miss any details.

There are only four cases in the world.

Unfortunately,

304

Mingchen is the lucky dog

305

who has this rare disease.

306

Mingchen entered the fourth stage of this disease.

He started growing younger more quickly.

312

Mingchen is 31 years old now,

but his bone age test

314

says he's only 19 years old.

315

In less than ten months,

316

he grew ten years younger.

And this change is accelerating.

318
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,750
It will be too much for his heart to handle

319
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,830
and he will faint frequently.

320

is that girl my cure?

What do you think?

327
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,170
I think maybe she somehow is.

Really?

329
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,830
The first time, in the bathroom,

330
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,510
I vaguely remember her giving me mouth-to-mouth.

331
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,720
I felt like a drowning man

332
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,580
who suddenly breathed in the fresh air.

333
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,940
The second time, in the ward,

334
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,880
to confirm my guess,

335
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,930
I kissed her again.

336
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,380
It's something I've never felt before.

337
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,300
I felt that I completely recovered.

338
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,270
Like right as rain?

339
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,950
I've read all your physical data.

for the first time after you were diagnosed.

342
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,920
I have a theory.

343
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,660
What is it?

344
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,140
I guess the girl's kiss,

345
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,270
I mean, her saliva,

346
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,250
contains a certain kind of enzyme.

347
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,010
This enzyme

348
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,820
can target

349
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,540
the defective genes

350
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,350
in Mingchen's body

351
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,730
and restore the balance

352
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,620
of his growth hormones.

353
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,940
Mingchen.

354
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,830
I have an idea.

355
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,500
Maybe my kiss has the same effect.

356
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,720
That's disgusting.

357
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,020
I'm serious.

358
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,290
Every enzyme triggers a unique chemical reaction.

359
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,760
That girl's existence

360
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,490
is already a highly unlikely thing.

361
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,020
I don't believe there's another one like her.

362
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,990
OK. At least we have her. Right?

363
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,730
I think it's a miracle.

364
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
I never believe in miracles.

365
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,720
It's more likely to be a coincidence.

366
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,850
During this year,

367
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,160
Yijiang and I went to more than ten countries

368
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,310
and consulted experts at home and abroad.

369
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,360
No one can help me.

370
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,330
If I really have to die,

371
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,110
I'll go to a quiet place

372
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,320
to wait for that day to come.

373
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,680
That day won't come.

374
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,380
Mingchen, as your best friend

375
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,560
and a doctor,

376
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,670
I won't give up on you.

377
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,720
Don't worry.

378
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,510
There are still many things I want to do.

379
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,240
Yes. We can't give up.

380
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,760
That girl.

381
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,720
I don't care if she's a miracle or a coincidence.

382
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,520
I'll find her.

383
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,910
You'll kiss her hard

384
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,960
in front of us.

385
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,210
Then everything will be clear.

386
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,190
He Le is right.

387
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,100
That's the most efficient way.

388
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,250
We should find her.

389
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,400
If her kiss really works…

390
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,800
If her kiss really works,

391
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,320
I'll make her stay for you.

392
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,220
I'll go look for her now.

393
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,620
Actually, I'm more interested

394
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,940
in the handsome guy who kissed you.

395
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,450
Give me some details.

396
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,590
Did he kiss you with his eyes open

397
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,520
or closed?

398
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,370
Don't mention it.

399
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,630
I was startled.

400
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,840
I was so mad and regretted helping him.

401
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm the farmer who saved the snake

402
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,510
in that fable.

403
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,280
I kindly saved him but what did I get?

404
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,490
I got bitten!

405
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,960
Will Jiannan blame me if he finds out?

406
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,690
He has no right to do that.

407
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,830
You did it to save someone's life.

408
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,930
That kept man is not in a position

409
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,260
to point fingers at you.

410
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,050
He's spent three years taking exams to be a civil servant.

411
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,940
He's basically relying on you for everything.

412
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,240
Only a fool like you

413
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,040
would still be with him.

414
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,070
Alright. Have some snacks.

415
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,730
Let's change the subject.

416
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,370
Before I came here,

417
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,190
I was really worried about you.

418
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,730
Are you okay?

419
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,870
Don't worry. I'm fine.

420
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,190
Has the news spread in the hotel?

421
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,130
No.

422
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,730
It was suppressed in time.

423
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,060
Few people knew that you fainted.

424
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,730
It's so bad that I happened

425
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,940
to be busy with recruitment

426
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,820
and couldn't be there with you.

427
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,170
To develop the hotel,

428
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,700
we need new blood.

429
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,260
I sent you to the hotel

430
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,620
to prevent my uncle from playing tricks.

431
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,990
Rest assured.

432
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,420
I'm where I am today thanks to the Xu family.

433
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,760
I'll do my best.

434
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,110
You're a mature woman now.

435
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,340
You got everything you have today

436
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,600
through hard work.

437
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,300
Your efforts haven't gone unnoticed.

438
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,890
It's getting late. You should go.

439
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,200
Okay.

440
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,270
[Two for one for all sparkling wines under 200 yuan]

441
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,800
Welcome.

442
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,770
Would you like to have a taste of the wine?

443
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,950
You can try it for free.

444
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,370
No, thanks.

445
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,030
No, thanks.

446
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,470
[Has the exam result come out? Don't worry. Whether it's good or not, we'll get it through together.]

447
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,400
[Say something.]

448
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,630
Did he fail again?

449
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,700
Hello, sir.

450
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,170
How can I help you?

451
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,150
Which is the most expensive wine here?

452
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,320
My fiancee deserves the best of everything.

453
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,820
Is it for your proposal?

454
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,670
Since that's the case,

455
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,470
I recommend this one to you.

456
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,300
How much is it?

457
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,300
It's usually 899 yuan per bottle.

458
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,600
But since you're going to propose,

459
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,240
I won't take a percentage of this deal.

460
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,090
I wish you a successful proposal.

461
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,230
Okay. It's a deal.

462
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,990
I'll go back and see how many bottles we need.

463
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,210
I'll come to you the day after tomorrow.

464
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:14,970
No problem.

465
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,100
Lu Fenfen.

466
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,260
That's not the most expensive wine here.

467
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,490
Leader, here is the thing.

468
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,250
Although proposing

469
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,910
is a very important thing,

470
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,390
it's not necessary to spend the salary

471
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,320
of a whole month on a bottle of wine.

472
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,170
Expensive wine doesn't suit everybody.

473
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,680
You're too kind.

474
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,940
Good point.

475
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,090
Give me the most expensive wine here.

476
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,930
I'm rich.

477
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,660
Sir.

478
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,800
Penfolds Grange Bin 95.

479
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,850
5,288 yuan.

480
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,080
This is the most expensive wine here.

481
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,880
Are you sure you want it, sir?

482
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,890
Yeah.

483
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,660
I'll pay by card.

484
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,260
Okay, sir.

485
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,870
May I ask

486
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,130
if you're single?

487
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,700
Why did you ask that?
