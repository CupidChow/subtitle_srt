Nana!

00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,690
Qingran!

7
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,940
It's been so many years.

8
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,860
Welcome back.

9
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,900
Nana.

10
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,740
Uncle Song, why are you here?

11
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,570
We are really looking forward with impatient anticipation,

12
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,970
and you're finally here.

13
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,700
Yes. Rumors have it

14
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,350
that our group and Ding's Group always didn't see eye to eye.

15
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,020
There is indeed competition between us in business.

16
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,860
But Mingchen and I

17
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,100
and Mr. Ding are close in private.

18
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,100
We need to take a further step

19
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,260
to strengthen the cooperation between our groups

20
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,260
and strive for win-win outcomes in the future.

21
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,579
Then we should unite through marriage.

22
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,220
It's been so many years.

23
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,780
I have to treat you to dinner.

24
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,980
Tell your dad.

25
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,140
You've decided to

26
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,140
hold your return party at our hotel.

27
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,340
I've got everything arranged for you.

28
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,470
Thank you. Qingran!

29
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,820
Let's go.

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,030
This way.

31
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,980
So this is the big move that Xu Mingchen mentioned.

32
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,660
Has Qiao Yi left?

33
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,960
Will she come back?

34
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,380
I don't think so.

35
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,630
That's good.

36
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,660
Look, I made breakfast.

37
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,980
Eggs, bread, and milk.

38
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,820
Which one do you want?

39
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,180
I want to have something else first.

40
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,220
Why are you so wicked?

41
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,300

Hello, Qingran.

45
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,260
Throw a party for Ding Nana?

46
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,860
Okay, I got it.

47
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,060
Okay.

48
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,180
Who is Ding Nana?

49
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,420
Ding Nana.

50
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,060
She was my childhood friend.

51
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,460
Just like a sister to me.

52
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,380
Sister?

53
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,260
Brothers and sisters.

54
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,700
There are so many members in your family.

55
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,500
The one-child policy didn't apply to your family?

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,460
No wonder the hotel told us

57
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,780
to work overtime for the welcome party.

58
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,620
Since you're close,

59
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,780
I have to get ready.

60
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,960
I can't leave a bad impression

61
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,390
in front of your family.

62
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,140
Wait.

00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,900
You've been in a relationship with Lu Fenfen

65
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,060
for a while.

66
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,590
You've never thought about living together?

67
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
It's still early.

68
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,060
Lu Fenfen lives with Qiao Yi.

69

Don't you ever feel inconvenient

70
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
when you come to her house?

71
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,420
Why does it sound like

72
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,740
you want to pursue Qiao Yi

73
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,670
and find it inconvenient for their living together?

74
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,660

You're a genius.

76

You can even tell by

77
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,190
how subtly I said it.

78
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,380
Is it hard?

79
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,220
Besides, you didn't want to hide it.

80
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,780
Are you used to living here?

81

I've lived here for so long.

82
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,640
Of course, I'm used to this place.

83

Have you ever thought about moving out?

84

Moving out?

85
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,260
You have a cheaper place?

86

Forget it. No more chat.

let me send you back after dinner?

Please forgive me.

after a more than 10-hour flight.

113
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,580
I'm being thoughtless

by asking you to have a dinner with us.

115
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,270
Then how about you go back and rest today?

Then why are you still standing here?

I'm sure it didn't go well.

No way.

My dear.

137
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,620
Could it be that his syndrome

138
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,300
would affect some of his functions?

139
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,340
Lu Fenfen.

140

I really admire you sometimes.

At this point,

142
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,260
you can still remain calm

143
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,580
and come to work

144
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,910
like nothing happened.

145
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,220
What happened?

146
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,780
You don't know anything, do you?

147
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,740
What are you talking about?

148
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,660
Aren't you Mingchen's girlfriend?

149
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,500
Didn't he tell you

150
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,060
who we were going to welcome

151
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,640
with such a grand gesture?

152
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,980
He told me. It's Ding Nana.

153
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,800
How can you be so calm after knowing this?

154
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,140
Do you know who Ding Nana is?

155
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,890
He told me about it too. She's his sister.

156
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,220
Did he tell you

157
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,460
Ding Nana is his childhood friend

158
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,060
and his confidant?

159
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,050
Did he tell you

160
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,130
how much Xu Qingran adores her?

161
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,540
Only Ding Nana dares talk back to her.

162
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,180
Even Mingchen can't do it.

163
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,860
What's wrong?

164
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,900
Do you know the Chairwoman well?

165
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,900
You know everything

166
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,870
about what she likes and dislikes?

167
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,500
I just want to remind you.

168
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,580
Everyone in our hotel

169
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,100
knows about it

170
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,580
except you.

171
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,820
By the way,

172
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,700
Ding Nana came back this time

173
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,640
to get engaged with Mingchen.

174
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,660

yet you're still counting money for the one who sold you?

181
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,820
How pitiful.

182
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,100
A friendly reminder.

183
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,940
Cutting your losses now is better than being abandoned later.

Mingchen, to be honest,

185
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,380
why don't you ask Yijiang to prescribe some medicine for you?

186
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,740
I really can't help you with this, even if I want to.

187
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,180
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

188

What medicine?

189
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,020
Can you

Mingchen, you didn't come and pick me up.

201

Didn't Qingran come to pick you up?

202

Qingran likes lively events.

she's going to welcome some returning stars.

You know it.

I don't like crowded places since childhood.

207
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,060
I'll feel dizzy.

Of course I am.

Maybe she's too tired.

Try it.

297

299
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,950

Yes!

using roasted duck tongue to go with rose wine?

306
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,770
It's a perfect pair.

307
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:22,819
Open it!

308
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,829
That's what I've been waiting for.

309
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,230
I've never seen this wine abroad.

310
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,260
It smells great.

311
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,430
The balance of sourness is also good.

312
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,030
It's as good as those famous wines.

313
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,330
Right? I think so too.

314
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,050
Although

315
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,810
I've never drunk much famous wine,

316
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,420
in China

317
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,180
there are so many delicious wines at a fair price.

318
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,040
Just many people don't know them.

319
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,670
For wine,

320
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,220
a good concept is very important.

321
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,070
Yes, we think alike.

322
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,480
And I'm actually very optimistic about

323
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,300
the market potential of rose wine in China.

324
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,740
Can you tell me more about it?

325
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,490
Rose wine

326
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,520
doesn't have as many limitations as red wine.

327
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,320
It can pair with any dish.

328
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,830
So this kind of wine

329
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,890
is more suitable for Chinese tastes.

330
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,330
And if possible,

331
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,880
I hope...

332
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,060
Hope what?

333
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,250
I hope I can make my own wine.

334
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,510
Young female clients like us

335
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,400
will be the special target.

336
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,580
So you aim at rose wine?

337
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,420
Yes.

338
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,460
But I know it's unrealistic.

339
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,520
I don't think so.

340
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,410
I totally agree with you.

341
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,850
I just came back from France.

342
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,860
I also want to do something

343
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,390
in the wine market in China.

344
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,190
You studied in France?

345
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,170
Then you are a professional.

346
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,750
In my opinion, you are also professional.

347
00:18:52,230 --> 00:19:02,900
[Let Bygones Be Bygones]

348
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,650
Promise me.

349
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,160
If you find

350
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,220
another rose wine that tastes better than this,

351
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,020
you must tell me to try it first.

352
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,540
You have to promise me.

353
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,650
Even your boyfriend

354
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,120
can't try it before me.

355
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,210
What's wrong?

356
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,810
Did you have a fight with your boyfriend?

357
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,330
No.

358
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,550
I just don't have much confidence

359
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,680
in our relationship.

360
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,910
Why?

361
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,490
Because we are not from the same world.

362
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,410
Not from the same world?

363
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,770
Then what is he?

364
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,370
Is he a time traveler, an alien,

365
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,720
or a ghost?

366
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,460
Not funny?

367
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,910
I mean.

368
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,120
It's nonsense

369
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,120
about "not from the same world."

370
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,640
Men are like our careers.

371
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,920
If you want it, you have to fight for it.

372
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,460
Do you have a man

373
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,240
for whom you want to fight?

374
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,270
Yes.

375
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,260
I just don't know how he feels about me.

376
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,070
But I believe

377
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,900
as long as I set a goal,

378
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,640
I can get it.

379
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,610
I also believe that,

380
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,880
as long as you strike,

381
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,660
no one in the world can resist you.

382
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,400
Here.

383
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,590
I wish you...

384
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,930
Wish me what?

385
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,230
I wish you have a good career and a good man.

386
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,170
Let's work hard together.

387
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:56,920
OK.

388
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,910
Qingran.

389
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,090
How is Mingchen doing

390
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,670
in China these years?

391
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,750
Pretty good.

392
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,700
But when I called him last time,

393
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,040
he didn't show much enthusiasm for me.

394
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,370
Nana.

395
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,420
Mingchen has a girlfriend.

396
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,170
You've always been sensible.

397
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,090
I don't want to hide it from you.

398
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,320
You grew up with Mingchen.

399
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,110
You know each other well.

400
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,300
But fate can't be controlled.

401
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,770
If Mingchen really likes someone,

402
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,250
I'll give him my blessing.

403
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,420
I don't like forcing others.

404
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,000
Don't you say you will come back next month?

405
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,130
You come back early.

406
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,070
Wait a minute. It'll be ready soon.

407
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,670
Ding Nana.

408
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,140
I don't bear to drink this Richebourg

409
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,190
from 1994 myself.

410
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,790
You really make yourself at home.

411
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,730
So, I made up your mind for you.

412
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,920
You hung out with Xu Qingran?

413
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Yes.

414
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,490
Well, Qingran

415
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,170
seems different this time.

416
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,740
What changed?

417
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,210
Qingran

418
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,190
always took the initiative to set me up with Mingchen before.

419
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,580
Now she's telling me to let him go.

420
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,330
Welcome to the Unfavored Club.

421
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,570
Based on my past with Mingchen,

422
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,050
everyone else's is nothing.

423
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,040
Good for you.

424
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,850
You butter me up.

425
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,230
And talk sweet to Xu Qingran.

426
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,370
You're pleasing both sides.

427
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,790
Not one side is neglected.

428
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,230
What do you mean?

429
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,250
Among everyone,

430
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,880
only I'm the one who sincerely hopes

431
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,080
you three can get along with each other.

432
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,130
Thank you.

433
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,140
Mingchen.

434
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,190
Qingran.

435
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,930
Here, drink it while it's hot.

436
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,720
Nana is not going to leave after she comes back this time.

437
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,650
She said there are fewer opportunities in France.

438
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,450
She still wants to stay in China.

439
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,680
Hotel?

440
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,270
She wants to be in the wine business.

441
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,280
I mean,

442
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,830
don't neglect her.

443
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,850
Why would I?

444
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,670
I know you won't.

445
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm just reminding you.

446
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,690
Not only don't neglect her,

447
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,830
but you have to coax her, spoil her,

448
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,620
and pay more attention to her.

449
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,210
Ding Nana is the key

450
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,810
to easing our relationship with Ding's group.

451
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,290
You must take this step well.

452
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,340
How?

453
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,890
Have you forgotten?

454
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,290
When Dad was still alive,

455
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,040
he liked this girl the most.

456
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,730
He told me more than once

457
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,680
that he wanted her to be his daughter-in-law.

458
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,650
His biggest regret could be

459
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,000
that he didn't see you two get married.

460
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,110
Qingran, you know,

461
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,800
I always think of Ding Nana as my sister.

462
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,680
I know.

463
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,620
I know you like Fenfen.

464
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,670
For your health,

465
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,970
I won't force you.

466
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,860
But it doesn't mean you have to give Nana the cold shoulder.

467
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,200
I know. I know what to do.

468
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:22,910
Hello?

469
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,280
Where are you?

470
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,100
What's wrong?

471
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,360
Fix the electricity.

472
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,030
What?

473
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,030
Mingchen.

474
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,660
Why are you here alone?

475
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,850
It's too dark in there.

476
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,940
Silly girl, don't scare yourself.

477
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,470
How about this? Let's go back to my house.

478
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,920
Wait for me.

479
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,380
Hello?

480
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,870
How's it going?

481
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,110
Has Lu Fenfen decided to move out?

482
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,080
What do you mean?

483
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,780
I cut the power

484
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,090
and changed the password.

485
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,910
I did everything I could.

486
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,590
You need me, and I step up.

487
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,720
You are Lord Mengchang,

488
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,320
and I'm your sneaky adviser.

489
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,690
You must take my credit this time.

490
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,150
Credit my ass.

491
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,450
How about this?

492
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,200
You can stay at my place.

493
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,670
Do you think it's appropriate?

494
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,940
Why not?

495
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,490
You are my girlfriend.

496
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,640
It's natural for us to live together.

497
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,460
Your house is so big.

498
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,070
Just so so.

499
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,700
But I prefer living next door to you.

500
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,130
It feels more like home.

501
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,430
You're the first girl I brought home

502
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,630
and the last one.

503
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,500
Then you should keep what you said.

504
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,310
Okay.

505
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,250
Go take a shower.

506
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,530
Let me show you there.

507
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,860
Okay, you carry me there.

508
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,060
You said you wanted to organize a family gathering.

509
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,150
Whatever.

510
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,500
So you agreed?

511
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,680
Agreed what?

512
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,790
You're one of the family members.

513
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,270
I'm not going.

514
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,620
If you don't,

515
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,730
Mingchen won't agree.

516
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,460
Am I a tool for you?

517
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,920
Take it as a welcome party for me.

518
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,680
Tianran, please help me.

519
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,040
I don't want to see them.

520
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,120
Don't be so petty.

521
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,630
I promise you

522
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,710
I'll protect you.

523
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,160
You always said that.

524
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,800
But every time you see Xu Mingchen,

525
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,000
you're all smitten and leave me behind.

526
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,160
Just tell me.

527
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,710
Are you going or not?

528
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,310
If you don't,

529
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,490
I won't drink with you.

530
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,500
Then I call him now.

531
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,700
Hello, Nana.

532
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,100
You said Tianran would come too?

533
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,850
Okay, I'll bring a person too.

534
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,370
My girlfriend, Lu Fenfen.

535
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,100
So embarrassed.

536
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,530
Why did you try so hard

537
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,140
to organize a family party?

538
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,180
We go and see them show affection for each other?

539
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,900
Shut up!

540
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,820
What's so good about Lu Fenfen?

541
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,370
Mingcheng is obsessed with her.

542
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,880
And Qingran.

543
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,520
She doesn't care about me anymore.

544
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,710
I told you to register the reality.

545
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,700
Xu Qingran's precious baby is Lu Fenfen now.

546
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,590
What does she like about her?

547
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,480
Fenfen is so cute.

548
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,110
Fenfen loves wine.

549
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,500
She has a perfect sense of taste.

550
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,850
Given some time,

551
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,070
she'll be an excellent master of wine.

552
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,560
Don't look down on her.

553
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,800
Why do I feel you're weird?

554
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,530
You're not falling in love with her, right?
