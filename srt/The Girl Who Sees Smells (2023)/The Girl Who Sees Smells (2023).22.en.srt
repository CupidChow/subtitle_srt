00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,110
Mingchen, let me tell you something.

5
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,100
Fenfen might know everything.

6
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,180
Fenfen, we'll get back to work.

7
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,710
Congratulations, Fenfen.

8
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,600
How good-looking you are!

9
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,260
Xiong is here!

10
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,260
Hello.

11
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,430
Daxiong.

12
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,060
Give him a chance to talk with her.

13
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,590
You two come here. This way.

14
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,020
Okay, okay. Let's go.

15
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,900
-Daxiong, why are you here? -Fenfen.

16
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,500
Fenfen,

17
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,579
how can I not come on your big day?

18
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:43,990
This is for you.

19
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,660
Here. Take it!

20
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,329
Fenfen.

21
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,000
You've finally found your true love.

22
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,900
I'm happier than anyone.

23
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,100
I'm your family now.

24
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,710
I don't know how to say sweet words.

25
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,620
But I wish you happiness forever.

26
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,900
Daxiong! Come and eat something.

27
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,780
Fenfen, cheer up!

28
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,140
Mingchen.

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,340
Mingchen.

30
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,180
I have something to tell you.

31
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,340
Did you drink again yesterday?

32
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,100
No.

33
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,500
Don't drink too much during pregnancy.

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,260
Nana.

35
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,300
We've grown up.

36
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,980
You'll find someone who loves you.

37
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,940
Mingchen.

38
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,300
If possible...

39
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,579
What are you talking about?

40
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,140
We were talking about our childhood memories.

41
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,540
Yes.

42
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,660
There are indeed many things between you

43
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,380
that I don't know.

44
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,300
What's wrong with you today, Fenfen?

45
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,620
Why are you absent-minded?

46
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,060
I have a question for you.

47
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,890
Go ahead.

48
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,060
Have you ever lied to me?

49
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,620
Why do I feel awkward every time I see it?

50
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,460
It's okay.

51
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,800
It's just awkward.

52
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,940
I wish you happiness.

53
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,940
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,380
I came in a hurry this time.

55
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,780
I didn't bring anything.

56
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,700
When you get married,

57
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,220
I will prepare a big gift.

58
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,020
Xu Mingchen.

59
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,140
Have you ever lied to me?

60
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,660
Of course not.

61
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,540
Take a look.

62
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,600
What do you think of the clothes we chose for their baby?

63
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,290
Fenfen!

64
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,020
Fenfen!

65
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,100
Stop, Fenfen!

66
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,420
Fenfen!

67
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,930
Fenfen, wait for me!

68
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,370
Are you happy now?

69
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,100
I told you

70
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,700
not to give you a chance to hurt Mingchen and Fenfen.

71
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,430
I'll make it clear to Mingchen.

72
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,740
The fact that Fenfen knows the truth is because of me.

73
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,540
So don't...

74
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,620
I just don't want them to be together!

75
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,740
Are you crazy?

76
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,730
Things have turned out to be like this now.

77
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,659
Do you think you still have a chance

78
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,220
after they break up?

79
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,020
I don't care if there is a chance.

80
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,720
Even if Xu Mingchen doesn't love anyone,

81
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,580
he just can't fall in love with that woman.

82
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,140
Stop being like this.

83
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,140
I know you're not that kind of person.

84
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,470
I am that kind of person!

85
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,500
Why?

86
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,620
I've been working so hard

87
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,750
to achieve the thing

88
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,860
that I dare not imagine!

89
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,060
Why can Lu Fenfen easily get it?

90
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,380
Why is it so unfair?

91
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,690
Listen.

92
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,620
No one can get the thing

93
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,860
that I can't get!

94
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,420
Especially Lu Fenfen.

95
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,430
She doesn't deserve it.

96
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,760
In fact, you're all taking advantage of her.

97
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,860
But I did this for her good.

98
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,180
Do you think

99
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,780
a romantic relationship that relies on lies

100
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,860
will last long?

101
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,659
Maybe men would say

102
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,900
lies

103
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,070
can become true if you lie forever.

104
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,340
But do you think we are all fools?

105
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,410
Even if I don't tell her,

106
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,770
Lu Fenfen will find it out herself.

107
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,130
What's wrong?

108
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,280
Are you scared? Do you regret telling me?

109
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,500
If you do, stay away from a bad woman like me.

110
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,620
Bai Bing, I hope you won't regret

111
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,310
what you've done this time.

112
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,500
Bai Bing.

113
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,159
Thank you for giving me and Fenfen a big gift.

114
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,240
Mingchen, it's all because of me.

115
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,059
I understand.

116
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,860
You're right.

117
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,780
Without you,

118
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,810
Fenfen would have known.

119
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,780
So I don't intend to blame you.

120
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,500
From now on,

121
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,000
you have nothing to do with me.

122
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,790
Don't worry.

123
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,260
I won't disturb your life anymore.

Fenfen.

128
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,660
I'm sorry for hiding it from you.

129
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,860
Is there anything else you lied to me about?

130
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,790
Absolutely not.

131
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,220
I swear with He Le's life.

132
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,380
All right, don't be angry.

133
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,300
How can I not be angry?

134
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,740
You already knew it.

135
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,100
But you didn't tell me.

136
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,060
Making friends with women is indeed unreliable,

137
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,860
especially with married women!

138
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,540
I'll ask He Le to come here, so you can vent your anger on him!

139
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,180
No need.

140
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,820
I don't want to see anyone

141
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,550
that is related to Xu Mingchen!

142
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,740
And this.

143
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,700
Give it back to him.

144
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,500
Fenfen.

145
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,020
To be honest,

146
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,140
I think

147
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,420
no relationship is completely pure in this world.

148
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,540
As long as his selfishness

149
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,620
doesn't affect your relationship,

150
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,660
I don't think it's a bad thing.

151
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,180
You're still defending him!

152
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,820
I'm not defending him.

153
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,580
I'm helping you.

154
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,380
Happiness is the most important thing.

155
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,670
Now you've known everything.

156
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,010
What else do you have

157
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,280
except that there's a thorn in your side?

158
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,380
I don't know.

159
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,220
But it's really disgusting.

160
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,130
I understand.

161

I don't want to think about anything now.

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,100
But I want to tell you

165
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,820
that I cherish you.

166
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,140
I cherish you too.

167
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,540
So,

168
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,940
I forgive you

169
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,540
in terms of the fact that you lied to me together with them.

This is the Share Transfer Agreement.

Once you sign it,

176

she will transfer the money immediately.

177
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,440
Am I short of the money?

Fenfen said

00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,660
you would tear it up.

180
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,060
So she asked me to bring another same agreement.

I can only take Qiao Yi's side.

a married man can't stand the test of his friendship.

Since she wants to draw a line,

00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,030
I'll do what she wants.

I don't want to break up with you.

It's my fault on the matter.

206
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,340
I wrote you a letter.

207
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,260
It was written before we get married.

But I didn't have the courage to send it to you.

Our encounter is an accident.

At first, I just wanted to survive.

But later I found out

that I liked you

But the more I love you,

You should leave.

love story

346
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,620
as a selling point.

347
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,830
If it doesn't work,

348
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,780
putting on an act is acceptable.

349
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,900
Customers will also pay for it.

He thought

351
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,300
my explanation was too simple

352
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,620
and it was too risky to put it on the market.

353
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,020
He also said if there was a love story as a selling point,

354
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,700
it would be great.

355
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,900
I agree.

356
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,600
Since you broke up,

357
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,140
your feelings for Xu Mingchen

358
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,940
have completely affected Kiss.

359
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,410
I think, without the sweet relationship,

360
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,020
you lost your original intention

361
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,330
to concoct this wine.

362
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,090
I know.

363
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
The core of this wine I concoct

364
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,940
is related to Xu Mingchen.

365
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,540
But now...

Are you still thinking about Xu Mingchen?

368
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,220
I suggest you go find him.

369
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,100
There's no chance for us to be together.

370

Do you want him to die?

What do you mean?

373
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,180
You mean his illness...

374
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,260
Am I crazy?

375
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,300
I can't believe I came to Xu Mingchen's house.

376

Are you okay?

You didn't answer my call.

379

I stayed up late to work last night.

380
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,550
So I fell asleep.

381

I'm not.

Then why did you come here?

I don't think it'll work.

Mr. Li, the selling point may not be

a touching love story.

404
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,250
Since it's called Kiss,

405
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,460
the point is the kiss.

Then what is it?

407
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,780
This is a kiss

that can make customers feel sweet.

409
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,620
Kiss connects a romantic relationship between two people.

One can fall in love after drinking it.

411

Isn't it logical?

Miss Lu, wait.

It suddenly occurred to me

why I had to find

Start over?

For example, find someone to date.

Kiss's true meaning that you want to present.
