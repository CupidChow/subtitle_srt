4
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,410
I can hear Mingchen's heartbeat

5
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,259
from here.

6
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,060
Listen.

7
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,850
I agree. Now it seems that

8
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,740
the key is Lu Fenfen.

9
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,500
The rest doesn't matter at all.

10
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:42,940
You're right.

11
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,380
Thank God, the result is fine.

12
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,310
Otherwise I would have killed you.

13
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,330
It's done. Let's go.

14
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,300
Let's go.

15
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,770
Qiao Yi!

16
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,020
Yijiang.

17
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,620
Yijiang!

18
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,740
We're home.

19
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,940
Qiao Yi.

20
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,660
Let men do this kind of thing.

21
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,579
After all, it's my stuff.

22
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,430
He is so good at this.

23
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,180
Why should we have to be here?

24
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,920
We do the hard labor and have to see them showing affection.

25
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,500
This is a man's job.

26
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,420
It's my stuff after all.

27
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,900
How about we treat everyone to a meal?

28
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,060
Thank you for doing so much

29
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,130
for us.

30
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,590
Let's invite Yijiang and Nana too.

31
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,380
We can finally have a decent meal.

32
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,990
Let's go.

33
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,950
Let's go.

34
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,020
Thank you.

35
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,980
It's okay.

36
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,190
Let's go.

37
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,660
Thank you.

38
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,440
You really love me.

39
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,960
You really love me.

40
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,260
Qiao Yi!

41
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,900
Qingran.

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,630
I need to talk to you.

43
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,300
What?

44
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,940
I'm back with Fenfen.

45
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,100
I'm serious this time.

46
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,610
I want to marry her.

47
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,090
I hope we can have your blessing.

48
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,260
The wine I'm holding has been aged for ten years.

49
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,120
It is one of the best in our cellar.

50
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,460
Please have a taste.

51
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,700
Everyone.

52
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you for coming here.

53
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,260
I'm very honored and happy.

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,620
Many years ago, with great passion,

55
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,399
I started to learn about wine.

56
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,240
I announce that

57
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,940
our upcoming new wine

58
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,460
will be born in this winery.

59
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,860
Cheers!

60
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,180
-Cheers. -Cheers.

61
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:46,840
Cheers.

62
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,070
Congratulations, Master.

63
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,659
I hope this wine

64
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,380
can meet professional taste standards

65
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,450
and market needs

66
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,110
with a sense of balance and structure.

67
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,420
This is a series of wines.

68
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,300
So I hope your wine

69
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,180
can match the others.

70
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,100
Master, what I want to adjust...

71
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,370
Fenfen, I know what you want to say.

72
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
My suggestion is

73
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,020
that you can re-evaluate it over some time

74
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,860
and then decide

75
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,640
which flavor you really like.

76
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,740
Master, I just want to make it

77
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,580
sweeter.

78
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,500
Fenfen, let's go socialize first.

79
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,510
Long time no see.

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,420
Congratulations.

81
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,100
Congratulations.

82
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,700
Thank you.

83
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,190
You're back.

84
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,620
I have a surprise for you.

85
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,580
What is it?

86
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,180
Guess.

87
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Let me have a look.

88
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,270
Do you like it?

89
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,460
Yes.

90
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,080
That's all?

91
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,220
What else do you want?

92
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,980
Right, I have something to share with you too.

93
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,020
This is my first bottle of wine.

94
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,780
First of all, congratulations.

95
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,380
I've been worried

96
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,700
that the taste wouldn't be professional.

97
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,780
So I want to give it to you

98
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,540
and listen to your opinion.

99
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,100
Okay.

100
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,460
How is it?

101
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,580
The taste is smooth and sweet.

102
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,290
I think it's good.

103
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,660
That's good.

104
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,580
But isn't it too sweet?

105
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,100
I can feel the sweetness of it.

106
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,060
Maybe it is because it's your concoction.

107
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,250
I'll bring it to my master tomorrow.

108
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,980
He should like it too.

109
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,900
So you only let me try it to see if he will like it.

110
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,460
Didn't I let you try my wine first?

111
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,100
Master.

112
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,460
Give me the glasses.

113
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,320
This should be the final version.

114
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,540
Try it.

115
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,740
I think it's good.

116
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,140
But is there a slight difference

117
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,740
from the previous version?

118
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,750
The taste is indeed different.

119
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,660
But as long as the initial positioning is accurate,

120
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,460
there won't be a big difference.

121
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,260
Master, I've been wanting to say...

122
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,840
I know what you want to say.

123
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,809
But you have to believe in yourself

124
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,140
and my judgment.

125
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,470
Your previous version is good enough.

126
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,900
Master.

127
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,140
Fenfen.

128
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,940
Why are you here?

129
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,980
I'm afraid you'll skip lunch because you've been working so hard,

130
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,220
so I brought you lunch.

131
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,460
It's not hard at all.

132
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,940
She feels a strong sense of accomplishment here,

133
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,800
right, Fenfen?

134
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,540
By the way,

135
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,580
I heard you're going to launch a series of red wines.

136
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,490
I'm very happy that Fenfen can be part of it.

137
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,620
As your big brother,

138
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,870
I will definitely support you.

139
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,820
By the way,

140
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,940
Fenfen, what did you want to say to me?

141
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,200
Something about wine?

142
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,500
Nothing, Master.

143
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,040
You must be hungry.

144
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,000
How about we eat together?

145
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,020
Let's eat.

146
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,080
You didn't even eat properly at the winery, did you?

147
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,580
Beef and ribs. They are all your favorites.

148
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,380
This is so awkward.

149
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,300
What exactly do they want?

150
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,100
Eat.

151
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,980
I'm hungry too.

152
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,420
Thank you.

153
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
I have something to do. Fenfen.

154
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,880
Take your time.

155
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,800
Mingchen, I have something to discuss with you.

156
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,460
You are so busy,

157
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,380
so you don't have to bring me lunch.

158
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,460
What? Are you afraid I'll ruin your work?

159
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,060
You don't understand.

160
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,700
You're angry.

161
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,750
You and Philip are so intimate.

162
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,060
I'm the one who should be angry.

163
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,990
Are you jealous?

164
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,780
Of what?

165
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,220
I want my sweet and sour ribs.

166
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,970
Okay, have it.

167
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,320
They are all yours.

168
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,260
Have some more.

169
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,380
Master, this

170
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,260
is the final version I want to submit to you.

171
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,860
I concocted this wine

172
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,100
to find

173
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,340
a young rose wine.

174
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,060
It may not be as luxurious and complicated

175
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,860
as those in this winery.

176
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,770
But as long as you taste it,

177
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,620
you can feel the sweetness.

178
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,900
Simply put,

179
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,100
I adjusted its balance.

180
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,900
It became sweeter.

181
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,320
Why do you have such thoughts?

182
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,860
What happened?

183
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,900
Because I made up with Mingchen.

184
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,860
Master, I know this wine

185
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,840
doesn't fit the aesthetics of professional wines.

186
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,220
But it has a more common flavor.

187
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,260
So I also thought of

188
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,600
a more down-to-earth publicity method.

189
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,540
What?

190
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,580
Livestream.

191
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,940
Do you know there is an internet celebrity

192
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,250
called Pear in Wine?

193
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,900
An influencer like them

194
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,100
can affect a wine brand with just one sentence.

195
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,540
Is it still

196
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,060
wine tasting

197
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,900
if you casually allow a popular internet celebrity to read the manuscript

198
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,430
you prepared ahead of time?

199
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,100
Master, I've met her before.

200
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,180
Although she is an Internet celebrity,

201
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,850
her wine knowledge...

202
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,500
Fenfen, I know you are full of ideas.

203
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,420
But you must know that

204
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,860
red wine is picky about the audience.

205
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,660
But when a wine is developed,

206
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,140
isn't it waiting for people to taste it?

207
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,740
We now

208
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,260
make the flavor more common,

209
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,540
isn't it...

210
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,700
A perfect wine

211
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,700
is like delicate music.

212
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,740
Every note should be where it should be.

213
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,260
Each flavor is just right

214
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,320
in its proportion.

215
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,900
Balance is the best.

216
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,940
If a customer wants a sweeter wine,

217
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,060
why don't we just sell him grape juice?

218
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,660
If you want to become a real Master of Wine,

219
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,850
you have to trust me.

220
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,420
The marketing method of live-streaming sales

221
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,100
has completely lowered the positioning of this wine.

222
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,960
I want to make something classic,

223
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,720
not something popular like internet celebrities.

224
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,260
All right, change it back to the original version.

225
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,340
You're back.

226
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,700
I bought cakes.

227
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,900
How about asking Mingchen?

228
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,660
Career comes first. Pride is nothing.

229
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,070
You're going to eat alone?

230
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,940
There is one more.

231
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,340
What are you thinking about?

232
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,860
I'm thinking about my wine proposal.

233
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,740
Show me.

234
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,050
Why is your wine suddenly positioned as high-end.

235
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,510
Wasn't the point to pair wine with barbecue?

236
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,020
This is different from the one

237
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,350
you let me taste before.

238
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,380
Red wine should be served to high-end people.

239
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,700
No.

240
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,420
That's not right.

241
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,020
Every red wine maker

242
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,620
has a distinct vision.

243
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,980
Isn't it putting the cart

244
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,220
before the horse,

245
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,590
if you target the audiences first?

246
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,020
Yes, I think so too.

247
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,859
And today's audiences

248
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,660
are difficult to please.

249
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,339
I think you should follow your own ideas.

250
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,180
You're amazing!

[Philip Studio]

252
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,579
The next one

253
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,829
is a rose wine, designed by Fenfen.

254
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,140
Try it.

255
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,260
Okay.

256
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,660
Take a look.

257
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,470
This is the design of this wine.

258
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,820
I thought it would take a lot of effort

259
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,540
to persuade Master.

260
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,260
I didn't expect him to accept my idea so quickly.

[Philip Studio]

262
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,250
I've always known that Phillip is amazing,

263
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,860
but it's selling so well!

264
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,380
Of course.

265
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,420
Master is a super master

266
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,380
with a good look and talent.

267
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,020
Plus my extraordinary...

When I think about the bonus I'm going to get,

269
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,910
I'm so happy that I can't sleep.

270
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,220
Do you only see money in your eyes?

271
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,060
But the sales

272
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,600
are all from physical stores.

273
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,540

Welcome to our live stream room.

Next, let me introduce

278
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,540
this series of red wines.

279
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,380
This one is from a famous winery in China

280
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,940
designed by the famous Master of Wine,

281

Mr. Philip,

OK,

let me taste

286
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
this red wine,

287
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,420
which is carefully fermented in the famous winery.

Mr. Xu, there's an urgent document that you need to confirm.

please postpone the rest of my schedule for today.

Okay.

Also,

buy me a batch of Phillip's wine.

296

Mr. Xu Mingchen, the youngest and most handsome

CEO of Xu's Group.

349
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,310
Let's welcome him.

350
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,510
Next, let's give this room

351
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,860
to Mr. Xu.

352
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,240
It's going up.

353
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,590
Hello, everyone.

354
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,650
I'm Xu Mingchen.

355
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,460
Today, I'll introduce three kinds of red wine to you.

356
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,910
The two on the sides are classic red wine.

357
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,630
The one in the middle is rose wine.

358
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,870
The one in my hand

359
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,560
is designed by

360
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,810
the new star, Miss Lu Fenfen.

361
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,060
I remember

362
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,400
when I first drank this bottle of wine,

363
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,060
I felt like I was in love.

364

[Estimated Sales]

365
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,170
They're showing off their relationship.

366
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,170
Fine, I'll buy it.

367
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,160
Can I really find the one?

368
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,790
This friend is right.

369
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,650
Once you drink this wine,

370
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,240
there will be sweet love waiting for you.

371
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,890
What are you doing?

372
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,650
Although it hasn't been five minutes,

373
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,450
it has proved that you are wrong.

374
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,520
Do you know what is right?

375
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,970
Do you know what wine is?

376
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,630
I'm sorry, Master.

377
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,110
Are you really going to do this?

378
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,450
My student, my wine.

379
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,170
You have no right to question me.

380
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,150
Brother, it won't work. Stop it.

381
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,260
What did you say?

382
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,960
I said it wouldn't work.

383
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,840
I won't go easy on you this time.

384
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,700
Master.

385
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,500
Are these all orders sold over the internet?

386
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,090
Yes.

387
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,070
It's very useful

388
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,700
that Fenfen brought friends to a live stream here.

389
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,930
In fact,  there are many young customers

390
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,480
in our target group.

391
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,790
They probably bought it

392
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,590
after watching the live stream.

393
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,630
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

394
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,730
You were so fierce.

395
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,730
You almost made Fenfen cry last time.

396
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,570
How dare I?

397
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,820
Master, the sales this time

398
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,330
has gone skyracketing.

399
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,030
Do you want to take this opportunity to show your gratitude?

400
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,490
Fenfen is simple-minded.

401
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,740
It's easy to coax her.

402
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,910
Let's have a celebration party.

403
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,140
This is a good opportunity to introduce Fenfen to everyone.

404
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,600
OK.

Okay.

Are you still sad?

408
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,180
Alright, don't be sad.

409
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,360
The master just cares about this wine.

410
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,230
Think about it.

411
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,970
He created over

412
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,420
200 experimental demos.

413
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,210
He stayed up all night

414
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,010
and put in so much effort.

415
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,390
Then he saw you selling wine at a discount.

416
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,650
Think about it.

417
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,560
It's understandable that he was angry.

418
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,110
Right?

419
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,770
Thank you, Xia.

420
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,880
I just blame myself.

421
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,650
As his student,

422
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,550
I didn't think of that.

423
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,040
He should be angry.

424
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,350
Yes.

425
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,790
Master is very angry.

426
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,930
He can't wait...

427
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,740
Wait what?

00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,580
To throw a celebration party.

429
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,590
What?

430
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,780
Actually, when Master saw

431
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,290
your market report,

432
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,720
he wasn't angry anymore.

433
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,490
He said he was looking forward to your attendance.

434
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,220
You must dress up beautifully.

435
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,770
Really? Did Master really say that?

436
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,490
Of course.

437
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,360
By the way,

438
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,030
I forgot to tell you.

439

The new wine is out of stock in the studio.

440

That's great.

I have to go.

442
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,860
I have to go home and prepare my costume for my celebration party.

443
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,510

444

that I'm willing to let Fenfen come here

446
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,690
because she likes it.

447

I won't make an exception.

You're here to warn me?

452
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,430
I'll introduce her to everyone at the party.

453
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,230
I'll make sure everyone remembers her

454
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,000
as my student.

455
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,180
You won't have a chance to get even with me.

You and the Master are the best.

You've tested so many versions.

476
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,350
You also know it too that I hesitated between

477

the last two versions for a long time.

Thanks to you.

479
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,090
You agreed to switch back to the previous version at the last moment.

480
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,020
Otherwise, the market response wouldn't be so good.

481
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,510
What? Switch the version?

482
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,520
Yes.

This is not my previous version.

What previous version?

486
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,330
Yes.

487
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,180
Master.

488
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,640
This is not the version I gave you.

489
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,860
Fenfen, it doesn't matter.

490
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,080
Just trust my judgment.

491
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,180
The market has given us feedback.

492
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,510
This is the best result.

493
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,450
But this is not the version I want to express.

494
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,110
I gave you a more professional version.

495
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,890
Anyway, the decision to change the wine was the right one.

You don't have to think about anything now.

Just hug the success with me.

Excuse me.

Got it.

If I hadn't told you this,

you wouldn't have fought with the Master.
