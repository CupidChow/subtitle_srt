[Episode 4]

4
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,080
We are arriving at the station.

5
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,320
Please be careful.

6
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,250
Grandpa.

7
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,140
Fenfen.

8
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,940
Grandpa.

9
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,750
She is…

10
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,360
Grandpa, this is Qiao Yi.

11
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,080
She was my college roommate.

12
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,880
It's she who called you.

13
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,030
-Thank you so much. -Hello, grandpa.

14
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,660
You look thinner.

15
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,950
I'll gain some weight soon.

16
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,590
I'll become chubby tomorrow.

17
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,470
Let's go home.

18
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,350
It's not that easy.

19
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,020
Let me take the luggage.

20
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,950
It's okay, grandpa.

21
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,540
Let her take it.

22
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,830
We're home.

23
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,040
Not bad.

24
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,220
Yeah.

25
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,710
Have a seat, grandpa.

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,750
The rent must be very high.

27
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,060
No, it isn't.

28
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,620
Qiao Yi is really nice.

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,100
She pays most of the rent.

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,390
You...

31
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,410
You shouldn't take advantage of her.

32
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:31,940
Grandpa.

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,680
Here, have some water.

34
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,070
Thank you.

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,540
Grandpa, make yourself at home.

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,690
Fenfen is doing well now.

37
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,110
She has found a good job.

38
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,140
It's all my fault.

39
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,410
I was really anxious at that time.

40
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,720
I didn't realize that I exaggerated it.

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,820
I shouldn't have made you so worried.

42
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,500
It's not your fault.

43
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,420
If it weren't for you,

44
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,600
I wouldn't get such big news.

45
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,430
Grandpa, you don't blame me, do you?

46
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,950
Of course not. Why should I blame you?

47
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,360
It's Yang's fault.

48
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,690
He just didn't know

49
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,870
what a good girl you are.

50
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,230
Grandpa, you are right. I agree with you.

51
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,520
It's good that Fenfen didn't lose much.

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,060
It looks like Fenfen is not troubled by this.

53
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,050
I feel relieved.

54
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,920
Everything is fine now.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,790
Sister.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,420
Tianran is back.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,480
Don't you want to see him?

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,710
Did I refuse to see him?

59
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,810
He stood by the Ding family once he came back.

60
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,670
He doesn't care about us, does he?

61
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,950
He must have done it for his own reasons.

62
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,340
Besides, the Ding family and we are close.

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,100
We've been friends for generations.

64
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,660
Fine, whatever.

65
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,010
He will come back if he wants.

66
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,160
I am worried about your health.

67
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,550
How are you?

68
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,940
I'm in good condition now.

69
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,060
Yijiang is also helping me.

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,240
I wish I were the sick person instead of you.

71
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

72
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,620
Let me help you.

73
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,800
Let me do it.

74
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,610
Grandpa, why are you here?

75
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,830
Qiao Yi said you work here.

76
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,270
I was taking a walk after dinner.

77
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,240
So I came to see you.

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,030
Let me do it, grandpa.

79
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,130
No, let me help you.

80
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,850
Grandpa.

81
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,150
-Which ones should I move next? -Grandpa.

82
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,950
Granpa, you don't have to do this. It's too tiring.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,180
I have a strong body.

84
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,150
I'm fine.

85
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,120
Don't worry about me. Which one should I move next?

86
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,090
Okay, I know.

87
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,350
My grandpa is very healthy and strong.

88
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,320
But

89
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,250
my colleagues and I will move all of them.

90
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,550
You take a break, grandpa.

91
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,280
You're a girl.

92
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,090
It's not easy for you to do it.

93
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,480
It's okay, grandpa.

94
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,110
My colleagues are nice.

95
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,090
They all take good care of me.

96
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,050
Especially my…

97
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,900
Fenfen, the Merlot wine…

98
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,390
Daxiong. This is my group leader, Daxiong.

99
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,770
Grandpa, this is Daxiong.

100
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,700
Grandpa, do you still remember me?

101
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,930
You are Daxiong from the Wang family?

102
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,490
We haven't seen each other for years…

103
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,720
Thank you for helping Fenfen a lot.

104
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,360
You're welcome, grandpa.

105
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,530
It's my honor to do something for her.

106
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,300
We are like family.

107
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,630
Fenfen,

108
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,410
knowing that you have so many good friends around you,

109
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,350
I feel happy for you from the bottom of my heart.

110
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,070
But Fenfen,

111
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,850
I still hope you can find someone

112
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,840
who really cherishes you and can give you warmth.

113
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,030
Grandpa, I can take care of myself.

114
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,290
Please rest assured.

115
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,800
Fenfen, I think your grandpa is right.

116
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,990
Grandpa, don't worry.

117
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,170
I promise

118
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,470
no matter what happens,

119
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,390
I'll always be there

120
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,330
for Fenfen.

121
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,140
I'll treat you to lunch today.

122
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,870
Okay, thank you.

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,960
You're welcome.

124
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,640
Daxiong, thank you.

125
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,030
It's my pleasure, grandpa.

126
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,130
You promised me. You'll pay the bill today.

127
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,050
No problem.

128
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,150
No, grandpa. Let me treat you to lunch.

129
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,700
Fenfen and I

130
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,960
grew up together.

131
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,010
Actually…

132
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,000
Actually, I brought someone else here today.

133
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,340
Who?

134
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,140
Someone else?

135
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,270
Shouldn't you treat us?

136
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,940
No problem.

137
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,500
Let's take a seat.

138
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,470
Come on.

139
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,190
Take a seat.

140
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,870
Ming.

141
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,090
Grandpa.

142
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,780
Fenfen, you don't remember him?

143
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,790
Hello.

144
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,510
You grew up together.

145
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,409
He is Brother Li.

146
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,090
You used to call him Brother Li when you were a kid.

147
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,760
Hello.

148
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,690
He's the son of our village leader.

149
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,830
Yeah. I remember him.

150
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,390
Grandpa, what are you doing?

151
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,870
You two haven't seen each other for a long time.

152
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,920
Now, you are in the same city.

153
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,230
In the future,

154
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,990
you two can hang out often

155
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,750
or have a meal together.

156
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,990
So you will have one more close friend

157
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,110
and I won't be too worried about you.

158
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,770
So you are Fenfen.

159
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,660
You're much prettier than before.

160
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,130
Thank you.

161
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,940
I still remember when we were young,

162
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,160
we went to the orchard together.

163
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,290
You accidentally fell into a dung pit.

164
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,020
Help!

165
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,660
Why would he mention

166
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,590
such an embarrassing thing?

167
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,020
You are...

168
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,450
Daxiong.

169
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,140
No, just Xiong.

170
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,320
I'm Fenfen's leader

171
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,510
and her best friend.

172
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,700
I remember

173
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,960
you liked following Fenfen when you were a kid.

174
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,850
One day, you were chased by a group of boys.

175
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,650
They took off your pants and threw them into a tree.

176
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,909
So you are Ming.

177
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,760
How about you drink more water

178
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,350
and talk less?

179
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,050
Fenfen.

180
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,390
Order.

181
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,870
Okay, let's order.

182
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,570
The dishes are ready.

183
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,360
Have some water, grandpa.

184
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,140
[Qiao Yi, help!]

185
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,940
[Lu Fenfen]

186
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,030
[Lu Fenfen: Qiao Yi, help!]

187
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,460
You're too slow.

188
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,380
You still haven't got Lu Fenfen's kiss.

189
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,840
She sees me as a kid

190
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,570
and has rejected me several times.

191
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,330
But

192
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,210
if you can't get her kiss,

193
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,720
you'll die.

194
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,910
As your good bro, I have to make some sacrifices for you.

195
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,150
I have to do this.

196
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,289
Don't move.

197
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,250
Grandpa, try this.

198
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,590
Okay.

199
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,680
Fenfen, this is for you.

200
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,200
Thank you.

201
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,180
Let's eat.

202
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,110
Ming is so sweet.

203
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,240
He said

204
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,020
he will take us to have fun after lunch.

205
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,120
Yes, let's have a great time together.

206
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,090
I'll drive.

207
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,910
Grandpa, I don't have time this afternoon.

208
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,880
You're kidding.

209
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,350
I'm serious.

210
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,750
You should be free today.

211
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,590
Fenfen.

212
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,690
Why are you dating someone else

213
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,080
without telling me?

214
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,180
I...

215
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,840
Didn't you say you will love me forever?

216
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,970
What are you doing? Let go of your hand!

217
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,080
Grandpa, he…

218
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,830
Who is he?

219
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,340
Nice to meet you, grandpa.

220
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,870
I'm Lu Fenfen's boyfriend.

221
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,760
My name is Xu Tianran.

222
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,680
Grandpa, I'll show you around today.

223
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,580
Let's have dinner together.

224
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,560
Grandpa,

225
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,040
how about I take a photo of you?

226
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,340
Great.

227
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,970
Okay.

228
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,110
It's nice to see the blue sky and white clouds.

229
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,330
Yes, right here.

230
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,260
Let me see. You're good.

231
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,880
Let's take a family photo.

232
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,510
A family photo.

233
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,310
No, grandpa. Just a photo of you.

234
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,650
Come here.

235
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,460
Come on.

236
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,420
Come on.

237
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,350
OK.

238
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,950
Let me take a photo of you two.

239
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,290
No, no, no, grandpa. That's enough.

240
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,440
When I miss you,

241
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,980
I can take out this photo and take a look at it.

242
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,530
Come on.

243
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,110
Be closer to each other, you two.

244
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,220
Make a pose. Give me a big heart.

245
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,940
Ready.

246
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,680
One, two, go.

247
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,400
A big heart.

248
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,830
No, it's not like this.

249
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,880
Look at me.

250
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:06,850
Like this.

251
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,700
Ready, go.

252
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,970
A big heart. Okay.

253
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,740
Good.

254
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,400
Be more intimate, you two.

255
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,830
Look at them.

256
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,630
How intimate they are.

257
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,900
Learn from them.

258
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,950
Come on.

259
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,750
Kiss me again.

260
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,990
There are so many people.

261
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,170
Just one photo.

262
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,140
Look at them.

263
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,810
Do I look beautiful?

264
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,480
Kiss.

265
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,220
As beautiful as always.

266
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,470
How about this?

267
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
-Let's go over there. -Okay.

268
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,900
Good.

269
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,150
All right.

270
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,260
Grandpa, are you hungry?

271
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,180
No.

272
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,200
Let's go eat something nice.

273
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,310
Are you hungry?

274
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,490
No, I'm not.

275
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,660
Look at that.

276
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,270
Grandpa, do you want to try that?

277
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,230
No.

278
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:20,980
Grandpa,

279
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,070
this is the place you wanted me to come?

280
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,350
Yes.

281
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,700
It's not Grandpa's idea. It's mine.

282
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,810
♫I want to tell the whole world♫

283
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,340
The place Fenfen wants to go,

284
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,240
♫How much I like you♫

285
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,720
is where I want to go.

286
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,710
♫My whispers of love for you♫

287
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,810
Let's go bungee jumping.

288
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,710
♫Are endless♫

289
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,740
No, no.

290
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,420
I can't do that.

291
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,510
♫Even though the nights are dark and long♫

292
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,430
You go have fun.

293
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,250
♫Your presence makes them so romantic♫

294
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,270
You guys go bungee jumping.

295
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,680
♫Every night I won't go to sleep♫

296
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,720
♫Until you tell me stories and say good night♫

297
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,310
♫I miss you for every single minute♫

298
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,370
♫It has become one of my habits♫

299
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,880
♫We say goodbye to each other over and over again♫

300
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,860
♫Because we have too little time♫

301
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,700
♫Sometimes I will hesitate♫

302
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,470
♫Sometimes I am brave for no reason♫

303
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,990
♫But your voice♫

304

♫Is always in my mind♫

305
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,900
You two are weak.

306
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,800
Actually, Fenfen had a very difficult life.

307
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,180
Her parents passed away early.

308
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,020
I brought her up alone.

309
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,630
When she was a kid,

310
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,040
she dreamed of coming to this amusement park.

311
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,190
Back then, I had to raise pigs.

312
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,630
I had no time or money.

313
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,620
Grandpa.

314
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
The company of family is priceless.

315
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,950
Fenfen is so happy now

316
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,740
because she has the best grandpa in the world.

317
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,970
Fenfen said you're like a child.

318
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,160
But I think you are mature.

319
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,070
Tell me

320
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,350
do you really like Fenfen?

321
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,670
I...

322
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,820
Don't say it to me.

323
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,750
Say it to yourself.

324
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,050
I'm an old man now.

325
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,620
I can't take care of her forever.

326
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,030
I just hope my granddaughter

327
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,840
can be happy every day.

328
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,050
Even if she is a little unhappy sometimes,

329
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,080
she can forget the unhappy things easily.

330
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,820
She will.

331
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,350
Although she looks naive,

332
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,410
she's actually very strong.

333
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,930
I think she's like a snail.

334
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,190
Though she walks slowly,

335
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,920
she is always

336
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,440
heading towards her goal.

337
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,260
You're right.

338
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,370
She is stubborn.

339
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,210
As you know,

340
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,540
Fenfen has an extraordinary gustation.

341
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,770
She loves wine so much.

342
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,210
Her passion for wine

343
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,890
will make her

344
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,870
the best wine taster in the world.

00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,460
Why?

515
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,150
Mr. Chen, the big client who often collaborates with us,

516
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,620
suddenly cancelled his order.

517
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,800
As a result,

518
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,390
our turnover this month has declined sharply.

519
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,850
I guess that's the reason.

520
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,480
Is it that serious?

521
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,820
What's worse,

522
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,790
the manager asked me to go to his office just now

523
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,630
and told me those whose comprehensive performances

524
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,560
are ranked in the last 30% this month,

525
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,420
will all be fired.

526
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,720
I have to remind you,

527
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,860
though you

528
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,700
are good at selling wine,

529
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,600
your comprehensive performances are always not good.

530
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,310
I know.

531
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,900
Now,

532
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,840
you must be careful with your words and actions.

533
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,600
Don't make any trouble.

534
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,100
Got it.

535
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,390
Be patient.

536
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,740
Patient.

537
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,100
Sir, what can I do for you?

538
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,230
It's you.

539
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,210
You sold me fake wine.

540
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,760
Fake wine?

541
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,230
That's impossible, sir.

542
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,740
We're a chain supermarket.

543
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,830
Our goods all come from our trusted suppliers.

544
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,260
We never sell fake wine.

545
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,780
Smell it.

546
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,500
Did you sell this to me?

547
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,970
I...

548
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,040
Your supermarket is so terrible.

549
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,600
It cost me over a thousand yuan.

550
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,030
How dare you sold fake wine to me?

551
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,920
You know what.

552
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,850
You have to pay me a compensation ten times of the wine's price.

553
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,820
Sir,

554
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,710
is there any misunderstanding?

555
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,970
Our supermarket never sells fake wine.

556
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,490
I remember it clearly.

557
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,150
You sold the fake wine to me.

558
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,100
Let me tell you,

559
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,750
if the supermarket doesn't pay compensation to me, you should.

560
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,010
Let's see your leader.

561
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,610
Sir.

562
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,370
Let's solve the problem, but please do not touch her.

563
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,170
Xu Tianran.

564
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,120
Who are you? It's none of your business.

565
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,700
I thought you were sincere

566
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,480
and I intended to let you pay less.

567
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,580
Now, you have to pay me ten times of the wine's price.

568
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,960
Not a penny less.

569
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,440
Everybody, come here.

570
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,950
Come here.

571
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,930
Look.

572
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,500
The woman sold me fake wine.

573
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,720
I came to ask for compensations politely.

574
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,650
She asked her boyfriend to come

575
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,750
and they intended to have a fight with me.

576
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,800
-Do you still obey laws? -Sir.

577
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,810
Sir.

578
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,580
We will definitely pay compensation to you.

579
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,430
Could you please not shout?

580
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,360
What's going on?

581
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,360
What's wrong?

582
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,040
Are you the leader?

583
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,500
Yes.

584
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,600
Let me tell you,

585
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,540
she sold fake wine to me.

586
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,070
Why are you taking photos of me?

587
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,710
Who allowed you to do that? Delete them.

588
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,770
[Investigate this guy for me right now.]

589
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,360
[Mingchen: Investigate this guy for me right now.]

590
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,100
I suspect you're blackmailing us.
