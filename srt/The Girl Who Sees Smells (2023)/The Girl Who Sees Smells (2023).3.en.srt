4
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,060
Why are you here?

5
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,060
It's for you.

6
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,220
Why?

7
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,070
I want to treat you to dinner

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,140
to thank you for your Red Wine Vanilla Tea.

9
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,820
Here are two facts.

10
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,620
One,

11
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,660
I'm older than you.

12
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,500
Two,

13
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,200
you're richer than me.

14
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,290
So?

15
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,980
So you shouldn't blow your money at your age.

16
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,660
You should develop a correct view on money.

17
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,420
Every penny doesn't come easily.

18
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,820
No matter how rich your family is,

19
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,780
you're not the one who makes it rich.

20
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,810
It's wrong for you to blow your money.

21
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,140
How did I waste my money?

22
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,200
It's a waste for you to buy these flowers.

23
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,000
How do you know I don't make money myself?

24
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,380
Everyone can see that, okay?

25
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,040
You can't have worked before.

26
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,980
You should be...

27
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,780
A junior?

28
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,780
I graduated ten years ago.

29
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,790
Graduated from primary school ten years ago?

30
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,340
Pretty girl.

31
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,690
Your eyes are beautiful.

32
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,980
But you don't have an eye for people.

33
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,200
Boys from the generation after 00s are so good at flirting.

34
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,730
He dare touch my face?

[Have you got fat lately? Then why are you weighing more and more in my heart?]

36
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,060
This is so delicious!

37
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,340
Fenfen.

38

Have you got fat lately?

39
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,900
No. Why?

40
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,940
Then why are you

41
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,390
weighing more and more in my heart?

42
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,580
Why did you do this to me?

43
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,820
I... What did I do to you?

44
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,860
Why did you make me

45
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,500
like you so much?

46
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,180
What are these sweet nothings? Nonsense.

47
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,220
Lu Fenfen, let's cut the crap.

48
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,180
Do you want to date me?

49
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,940
Date me!

50
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,180
Is it funny?

51
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,500
A... A little bit funny.

52
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,060
Can you watch fewer TV dramas?

53
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,860
I don't watch TV.

54
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,810
Nonsense!

55
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,700
If you don't watch TV dramas,

56
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,820
where did you learn these bossy lines from?

57
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,480
Do I need to?

58
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,820
And this bossy look

59
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,140
and the bossy smile you made just now.

60
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,980
Cute boy, you're so young.

61
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,180
Can't you smile

62
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,380
in a cheerful and active manner?

63
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Am I not cheerful?

64
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,820
Anyway, what I want to say is

65
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,260
that I'm not in the mood to date now.

66
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,060

Of course.

74

Didn't you go abroad?

75

No. You're more handsome than before.

He refused.

Come on.

Look at your physical state.

101
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
You're in poor physical condition.

102
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,660
Mingchen, I thought about it.

103
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,460
If you can't recover,

104
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,500
why don't you sell the group?

Sister, what are you talking about?

106
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,650
You are the most important to me.

After our parents passed away,

108
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,640
It's my fault that I didn't take good care of you.

109
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,380
Don't say that.

110

By the way, Tianran is back.

Do you want to see him?

112
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,500
Since he's back,

113
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,420
let him return to the group as soon as possible.

114
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,180
He has his own ideas.

115
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,900
We should respect his opinion.

116
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,380
Above all, he must admit that he's a member of the Xu family,

117
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,380
and he must protect Xu's interests.

118
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,890
If he can do that,

119
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,840
we can talk about something else.

120
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,500
But what if...

121
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,920
What if my illness can't be cured?

122
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,420
Sister, I thought about it carefully.

123
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,820
If I can't recover,

124
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,340
Tianran is the most suitable successor.

125
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,540
Why don't we speak frankly...

126
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,980
I won't let anything happen to you.

127
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,100
If Yijiang can't cure you,

128
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,620
we have other solutions.

129
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,820
I'm willing to give up everything,

Okay.

149

Vintage in 2013.

From the South of France.

151
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,180
You're right.

152
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,290
But why do you only talk about the name of origin

153
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,550
instead of the brand?

154
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,340
Because I never drank this wine before.

155
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,180
It must be expensive.

156
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,680
You can also try the one over there.

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,240
with one taste of the wine here.

165
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,380
If it's the wine I drank before,

166
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,900
I can directly tell you its brand name.

167
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,370
I'm so happy,

168
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,260
since I can drink so much good wine all at once.

169

[Ding's Group Opening Ceremony of Rhone Valley Lounge]

173
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,480
They're particular about the quality of red wine.

174
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,160
But,

175
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,430
they're mad about the wine

176
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,870
produced in Rhone Valley.

177
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,810
Who on earth are you?

178
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,790
How will you help me become a sommelier?

179
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,370
Mr. Phillip, it's your turn to speak.

180
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,560
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,660
I was immersed in the conversation and forgot the time.

182
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,010
Wait, wait.

183
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,700
She... What did she call you?

184
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,360
Phillip?

185
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,760
Are you really Phillip?

186
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,760
It's true. Come with me.

187
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,910
Let's welcome Mr. Phillip,

188
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,850
the world Master of Wine, to the stage.

189
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,560
Besides,

190
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,950
he is also the co-founder

191
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,590
of the Rhone Valley Lounge Programme.

192

Let's welcome!

193
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,910
It's my honor to have you all so enthusiastic.

194
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,620
This is my first time coming back

195
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,750
after so many years.

196
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,240
In the coming days, I, together with Ding's Group

197
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,920
will establish the red wine brand of Rhone Valley,

198
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,350
and I'll hold the post of senior advisor

199
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,200
of the hotel under Ding's Group

200
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,640
to promote the wine culture.

201
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,630
Besides,

202
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,640
I will set up my first master class.

203
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,040
I'll choose gifted sommeliers

204
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,420
to become my students.

205
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,850
I hope in the future,

206
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,080
in my master class,

207
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,770
a number of excellent Masters of Wine can arise.

208
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,530
Next is the part of blind tasting.

209
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,760
Lady, can you pick a bottle of wine for me?

210
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,580
Me?

211
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,260
Of course, it's you.

212
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,450
She actually met Tianran.

213
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,150
But since she's so gifted,

214
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,710
it's good for her to learn from him.

215
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,630
You must be doing well, my little brother.

216
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you earlier.

217
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,020
I guessed it was you.

218
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,780
But I also thought

219
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,920
it was impossible.

220
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,560
Actually, I prefer the state

221
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,220
when you didn't recognize me.

222
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,130
You know.

223
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,810
When everyone recognizes me,

224
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,490
they will be too enthusiastic.

225
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,150
So I like to hide my identity when I make friends.

226
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,780
By the way,

227
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,710
you'll become a sommelier,

228
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,270
as promised.

229
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,840
But I've never studied abroad.

230

232
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,170
Of course!

233

Without your name or email,

237
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,490
how can I send you the appraisal invitation

238
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,550

239
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,859
You invite me to your master class?

240
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,220
You should join it.

241

All right, it's almost time.

242

I'm going to socialize with others.

243

See you in the later appraisal.

244
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,220
OK.

245
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,550
I'm really happy today.

246

247

I hope we can collaborate on better projects in the future.

248
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,370
Here's to a successful collaboration.

249

You didn't even contact us.

266

You always acted as if someone owed you.

267

Can you go home?

There are a lot of memories at home for you to recall...

271
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,340
Is it necessary to go home?

It's none of your business.

279

I think so.

Yeah. CEO Xu, you're wearing well.

00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,470
I'm Xu Mingchen's little brother,

343
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,820
Xu Tianran.

344
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,430
Yeah. He just came back.

345
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,610
With a special identity,

346
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,040
he keeps a low profile.

347
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,730
Turns out you two are brothers!

348
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,620
No wonder you two look so alike.

349
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,240
Yeah. We don't want to attract media outlets' attention.

350
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,990
Please keep it a secret.

351
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,040
Yeah.

352
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,220
No problem.

353
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,940
A far-off relative is not as helpful as a near neighbor, right?

354
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,950
Don't worry.

355
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,470
Well, I'm sorry.

356
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,050
We've disturbed you. We have to go back.

357
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,580
Bye.

358
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,620
It's okay.

359
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,370
Take care.

360
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,420
Good night. Good night.

361
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,740
As a reporter,

362
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,960
I must investigate him.

363
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,130
[Xu Tianran, the second young master of the Xu family]

364
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,170
Seems that Xu Tianran really exists.

365
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,300
He seems to leave home early.

366
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,630
[Xu Tianran, the second young master of the Xu family, the little brother of Xu Mingchen, left home early and his whereabouts are unknown.]

367
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,650
His whereabouts are unknown?

368
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,840
It seems to me

369
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,280
that he's much younger than Xu Mingchen.

370
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,110
Mingchen.

371
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,750
The roommate of Lu Fenfen is tricky to deal with.

372
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,590
Yes.

373
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,490
She acts unreasonably and she lies

374
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,790
without hesitation.

375
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
You know her?

376
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,720
She's the cleaner who sneaked into my office.

377
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,240
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

378
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,110
Mingchen, we need to pay more attention to this.

379
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,280
I'll ask Secretary An to investigate it.

380
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,850
I think it's quite tricky.

381
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,540
The matter of Lu Fenfen hasn't been settled yet.

382
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,220
Her roommate has sharp eyes.

383
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,180
We can't be careless.

384
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,800
Is it that serious?

385
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,160
You take care of her.

386
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:22,900
You can do it!

387
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,490
Cheers, Le.

388
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,880
[Grandpa]

389
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,400
Lu Fenfen!

390
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,300
Hello?

391
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,540
Fenfen, what are you doing?

392
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,490
Grandpa. I'm Fenfen's friend.

393
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,750
She left her phone at home.

394
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,270
I'm sorry.

395
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,070
I'll call back later.

396
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,840
Fenfen is doing well.

397
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,310
Don't worry, Grandpa.

398
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,190
What? You want to visit Yang Jiannan?

399
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,500
I haven't been busy with my garden recently.

400
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,310
So I want to visit them.

401
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,920
Grandpa, let me tell you.

402
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,090
Yang Jiannan is a scumbag.

403
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,620
Scumbag?

404
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,900
Who?

405
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,020
What should I do?

406
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,320
You're up!

407
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,390
No wonder I couldn't find it.

408
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,160
Turns out I left it at home.

409
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,310
What happened to you?

410
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,700
I caused trouble.
