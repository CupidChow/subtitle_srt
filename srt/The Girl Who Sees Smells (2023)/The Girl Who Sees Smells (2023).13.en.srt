[Episode 13]

4
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,820
Actually, I'm confused.

5
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,220
Logically speaking,

6
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,020
that guy named David

7
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,700
shouldn't have made such a careless mistake

8
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
on such an important day.

9
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,180
Had he really left the leftovers in the fridge by chance?

10
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,660
You mean he colluded with Lu Fenfen?

11
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:00,820
I don't know.

12
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,420
This whole thing looks fishy to me.

13
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,060
You've seen how it ended.

14
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,139
Lu Fenfen got promoted.

15
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,420
You were humiliated.

16
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,020
Director Bai,

17
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,740
I know your intention is good.

18
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,220
You just wanted to impress Mingchen

19
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,820
by getting an influencer to promote our service.

20
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,850
Unfortunately, it didn't work out.

21
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,740
I won't let them get away with it.

22
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,900
What's your plan?

23
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,730
Are you going to fall out with them?

24
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,620
David

25
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,460
has taken all the blame.

26
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,820
He has apologized for his mistake.

27
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,980
Even if you fired him now,

28
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,940
it wouldn't make much difference.

29
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,410
No matter what you do,

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,380
there's no way you can shift the blame to Lu Fenfen.

31
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,420
Director Bai,

32
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,740
I've heard that you and Lu Fenfen

33
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
have been on bad terms for long.

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,460
to the same position as you.

36
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,460
I advise you to take action first.

Me too.

40
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,050
This is a well-proportioned wine

41
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,610
blended from Merlot, Cabernet Franc,

42
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,980
and Cabernet Sauvignon.

43
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,860
Its maturation time

44
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,260
should be more than 20 months.

45
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,140
It offers rich fruit flavors

46
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,780
supported by fine-grained tannins.

47
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,420
Most people would like it.

48
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,460
You're right.

49

But it's not good enough.

To be the new wine of a Master of Wine,

51
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,180
it needs something

52
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
that makes it stand out.

You're such an ingrate.

the biggest difference this year

82
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,100
is that we'll buy more domestic wines

83

to keep up with the new trends.

84

They've started to gain ground.

86
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,900
We should talk with potential suppliers as soon as possible

87

Any objections?

111
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,220
Lu Fenfen has never purchased wines before.

She's a director like you.

Director Lu,

117

Don't let him down.

119
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,980
Secretary An is biased in favor of her.

120
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,980
That's why we need to plan ahead.

121

Director Bai,

122
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,020
as you said, Lu Fenfen

123
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,460
has no purchase experience at all.

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,740
finish this important task?

It's so late. Of course I'm worried.

156
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,820
Sorry.

157
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,260
I've been too busy at work recently

158
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,420
and didn't spend much time with you.

159

You're the best.

160

You know you're my favorite person in the world.

161

I'm your boyfriend.

166
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,740
It naturally makes him your brother.

167
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,540
You smiled.

168
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,740
It means you're not angry anymore.

Let me tell you something.

to make my own wine today.

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,580
But I haven't decided yet.

175
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,100
I have so much on my plate recently.

176
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,860
You want me

177
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,020
to lighten your load?

178
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,700
No.

179
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,740
I'm thinking about what to do.

180
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,380
I need to attend the business at the winery first

181
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,180
and then do my job as the director.

182
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,420
After all that, I can work on my wine.

183
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm glad you know the priorities.

184
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,460
Of course I know.

185
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm just so excited.

186
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,220
You know me.

187
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,660
I've always wanted to make my own wine.

188
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,860
It'll be cheap and high-quality.

189
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,900
You know what?

190
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,060
As the saying goes,

191
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,020
you can't have your cake and eat it.

192
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,460
I understand.

193
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,380
But those high-end wines are too expensive.

194
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,700
Normal people can't afford them.

195
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,900
I'll make a wine

196
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,060
that everyone can afford.

197
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,100
You don't believe me?

198
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,980
I know wine is not just a kind of drink

199
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,460
for people like you.

200
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,260
It's also a symbol of status.

201
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,700
That's why you prefer luxurious wines.

202
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,140
I told you this before.

203
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,340
My father started from scratch.

204
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,010
He wanted to make cheap wines too.

205
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,700
Really?

206
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,540
You never talked about

207
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,580
your father before.

208
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,860
I miss him.

209
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,340
That accident back then

210
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,620
changed both my and Tianran's lives.

How did you know about it?

Lu Fenfen can be in charge

about the wine industrial chain.

261

264

You don't like wine at all.

265
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,260
Wine is just a beverage

that you drink now and then.

Most importantly,

268
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,850
Xu Mingchen doesn't care about you at all.

Why do you think so highly of Lu Fenfen?

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,060
Just because she's talented?

344
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,100
Okay.

345
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,220
I'll report to Director Bai and Mr. Xu.

[Xu Mingchen]

348
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,900
Welcome home.

349
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,100
Have a seat.

350
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
I made steak.

351
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,300
I brought you a bottle of good wine.

352
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,140
What's the brand?

353
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,420
I've never seen it before.

354
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,050
Well,

355
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,140
it's the wine from a new supplier.

356
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,940
It's very cost-effective.

357
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,060
You should thank me

358
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,290
for saving a lot of money for the hotel.

359
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,540
A good price is very important, but that's not

360
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,260
the only standard in choosing suppliers.

361
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
I know.

362
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,900
I checked every bottle

363
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,100
of the sample wine they sent us.

364
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,620
I didn't find any problem.

365
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,060
They once provided wines

366
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,980
to the supermarket I worked in before.

367
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,020
They're trustworthy.

368
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,980
Why didn't you buy wines from our old suppliers?

369
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,500
Because this wine has better value for money.

370
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,380
What's wrong?

371
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,300
You don't agree with what I said?

372
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,610
When big companies make purchases,

373
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,780
they usually choose

374
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,620
the brands with the highest market share

375
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,540
or the brands that they've been working with for a long time.

376
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,740
These brands neither offer the lowest price

377
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,500
nor the best products.

378
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,780
Do you know why?

379
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,660
No.

380
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,060
Because if anything goes wrong with the products,

381
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,220
the one in charge of the purchase won't be held accountable.

382
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,700
That's why big companies

383
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,700
waste lots of money every year.

384
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,930
You'll be weeded out by the market one day.

385
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,580
Someone like me can help you

386
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,260
reform the old way of doing things.

387
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,460

Do you trust my judgment now?

Isn't it great?

396
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,100
Not at all.

397
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,530
Too suggestive.

398
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,860

I didn't show it to anyone but you.

400

I didn't even show it to Qiao Yi.

401

You thought of showing it to Qiao Yi?

402
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,740
Photos like that should be kept secret.

403
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,770
Don't show it to anyone.

It's unbelievable that such a big hotel sells fake wine.

whether it's just an accident

501

or you did it deliberately

It's my fault.

I let you down.

all the samples the supplier sent us.

510
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,460
The samples were perfectly fine.

511

David is right.

00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,340
We checked the sample wine

514
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
bottle by bottle.

515
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,580
We didn't miss any problem.

516
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,420
We must have missed some important clue.

517
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,260
Mr. Xu.

518
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,260
What's the point of saying that now?

519
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,660
I'll investigate what you said.

520
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,300
Everyone, buck up and get things under control.

521
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,500
We don't want to hit headlines again.

522
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,740
Yes.

523
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,980
Ms. Xu,

524
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,740
Director Lu…

525
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,940
Lu Fenfen will be suspended for investigation.

526
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,460
No decisions will be made before the truth is out.

527
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,660
[Shocker! Anda Hotel sold fake wine. Several consumers are hospitalized.]

528
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,420
Why are you still here?

529
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,940
Waiting to get off work?

530
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,340
Things are not clear yet.

531
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,860
You can't ask me to leave.

532
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,610
Ms. Xu suspended you in front of so many people.

533
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,900
I feel so embarrassed for you.

534
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,660
Pack up and leave.

535
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,780
I need to lock the door.

536
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,700
I'll leave when I want. Mind your own business.

537
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,140
Okay. I'll lock the door in half an hour.

538
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,180
If you're still here,

539
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,580
I'll call security.
