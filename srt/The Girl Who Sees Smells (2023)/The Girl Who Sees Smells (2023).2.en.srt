[Episode 2]

4
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,210
May I ask,

5
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,390
are you single?

6
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,210
Why do you ask this question?

7
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,250
Sir.

8
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,930
Does her relationship status

9
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,190
have anything to do with you buying wine?

10
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,620
Yes.

11
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,190
I have a boyfriend, sir.

12
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,000
Is he your boyfriend?

13
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,900
No, this is my boss.

14
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,050
Good! He is your boss!

15
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,190
Sir, why do I feel like

16
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,199
you are like an old friend to me?

17
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,410
Sir. Sir!

18
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,210
It's good that he's your boss.

19
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,220
That's good!

20
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,820
Here's the thing.

21
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,240
I

22
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,130
thank you very much for buying wine here.

23
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,430
But I don't think

24
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,190
I'm obliged to tell you about my private life.

25
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,850
And my boyfriend is handsome.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,550
I...

27
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,740
[Senior]

28
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,500
Jiannan.

29
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,150
What's wrong? You're not replying to my messages.

30
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,120
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,340
Did you fail the exam?

32
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,079
It's okay. We can always take the exam again.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
You'll pass the exam one day, right?

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,410
Are you free later?

35
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,650
Is he going to propose?

36
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,760
Yes.

37
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,390
What do you want to tell me?

38
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm not only going to tell you something,

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,970
but I'm also going to introduce you to the most important person in my life.

40
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,080
The most important person?

41
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,700
Leader.

42
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:20,840
Fenfen.

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,150
Is Jiannan

44
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,829
going to propose to me?

45
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,050
No way.

46
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,130
Leader, I need to take a leave.

47
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,310
I have to go back and dress up.

48
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,460
Be careful! Fenfen.

49
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,570
Oh my god.

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,030
God wants Xu Mingchen dead.

51
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,950
Thank you.

52
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,010
Miss, what would you like to order?

53
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,320
I'll order later.

54
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,280
I'm waiting for someone.

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,790
Okay.

56
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,670
You've been waiting for a long time, right?

57
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,270
No, I just arrived.

58
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,190
Fenfen, let me introduce her to you.

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,279
This is the most important woman in my life.

60
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,370
Hello, aunt.

61
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,120
My fiancée.

62
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,850
Fiancée?

63
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,370
Aren't you going to introduce me to your mom?

64
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,610
What are you talking about? What mom?

65
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,909
Lu Fenfen.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,210
She is my fiancée.

67
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,990
I have to confess to you now.

68
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,090
When we were together,

69
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,690
I was just a little boy who knew nothing about love.

70
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,700
I was with you,

71
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,420
because you were nice to me.

72
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,150
I had no idea what true love was

73
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,920
until Ms. Chen showed up one day.

74
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,659
Ms. Chen?

75
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,470
True love?

76
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,990
Lu Fenfen.

77
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,310
Actually, you know that too.

78
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,000
There's no love between us.

79
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,540
We're just losers

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,060
looking for warmth from each other.

81
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,460
Three years.

82
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,000
I've been with you for three years.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You said there's no love between us?

84
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,080
So,

85
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,340
I don't think I can hold you up anymore.

86
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,620
I'm in pain too.

87
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,410
I tossed and turned and thought about it for several nights.

88
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,230
I can't lie to myself anymore.

89
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,060
I don't have the vocation to be a civil servant.

90
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,870
You can only live a poor life

91
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,050
if you are with me.

92
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,770
But you never asked.

93
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,340
I don't mind living a poor life.

94
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,520
But I don't want to.

95
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,370
Don't be so stubborn.

96
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,480
This world is very realistic.

97
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,330
Yang Jiannan.

98
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,530
I always thought you work hard.

99
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,060
So I've always supported your dream.

100
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,200
But I didn't expect you to be so despicable

101
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,740
and shameless.

102
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,310
What are you talking about?

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,970
Ms. Chen is my true love.

104
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,120
Don't think about us with your sleazy thoughts.

105
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,260
I'm sleazy?

106
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,450
Yes, I am.

107
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,480
Every day I spent with you for the past three years

108
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,860
was very sleazy.

109
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,290
I didn't expect

110
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,620
I have been living with a piece of rubbish.

111
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,920
Who do you call rubbish? Are you crazy?

112
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,530
I'm not crazy.

113
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,830
He's just a piece of trash,

114
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,670
and the sleaziest one in the trash.

115
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,720
Say that again!

116
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,330
Aunt, it's not good to hit someone, right?

117
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,050
Who are you?

118
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,600
How dare you touch my woman?

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,530
What do you want?

120
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,810
Are you okay, Nan?

121
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,020
You...

122
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,920
This is your taste?

123
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,060
So you knew each other long ago.

124
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,650
What's your relationship with her?

125
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,910
It doesn't matter.

126
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,900
The most important thing is to beat a scumbag.

127
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,380
We've heard everything clearly.

128
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,090
Don't you just feel tired

129
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,400
and want to take a shortcut

130
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
and find a sugar mom as well?

131
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,830
We are truly in love!

132
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,720
True love?

133
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,950
Your true love is really invincible.

134
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,680
It can go beyond the 30-year age

135
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,310
and wealth gap.

136
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,280
Actually,

137
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,100
we respect true love very much.

138
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,980
But your order is wrong.

139
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,710
Normally, when a person finds his true love,

140
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,850
he will break up with his current girlfriend first

141
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,310
then be with his true love.

142
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,540
But you...

143
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,380
You come to break up with your girlfriend

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,200
with your true love in your arms.

145
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,050
This is the first time I have ever seen this.

146
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,430
Is there anyone in charge here?

147
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,830
I want to call the police.

148
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,380
Call the police?

149
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,630
Go ahead.

150
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,070
I just took a video

151
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,400
of you trying to hit her.

152
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,010
If anyone wants to call the police,

153
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,990
it will be this lady who calls them first.

154
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,880
I'll give you five seconds.

155
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,010
Apologize to her immediately.

156
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,230
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,320
Louder!

158
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,190
I'm sorry, Lu Fenfen! I was wrong.

159
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,600
Get lost.

160
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,230
Thank you.

161
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,560
Why am I so busy?

162
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,960
People call me every day.

163
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,930
Hello?

164
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,130
Lili.

165
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,110
What's the matter, Lili?

166
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,150
Lili.

167
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,540
Send me your location.

168
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,400
Why did he leave?

169
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,170
He has enough?

170
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,580
Maybe something came up.

171
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,310
You should stop drinking too.

172
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,170
Do you need a taxi to send you home?

173
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,940
I don't want to go back.

174
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,980
I want to go back to my childhood.

175
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,100
I was so carefree.

176
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,170
When I'm happy, I'll drink.

177
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,250
If I'm unhappy, I'll sleep.

178
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,400
I thought

179
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:47,340
I would be with my boyfriend forever.

180
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,990
And

181
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,990
I can bring Grandpa here to live with us.

182
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,950
It's nice to be with the family.

183
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,600
Brother.

184
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,080
You're a minor.

185
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,160
Don't be so nostalgic like me.

186
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,640
What's wrong with her?

187
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,510
She likes to be the big sister?

188
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,990
Sometimes,

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,570
you need to wipe away your own tears and sweat.

190
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,740
Is this how your millennium generation

191
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,290
comforts people?

192
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,570
What millennium generation?

193
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,970
I'm more mature than you.

194
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,960
And I'll never come to this point like you.

195
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,350
Let me tell you a secret.

196
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,830
I have a perfect sense of taste.

197
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,730
As long as I have drunk that wine,

198
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,510
I will never forget its taste.

199
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,280
My blind tasting is super amazing.

200
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,390
I don't know if you're good at blind tasting.

201
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,820
But I know you're drunk now.

202
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,790
Straighten your tongue first.

203
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,630
My tongue is very straight.

204
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,820
I don't need you to lecture me.

205
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,010
Why do I feel that you are unhappy?

206
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,750
Let me tell you.

207
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,490
I am a very loyal person.

208
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,210
Today,

209
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,560
you helped me.

210
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,380
So you'll be my brother from now on.

211
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,570
If anything happens,

212
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,910
just tell me.

213
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,170
I'll help you.

214
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,410
I can't do this.

215
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,530
You can do it only when we're in a relationship.

216
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,260
Although I just broke up,

217
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,030
I can't

218
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,380
just date anybody.

219
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,450
Especially a little brother like you.

220
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,640
Actually, I don't want to date you either.

221
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,910
Can we go home now?

222
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,320
Do you know where your home is?

223
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,380
You look down on me.

224
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,330
I can handle liquor.

225
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,310
Of course, I remember where I live.

226
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,140
My home. My home is...

227
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,120
My home is...

228
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,410
Where is your key?

229
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,950
The fingerprint is the key.

230
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,940
Open it.

231
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,400
The door is opened.

232
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,460
You are home.

233
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,690
I can't walk anymore.

234
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,840
Carry me.

235
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,130
Who are you?

236
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,770
Why are you here?

237
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,780
You don't remember anything?

238
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,400
You are...

239
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,070
You're the one who kissed me without my permission.

240
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,660
How dare you kiss me

241
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,940
without my permission?

242
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,240
I want... I want to go to the toilet.

243
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,100
I want to throw up.

244
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,020
Why is the data getting better all of a sudden?

245
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,780
I must have drank too much last night again.

246
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,280
[I'll be a donkey if I ever get drunk again!]

247
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,800
Why are you here?

248
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,310
Do you still have a headache?

249
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,880
You really don't remember anything?

250
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,600
I remember.

251
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,740
I remember that you helped me yesterday.

252
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,270
Do you need help with moving?

253
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,610
Sure.

254
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,490
No need.

255
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,800
We just moved here.

256
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,760
Hope we can be good neighbors.

257
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,910
No problem. Fate brought us together.

258
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,310
My name is Lu Fenfen.

259
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,900
Nice to meet you.

260
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,770
My name is He Le.

261
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,190
OK.

262
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,829
No, I...

263
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,130
What are you doing so early in the morning?

264
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,480
Leader, you scared me.

265
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,030
Well, Fenfen...

266
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,470
Were you okay last night?

267
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,030
You knew?

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The proposal turned into a breakup.

269
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,650
Really?

270
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,170
You don't know?

271
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,350
I don't know.

272
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,060
Why are you laughing?

273
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:46,830
No.

274
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,760
Fenfen, well...

275
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,570
Last night,

276
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,630
I was worried about you.

277
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,150
So I went to your house to check on you.

278
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,320
I just wanted to check on you.

279
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,120
When I got to your door,

280
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
it didn't lock.

281
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,850
So I instinctively

282
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,710
peered through

283
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,210
that crack.

284
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,900
There was boy, you know?

285
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,540
He...

286
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,830
He kissed you without your permission.

287
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,880
What?

288
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,580
Yijiang!

289
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,500
No, Mingchen.

290
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,140
You're only one year older than Yijiang and me.

291
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,800
Why are you so old-fashioned?

292
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,260
I'm not interested in superficial things.

293
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,860
What happened last night?

294
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,580
Why were you reported?

295
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,680
Sexual harassment?

296
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,740
That's called a "One Night Stand".

297
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,940
That was an accident.

298
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,680
You mean,

299
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,890
I was drunk.

300
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,550
And a boy about the age of a high school student

301
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,480
was trying to sexually assault me?

302
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,500
You! Go away!

303
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,970
Get down!

304
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,500
Then you called the police.

305
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,110
Well, Fenfen...

306
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,540
This was a misunderstanding.

307
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,270
No, I misunderstood.

308
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,420
I heard from the caller that

309
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,020
he saw you

310
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,870
molesting the lady in the house.

311
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,960
Yes, that's him.

312
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,430
He was topless just now.

313
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,570
No, I was just passing by.

314
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,960
Just passing by?

315
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,600
Just passing by, officers. What a coincidence!

316
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,950
You just happened to pass by her door at night.

317
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,240
-I... -Right?

318
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,140
I'm her neighbor.

319
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,260
He is actually your neighbor.

320
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,590
Finish your sentence in one breath next time.

321
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,840
You scared me!

322
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,710
What a coincidence!

323
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,550
Speaking of which,

324
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,830
you have to thank me.

325
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,210
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able

326
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,350
sit here and act like nothing happened.

327
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,190
By the way.

328
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,570
Last night,

329
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,170
after I sent you the message,

330
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,060
how did you take care of this matter?

331
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,390
What's your relationship with this lady?

332
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,460
Officers,

333
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,180
we work in the same supermarket.

334
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,310
I'm her team leader.

335
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,620
So you're colleagues?

336
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,290
Yes.

337
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,230
Since you two are just colleagues, why did you come to her house so late?

338
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,750
[Emergency. I must live next door to Lu Fenfen. Help me fix this.]

339
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,580
Officer.

340
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,850
No, I called the police.

341
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,120
Hello, is this the owner of

342
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,140
room 110, Unit 1, Building 12, Huasheng Garden Community?

343
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,290
Hello, is this the tenant of Room 110?

344
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,430
The owner of your house

345
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,020
needs to sell it urgently.

346
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,410
I just moved in.

347
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,800
Lying. Thief!

348
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,270
Since you just moved in,

349
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,240
prove it.

350
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,560
-[Is it done? -Yes.]

351
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,630
The door is open.

352
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,470
No, he...

353
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,570
Oh my god.

354
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,950
We're just like God.

355
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,300
I even admire myself.

356
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,820
Really.

357
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,460
Le worries about you all day long.

358
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,540
The house is settled now.

359
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,340
Let's get to the point.

360
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,770
What point?

361
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,140
Kiss. Life-saving kiss.

362
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,930
Full of twists and turns.

363
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,550
I thought I was the heroine of some idol drama.

364
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,800
Thank you for yesterday.

365
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,770
It's nothing.

366
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,760
What's wrong? Are you off?

367
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,910
It's an old problem.

368
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,450
Do you want to try my secret prescription?

369
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,560
Sure.

370
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,400
Thank you.

371
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,530
How is it? Doesn't it smell good?

372
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,180
It's hot.

373
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,730
Is it that bad?

374
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,260
It's my first time drinking it. It tastes good.

375
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,920
Do you treat everyone like this?

376
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,960
I think

377
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,590
you are too warm and kind.

378
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,440
That's why you were cheated by a scumbag.

379
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,620
I've reflected on this.

380
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
Am I a pushover?

381
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,710
But after thinking about it,

382
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,310
it's my responsibility

383
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,240
to be nice to him as his girlfriend.

384
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,730
He cheated on me, but that doesn't mean I did anything wrong.

385
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,870
And if I hadn't saved you,

386
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,930
you wouldn't have helped me yesterday.

387
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,820
So good people will be rewarded.

388
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,420
Aren't you sad?

389
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,610
I was sad at first.

390
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,260
You're so optimistic.

391
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,650
Of course.

392
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,050
Because life still goes on.

393
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,800
You

394
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,350
finish the rest in the pot.

395
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,490
I should go back.

396
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,510
Lu Fenfen.

397
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,780
What kind of person are you?

398
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,980
Do I really have to pursue you?

399
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,260
The ice cream is so delicious.

400
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,990
The flavor of the wine inside is so authentic.

401
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,800
It's like walking in a vineyard.

402
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,950
[Phillip, Master of French Wine]

403
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,590
Phillip!

404
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,990
Phillip!

405
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,200
Isn't this the youngest master of wine

406
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,840
in your magazine?

407
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,070
It's him.

408
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,140
Let me tell you.

409
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,300
The master of wine is the highest level

410
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,540
above a sommelier and a wine taster.

411
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,890
That's the symbol of authority.

412
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,920
Is he going back to China?

413
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,520
Do I get to meet him?

414
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,400
Dr Jian, the test report is out.

415
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,660
What did it say?

416
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,540
It's the same as the first time.

417
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,140
Growth hormone is normal.

418
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,740
All indicators of blood pressure, heart rate, and hemoglobin count

419
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,170
are back to normal.

420
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,480
Mingchen.

421
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,320
From the current situation,

422
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,080
Lu Fenfen's kiss

423
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,480
is helpful to some extent

424
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,520
with your rejuvenation syndrome.

425
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,540
Mingchen,

426
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,040
I want to give it a try.

427
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,080
Try what?

428
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,340
Your kiss won't help!

429
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,010
What else?

430
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,440
At present,

431
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,870
I don't think you're healed.

432
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,010
Your condition is just stable.

433
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,970
The effect of the bioenzyme

434
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,900
will weaken as time goes by.

435
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,910
How long can the effect of one kiss last?

436
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,560
It's hard to tell the exact time.

437
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,820
But after 24 hours,

438
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,450
the concentration of the bioenzyme in your body

439
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,670
will basically be zero.

440
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,470
No, Mingchen.

441
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,060
Let me try it for you.

442
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,900
So the problem now is,

443
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,790
how can you make Lu Fenfen kiss you?
