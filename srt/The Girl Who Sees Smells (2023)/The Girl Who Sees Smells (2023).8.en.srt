[Episode 8]

4
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,259
Who are you?

5
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,660
Tianran.

6
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,120
Let me send him home first.

7
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,580
I'll take you home first.

8
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,310
Let's split up to find her.

9
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,630
Mingchen!

10
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,340
I can move small items

11
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,700
myself!

12
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,060
You're the one who moved house for me?

13
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,820
Tianran!

14
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,780
Tianran!

15
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,740
Help me!

16
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,260
Tianran!

17
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,380
Hey. Dude.

18
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
You can't keep running anymore, can you?

19
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,500
I... I can still run.

20
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,890
Listen.

21
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,980
If you keep chasing after me,

22
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,820
it'll be dawn.

23
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,000
Can you stop chasing after me?

24
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,510
We can talk about it.

25
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,940
You stop chasing after me.

26
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,130
I won't call the police, okay?

27
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,340
If you dare, I'll kill you!

28
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,180
I won't call the police! I won't!

29
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,940
But you have no other way,

30
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,690
besides letting me go, right?

31
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,300
You can't run faster than me!

32
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,180
When I was in middle school,

33
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,910
I was a member of the women's track and field team!

34
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,860
In this world,

35
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,700
few men can run faster than me!

36
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,660
So what?

37
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,740
It's unlucky for you to fall off!

38
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,700
Don't leave!

39
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,820
If you don't pull me up,

40
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,780
I'll call the police now!

41
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,100
Wait!

42
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,380
Have you seen a young girl?

43
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,500
No!

44
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,510
Did we meet somewhere before?

45
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,380
Help! Help!

46
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,420
Is anyone up there?

47
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,900
I'm so stupid.

48
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,260
If I knew this would happen,

49
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,620
I wouldn't care about his age.

50
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,540
I swear

51
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,940
as long as I can get out alive,

52
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,250
I will...

53
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,060
I will tell him how I feel.

54
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:52,380
Xu Tianran, I'm fond of you!

55
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,380
Fenfen?

56
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,980
Lu Fenfen, is that you?

57
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,620
Xu Tianran!

58
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,420
Xu Tianran!

59
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,020
I'm down here.

60
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,140
Come and save...

61
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Give me your hand.

62
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,340
Okay.

63
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,150
Hold my hand.

64
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,780
Are you okay?

65
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,940
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,730
I didn't expect I was so heavy.

67
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,780
I'll lose weight when I get out.

68
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,820
Hurry and kiss me.

69
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,820
Now?

70
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,390
You still think about this?

71
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,180
♫Because you are my love♫

72
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,430
♫Answer is unnecessary to prove it♫

73
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,070
♫Buried in my heart♫

74
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:09,300
♫I can't suppress my love♫

00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,610
♫Because you are my love♫

76
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:21,870
♫I'd rather sacrifice the whole world for you♫

77
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,020
♫Quiet just like now♫

78
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,780
Lu Fenfen.

79
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:32,920
♫Gaze at every tide♫

80
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,700
Promise me

81
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,180
you will stay close to me.

82
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Anyway, I can find you whenever and wherever possible,

83
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,570
and I can kiss you anytime.

84
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,260
♫Because you are my love♫

85
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:53,409
♫Answer is unnecessary to prove it♫

86
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,780
Where can Fenfen go?

87
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
♫Buried in my heart♫

88
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,260
Now, Tianran is lost.

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,700
I wonder how he is now.

90
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,300
What's there to worry about?

91
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,840
Fenfen is weaker than him.

92
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,170
You won't know even if I tell you.

93
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,000
Just say it.

94
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,180
God bless them!

95
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,380
Stop!

96
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,820
Something is wrong with him.

97
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,780
I'll take care of him.

98
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,260
Are you the reincarnation of a heroine?

99
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,060
It's nothing.

100
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,340
As a reporter,

101
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,260
I met much more dangerous cases

102
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,180
than this.

103
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,220
It's quite normal for me.

104
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,380
Let me ask you!

105
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,840
Where did that girl go?

106
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,700
I don't know!

107
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,159
You don't know?

108
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,340
Fenfen!

109
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,730
Move!

110
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,220
Fenfen!

111
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,020
Come here!

112
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,740
Are you okay?

113
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:14,980
Come here!

114
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,040
Did the bad guy take advantage of you?

115
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm fine. Don't worry.

116
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,420
Why is he here?

117
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,890
Wait.

118
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,980
I remember.

119
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,610
So,

120
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,420
are we together now?

121
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,940
Are you awake?

122
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,980
I just woke up.

123
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,100
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

124
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,420
I'm fine.

125
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,860
The doctor just said

126
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,940
my back muscle was pulled a little.

127
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,060
It's okay.

128
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,440
Really? Let me see. Is it serious?

129
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,780
What?

130
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,060
I have something to tell you.

131
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,980
What a coincidence. I have something to tell you too.

132
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,940
You first.

133
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,980
It's nothing.

134
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,900
I just want to tell you

135
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,420
don't be too impulsive.

136
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,100
Don't put yourself in danger.

137
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,420
You almost died this time.

138
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,030
You may not know.

139
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,190
If anything happens to you,

140
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,150
I can't live either.

141
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,740
Really?

142
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,940
Okay, I promise you.

143
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,060
That's all.

144
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,800
It's your turn.

145
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,820
What I want to say is...

146
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,740
How should I put it?

147
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,100
Is it love at first sight

148
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,260
or love that grows over time?

149
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,520
What's wrong with you?

150
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,550
I think you're thirsty.

151
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,200
The doctor said your leg was fine.

152
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,980
But you still need to rest.

153
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,100
After drinking this glass of water,

154
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,560
you should get more sleep.

155
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,860
Okay.

156
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,900
How did Xu Tianran

157
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,460
find Lu Fenfen?

158
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,540
There are some kilometers away according to the map.

159
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,340
Even a cat or a rabbit

160
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,300
can't hear such a faraway sound, right?

161
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,100
What's so strange about that?

162
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,950
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

163
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,300
I don't think so.

164
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,530
Maybe Tianran and Fenfen

165
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,560
are physically connected to each other.

166
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,300
Because of this connection,

167
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,140
he can sense her danger

168
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,180
and find where she is.

169
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,820
Are you satisfied with this explanation, Le?

170
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,100
You mean Mary Sue?

171
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,860
Nonsense. Who would believe that?

172
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,940
Do you believe it?

173
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,330
Let's go.

174
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,320
Look.

175
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,820
Tianran, what I want to say is

176
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,780
that I'm fond of you.

177
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,130
I've liked you for a long time.

178
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,220
No, no.

179
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,400
This is too straightforward.

180
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,740
Tianran.

181
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,500
Didn't I tell you

182
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,540
that you should respect and show gratitude to

183
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,980
a sister next door

184
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,680
and that you shouldn't have any improper thoughts, right?

185
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,540
But I take it back now.

186
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,850
Because I have improper thoughts about you.

187
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,890
That's good. That's it.

188
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,030
You're here!

189
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,310
Why didn't you go in?

190
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,850
Don't be shy. It's okay.

191
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,780
Behave yourself!

192
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,010
Come on.

193
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,820
I didn't notice that before.

194
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,880
How did you hide it?

195
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,220
What's wrong?

196
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,260
So happy.

197
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,610
Did she really say that?

198
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,330
[Cats would look for Anoectochilus when they are dying.]

199
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,590
What did you say?

200
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,980
She admitted that

201
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,970
she had liked me for a long time?

202
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,240
[Cats would look for Anoectochilus when they are dying.]

203
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,220
Yes, that's what she said.

204
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,920
Mingchen, let me tell you.

205
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,980
She wanted to tell you how she felt for you.

206
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,510
Unluckily, she ran into us.

207
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,020
Otherwise, she could make it!

208
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,620
You know?

209
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,820
Leave it to me.

210
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,780
He Le, do me a favor.

211
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,220
How about a French restaurant?

212
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,080
Prepare the best red wine.

213
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,540
Okay, you can count on me.

214
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,260
Mingchen's response last night

215
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,240
may even affect the trend of medicine in the future.

216
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,860
That's the instinct of mammals.

217
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
Stop saying that.

218
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,100
Telling Lu Fenfen how he feels

219
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,420
is just his instinct.

220
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,640
Qingran.

221
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,420
Qingran.

222
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,120
You guys continue.

223
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,950
We have to go.

224
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,040
You look younger than before.

225
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,610
Are you okay?

226
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,180
Sister.

227
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,020
You scared me.

228
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,150
I didn't expect it to be a such big deal.

229
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,920
I just wanted to pick Fenfen up.

230
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,180
Can Fenfen save you

231
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,380
just as Yijiang said?

232
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,370
Don't worry.

233
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,460
I didn't expect your girlfriend

234
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,800
to be the type like her,

235
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,940
but as long as she can save you,

236
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,980
I don't mind.

237
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,220
Sister, I'm with her

238
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,660
not to save my life.

239
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,340
I really love her.

240
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,790
And she really loves me.

241
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,700
Okay. Everything will be all right,

242
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,900
if only you are fine.

243
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,900
Does Fenfen know that she can save you?

244
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,880
Then you must keep it a secret.

245
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,740
Girls still mind this kind of thing.

246
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,740
Since we're in love,

247
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,990
I don't want to hide it from her.

248
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,440
Are you going to tell her everything?

249
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,250
Yes.

250
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,410
I suggest

251
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,300
you should not tell her.

252
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,220
You've just started dating,

253
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,860
and your relationship is not so stable.

254
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,860
And Fenfen is so young.

255
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,080
If you tell her,

256
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,140
she might not understand that much.

257
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,730
Why don't you tell her

258
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
when your relationship is stabler?

259
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,660
And your current situation

260
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,900
is quite subtle.

261
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,590
Once a person has his true love,

262
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,390
it's like he has a weakness even if he wears armor.

263
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,340
What if someone puts her at a disadvantage?

264
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,580
The group is complicated.

265
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,740
She's lucky to escape this time.

266
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,460
But if she gets involved in family trouble,

267
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,470
I don't think it's a good thing.

268
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,130
[Xu Tianran Are you asleep?]

269
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,770
[Xu Tianran What are you doing?]

270
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,410
[Are you asleep? Send.]

271
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,030
[Xu Tianran: Are you asleep?]

272
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,500
[Xu Tianran: Are you asleep?]

273
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,680
[No, what are you doing?]

274
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,560
[No, what are you doing?]

275
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,650
[Anda Hotel]

276
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,840
[Xu Tianran]

277
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,860
Fenfen.

278
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,660
Why do you keep laughing?

279
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,940
Do you think it's funny

280
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,350
that David may be fired?

281
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,540
No.

282
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,660
Why would I laugh at David?

283
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,500
But you kept laughing.

284
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
Did I?

285
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,500
Sorry.

286
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,460
I may not manage my facial expressions well.

287
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,210
Are you confident that you will not be knocked out of the team

288
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,090
in the system of the elimination of the least competent?

289
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,570
I'm not worried about that.

290
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,140
Because I've figured out a solution.

291
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,610
What can you do?

292
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,180
Does the system stipulate

293
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,580
that one will be expelled

294
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,750
if he ranks last for two months in a row?

295
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,730
That's it!

296
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,300
If no one

297
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,240
ranks last for two months in a row,

298
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,700
everyone will be safe.

299
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,180
Right?

300
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,090
Yes.

301
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,340
That makes sense.

302
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,570
But will it work?

303
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,250
Of course!

304
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,220
David, let me tell you.

305
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,460
I'll be the last one this month.

306
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,460
Really?

307
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,820
Thank you, Fenfen.

308
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,100
Nothing.

309
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,620
Lu Fenfen.

310
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,700
You've only been here for a short time and now you're against me.

311
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,700
Wait and see.

312
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,300
I heard that some sommeliers would take turns

313
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,260
to be the last one to evade the rule

314
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,140
that one will be expelled if he ranks last in sales for two months in a row.

315
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,180
Is that true?

316
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,140
Who proposed it?

317
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,820
If you want to protect her,

318
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,900
you'll be expelled together!

319
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,660
David!

320
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,510
Do you know who it is?

321
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,460
I...

322
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,420
It's me.

323
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,620
Lu Fenfen.

324
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,060
You tried every means to avail yourself of the loopholes

325
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,120
just because you're not good enough.

326
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,860
I told you earlier

327
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,260
that you were not suitable for the red wine industry.

328
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,620
And you are not qualified

329
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,260
to be Anda's sommelier.

330
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,700
Director Bai.

331
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,580
A sommelier is responsible for

332
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,670
providing drink service and counseling for customers.

333
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,820
A sommelier should put high-quality service and a professional attitude

334
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,880
in the first place.

335
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,940
If one only wants to sell red wine,

336
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,800
things will definitely go wrong.

337
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,180
And if customers get sick of

338
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,620
the promotion,

339
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,620
as time passes by,

340
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,950
the hotel's reputation will be affected.

341
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,590
You're being unreasonable

342
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,700
because you can't sell red wine.

343
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,420
Then why can everyone else achieve their sales targets?

344
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,620
According to you,

345
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,810
Anda doesn't need any profits anymore?

346
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,780
There are so many sommeliers in our hotel.

347
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,300
Some bought red wine themselves

348
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,740
to meet the targets.

349
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,260
Some promoted it to their family and friends.

350
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,420
In the app,

351
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,370
many clients said

352
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,890
we pushed our red wine unduly.

353
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,340
If it

354
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,940
affects the hotel's occupancy

355
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,180
and brand effect,

356
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,500
won't it harm the company more?

357
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,380
You...

358
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:52,940
Enough.

359
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,060
What Lu Fenfen said makes sense.

360
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,590
What else do you want to say?

361
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,580
I suggest canceling the system.

362
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,790
What about you, Mr. Xu?

363
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,840
Every rule and regulation of the company

364
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,580
is decided by the board of directors through discussion.

365
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,830
The system of the elimination of the least competent

366
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,740
was created after the board of directors took everything into consideration.

367
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,300
If it's abolished

368
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,980
just because an employee at the grassroots level wants it to be abolished,

369
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,580
isn't it ridiculous?

370
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,660
Is the board of directors just a joke?

371
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,380
Mr. Xu is right.

372
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,260

374
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,440
and wait for his decision.

375
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,860
I see.

376
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,500
Both parties have a point.

377
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,820
I asked the Marketing Department to investigate it.

378
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,410
Our company's reputation in the industry indeed declined

379
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,100
because of this.

380

the latest news released by the company.

395
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,820

But he doesn't seem to appreciate your kindness.

Instead, he made you embarrassed.

Mr. Xu, I respect all the decisions released by the company.

Hello, Tianran.

Let me tell you.

409
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,380
The company agreed

410

to cancel the system of the elimination of the least competent.

411

Really?

412
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,660
I didn't expect Boss to agree.

413
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,500
I thought he wouldn't.

414
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,330
After all, I'm so young

415

416
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,840
But I didn't expect

417
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,700
he had the same thought as me.

418

I admire him so much all of a sudden!

419
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,180
Let me ask you.

420

423

He's a boss!

Why would he like me?

425

Fine. You remember everything.

Tell me what kind of wine you chose.

I chose

00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,180
the co-fermentation of Bordeaux and Cabernet Sauvignon.

479
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,580
It tasted mellow.

480
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,980
And it was not produced in a big chateau.

481
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,060
So it hasn't reached the mature period yet.

482

00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,180
Why? Are you suspecting me?

518
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,540
The man standing in front of you

519
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,090
drank tens of thousands of bottles of red wine.

520
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,420
But how did this happen?

521
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,090
Someone added grape juice to your wine.

522
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,070
Grape juice can provide extra sweetness.

523
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,260
The sourness and smell are similar to wine.

524
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,700
It's hard to tell.

525
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,800
A smart manoeuvre.

526
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,760
A layman can't do this.

527
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,380
Who did this?

528
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
Why did he do this?

529
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,360
You asked the wrong question.

530
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,180
You should ask

531
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,820
whom I offended

532
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,660
and who did this to me.

533
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,220
The one who did this to me?
