[Episode 5]

4
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,580
I think you're extorting money.

5
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,360
You just grab any empty bottle

6
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,690
with cheap wine in it,

7
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,300
and want to use it to blackmail me?

8
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,580
I'm telling you. I'm a consumer.

9
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,770
Am I wrong

10
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,320
to defend my legal rights?

11
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,400
She sold me adulterated wine.

12
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,660
Is there any law?

13
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,259
If normal people buy adulterated wine,

14
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,940
they will come to the supermarket at the time they drank it,

15
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,340
instead of a few days after opening the bottle.

16
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,340
I had lunch with my friends

17
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,100
and had a few drinks...

18
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,820
You can smell the alcohol on me.

19
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,420
If you drank it at noon,

20
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,729
the stain on the wine bottle would be completely dry.

21
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,410
I can wipe it off

22
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,860
with a wet tissue.

23
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,300
Your wine has been opened for at least three days.

24
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Hello, I want to report a case.

25
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,980
You mean

26
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,740
I came to you after I let the wine go bad?

27
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,340
I can't tell the difference between spoiled wine

28
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,600
and adulterated wine?

29
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,380
Of course, the wine has not gone bad.

30
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,700
The wine in your hand

31
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,500
has only been aerated

32
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
for a few hours.

33
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,790
Here's the problem.

34
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,550
Why did the bottle stay open for three days

35
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,790
yet be aerated for only a few hours?

36
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,260
Come on.

37
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,400
How can you be so sure about the dates?

38
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,730
It seems that you own this winery.

39
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,329
Don't worry. Here comes the important matter.

40
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,380
This wine's logo is Chardonnay from Burgundy.

41
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,100
It's a classic white wine.

42
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,420
I don't know what's wrong with you

43
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,100
that you poured red wine into the bottle at noon.

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,620
If you want to extort money,

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,020
please be professional.

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,240
Not only did you extort money,

47
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,520
but you even tried to hit my woman.

48
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,410
No, no, no.

49
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,180
Bro. Bro.

50
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,580
Xu Tianran.

51
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,020
Dude.

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,900
Excuse me.

53
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,680
We can talk.

54
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,700
We just received a call from the public saying

55
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,570
that there's a repeat offender who is trying to extort money.

56
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,780
Yes, that's him.

57
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
You again?

58
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,900
No, no.

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,380
This is the fifth time this month.

60
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,140
No.

61
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,820
Unrepentant. Take him away.

62
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,560
No, no, sir.

63
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,260
I just had a few drinks with my friends.

64
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,860
No, no.

65
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,980
Thank you.

66
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,860
This way, please.

67
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,300
You came all the way here.

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,720
Come on, stop looking.

69
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,740
The show is over.

70
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,140
Get back to shopping.

71
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,820
Thank you, everyone.

72
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,900
Thank you.

73
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,579
Perfect sense of taste?

74
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,340
You can't even tell the difference between white

75
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,820
and red wine?

76
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,100
He is drunk.

77
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,980
And he yelled at me and dragged me.

78
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,180
I was stunned.

79
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,540
Alright, give me your phone.

80
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,660
Your phone!

81
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,980
Call me

82
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,350
if you are ever in danger again.

83
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,980
Is this your thank-you gift?

84
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,010
I'll treat you to something nice next time.

85
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,500
Our leader said he's very grateful.

86
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,300
I'll ask him

87
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,100
if he has

88
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,730
a reward for bravery

89
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,420
so I can apply for one for you.

90
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,440
Why didn't you resist?

91
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,300
You know what I'm talking about.

92
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,060
Why?

93
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,540
Why?

94
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,380
There's no reason.

95
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,700
Because I need this job.

96
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,980
What about your dignity?

97
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,630
Shouldn't it be more important than work?

98
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,780
That's your world.

99
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,780
Of course, you can hold your dignity

100
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,060
in your hands.

101
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,540
Then build a shining life

102
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,820
with your money.

103
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,460
But for ordinary people like me,

104
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,450
just living is hard enough.

105
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,300
Who are you to question me?

106
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,350
Lu Fenfen, as long as you want,

107
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,260
I can make you live a good life for the rest of your life.

108
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,950
What do you mean by that?

109
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,500
Are you talking about the contract?

110
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,540
So in your heart,

111
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,500
I can be bought with money.

112
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Then how much are you going to offer?

113
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,100
No, that's not what I meant.

114
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,300
I just think

115
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,220
you are really talented at wine.

116
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,940
If it's just because of the money

117
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,670
that you can't study in France,

118
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,820
I can totally help you with that.

119
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,140
Thank you.

120
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,580
But I want to rely on myself.

121
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,340
Look, over there.

122
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,460
These people are all busy

123
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,460
for just a little salary.

124
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,060
There are many ordinary people like me.

125
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,980
It's hard enough for us to live.

126
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
So sometimes

127
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,460
we need to give up

128
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,140
a little bit of dignity.

129
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,460
But that's normal.

130
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,930
Because not everyone is

131
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,860
born with a silver spoon

132
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,720
and never has to worry.

133
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,380
Do you really think so?

134
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,490
I don't know either.

135
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,140
Sometimes,

136
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,490
I think you're just a kid.

137
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,340
But sometimes,

138
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,700
you seem very tired,

139
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,860
like you're wearing a heavy shell.

140
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,580
How did she find out?

141
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,980
What? Did I say something wrong?

142
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,180
Don't pretend to be so deep.

143
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,940
Youth does not know the taste of sorrow.

144
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,590
Let's go.

145
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,780
Do you like her?

146
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,500
How could I like Lu Fenfen?

147
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,410
Mingchen.

148
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,950
You have fallen for her.

149
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,980
I admit

150
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,580
I pay special attention to her.

151
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,220
I feel relaxed when I'm with her,

152
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,940
just like I'm back in my childhood.

153
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,660
At that time,

154
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,420
my parents were still alive.

155
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,659
Mingchen, I've been wanting to tell you

156
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,179
that you are too depressing.

157
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,900
I asked you to pursue Lu Fenfen

158
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,380
to keep you alive.

159
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,220
But now it seems

160
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,500
your feelings toward her

161
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,180
are your special drug.

162
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,340
But this feeling makes me uneasy.

163
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,860
I always feel like I'll lose control.

164
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,540
This is the charm of love.

165
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,660
Very good.

166
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,280
The door is open.

167
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,030
Fenfen.

168
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,220
Fenfen.

169
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,700
Auntie.

170
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,830
Where are you going?

171
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,820
I'm going to work.

172
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,700
The rent for the next quarter...

173
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,660
It's time.

174
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,660
Auntie, my money

175
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,300
is really tight.

176
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,250
Can you give me more time?

177
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,460
I've given you several weeks.

178
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,950
You can't pay your rent, right?

179
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,780
It's OK. You can just pack up and move.

180
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,900
Auntie.

181
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,300
How much does she owe you?

182
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,940
50,000 yuan?

183
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,260
5,000 yuan.

184
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,530
4,500!

185
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,380
You have to pay the late fee too.

186
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,790
I'll transfer it to you.

187
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,250
Okay, that's great.

188
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,420
Done.

189
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,940
Thank you.

190
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,340
Your friend?

191
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,820
Auntie, is there anything else?

192
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,130
No, no. I'm leaving now.

193
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,070
I won't disturb you.

194
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,070
I won't disturb you.

195
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,140
Don't get me wrong. You have to pay me back.

196
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,060
Of course, I'll give you an IOU.

197
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,940
I'm not talking about money.

198
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,420
It's something else.

199
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,420
Else? What else?

200
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,790
Don't do this.

201
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,880
You've watched too many dramas.

202
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,370
I need you for one night.

203
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,520
You're dirty!

204
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
Don't worry.

205
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,130
I won't cross the line.

206
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,600
But that night,

207
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,280
your whole person and time

208
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,620
only belong to me.

209
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,310
Are you sure you won't do anything?

210
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,750
Brother, I'm your big sister.

211
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,340
You can't cross the line.

212
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,770
I don't think you dare do anything.

213
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,330
All right, I have to head out.

214
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,590
So arrogant.

215
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,970
CEO, I know you're strict.

216
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,600
But after working with your group for so many years,

217
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,710
we have never made any mistakes

218
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,970
in delivery.

219
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,460
There was a reason for the delay last time.

220
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,870
Could you please,

221
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,320
for the sake of our cooperation for so many years,

222
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,070
make an exception?

223
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,440
Chen.

224
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,400
Go on.

225
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,270
Mr. Xu, I'm not a young man.

226
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,790
I know the rules of business.

227
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,870
A mistake is a mistake. You should admit your mistake.

228
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,360
I didn't plead with you for myself.

229
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,380
My company is no match for your group.

230
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,910
But it still manages to support over 100 people.

231
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,490
If you want to punish someone,

232
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,880
just punish me.

233
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,590
You see, these people are all busy

234
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,680
for just a little salary.

235
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,220
There are many ordinary people like me.

236
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,100
It's hard enough for us to live.

237
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,990
So sometimes

238
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,350
we have to give up a little bit of dignity.

239
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,640
The consequences of this delay

240
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,350
are very serious.

241
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,580
It not only caused financial losses

242
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,300
but also injured

243
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,490
the image and reputation of the group

244
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,470
and reputation of our group in the hospitality industry,

245
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,670
where service quality is the highest industry standard.

246
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,770
Mr. Chen, I've read the report.

247
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,680
The driver's family had an emergency

248
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,600
and had to be sent to the hospital immediately.

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,660
There is really an excusable reason.

250
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,920
As you said,

251
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,140
you've been working with our group for 15 years

252
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,000
and have never made any mistakes.

253
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,300
I think

254
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,890
your dedication and trustworthiness

255
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,020
deserve another chance.

256
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,180
Thank you, CEO.

257
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,440
Just this once.

258
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,590
Also, the losses caused by the delay

259
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,070
will be subject to appropriate penalties.

260
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,620
Give me the plan as soon as possible.

261
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,460
Okay.

262
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,630
That's all for today's meeting. Dismiss.

263
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,540
Mingchen.

264
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,000
Mr. Xu, what can I do for you?

265
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,220
You go ahead.

266
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,440
Mingchen, well done.

267
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,760
Uncle I give you a thumbs-up.

268
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,970
Management

269
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
is actually an art of balance.

270
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,980
We can't just keep the pressure high.

271
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,420
It is still necessary to

272
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,190
keep a little flexibility.

273
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,540
Mr. Xu, just get to the point.

274
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,800
Mingchen, we're a family.

275
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,770
Don't be so cold to me.

276
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,550
You keep calling me Mr. Xu.

277
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,390
It sounds so distant.

278
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,030
It's just a small matter.

279
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,900
I'm here to plead with you on behalf of Song.

280
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,750
Mr. Xu.

281
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,690
Personnel handling is also my job.

282
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,930
If you have any objections,

283
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,110
you can make a motion to the board.

284
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,980
Mr. Xu.

285
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,140
In the company, I'm the CEO.

286
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,330
I hope you can still address me by my title

287
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,670
like everyone else.

288
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't think it is distant.

289
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,600
[Wine]

290
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,830
Why are you here?

291
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,970
I wanted to ask you the same question.

292
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,100
How's the preparation going?

293
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,280
You have so much faith in me.

294
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,630
So I must do my best.

295
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,850
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

296
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,940
You can make it.

297
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,050
This magazine is good.

298
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,990
I used to read them all the time.

299
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,850
I read the article about you in this magazine.

300
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,600
The episode when you became a Master of Wine.

301
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,710
That was many years ago.

302
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,550
You are my idol.

303
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,109
I only want to become a sommelier

304
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,210
because of you.

305
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,349
Really?

306
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,230
Yes.

307
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,829
I still keep that issue.

308
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,720
You have no idea how grateful I am

309
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,450
for your giving me this chance.

310
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,380
I feel like I'm dreaming now.

311
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,980
Since you owe me so much,

312
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,740
you can't just show your gratitude with your words.

313
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,200
How about you buy me a meal?

314
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,109
No problem.

315
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,350
You choose the place.

316
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,560
Why did I agree on this?

317
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,500
What if he wants to go to a Michelin-starred restaurant?

318
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I can't even afford the service fee.

319
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,070
What's wrong?

320
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,210
Mingchen

321
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,360
is getting more and more unbridled.

322
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,580
At today's meeting,

323
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,310
Chen made such a big mistake

324
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,080
and caused such a serious loss to the group.

325
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,510
But he didn't say anything and renewed the contract with him.

326
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,310
Let's see what happened to Song.

327
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,170
He just made some trivial mistakes

328
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,350
in life,

329
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,120
and he just wouldn't let him go.

330
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,550
He refused to change his mind when I, his uncle, begged him.

331
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,150
He doesn't respect me at all.

332
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,030
I'm his uncle after all.

333
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,410
He just stood there and

334
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,810
addressed me, Mr. Xu,

335
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,610
and said we were at the company.

336
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,920
[Dream back to Qing]

337
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,730
Good for him, that brat.

338
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,980
Now he knows how to play tricks on me.

339
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,060
Xu's Group will always belong to our Xu family.

340
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,580
But Uncle Song, I have to remind you.

341
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,970
Mingchen is the CEO of the group.

342
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,570
In terms of position, he's one level higher than you.

343
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,340
It doesn't seem appropriate

344
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,180
for you to call him a brat.

345
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,670
Qingran.

346
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,570
Director.

347
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,620
I don't mean anything else.

348
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,230
I'm doing this for the benefit of the group.

349
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,150
Right?

350
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,540
Besides,

351
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,350
Mingchen is the CEO.

352
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,330
Daily management is his duty.

353
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,260
But you come to me.

354
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,890
First, I can't interfere with his decision.

355
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,120
Second,

356
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,230
I always support his decision unconditionally.

357
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,230
What do you think?

358
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,190
Yes, you're right.

359
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,740
We should support him unconditionally.

360
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,060
Okay, if there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

361
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,040
See Mr. Xu off.

362
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,430
No need. Make some tea for the Director.

363
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,080
Director.

364
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,860
Is something wrong

365
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,960
with Mingchen?

366
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,980
At the meeting today,

367
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,160
I saw him a little off.

368
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,760
I'm really worried.

369
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,080
Thank you for your concern. He's fine.

370
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,500
That's good.

371
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,430
He was waiting for the right time to make a scene.

372
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,090
But the CEO didn't fall for it.

373
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,790
Mingchen did a good job.

374
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,170
But the CEO has always been strict.

375
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,550
I didn't expect that

376
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,300
he'd be lenient this time too.

377
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,390
Neither did I.

378
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,250
Maybe he feels better,

379
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,670
when his body is better.

380
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,980
He's getting better?

381
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,080
Yijiang found a way?

382
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,790
Great.

383

[Let Bygones Be Bygones]

384
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,360
The usual, boss.

385
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,500
Okay.

386
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,440
Hush.

387
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,490
Here. Sit here.

388
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,130
Have some water.

389
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,100
OK.

390
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,230
We'll do it ourselves.

391
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,360
Okay, wait a moment.

392
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,150
Luckily,

393
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,910
you didn't take me to

394
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,550
some Michelin-starred restaurants.

395
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,300
Otherwise,

396
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,150
I don't think I can even afford the service fee.

397
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,680
I'll just have to stay there and do the dishes.

398
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,240
You're so honest. You dare to say anything.

399
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,830
I think I take after my dad.

400
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,100
By the way, are you a local?

401
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,160
Why do you ask?

402
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,850
This street is very famous in here.

403
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,370
But out-of-towners may not know it.

404
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,130
You're quite smart.

405
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,680
How do you feel? Are you excited to be home?

406
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,260
Not happy?

407
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,090
Home.

408
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,080
When I was here, I hated it.

409
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,760
But when I left here,

410
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,330
I missed it.

411
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,480
Home is so complicated for me.

412
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,980
Roasted duck tongue is ready.

413

-Okay. -Here, girl.

Eat while it's hot.

415
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,400
OK.

416
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,620
Let's not talk about this. Let's eat.

417
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,660
Wait for me. I'm going to buy something.

418
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,750
Xu Mingchen.

419
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,110
I can't believe you did this.

420
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,880
I just made an exception.

421
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,340
Don't make a fuss.

422
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,600
Listen to yourself.

423
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,030
"I just made an exception."

424
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,520
This is something that the old Xu Mingchen

425
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,720
would never say.

426
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,470
What's the difference between

427
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,940
the old me and the new me?

428
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,420
The Xu Mingchen of the past

429
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,750
was a business machine without emotions.

430
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,900
Everything you did was for efficiency.

431
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,300
Input order, execution, and feedback.

432
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,200
Now you're

433
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,980
softhearted and will make an exception.

434
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,790
You seem more like a human.

435
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,370
What I'm more interested in is

436
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,560
who reprogrammed you

437
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,190
and changed you.

438
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,620
It's Lu Fenfen, right?

439
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,180
Speaking of her,

440
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,080
I've taken her down.

441
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,890
What did you say?

442
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,330
Not your kind of "take down".

443
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,600

Okay.

Let me tell you.

449
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,910
Although the wine is cheap,

450
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,640
it pairs perfectly with the roasted duck tongue.

451
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,280
Let me open it for you.

Here.

456
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,300
Try it.

457
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,970
The wine does not need to be aerated.

458

Try it.

459
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,070
How is it?

460
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,980
It's really good.

461
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,510
I told you.

462
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,320
It seems that I'm prejudiced.

463
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,370
In France,

464
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,340
they usually have red wine with duck.

465
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,100
But this is the first time

466
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,660
I've had duck tongues to go with red wine.

467
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,190
How could you think of that?

468
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,530
This duck meat is thicker in fat

469
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,920
yet the meat is very dry and hard.

470
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,490
So the traditional French cuisine

471
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,170
is to use low temperature

472
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,930
and slow cooking to seal the fat.

473
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,070
But the smell of the grease is too strong.

474
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,630
You can't pair them

475
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,640
with young, bitter wines.

476
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,870
They should be paired with

477
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,590
mature, thicker wines.

478
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,610
For example, the Saint-Emilion from Bordeaux.

479
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,500
But the duck tongue is different.

480
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,230
The duck tongue is tender and juicy.

481
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,910
It's suitable to pair with

482
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,680
the fresh and delicate wine.

483
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,280
And the barbecue is salty.

484
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,720
We need something sweet to go with it.

485
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,290
This domestic mint semi-sweet wine

486
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,550
is perfect for duck tongue.

487
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,970
A mouthful of duck tongue and a sip of wine.

488
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,480

Okay. I know.

They want to work with you.

500
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,160
Isn't that the biggest affirmation for you?

Congratulations.

They just give the money to me.

What's going on, Fenfen?

509
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,810
I sent you so many messages,

510
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,740
but you didn't reply.

511

Why can't you tell me on WeChat?

512
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,680
I can't tell you through WeChat. Something good happened.

Hurry up. I have to go home to review.

514
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,850
Two good news. Which one first?

515
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,940
Whatever.

516
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,940
Our big client, Mr. Chen's order, is back.

517
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,890
Next.

518
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,660
Our performance pay and bonus are back.

519
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,100
Really?

520
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,100
Yes.

521
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,940
I have money now.

522
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,670
The performance pay and bonus have been paid.

523
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,270
Let's celebrate together later.

524
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,020
KTV?

525
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,990
Sure.

526
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:44,960
Let's go.

527
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,010
-Let's go. -Go!

528
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,930
Let's go.

529
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,270
Listen, you can't hog the mic all night.

530
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:53,990
Why not?

531
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,780
He always sings all night.

532
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,410
Lu Fenfen.

533
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,790
You go first. I'll be right with you.

534
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,880
Hurry up.

535
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,000
See you at the usual place. We'll wait for you.

536
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,530
Let's go.

537
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,490
Why are you here?

538
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,880
I'm here to pick you up.

539
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,410
Have you forgotten?

540
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,550
You only belong to me tonight.

541
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,420
I remember.

542
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,760
Here, the appointment can be cancelled.

543
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,500
That's violation.

544
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,280
You forced me!

545
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,710
And all night?

546
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,940
Less drama, little brother.

547
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,630
I'm an adult. I'm busy.

548
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,800
Here, take it.

549
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,420
I don't care. I'm ready.

550
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,830
Why don't you go to karaoke with me?

551
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,230
Are you going or not?

552
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,650
Yes.

553
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,610
Next month's performance pay and bonus will definitely be paid as usual.

554
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,790
Thank you, Leader.

555
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,400
Hello.

556
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,970
Fenfen is here.

557
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,940
We've been waiting for you. What took you so long?

558
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,710
What a handsome brother!

559
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,350
Who is he?

560
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,190
-Little brother next door. -I'm her boyfriend.
