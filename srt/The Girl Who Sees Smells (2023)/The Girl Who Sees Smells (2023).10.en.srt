00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,740
So we deliberately

175
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,870
hid his real identity from you.

176
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,500
Fenfen.

177
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,220
I think what they said

178
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,580
makes sense.

179
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,370
Although it's wrong for Xu Mingchen to lie,

180
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,380
as the boss of a big company,

181
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,150
he must consider the interests

182
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,820
of the staff and the company.

183
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,980
Each of us has different positions,

184
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,240
which leads to different perspectives.

185
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,180
So, do you also think

186
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,540
I shouldn't blame him?

187
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,140
No.

188
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,340
Fenfen.

189
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,370
It's all my fault.

190
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,780
I shouldn't have lied to you.

191
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,260
Please forgive me.

192
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,910
But there's one thing I don't understand.

193
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,660
Xu Tianran is Phillip.

194
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,390
He's your younger brother.

195
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
But why do you look younger than him?

196
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,380
Because I'm ill.

197
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,110
What kind of illness it is? Is it serious?

198
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,700
He's sick with a very rare disease.

199
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,420
It's a long story.

200
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,580
Simply put,

201
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,800
it's a special kind of genetic inheritance.

202
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,100
He would look younger than his real age,

203
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,050
and would be younger and younger every year.

204
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,780
What will happen next?

205
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,780
It may...

206
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,900
It's nothing.

207
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,670
He just looks much younger.

208
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,660
Gosh!

209
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,540
That would be great.

210
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,620
[Anda Hotel]

211
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,420
You look quite handsome today.

212
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,300
This week's work plan is the same as last week's.

213
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,160
There's just a small adjustment.

214
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,620
Lu Fenfen is no longer in charge

215
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,480
of the godown entry of the lounge.

216
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,540
She only takes charge of management affairs of the lounge.

217
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,860
If anything happens,

218
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,980
you have to ask Lu Fenfen for instructions.

219
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,780
Understand?

220
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,540
Yes.

221
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,220
Yes.

222
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,160
Fenfen.

223
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,420
It's my pleasure to work with you.

224
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,400
I'm in charge of the management affairs?

225
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,850
What's going on?

226
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,420
Okay.

227
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
The meeting is over.

228
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,940
Qiao Anna is quitting her job?

229
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,460
Yes.

230
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,190
That's true.

231
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,750
But there's nothing she can do.

232
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,700
Fenfen.

233
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,770
I didn't take good care of you

234
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,100
when you took office.

235
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,860
I didn't know at that time.

236
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,080
Please forgive me.

237
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,400
Don't take it to heart.

238
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,140
What do you know?

239
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,850
David. Fenfen is not like that.

240
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,660
Otherwise, with her identity,

241
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,260
she wouldn't have eaten in the canteen with us.

242
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,420
But Fenfen,

243
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,940
you shouldn't eat in the canteen with us anymore.

244
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,270
After all, you're the boss's girlfriend.

245
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,420
They are watching you.

246
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,589
Let's go.

247
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,580
CEO, I have something to tell you.

248
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,260
What's wrong?

249
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,570
Did you come to work with Lu Fenfen today?

250
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,180
Yes.

251
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,350
Lu Fenfen is my girlfriend.

252
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,340
Just deal with your management affairs normally.

253
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,800
It won't affect your work.

254
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,980
But Lu Fenfen has no educational background

255
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,840
or experience.

256
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,720
And she used to do odd jobs in a supermarket...

257
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,620
Enough. This is my personal affair.

258
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,220
If there's nothing else,

259
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,030
you can get back to work.

260
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,660
Okay.

261
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,620
Chairwoman,

262
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,700
I shouldn't have meddled in this matter.

263
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,220
But I think it's necessary

264
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,180
to let you know.

265
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,500
Go ahead.

266
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,980
This morning, I saw CEO

267
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,060
and a grassroots employee of our company,

268
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,060
called Lu Fenfen,

269
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,580
coming to work hand in hand.

270
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,660
Lu Fenfen...

271
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,740
They came to work hand in hand?

272
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,420
Yes!

273
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,700
I asked CEO.

274
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,810
He admitted it.

275
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,590
He told me that Lu Fenfen was...

276
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,270
I'm relieved that they made it public.

277
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,180
OK. Thank you, Bai Bing.

278
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,240
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

279
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,580
Lu Fenfen.

280
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,140
What trick did you use

281
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,580
to bewitch the whole Xu family?

282
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,030
Wait and see.

283
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,220
I will reveal who you really are.

284
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:05,860
Mr. Xu.

285
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,330
What can I do for you?

286
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,860
Director Bai.

287
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,060
I heard that you had a hard time talking with Xu Mingchen,

288
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,580
because of Lu Fenfen.

289
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,290
Xu Mingchen hasn't come to the company lately.

290
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,080
I heard that he was hanging out

291
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,300
with Lu Fenfen.

292
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,670
That's impossible!

293
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,950
The CEO is not that kind of person.

294
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,700
You're too naive.

295
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,820
You don't know men well.

296
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,500
You've liked Xu Mingchen for so many years,

297
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,380
but he has never laid his eyes on you.

298
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,980
Now, Lu Fenfen

299
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,180
who is incompetent and not beautiful

300
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,880
is regarded as a precious girl by him.

301
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,420
It only shows that some men

302
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,540
are born with bad taste.

303
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,020
They're really not suitable to take responsibility.

304
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,220
Mr. Xu, as an employee of the company,

305
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,300
I don't want to hear you slandering the CEO.

306
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,360
You really don't know how to fight for yourself.

307
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,460
Xu Mingchen is a rich dandy now.

308
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,820
Only when he loses everything,

309
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,140
can he see you beside him

310
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,060
and understand your kindness.

311
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,820
And that moment

312
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,700
is the time when you can defeat Lu Fenfen.

313
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,580
Mr. Xu.

314
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,890
I will never betray

315
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,220
the CEO and Chairwoman.

316
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,510
I have something to do. I have to go.

317
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,900
The sales of the group in this quarter have fallen,

318
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,750
and Ding's Group is likely to come from behind.

319
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,050
Everyone is in a panic.

320
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,460
And the CEO hasn't shown up for a long time.

321
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,520
Mr. Xu Song secretly contacted the higher-ups of the company.

322
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,750
I'm afraid today is a trap.

323
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,960
Let's begin.

324
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,290
Chairwoman.

325
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,520
Is Mingchen not coming today?

326
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,840
The outside world is speculating

327
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,160
about his physical condition.

328
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,000
If he doesn't show up,

329
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,010
there would be trouble.

330
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,640
It's not a long-term solution

331
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,220
to make it not a trending topic.

332
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,030
You all have seen

333
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,920
the performance report, right?

334
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,650
For the first time in ten years,

335
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,580
Ding's Group has surpassed us.

336
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,830
A commander is indispensable to an army.

337
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,150
If Mingchen keeps being absent,

338
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,410
in addition to the speculation from the outside,

339
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,670
panic will be spread

340
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,230
within our group.

341
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,310
If Mingchen doesn't show up all the time,

342
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,390
what do you think we should do?

343
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,730
Chairwoman,

344
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,920
does Mingchen feel well?

345
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,730
I want to ask for your opinions.

346
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,950
We can only sacrifice the pawn to save the queen.

347
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,330
We should focus on the overall interests of the company

348
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,590
and select a new CEO.

349
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,420
In that case,

350
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,950
who do you think is suitable?

351
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,350
I suggest...

352
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,150
Excuse me!

353
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,380
I'm late.

354
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,820
How far are you guys going?

355
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,270
We haven't got to the point yet.

356
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,750
Mr. Xu is worried about your health.

357
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,680
Please rest assured.

358
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,420
My physical condition

359
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,230
is good.

360
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,210
[Xu Mingchen]

361
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,930
Hello.

362
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,020
You don't have to pick me up.

363
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,220
Why?

364
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,870
You have a special identity.

365
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,670
I don't want to be gossiped about.

366
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,130
I'll get you into trouble.

367
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,500
I don't think so.

368
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,820
You're a boss.

369
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm just an employee.

370
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,060
How can others work normally

371
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,990
if you make me so special in work?

372
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,680
How can my leaders treat me?

373
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,130
Fenfen has grown up.

374
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,070
She would think about the company.

375
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,380
You are acting as a boss's wife.

376
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,060
Cut the crap!

377
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,400
I have work to do.

378
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,620
You don't have to pick me up.

379
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,370
Bye.

380
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,350
Oh no.

381
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,120
The bus is gone.

382
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,020
Why are you here?

383
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,230
I managed to make you my girlfriend.

384
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,180
Thinking twice,

385
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,050
I can't bear the fact that you may get hurt.

386
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,120
Thank you

387
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,250
for showing up when I need you the most.

388
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,930
Thank you for tolerating my willfulness.

389
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,210
Let's go home.

390
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,080
Be careful.

391
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,310
How about your legs?

392
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,910
They're fine.

393
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,160
Well. Qiao Yi isn't home today.

394
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,470
It's so late...

395
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,350
What do you want to say?

396
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,850
I want to say that you can stay here.

397
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,340
If I stay,

398
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,400
what can I do?

399
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,190
I want

400
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
to drink with you.

401
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,830
Okay, I'll go get some wine.

402
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,170
Cheers.

403
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,980
I...

404
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,890
I'm a little drunk.

405
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,910
Me too.

406
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,590
Fenfen.

407
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,160
Are you asleep?

408
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,320
What should we do?

409
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,890
Why is she back now?

410
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,530
How would I know?

411
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,430
She usually comes back late.

412
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,550
She's asleep.

413
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,730
Why are you being so rude?

414
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,970
What can I do?

415
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,090
It's okay.

416
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,350
Well...

417
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,450
Qiao Yi

418
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,660
will go back to her room after having instant noodles.

419
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,480
What should we do?

420
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,820
I can't take it anymore.

421
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,760
Don't say that.

422
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,310
I can't either.

423
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,880
How long will she be able to go back to her room?

424
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,440
Maybe... soon?

425
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,960
