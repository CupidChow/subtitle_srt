[Episode 7]

4
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,479
Fenfen is so talented.

5
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,890
Why didn't she choose correctly?

6
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,250
Come in.

7
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,420
What's up?

8
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,479
I'm here to thank you

9
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,620
for letting me join the master class.

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,970
I've been fond of wine since I was a kid.

11
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,580
Unfortunately, I never had

12
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,169
a good teacher to guide me.

13
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,090
You are selected as a member of the master class

14
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,510
because of your talent.

15
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,390
I know

16
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,980
you are Xu Tianran, the second son of the Xu family.

17
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,570
Actually, Mingchen always cares about you.

18
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,880
So does the chairman of Anda.

19
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,320
So if you need any help,

20
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,230
I will do my best to help you.

21
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,920
Miss Bai, let me tell you,

22
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,640
my master class

23
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,440
is for those who truly love wine.

24
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,750
I hope you can care more about wine

25
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,390
instead of some useless things.

26
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,630
I'm warning you.

27
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,890
Watch your words.

28
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,579
I can disqualify you from being in the class anytime.

29
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,620
Okay, I got it.

30
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,780
Dangerous, dear. Wait.

31
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,430
It's okay. It's okay.

32
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,800
Let me see if you're hurt.

33
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,270
What are you doing?

34
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,160
You scared my son!

35
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,210
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,730
I didn't push him.

37
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,150
He bumped into the box himself.

38
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,290
It's your fault.

39
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,880
If not, he wouldn't be so scared.

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,020
He ran so fast.

41
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,870
Sorry, dear.

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,880
Are you okay?

43
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,970
Your son ran too fast

44
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,100
and accidentally bumped into the box.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,960
You two are colleagues.

46
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
Of course you're on her side.

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,570
I'll make a complaint against you.

48
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,370
What's going on?

49
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,770
What's going on, Fenfen?

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,770
Why is the boy...

51
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,410
Are you the person in charge?

52
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,340
Yes, I am their leader.

53
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,600
I want to make a complaint against your two workers.

54
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,570
What happened?

55
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,630
They hurt my son and didn't admit it.

56
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,350
This is so unacceptable.

57
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,450
Yes. What's wrong with you?

58
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,590
I apologize to you on behalf of them.

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,940
Is the kid hurt?

60
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,410
Let's go to the infirmary.

61
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,790
Whether my son is hurt or not,

62
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,790
I'll make a complaint against them.

63
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,950
Your son bumped into the box himself.

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,570
Alright, thank you all.

65
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,930
You may go on shopping now.

66
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,810
Please.

67
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,779
Fenfen, clean here.

68
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,790
Do not just stand still.

69
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,720
Let's go to the infirmary.

70
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,440
If my son is hurt, I won't let you off!

71
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,280
Okay. Okay.

72
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,530
This way.

73
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,720
Disperse!

74
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,610
Fenfen, let the crowd disperse.

75
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,620
This way.

76
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,550
Okay, I got it.

77
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,350
I'll handle it properly.

78
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,390
Sorry, Manager.

79
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,700
Manager, actually, what happened today

80
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,630
is not Fenfen's fault.

81
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,430
Shut up!

82
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,270
Fenfen.

83
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,790
To join that master class,

84
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,770
you got yourself exhausted every day.

85
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,900
I know you failed

86
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,920
and it is a big blow to you.

87
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,110
But you shouldn't have been so emotional when you were working.

88
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,440
The customer just called and made a complaint against you.

89
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,290
She said you yelled at her child.

90
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,590
The child was terrified

91
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,190
and is still in hospital now.

92
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,790
Manager, I didn't do it.

93
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,780
Fenfen, we work in the hospitality industry.

94
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,040
Always put the customer first.

95
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,510
You need to cheer up

96
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,360
and do your job well.

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,770
I overestimated my ability. I'm sorry.

98
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,850
Look.

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,420
She's quitting just because of what I said.

100
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,010
How can you be so immature?

101
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,460
Manager, Fenfen just wants to make things easier for you.

102
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,600
I've explained it to the people at headquarters

103
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,070
and sent them the video.

104
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,840
They said the kid is not hurt.

105
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,510
The company has no loss.

106
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,280
You just need to pay for those broken bottles of wine

107
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,010
and then you can go back to work.

108
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,790
Thanks for your help these days.

109
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,150
But I've made up my mind.

110
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,250
I want to quit.

111
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,150
Well...

112
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,290
Fenfen.

113
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,210
Fenfen.

114
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,650
Fenfen, Fenfen.

115
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,500
Fenfen, you…

116
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,810
Leader, I want to be alone.

117
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,740
No, you shouldn't.

118
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,300
Our manager has a sharp tongue.

119
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,020
Don't take his words seriously.

120
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,030
He's not blaming you.

121
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,330
Leader, he's right.

122
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,320
I just don't want to be a wine salesperson anymore.

123
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,030
No.

124
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,300
Thanks for your help these days.

125
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,360
What are you doing?

126
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,000
Fenfen, please…

127
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,430
Hello, Grandpa.

128
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,110
Fenfen.

129
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,800
You haven't called me for a long time.

130
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,230
Don't you miss me?

131
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,380
How are you?

132
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,280
How's your work?

133
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,660
Is everything going well?

134
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,270
Yes, Grandpa.

135
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,680
Good. I've made some new sausages.

136
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,750
I'll send them to you tomorrow.

137
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,540
Grandpa, no need to do that.

138
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,420
I still have some left.

139
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,410
Are you short of money?

140
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,260
Be more generous.

141
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,190
If you have the chance,

142
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,250
treat your roommate,

143
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,230
Qiao Yi,

144
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,230
to a meal.

145
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,750
Grandpa, I want to go home.

146
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,909
Okay.

147
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,240
Come back home.

148
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,909
Fenfen.

149
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,420
Fenfen.

150
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,410
Come on, this way.

151
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,710
Be careful.

152
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,470
I bought the box last week.

153
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,350
It cost me 150 yuan.

154
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,190
Be careful.

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,870
Here.

156
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,090
Put it here.

157
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,970
Here.

158
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,429
Guys, stop, stop.

159
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,340
You told me it's just eight boxes.

160
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,730
But now,

161
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,580
there are so many other things.

162
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,809
And your boxes are all very heavy.

163
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,330
Well.

164
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,920
You just carry the boxes. I can carry other things myself.

165
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,380
We've agreed on the price.

166
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,280
How can you charge me more suddenly?

167
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,450
By the way,

168
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,380
you broke some of my stuff just now.

169
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,980
How can you say that?

170
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,660
I planned to carry all your things alone.

171
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,060
Now I have to bring three more men.

172
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,880
Shouldn't I charge more?

173
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,760
600 yuan is a very low price.

174
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,110
I didn't ask you to bring more men.

175
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:06,820
Wait.

176
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,410
Are you moving?

177
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,190
Where are you going?

178
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,210
Go back to my hometown.

179
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,190
Why now?

180
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,670
Didn't you say you wanted to develop your career here?

181
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,270
What about the master class?

182
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,760
I didn't get to join the class.

183
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,080
But it doesn't mean that you should move.

184
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,380
What about your job at the supermarket?

185
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,620
I quit that job.

186
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,380
Why?

187
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,480
None of your business.

188
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,740
Do you want to move these things or not?

189
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
She is not moving.

190
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,290
What do you mean?

191
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,860
Guys, let's go.

192
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,270
No, don't listen to him.

193
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,440
Xu Tianran, what are you doing?

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,260
You put these things back now.

195
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,630
I'll pay you.

196
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,850
Put them back?

197
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,200
No matter how much she pays you, I'll pay you twice. Work now.

198
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,960
Guys, work. Hurry.

199
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,770
You are so unprofessional.

200
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,180
No, don't put them back.

201
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,990
Come on.

202
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,550
Be gentle.

203
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,070
Xu Tianran, I'm already so unlucky.

204
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,870
Can you stop causing me trouble?

205
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,160
Why do you want me to see this?

206
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,470
Have you ever watched SLAM DUNK?

207
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,600
I like Hisashi Mitsui the best.

208
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,820
He once gave up what he cared the most

209
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,330
because he got sick.

210
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
But later, he met Mitsuyoshi Anzai.

211
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,300
Then he picked up his strong will.

212
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,420
As long as one can have a strong will,

213
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,250
he or she can always start again.

214
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
But I've been trying for a long time.

215
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,820
It's really tiring.

216
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,580
I see no hope.

217
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,690
It happens to everyone.

218
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,330
I've quit my job.

219
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,870
I have nothing left now.

220
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,170
I can't even make a living.

221
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,390
How can I keep going forward?

222
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,400
Stop.

223
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,900
It's okay. I can drink more.

224
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,750
I'm a loser now.

225
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,220
I'm happy that you don't look down on me.

226
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,260
Thank you.

227
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,380
You're not a loser.

228
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,040
Persistence is the key to success.

229
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,340
Keep watching.

230
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,690
I'll get you something to eat.

231
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,760
Hello, An.

232
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,000
I need you to make an investigation.

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,130
[Hello, Miss Lu Fenfen. We would love to invite you to our interview for Assistant Sommelier at Anda Hotel.]

234
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,330
[Hello, Miss Lu Fenfen. We would love to invite you to our interview for Assistant Sommelier at Anda Hotel.]

235
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,330
[The interview will be held from 9 a.m. to 12 a.m. tomorrow. Please take with you your ID card and CV.]

236
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:20,990
What's up?

237
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,480
I am invited for an interview by Anda.

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,130
That's good.

239
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,280
The interview is for Assistant Sommelier.

240
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,230
You don't like it?

241
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
I didn't say that.

242
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,140
But I didn't send my CV to them.

243
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,800
The HR department of big companies

244
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,610
will normally collect the CVs of some candidates for future use.

245
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,460
Maybe they are in a need of new employees now.

246
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,390
Let me tell you, take this job first.

247
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,250
If you perform well,

248
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,520
you may get promoted.

249
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,700
Yeah.

250
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,730
You're so considerate.

251
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,250
Of course.

252
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,400
I am much smarter than you.

253
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,470
What do you mean?

254
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,240
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

255
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,410
[Anda Hotel]

256
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,250
Miss Lu, sorry to keep you waiting so long.

257
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,610
You

258
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,600
are qualified for this position.

259
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,730
When can you start to work here?

260
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,450
Anytime.

261
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,300
Very good.

262
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Please follow me.

263
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,110
Okay.

264
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,130
I told you

265
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,480
Lu Fenfen can never show up at Anda Hotel.

266
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,000
Director Bai, here is the thing.

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,630
Secretary An came to see me

268
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,460
and said Lu Fenfen is suitable for the position.

269
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,170
I have no other choice.

270
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,610
Really?

271
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,890
Why does it have to be Lu Fenfen?

272
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,990
If it weren't for Secretary An,

273
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,740
I wouldn't have hired her.

274
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,790
Fine.

275
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,710
Keep an eye on her.

276
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,970
I'll find out who she is.

277
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,040
Okay, I'll leave now.

278
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,860
Thank you.

279
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,840
You're right.

280
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,490
The minute you give up, you lose the game.

281
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,400
As long as we don't give up,

282
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,810
ordinary people like me

283
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,580
will also find hope.

284
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Don't just praise towering things.

285
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,310
Plains and hills are just as immortal.

286
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,490
Is this line created by you?

287
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,120
No. Philip James Bailey said that.

288
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,220
It means that ordinary people

289
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,650
can also shine.

290
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,930
Doing something great in our ordinary life, just occasionally

291
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,660
will also make us great people.

292
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,040
Well said. I need to note it down.

293
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,950
So, will you pay attention to my words in the future?

294
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,340
You little kid.

295
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,530
Do you really think I don't know this?

296
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,950
I just don't know how to express the same idea

297
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,340
with beautiful words.

298
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,640
You kid.

299
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,030
When will you start to work there?

with her daily work.

our work process.

313
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,430
Okay.

314
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,500
Our main duty

315
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,760
is to sort the wines, place them and properly store them.

we follow…

318
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,900
At the end of the 19th century

319
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,450
when diseases were widespread in Europe,

320
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,850
noxious substances caused a lot of damage.

321
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,230
In the early 20th century,

322
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,800
laws were enacted to fight against fraud.

323
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,190
So the authenticity of certificates could be ensured.

Lu Fenfen.

325
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,990
You're just an assistant.

326
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,050
You are not allowed to listen to this.

327

Leave now.

328
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,040
Why are you carrying it?

329
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,920
It's too heavy.

330
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,960
It's okay. It's my work.

331
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,970
How is it? Are you used to working here?

332
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,780
Not bad.

333
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,430
Zhu Jie told me

334
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,540
there are rats in your lounge.

335
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,560
Really?

336
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,850
It's fine.

337
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,400
She gave me a camera.

Can you help place these bottles of wine?

342

Okay.

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,940
Fenfen.

345
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,190
How is everything going?

346
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,290
This place is different from the supermarket.

347
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,350
Do you like it here?

348
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,350
The place is not bad.

349
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,170
I've been very busy

350
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,470
because of the master class.

351
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,330
So I don't often stay in the hotel.

352
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,040
After all, we were classmates.

353
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,420
If you need any help,

354
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,150
just tell me.

355
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,860
Keep going.

356
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,510
A diamond ring.

357
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,390
Why is there a diamond ring?

358
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,460
Lu Fenfen.

359
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,790
Sure enough, it's you.

360
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,730
What are you talking about?

361
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,800
Fenfen.

362
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,010
This is the diamond ring Qiao Anna lost.

363
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,000
This is it.

364
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,910
Well.

365
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,080
When I opened the locker,

366
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,050
I just saw it there.

367
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,980
I don't know who put it in my locker.

368
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,990
You don't know?

369
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:37,840
So you think

370
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,470
my diamond ring had legs

371
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,860
and just went into your locker itself.

372
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,930
If I hadn't shown up in time,

373
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,460
you must have taken it home.

374
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,840
You're caught red-handed.

375
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,750
What do you want to say?

376
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,160
Let's go to see Director Bai now.

377
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,820
We should call the police

378
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,610
and get the thief arrested.

379
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,880
Okay, I'll go.

380
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,420
I didn't steal your ring.

381
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,380
I don't know

382
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,180
why it was in my locker.

383
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,910
Lu Fenfen, stop lying.

384
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,350
I know life is difficult for you.

385
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,830
We were classmates. I want to help you.

386
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,680
But there shouldn't be a thief in our hotel.

387
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,780
I said I didn't steal it.

388
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
I can quit this job

389
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,300
but you need to know that I am innocent.

390
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm a poor girl

391
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,540
but I never steal from others.

392
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,270
Come on, Lu Fenfen.

393
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,280
Everyone can say that.

394
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,800
Are you proud of being a thief?

395
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,490
We can't just let it go.

396
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,990
We must call the police.

397
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,390
If we just forgive you,

398
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,120
you will do harm to the society.

399
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,120
I'll call 110.

400
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,370
When the police come,

401
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,490
you'll need to give them evidence.

402
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,770
Evidence.

403
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,330
Zhu Jie told me

404
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,440
there were rats in your lounge.

405
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,070
She gave me a camera.

406
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,060
I'll install it for you later.

407
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,000
There is a surveillance camera in the rest area.

408
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,130
You installed it last time.

409
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,610
Right.

410
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,810
Oh, I forgot about it.

411
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,400
Wait a minute.

412
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
When did you install a camera there?

413
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,620
Why didn't you tell me?

414
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,720
Director Bai.

415
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,770
Look.

416
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,500
Well, Director Bai.

417
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,430
This doesn't prove anything.

418
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,390
I just went to the rest area once.

419
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,910
I work here.

420
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,510
There is nothing wrong

421
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,340
with me going to the rest area.

422
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,940
We'd better call the police.

423
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,950
With the camera, we can know what happened this afternoon.

424
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,920
I never went to the rest area this afternoon.

425
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,680
We'll know

426
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,610
who the real thief is when the police arrive.

427
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,410
I'll call 110.

428
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,140
As long as you still work here,

429
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,320
you can never call the police.

430
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,050
Yes, it's a misunderstanding.

431
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,170
It's just a misunderstanding.

432
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,260
Don't make it too dramatic.

433
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,990
But I don't work here anymore.

434
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,370
I got fired just now.

435
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,650
Lu Fenfen, what do you want?

436
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,410
I take back what I said.

437
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,720
Well, then

438
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,110
I'll go home now, Director Bai.

439
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,040
Bye, Director Bai.

Director Bai.

441
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,510
We really can't let Lu Fenfen still work here.

442
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,190
Get out.

443
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,070
Look at her.

444
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,700
Get out.

This is le Pinot noir.

This is Chianti.

you can succeed this time.

you should thank my good handsome bro?

She…

Okay, let's talk about

493
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,180
the target market of our wine today.

494
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,360
Since wine is a kind of high-end product,

495
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,050
Anda should enhance its presence in the high-end market

496
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,910
and improve the level of our wine.

497

Every time

498
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,010
when we are selling our wine to the customers,

499
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,270
we need to emphasize

500
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,490
the high-end quality of our wine

501
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,380
so that our wine can always

502
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,910
enjoy a high reputation among our customers.

503

Director Bai,

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,720

Go ahead.

506
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,530
I've been thinking about

507
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,010
the target market for Anda's wine.

508
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,530
Based on my recent observation,

509
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,080
I've got a conclusion different from yours.

510
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
What conclusion?

511
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,780
Your opinion

512
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,050
about the wine market

513
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,600
is a stereotype

514
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,890
also held by many others in the country.

515
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,210
You all pay too much attention on high-end customers.

516
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,220
To serve them,

517
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,250
we choose those wines that are ripe,

518
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,980
expensive,

519
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,130
and believe they are only for business banquets.

520
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,130
We also prefer imported wines from famous vineyards.

521
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,720
In fact, to choose a good wine,

522
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,360
we only need to consider two questions.

523
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,880
Who will drink the wine

524
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,820
and with whom he or she will drink it.

525
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,750
For example, to choose a wine for young girls like me,

526
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,440
we need to consider when they will want to drink wine

527
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,010
and what kind of wine they may like.

528
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,030
What's wrong with Lu Fenfen?

529
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,120
Is her EQ very low?

530
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,180
Yes.

531
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,730
Her EQ cannot be lower.

532
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,460

What are you doing here?

539
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,360
I heard the news about the stalker

540
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,160
so I'm quite worried about you.

541

I'm sorry.
