4
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:33,979
Thank you.

5
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:34,620
You're welcome.

6
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,150
This way.

7
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,110
Are you feeling better?

8
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,940
Sorry, Master.

9
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,180
I was too emotional just now.

10
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,340
I do dream of becoming a Master of Wine,

11
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,560
but definitely not through this method.

12
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,240
We are all tired today.

13
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,900
Let's talk about it another time.

14
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,500
I'm grateful to you

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,430
for teaching me and supporting me.

16
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,020
But I may not be qualified

17
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,140
to be your student.

18
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,870
What do you mean?

19
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,660
After thinking about it,

20
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,680
I don't think I should stay here anymore.

21
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,750
Don't rush into decisions.

22
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,620
I have something to tell you.

23
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,640
Let's at least have dinner together.

24
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,100
I ordered them for you.

25
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,740
Be my guest.

26
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,310
Actually, I want to tell you

27
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,120
that I've fallen in love with you.

28
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,520
Master.

29
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,079
You don't have to say that to make me stay.

30
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,600
I'm serious.

31
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,170
I just want to resign.

32
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,530
He made it look like a breakup.

33
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,260
What's going on?

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,510
Xia.

35
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,700
Where's Fenfen?

36
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,970
She's having dinner with Philip.

37
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,850
Dinner? Where are they?

38
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,790
Upstairs, I think.

39
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,870
I love you.

40
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,220
I can give you everything you want.

41
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,370
Whatever Xu Mingchen promised you,

42
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,570
I can promise you too.

43
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,090
Master, you know me.

44
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,070
Those things never appeal to me.

45
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,260
What attracted me to Mingchen

46
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,290
has never changed.

47
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,709
What is it?

48
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,240
If I had nothing to do

49
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,670
with the Xu family

50
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,860
and were just an ordinary salesgirl,

51
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,410
would you still love me?

52
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,190
Do you love me for me

53
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,510
or just because I'm Xu Mingchen's girlfriend?

54
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,690
I love you for you.

55
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,330
Have you ever thought

56
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,330
that you love me

57
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,390
just because I'm the one Mingchen loves?

58
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,060
You released your new wine.

59
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,920
I haven't congratulated you yet.

60
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,590
You're fast.

61
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,090
Are you afraid that I'll steal her away?

62
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,350
I don't think you can do that.

63
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,670
Let's go.

64
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,740
Fenfen.

65
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,730
You haven't told me

66
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,540
what you think of what I said.

67
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,360
Don't force her to do anything.

68
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,070
Have you taken Fenfen as a toy?

69
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,380
A toy?

70
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,320
Only a bossy man like you would call her that.

71
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,120
Have you ever asked her opinion?

72
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,850
Enough.

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,780
Am I a trophy or what?

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,400
Now that you're here,

75
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,270
let's have a face-off.

76
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,240
No problem.

77
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,530
As usual, we'll play basketball.

78
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,980
No matter who wins in the end,

79
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
we have to respect Fenfen's choice.

80
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,390
Do you two have to be so childish?

81
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,850
I want to raise the stakes.

82
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,720
The winner gets to kiss Fenfen.

83
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,450
What did you say?

84
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,010
I said the winner gets to kiss Fenfen.

85
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,010
Where are your good manners, Mr. Perfect?

86
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,650
I pissed you off?

87
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,000
You've never changed.

88
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,180
You clutch everything you want

89
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,350
in your hands.

90
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,910
Basketball game at first

91
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,040
and then Lu Fenfen.

92
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,060
Can't you think

93
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,230
before you talk?

94
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,310
Stop arguing.

95
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,460
Master, I've made up my mind

96
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,550
to resign.

97
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,200
Anyway, thank you for your appreciation.

98
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,670
Is it worth it to dwell on

99
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,330
what happened when we were little?

100
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,690
Tianran, the score is 8 to 8 now.

101
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,190
The ball is in my hands.

102
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,290
I'll beat you with one more shot.

103
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,950
Your plane model will be mine.

104
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,770
Yes. It's worth it.

105
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,280
If it still makes you feel so bad,

106
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,370
I apologize to you.

107
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,910
But you have to figure out

108
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,870
what is truly bothering you.

109
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,840
Lu Fenfen is my girlfriend.

110
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,500
She's not an item we fight for.

111
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,450
I won't let you belittle her like that.

112
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,730
Let's go.

113
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,110
Master, I've always admired you.

114
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,800
I think you are really interesting.

115
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,950
You're cool and amazing.

116
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,830
As your student,

117
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,310
I admire you very much.

118
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,710
As my student?

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,130
You're turning me down, right?

120
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,090
I mean my words.

121
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,590
I hope you can let go of the past.

122
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,510
In my heart,

123
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,360
you're a superhero.

124
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,659
He shouldn't be held back by these things.

125
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,130
Fenfen.

126
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,820
Sorry.

127
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,110
You're the only one who's worth my love.

128
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,620
You're an adult. You shouldn't have hit him.

129
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,950
Don't you think you two were too childish?

130
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,940
He started it.

131
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,470
But he's my Master after all.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,659
Why does he get jealous so easily?

133
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,350
Listen carefully.

134
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,270
You're mine.

135
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,470
Come with me.

136
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,080
I got something for you.

137
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,380
This wine didn't get released

138
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,770
and can't be enjoyed by more people.

139
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,100
It's a great pity for me,

140
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,550
but here is the thing.

141
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,820
To me,

142
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,430
it tastes bitter and then sweet.

143
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,360
The sweet taste lasts.

144
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,800
Just like our relationship.

145
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,000
So I named it "Kiss".

146
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,480
Do you understand, Mr. Kiss?

147
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,980
Yeah, Miss Kiss.

148
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,150
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,690
I've decided to quit my job at Philip Studio.

150
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,720
Why?

151
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,100
Because of me?

152
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,710
Just partially.

153
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,910
It's mainly because I feel frustrated.

154
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,090
Think twice.

155
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,240
You may be giving up a great opportunity.

156
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,910
No.

157
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,510
I only need you.

158
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,740
And I seem to have figured out

159
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,180
what kind of wine I'm going to make.

160
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,220
I have a question for you.

161
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,380
Go ahead.

162
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,670
What about me attracted you?

163
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:34,980
What?

164
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,880
What did you say to Philip?

165
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,110
How much did you hear?

166
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,250
Tell me.

167
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,300
If you don't tell me…

168
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,960
I surrender.

169
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,010
It's you.

170
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,690
Just you.

171
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,600
You as a person attracted me.

172
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,030
Happy now?

173
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,470
Master, this is my resignation.

00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,790
I knew you were coming,

176
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,150
but I didn't expect it to be so soon.

177
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,260
Sorry, Master.

178
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,120
I think this is the best choice.

179
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,770
I wish you all the best.

180
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,690
Master. Master.

181
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,540
Our wines were suddenly pulled from shelves.

182
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,080
Why?

183
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,410
The owner of the winery said the Chairwoman

184
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,840
of Xu's Group suddenly acquired their investors.

185
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,340
So...

186
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,010
Master.

187
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,050
Xu Qingran, how dare you mess with me!

188
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,350
Watch your tone.

189
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,830
Are you playing dumb with me?

190
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,590
You bought the shares of my new wine

191
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,560
and terminated my contract.

192
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,190
Tell me what's in it for you.

193
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,760
Why do you enjoy picking on me so much?

194
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,350
Here's my advice.

195
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Don't think too highly of yourself.

196
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,850
Besides, you said I picked on you.

197
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,240
Have you not done the same to me and Mingchen?

198
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,820
Do you really like Lu Fenfen

199
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,510
or are you using her to provoke me and Mingchen?

200
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,430
Anyway,

201
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,580
I want nothing to do with you.

202
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,520
You'd better leave us alone

203
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,100
and mind your own business.

204
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,900
Stop being a nuisance in my life.

205
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,880
So in your eyes,

206
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,720
no matter how hard I try,

207
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,600
I don't deserve to have what Xu Mingchen has, right?

208
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,290
Save your self-pity.

209
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,270
What do you want?

210
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,490
I remember everything

211
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,080
that has happened over these years.

212
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,220
So do I.

213
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,090
Good. I'm glad you didn't forget.

214
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,700
You saved Xu Mingchen in that accident

215
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,950
and left me alone in the car to die.

216
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,720
What are you talking about?

217
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,810
When you saved him,

218
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,970
did you forget that I was in the car too?

219
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,030
The petrol tank was leaking.

220
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,630
The car could explode any second.

221
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,160
Did you hate me so much that you wanted me dead?

222
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,510
Qingran, help me.

223
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,350
Come, Mingchen.

224
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,080
I got you.

225
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,650
Hold on, Mingchen. I'll get you out.

226
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,380
Qingran.

227
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,710
Qingran.

228
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,330
Mingchen. He's bleeding.

229
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,150
-Can't you stop it? -The doctor will be here soon.

230
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,340
Did I pick on you?

231
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,520
Yes, I did.

232
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,490
I've come around.

233
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,010
You'll never care for me

234
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,480
as you do for Xu Mingchen.

235
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,630
All I have is useless jealousy.

236
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,670
When necessary,

237
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,650
you'll let me die for him, won't you?

238
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,780
Shut up, Xu Tianran!

239
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,790
I'm not Xu Tianran! I'm Phillip.

240
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,820
And you, Xu Qingran.

241
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,080
In my eyes,

242
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,420
you are a pitiful woman who lost herself.

243
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,780
I won't give up the new wine for you.

244
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,440
Neither will I give up Lu Fenfen for Xu Mingchen.

245
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,650
Good. Great.

246
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,350
Since you've accepted the fact

247
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,860
that I love Mingchen more than you,

248
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,280
why are you here yelling at me?

249
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,740
You are Philip,

250
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,180
not Xu Tianran.

251
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,270
That means you can't barge in like this.

252
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,600
Get lost! Now!

253
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,950
I'm here to tell you

254
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,790
that one day,

255
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,320
I'll make you regret everything you've done.

256
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,110
Listen.

257
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,420
Mingchen is far better than you.

258
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,900
He's not as rebellious as you.

259
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,250
He's much more considerate than you.

260
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,610
In a word, you're not in his league.

261
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,720
As for the accident,

262
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,850
believe whatever you want.

263
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,550
I don't care.

264
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,210
Wait. We need to talk.

265
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,920
About what?

266
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,160
Lu Fenfen? Or my new wine?

267
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,130
You are wrong about the car accident.

268
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,230
Enough. I'm done with that.

269
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,080
Qingran.

270
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,120
In the car accident,

271
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,040
he thought I left him to die.

272
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,910
That's what he has been believing

273
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,990
for all these years.

274
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,770
Qingran, Tianran misunderstood you.

275
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,380
Don't be so angry.

276
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,150
That's how he thinks of me.

277
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,280
That matter is already behind us.

278
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,160
You should let it go.

279
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,360
I'll talk to him.

280
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,400
I'll explain things to him.

281
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,940
Don't be angry.

282
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,100
[Anda Hotel]

283
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,460
Dad, Mom,

284
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,990
what should I do

285
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,430
to make things the way they were?

286
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,320
Qiao Yi, I'm a little nervous.

287
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,300
Why?

288
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,860
I've never made a pitch to an investor before.

289
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,830
It's okay.

290
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,560
You did well when you practiced with me last night.

291
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,780
You sold wines in a live stream.

292
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,750
You're not totally inexperienced.

293
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,610
You can make it.

294
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,350
Okay.

295
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,790
Getting him

296
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,970
to invest in Kiss

297
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,310
is half the battle, right?

298
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,730
Yes.

299
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:53,950
OK.

300
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,430
Who is this big shot?

301
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,870
You'll know later.

302
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,830
Okay.

303
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:05,880
Here.

304
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,620
He Le? What are you doing here?

305
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,680
I have told him that you plan to

306
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,150
start your own business.

307
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,080
He's very interested.

308
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,470
Am I right?

309
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,650
Yes.

310
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,380
I don't know much about wine,

311
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,730
but I'm very interested in this project.

312
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,720
Come. Let's sit down and talk.

313
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,700
You have a good project

314
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,330
that can make one buck ten.

315
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,140
I feel so honored

316
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,410
that Miss Qiao is willing to cut me in.

317
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,270
I'll do anything I can to help.

318
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,370
Stop. Save the preliminaries.

319
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,840
Tell us what you can do.

320
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,070
You'll need someone for public relations

321
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,290
and to interact with clients.

322
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,670
I can do that.

323
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,480
Miss Lu,

324
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,340
we need a well-connected partner like him.

325
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,490
OK. You make the decision.

326
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,380
But

327
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,940
only the three of us are not enough.

328
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,790
We need money.

329
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,000
The savings you and I have

330
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,810
are far from enough

331
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,410
to support our ambition.

332
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,730
You heard her.

333
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,500
When will the investor arrive?

334
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,720
You're not the investor?

335
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,150
You two…

336
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,920
Speaking of the devil.

337
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,360
Let me introduce

338
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,880
the investor I found for you.

339
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,490
Xu Mingchen, the CEO and director of Xu's Group.

340
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,320
He's looking for profitable projects now.

341
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,150
Nice to meet you, Mr. Xu.

342
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,610
What? I'm not welcome here?

343
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,660
This is cheating.

344
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,570

Mr. He.

347
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,590
Mr. He told me

348
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,280
that your project needs investment.

349
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,720
After learning about it,

350
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,730
I found the project quite good.

351
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,540
Of course, if you don't want my money,

352
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,520
I'll respect your decision.

354

We do want your money, don't we?

355
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,670
Yeah. You can't buy everything with money,

356
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,110
but you can't buy anything without money.

357
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,210
Even the best project needs money to get started.

358

Besides, to make talent like me stay,

359
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,210
you need money too.

360
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,120
Right, Fenfen?

361
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,060
Yes. How much will you invest in us?

362
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,070
Name your price.

363
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,690
We've made an estimate…

364

No matter how much you need,

365
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,930
I'll cover 70% of it.

366

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,390
After Qingran acquired his brand,

517
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,940
all his wines were pulled from shelves.

518
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,040
How can he sell them again now?

519
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,200
So much trouble at the very beginning.

520
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,490
Why don't you call to check on Fenfen?

521
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,940
The business world is a cruel battlefield.

522
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,400
She should get used to it as soon as possible.

523
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,710
Hey, girls. Nice to meet you.

524
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,570
Do you remember me?

525
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,910
Today I'm going to introduce to you

526
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,550
a delicious

527
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,000
and amazing wine, Kiss rosé.

528
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,130
You look a bit scary

529
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,520
when you're so focused.

530
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,200
You look like you want to eat someone alive.

531
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,730
You don't have to look at me.

532
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,770
But I like looking at you.

533
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,710
What are you busy with? Show me.

534
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,820
No need to keep it from me.

535
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,710
Is it the data of the live stream?

536
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,270
Fenfen didn't say anything.

537
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,660
You shouldn't be bothered either.

538
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,590
I wouldn't feel so bad

539
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,020
if she had said something.

540
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,830
I came up with the idea.

541
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,630
I invited Pear in Wine.

542
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,960
But look at how it ended.

543
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,910
I let Fenfen down.

544
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,140
My goodness, the numbers are good.

545
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,540
You should be satisfied.

546
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,630
Are you blind?

547
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,810
It's her sales.

548
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,080
Mine is here.

549
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,070
It's ten times less. I should be satisfied?

550
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,840
You're really bad at flattery.

551
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,900
I'm not flattering you.

552
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,760
You read the data in the wrong way.

553
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,590
Look.

554
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,050
Pear in Wine has 8 million fans.

555
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,150
Including paid posters, she has over 10 million followers.

556
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,740
But the number of people watching her live stream

557
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,710
is less than two million.

558
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,770
Less than 20% of her total followers.

559
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,910
Our account was created not long ago.

560
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,970
We only have thousands of followers,

561
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,620
but you got over 300 thousand

562
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,170
viewers at the peak.

563
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,530
This is dozens of times the number of our followers.

564
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,910
Then check out this.

565
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,100
Her curve is downward.

566
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,160
She had the most viewers at the beginning.

567
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,630
And less than half of them stayed till the end.

568
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,570
Look, our curve

569
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,620
keeps rising.

570
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,670
Your viewers were obviously

571
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,060
more active than hers.

572
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Then let's look at the sales number.

573
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,560
You didn't sell as many bottles

574
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,160
as Pear in Wine did,

575
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,800
but it's your first time selling in a live stream.

576
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,650
It's your first time selling in a live stream,

577
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,850
but you got more than 50 thousand deals.

578
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,510
To tell you the truth,

579
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,620
given your ability,

580
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,280
it won't take long for you to surpass Pear in Wine.

581
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,980
You're good at praising people.

582
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,710
This is my thing.

583
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,640
I'm good at analyzing data.

584
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,080
I always thought

585
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,210
you were a pervert obsessed with dolls.

586
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,040
That's not me. You're prejudiced against me.

587
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,070
How about drinking a toast to prejudice?

588
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,070
Good idea.

589
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,880
You like me, don't you?

590
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,020
Have I…have I

591
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,710
not made it obvious enough?

592
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,710
I thought you were a playboy.

593
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,950
I expected you to smile shyly

594
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,950
and said, no, Qiao Yi, I don't.

595
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,740
I'm not a naive schoolboy.

596
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,930
This is such a good opportunity.

597
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,820
I-I'd be a fool if I let it go.

598
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,230
But...

599
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,980
Let me ask you.

600
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:26,990
We've spent so much time together.

601
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,020
What do you think of me?

602
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,170
First, he needs to be good-looking.

603
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,360
He must have eight packs.

604
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,670
He needs to be well-educated

605
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,110
and have a nice voice.

606
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,000
As for money,

607
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,450
he doesn't need to be rich.

608
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,500
I can support him.

609
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,520
Are you wasted?

610
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,930
You got drunk so quickly.

611
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,110
I'm not drunk!

612
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,790
I'm perfectly somber.

613
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,720
I drink like fish.

614
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,760
Waiter, more wine.

615
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,449
Let me open it for you.

616
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,520
Come on, Le. Drink.

617
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:18,900
Come on.

618
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,949
Bottoms up!

619
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,620
I don't drink beer.

620
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,389
Beer is too bland.

621
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,949
I usually drink

622
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:36,420
whiskey or other spirits.

623
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,650
Something strong.

624
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:43,389
Something with a lot of kick.

625
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,340
Is this one strong enough?

626
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,949
Royal Salute?

627
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,990
Do you want breakfast?

628
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,240
I usually skip breakfast.

629
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,740
Breakfast is very important.

630
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,860
It preps you for the coming day.

631
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,050
I see.

632
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,400
Okay.

633
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,790
What do you want to eat?

634
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,940
E-Egg.

635
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,530
Why didn't she scream?

636
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,200
Women in TV dramas scream in such a situation.

637
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,930
Didn't we have sex last night?
