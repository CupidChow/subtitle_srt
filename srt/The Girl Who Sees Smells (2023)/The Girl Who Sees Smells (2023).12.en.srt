4
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,620
Fenfen loves wine.

5
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,780
She has a perfect sense of taste.

6
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,180
In time,

7
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,430
she'll be an excellent Master of Wine.

8
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,960
Don't look down on her.

9
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,380
You're a bit odd.

10
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,770
Do you like her?

11
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,700
Are you crazy?

12
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,720
You're overreacting.

13
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,340
I'm just pissed.

14
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,940
I know you.

15
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,940
Since you were young,

16
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,660
you've been wanting everything Mingchen has.

17
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,740
You have the gall to say that.

18
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,180
You've always been partial to Xu Mingchen.

19
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm serious.

20
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,580
Why don't you

21
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,220
turn on the charm?

22
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,340
After all,

23
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,250
you're a top Master of Wine

24
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,930
and Lu Fenfen's boss.

25
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,220
Go steal her away from Mingchen.

26
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,579
Then you'll take the chance

27
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,160
to make Xu Mingchen yours.

28
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,300
Stop dreaming.

29
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,260
Why is it different from the movies?

30
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,460
Why do I feel dizzy?

31
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,360
What's wrong?

32
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,910
Are you okay?

33
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,420
Why did you come in?

34
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,580
You screamed,

35
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,020
so I came to check on you.

36
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,820
I'm fine.

37
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,740
Really?

38
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,570
Go out now.

39
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,580
Be careful.

40
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,950
Okay. This is so embarrassing.

41
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,800
It's fine. We're a couple.

42
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,250
No. I'm not fine with it.

43
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,700
I'll go. Be careful.

44
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,220
Okay.

45
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,220
You've moved in?

46
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,500
Congratulations.

47
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,780
You started a new phase in your life.

48
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,659
Something really embarrassing just happened.

49
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,860
It's fine. Just a blip that spiced things up.

50
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,260
Go dress up.

51
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,820
You must look amazing at this important moment.

52
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,060
Put on makeup.

53
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,580
Hurry up.

54
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,460
Okay.

55
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,620
Makeup.

56
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,660
Toning cream.

57
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,620
Powder foundation.

58
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,270
Color-changing lipstick.

59
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,220
He won't be able to tell

60
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,870
that I'm wearing makeup

61
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,340
and perfume.

62
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,690
Have I tried too hard?

63
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,980
No. You look beautiful.

64
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,700
Come here.

65
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,540
So many delicious dishes.

66
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,260
Yeah. I want to impress you.

67
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,460
Welcome to my house.

68
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,260
Have a seat.

69
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,420
Try my cooking.

70
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,620
Okay.

71
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,660
It's delicious.

72
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,630
It's great that you like it.

73
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,100
If you like it,

74
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,220
I can cook for you every day.

75
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,000
That'll be wonderful.

76
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,290
Then we are

77
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,980
officially living together now?

78
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,230
I'm happy that you moved in, Lu Fenfen.

79
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,580
Me too.

80
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,320
I didn't expect you to be so reliable.

81
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,460
They're really living together now.

82
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,380
Of course.

83
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,700
The power is out?

84
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:15,970
He Le.

85
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,380
What did you do?

86
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,460
Well, to make the act convincing,

87
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,340
I cut the power.

88
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,340
What?

89
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,660
Can you fix it now?

90
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
Sorry, no.

91
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,880
Then where should I stay tonight?

92
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,180
I'll book a room in a five-star hotel for you.

93
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,110
I'll go get a change of clothes.

94
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,820
Who are you, hottie?

95
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,620
You look so handsome.

96
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,940
I'm your boyfriend.

97
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,980
Let me tell you a secret.

98
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,580
When I first met you,

99
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,980
I was like, wow,

100
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,780
this guy is so good-looking.

101
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,820

Qingran.

139
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,900
Nana.

140
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,920
Where's Mingchen?

141
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,580
He's the only one you care about?

142
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,060
How is Mingchen now?

143
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,900
He's getting younger and younger.

144
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,820
He looks like a teenager now.

145
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,780
I'm so worried.

146
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,500
Is it due to the disease you mentioned?

147
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,540
Are there other symptoms?

148
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,730
No.

149
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,980
He's just getting younger and younger.

150
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,240
If we can't find a cure,

151
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,940
he'll soon look like my son.

152
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,020
It's a wonderful disease.

153
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,340
I want to have it too.

154
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,300
This matter

155
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,420
will have an impact on the Group,

156
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,140
so we've been keeping it a secret.

157
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,580
Don't let on to anyone, Nana.

158
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
Qingran, I'm not a kid anymore.

159
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,180
Okay. I was worrying too much.

160
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,100
You're not a kid anymore.

161
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,180
Will she like it?

162
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,320
Don't worry. She will like it.

163
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,290
Nana.

164
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,510
What are you doing here?

165
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,820
Qingran.

166
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,120
I invited Tianran…

167
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,860
Philip to come over.

168
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,850
For my sake,

169
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,100
let's have a meal together.

170
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,460
Have a seat, Tianran.

171
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,420
Mingchen.

172
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,020
Sorry, we're late.

173
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,220
Qingran.

174
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,820
-It's you. -It's you.

175
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,340
Do you know each other?

176
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,260
We met when she came to buy wine.

177
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,100
Yeah.

178
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,540
It's a small world!

179
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,900
Nana.

180
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,020
This is a gift from me and Fenfen.

181
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,860
Hope you like it.

182
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,460
Thank you.

183
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,660
I like whatever you give me.

184
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,140
I'm glad that you like it.

185
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,470
Fenfen has been worried

186
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,280
that you wouldn't like it.

187
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,020
Come on. Let's sit down.

188
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,740
Nana, sit beside me.

189
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,780
Mingchen, what's in it?

190
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,430
Open it and you'll know.

191
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,620
How did you know I like this?

192
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,260
I'm so happy.

193
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,510
You told me when you were young.

194
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,260
You remember what I said?

195
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,700
We grew up together.

196
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,780
You're like my sister.

197
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,980
Of course I remember.

198
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,820
You should thank Fenfen too.

199
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,820
She inspired me.

200
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,820
Sure enough, girls know

201
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,040
what the best gifts for girls are.

202
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,940
I'm glad you like it.

203
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,940
Thank you.

204
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,700
Mingchen.

205
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
I really want to go back to our childhood.

206
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,820
We used to

207
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,940
listen to music and play together.

208
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,500
Do you remember

209
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,380
us playing house together when we were kids?

210
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,060
We played husband and wife.

211
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,220
We all liked that game when we were young.

212
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,300
I played Xiong's bride when I was little.

213
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,580
He was the boy living next door.

214
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,180
We were just kids. It was just a game.

215
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,530
Nana is pretty and kind.

216
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,700
Whoever marries Nana in the future

217
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,500
is the luckiest man in the world.

218
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,220
Mingchen.

219
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,940
You're so nice to Miss Lu.

220
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,920
When you have a boyfriend,

221
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,840
he'll treat you very well too.

222
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,980
Miss Lu,

223
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,260
I heard

224
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,260
you used to sell wine in the supermarket.

225
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,910
No wonder you were so good at picking wine.

226
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,740
Thank you.

227
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,940
Fenfen is a sommelier in our hotel now.

228
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,680
She knows a lot about wine.

229
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,280
If you want to buy wine,

230
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,320
you can ask her for advice.

231
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
Don't bother.

232
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,140
Phillip can help me.

233
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,130
You can trust her taste.

234
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,640
She's been doing a great job as my assistant.

235
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,900
Speaking of that,

236
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,420
Phillip, you work with Miss Lu every day

237
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,740
and both of you love wine.

238
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,650
You two must have a lot to talk about, right?

239
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,370
You must enjoy each other's company very much.

240
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,580
Phillip is very talented.

241
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,260
I admire him very much.

242
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,580
You mean you're his fan?

243
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,150
What a coincidence!

244
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,060
I've admired Mingchen since I was young.

245
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,940
So,

246
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,220
I should work harder

247
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,070
to make Fenfen like me more.

248
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,160
Fenfen has been working very hard recently.

249
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,900
Tianran.

250
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,910
Fenfen is your brother's girlfriend.

251
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,350
That means she may be your sister-in-law.

252
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,920
Let me make it clear to you.

253
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,020
Fenfen is my assistant now.

254
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Xu Tianran.

255
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,100
Let's eat. The dishes are getting cold.

256
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,380
Let's enjoy the food.

257
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,660
Qingran, let me propose a toast to you.

258
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,780
My goodness!

259
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,340
I never knew eating could be so exhausting.

260
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,140
I told you to relax.

261
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,140
How could I relax?

262
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,500
Miss Ding's big bright eyes

263
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,860
were fixed on you all the time.

264
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,860
I can tell that she likes you very much.

265
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,780
But I only like you.

266
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,420
Nana is childlike.

267
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,180
There's no need to worry.

268
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,100
I know.

269
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,220
She was very kind to me

270
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,940
when we met.

271
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,220
But after she found out

272
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,340
that I'm your girlfriend,

273
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,740
everything changed.

274
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,700
You made me lose a friend.

275
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,660
Go wash up and sleep.

276
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,020
Okay.

277
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,859
Stop moping.

278
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,270
I just don't understand

279
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,420
what's so good about Lu Fenfen.

280
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,810
Mingchen was so protective

281
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,060
towards her today

282
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,180
as if I was going to eat her alive.

283
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,180
That's exactly what you wanted to do.

284
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,460
You wanted to eat her alive

285
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,500
and just didn't get the chance.

286
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,340
Xu Tianran.

287
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,130
I told you not to call me that.

288
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,740
Phillip.

289
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,740
Why don't you take my side?

290
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,160
Qingran doesn't love me anymore.

291
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,420
That's a good thing.

292
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,460
You can team up with me.

293
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,900
What should I do?

294
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,220
I won't give up on Mingchen.

295
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,140
I believe that I'll win his heart eventually

296
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,340
as long as I work hard enough.

297
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,610
Whatever you say. Good luck.

298
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,980
[Anda Hotel]

299
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,940
Have you prepared the wine?

300
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,260
What is this?

301
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,860
David.

302
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,820
What are they busy with?

303
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
Bai Bing is here too.

304
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,880
You don't know?

305
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,340
Pear in Wine is coming.

306
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,420
Director Bai stayed up all night to get prepared.

307
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,540
Who's Pear in Wine?

308
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,140
A top influencer on TikTok.

309
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,620
She has millions of fans.

310
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
Really?

311
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,610
Yes.

312
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,540
She has greater influence

313
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,470
than a traditional Master of Wine.

314
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,810
Her few words of complaint

315
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,540
can make a bar go under.

316
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,220
Her likes and compliments

317
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,050
can immediately make a brand popular.

318
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,060
Why is she coming to our hotel?

319
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,250
She'll come to try our food and service

320
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,400
and then post a review online.

321
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,940
Director Bai is her huge fan

322
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,020
and the first one

323
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,770
to know about her coming.

324
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,460
It has put her nerves on edge.

325
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,980
What are you doing here?

326
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Your director is so busy

327
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,220
but you got nothing to do?

328
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,350
You look like directors more than I do.

329
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,700
Sorry, Director Bai.

330
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Be smart.

331
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,180
If you guys ruin this for me,

332
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,510
it'll end really badly for you.

333
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,180
Good.

334
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,660
Good afternoon, ladies.

335
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,540
What would you like to drink?

336
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,540
Could you recommend a wine for us?

337
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,700
Sure. No problem.

338
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,500
It's hot today.

339
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,460
A glass of iced Riesling

340
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,620
is a perfect choice.

341
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,100
What else do you have?

342
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,180
If you don't like Riesling,

343
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,580
I recommend

344
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,860
Grevino from the New World.

345
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,900
It is

346
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,220
a sweet Noble Rot wine

347
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,010
with an expressive nose of ripe fruits.

348
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,620
It's perfect for a charming lady…

349
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,740
I look so fat in this photo.

350
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,420
No retouching can save it. I'll delete it.

351
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,900
I look good in this one.

352
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,420
Like you.

353
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,730
What do you think?

354
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,030
What did you say?

355
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,620
I just recommended a Grevino

356
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,180
half-sweet white wine for you.

357
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,740
No, thanks. I'll have Riesling.

358
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,540
Okay. No problem.

359
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,500
Wait.

360
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,990
Is that American wine you mentioned really good?

361
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,740
This brand is not famous.

362
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,730
Pear in Wine

363
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,460
actually knows its region.

364
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,100
She's really something.

365
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,060
She ordered Riesling.

366
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,620
Riesling?

367
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,980
So simple?

368
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,710
We don't need Lu Fenfen. I'll serve it myself.

369
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,780
Get me a Grevino vintage wine

370
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,060
and chill it to the right temperature.

371
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,140
Chill the glass

372
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,820
to the proper temperature too.

373
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,300
Okay.

374
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,900
Thanks to Pear in Wine,

375
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,580
you got the chance to see me prepare the wine.

376
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,410
I don't serve ordinary people.

377
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,460
If you're interested,

378
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,940
I can recommend wines

379
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,900
from famous German wineries for you.

380
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
No. I'll have the charming one.

381
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,300
Sure. No problem.

382
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,450
I don't like it to be too sweet.

383
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,180
Don't worry.

384
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,940
I'll chill it to the best serving temperature.

385
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,980
Miss, here is your wine.

386
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,160
Where is the girl just now?

387
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,900
She's just a sommelier

388
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,300
in the Executive Lounge.

389
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,560
I'm the director. I'll serve you.

390
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,070
How do you like the wine?

391
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,300
It's good. You can leave now.

392
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,860
Ms. Pear in Wine, my name is Bai Bing.

393
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,530
I really like you.

394
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,480
Can I take a photo with you?

395
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,140
You're my fan.

396
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,900
Of course. Come here.

397
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,690
Come.

398
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Director Bai did a great job this time.

399
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,340
She's likely to get a promotion and a raise.

400
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,220
This lady seems close to Director Bai.

401
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,550
She will definitely give us a good review.

402
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,830
That'll be wonderful.

403
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,500
It's good news for everyone.

404
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,100
OK.

405
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,500
Thank you.

406
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,860
Let's start the live stream.

407
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
The bar we're visiting today

408
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,690
is the famous

409
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,460
Anda Executive Lounge.

410
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,860
Before I came here,

411
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,820
I thought I'd have a wonderful experience.

412
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,820
But my friends,

413
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,290
it turns out that this bar

414
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,410
doesn't live up to its hype.

415
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,620
As you can see,

416
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,860
the environment

417
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,980
is very high-end and fancy,

418
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,380
exactly as I expected from a five-star hotel.

419
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,140
But the wine they served

420
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,180
disappointed me so much.

421
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,740
Pear,

422
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,620
how will you score this bar?

423
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,500
Zero. I don't recommend it at all.

424
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,740
Why?

425
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,510
Ms. Pear in Wine.

426
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,770
I want to know why.

427
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,540
Why?

428
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,780
Why did you say that in the live stream?

429
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,410
Why were you so harsh on us?

430
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,100
The wine is horrible.

431
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,900
How's that possible?

432
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,220
Who do you think you are?

433
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,150
Why should I answer your question?

434
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,530
The wine is horrible?

435
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,060
Everyone knows

436
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,470
that we only sell

437
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,980
the best wines

438
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,260
from the best regions.

439
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,280
No one has ever questioned us.

440
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,020
Why are you an exception?

441
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,740
Are you trying to blackmail…

442
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,940
There's something wrong with the wine,

443
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,660
but instead of fixing the problem,

444
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,500
you accused me of blackmail.

445
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,820
Are you really my fan?

446
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,860
Your terrible attitude

447
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,020
is worth a bad review.

448
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,020
Pear, our next stop is

449
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,900
Nanshan Tavern.

450
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,460
They have their own winery.

451
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,590
Collect our things.

452
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,260
Wait.

453
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,430
What do you want now?

454
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,780
My time is precious.

455
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,180
Sorry, Ms. Pear in Wine.

456
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,860
I apologize.

457
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
As long as you remove the bad review,

458
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,900
I can ask the hotel to pay you a sum of money.

459
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,770
I promise you'll be satisfied with our offer.

460
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,570
Are you crazy?

461
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,980
Do you really think I'm blackmailing you?

462
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,780
You're insulting my work ethic.

463
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,900
How do you think

464
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,220
I got to where I am today?

465
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,140
By posting beautiful selfies?

466
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,000
Let me tell you.

467
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,220
I sent every bad review

468
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,420
for a good reason.

469
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,460
Pear's photos have all been Photoshopped,

470
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,060
but all her reviews are true.

471
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,140
Shut up.

472
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,260
I'm not done with you yet.

473
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,180
Just wait.

474
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,220
I'll keep telling people how bad this hotel is.

475
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,500
I'm not leaving yet.

476
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,700
She seems very unsatisfied with our wine.

477
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,000
But there's nothing wrong with our wine.

478
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,020
Mr. Xu.

479
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,780
Hello.

480
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,660
I'm Xu Song, Vice President of Anda Group.

481
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,980
Are you Ms. Pear in Wine?

482
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,170
May I have a word with you?

483
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,180
Let's talk here.

484
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,180
Miss, I'm in charge of this matter.

485
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,700
I will take care of it.

486
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,700
Really?

487
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,330
It doesn't look like

488
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,100
you can take care of it.

489
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,500
I agree with

490
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,150
what Director Bai said.

491
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,700
Ms. Pear, tell me

492
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,300
what you want us to do for you.

493
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,860
I'll try my best to meet your request.

494
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,420
So,

495
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,710
you think I'm here to extort money too?

496
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,500
Let me ask you one question.

497
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,340
After I said the wine is horrible,

498
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,470
has any one of you thought of trying it?

499
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,660
You just kept asking me to change my review.

500
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,260
That's how a top-notch hotel treats its guest?

501
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,580
Do you have any respect

502
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,060
for your guests at all?

503
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,180
Is everyone giving you a bad review

504
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,980
trying to blackmail you?

505
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,520
Even a zero is too high a score for you.

506
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,420
Let's go.

507
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,620
I'll rate you below zero on my way back.

508
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,930
Pear, zero is the lowest score on the platform.

509
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,660
Then complain to the platform.

510
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,330
Sorry, Ms. Pear in Wine.

511
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,580
Please wait a moment.

512
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,720
Lu Fenfen, what are you doing?

513
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,860
The wine does have a weird taste.

514
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,060
Lu Fenfen.

515
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,420
It's not the right time to steal the show.

516
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,080
Don't you dare contradict me.

517
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,350
You said the wine has a weird taste.

518
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,940
Can you be more specific?

519
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,600
What is that taste?

520
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,300
Can you figure out

521
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,060
what caused the problem?

522
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,420
Mr. Xu, I can give it a try.

523
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,940
Now someone's taking me seriously,

524
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
but it's too late.

525
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,460
Sorry, Ms. Pear in Wine.

526
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,060
The wine indeed has a weird taste.

527
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,300
We apologize.

528
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,540
But if we can find out

529
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,740
the reason why the wine tastes strange,

530
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,940
can you remove the bad review on our bar?

531
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,690
Apologies aren't enough to make me relent.

532
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,260
Tell me what that taste is

533
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,400
and then why the wine tastes that way.

534
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,460
I'm not sure about it yet,

535
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,980
but it tastes like celery

536
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,180
and eggshell.

537
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,380
Lu Fenfen.

538
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,300
That's nonsense. How is that possible?

539
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,820
Fine. If you tell me the reason,

540
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,430
I'll remove the bad review.

541
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,340
Really?

542
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,830
You have my word.

543
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,480
But I don't have much time.

544
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,680
I'll give you half an hour at most.

545
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,420
Okay.

546
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,020
Lu Fenfen.

547
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,220
Are you sure you can make it?

548
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,020
I'll try my best, Mr. Xu.

549
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,980
If you can't find the reason,

550
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,300
you have to resign.

551
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:45,980
Okay.

552
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,230
Is the wine from this decanter?

553
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,900
Yes.

554
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,980
What's the problem?

555
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,340
I think she's just picking a fight.

556
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,860
There are too many people like her online.

557
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,380
But she doesn't want money.

558
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,340
What's her purpose?

559
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,940
She's doing it for the clout.

560
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,250
You're just bluffing.

561
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,340
Fenfen.

562
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,940
How about I open another bottle

563
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,900
of the same wine for you?

564
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,780
No. The wine is fine.

565
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,350
How can there be any problem with our wine?

566
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,940
Celery and eggshell?

567
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,300
Do you think you're still working in the supermarket?

568
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,620
Did you put the wine glass

569
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,210
in the fridge before serving the wine?

570
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,700
Yes. Of course.

571
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,300
Which fridge?

572
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,780
The fridge in the kitchen.

573
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,620
What do you mean?

574
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,140
Let's go.

575
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,460
I know it.

576
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,310
I've found the reason.

577
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,020
Ms. Pear in Wine is right.

578
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,660
The wine does have a strange taste.

579
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,820
At first, I thought

580
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,020
something went wrong

581
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,340
with the wine we purchased.

582
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,420
But I just tasted the wine

583
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,720
from the same bottle in the decanter.

584
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,820
It doesn't have the weird taste.

585
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,880
It means that the wine itself is fine.

586
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,700
So the problem lies in the preparation of the wine.

587
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,220
Lu Fenfen.

588
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,420
Are you saying that it's my fault?

589
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,580
Good for you.

590
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,300
Let her finish her words.

591
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,370
In the summer,

592
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,060
to ensure the taste of iced wine,

593
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,820
we usually chill the wine glasses too.

594
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,140
Unfortunately,

595
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,470
one of my colleagues

596
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,700
put leftover food in the fridge.

597
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,340
He took it out soon,

598
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,980
but the smell remained on the glass

599
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,460
and was absorbed by the wine.

600
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,390
I'm terribly sorry.

601
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,420
I just put it in there for a little while

602
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,570
and took it out soon.

603
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,100
I didn't know it would cause such big trouble.

604
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,460
So it's your fault.

605
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,030
I'm so sorry, Director Bai.

606
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,140
Sorry, Ms. Pear in Wine.

607
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,940
My colleague didn't mean it.

608
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,820
The strange taste is faint.

609
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,880
Most people can't discern it.

610
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,070
It's incredible

611
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,260
that you've noticed such a subtle difference.

612
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,290
Of course.

613
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,020
I remember every wine I've ever tasted.

614
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,060
Now that we've found the cause of the problem,

615
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,490
can you remove the bad review on our bar?

616
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,100
Of course. Send a post telling everyone

617
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,540
that I'll rerecord this episode.

618
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,140
Okay.

619
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,520
Not only will I remove the bad review,

620
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,980
but I'll also give a big hand

621
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,260
to this sommelier.

622
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,140
Without you, these fools

623
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,820
would still think I'm trying to extort money.

624
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,460
But I find it strange.

625
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,540
Anda Hotel has such a talent

626
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,980
but she just works as a sommelier.

627
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
An idiot like that

628
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,430
is made the director of the Executive Lounge.

629
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,500
How things work in the five-star hotel

630
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,900
is really a mystery to us.

631
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,940
You're right.

632
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,620
Lu Fenfen is indeed very talented.

633
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,420
She's just a sommelier

634
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,150
because we want to test her abilities.

635
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,380
Now that she's proved herself,

636
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
I hereby announce

637
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,550
that from now on,

638
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,140
Lu Fenfen is officially promoted

639
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,380
to the director of Anda Executive Lounge.

640
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,440
She'll manage the Executive Lounge with Director Bai.

641
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,380
Then we have two directors.

642
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,860
Mr. Xu, is this appropriate?

643
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,460
I believe in you.

644
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,500
Lu Fenfen got promoted?

645
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,980
Yes, Vice President Xu Song promoted her himself.

646
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,060
I see.

647
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,400
Go back to work.

648
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,220
Okay.

649
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,700
Director Bai.

650
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:50,980
Mr. Xu.

651
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,610
Director Bai.

652
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,740
You look indignant.

653
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,580
This matter could've caused a disaster.

654
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,460
You made the trouble, but Lu Fenfen turned the tide.

655
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,060
Don't forget

656
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,659
that Lu Chengdu has a powerful boyfriend.

657
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,659
Nothing is impossible.
