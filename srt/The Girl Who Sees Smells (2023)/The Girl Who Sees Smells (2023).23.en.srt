I'm not the same fool as before.

5
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,870
Since we're going to sign a contract, I must be discreet.

6
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,380
I've added some conditions.

7
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,180
Take a look.

If you have no objections,

Nothing.

12

Your perfume smells good.

13
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,710
Since you've signed the contract,

14
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,190
you should move in as soon as possible.

15

Why didn't he kiss me after signing the contract?

34
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,020
Luckily, nothing has changed.

Lu Fenfen, right?

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,550
Only she is the most important, right?

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,700
What about us? Your friends and relatives?

48

Didn't he say we had to kiss by contract?

Why am I the one who's worried now?

53
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,940
No, Lu Fenfen.

54

It's Mingchen's health?

58
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,790
Lu Fenfen's kiss

59
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,580
can no longer relieve his disease.

He'll die at any time.

But he doesn't take it seriously.

66
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,900
Does Fenfen know?

67
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,120
It doesn't matter if she knows or not.

68
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,220
The most important thing now

69
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,250
is to find a way to save Mingchen.

70
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,490
We've tried many ways,

71

I don't know why things would become like this.

73
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,240
Today's mission is to prepare pre-mixed wine for the new wine.

74
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,220
I'll go to the winery to choose a new wine base.

75
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,490
You go to the east producing area

76
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,660
to record the varieties and yields.

77
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,980
We've harvested all the grapes in the east producing area.

78
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,840
Although I'm not a professional,

79
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,580
doesn't this wine need to

80
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,100
be remixed

81
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,500
to have the taste of love?

82
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,060
How can you make it all by yourself?

83
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,660
Why did you slap me?

84
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,500
There is a mosquito.

85
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,980
You care about me.

86
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,940
Mr. Xu, let me remind you.

87
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,940
The relationship we have now is

88
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,600
a pure relationship between Party A and Party B.

89
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,100
Please put yourself in the right mindset.

90
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,460
Why are you laughing?

91
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,900
You chirp like a little bird.

92
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,900
You look like a fool.

93
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,140
I don't know how much time like this

94
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,500
is left for me.

95
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,860
But I'm happy.

96
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,740
Look, the scenery is very beautiful.

97
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,220
It would be great

98
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,380
if we could stay in this moment forever.

99
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,220
Nothing special to me.

100
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,460
It's mainly because

101
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,320
there's someone I can share with.

102
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,820
I mean,

103
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,740
I enjoyed the scenery here

104
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,860
with the first girl I liked.

105
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,500
I regret that

106
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,320
I didn't take her to see a better view.

107
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,860
The first girl you liked?

108
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,500
Yes, I think she is my first love.

109
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,500
You have a first love?

110
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,100
No, I mean,

111
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,500
why didn't you mention it before?

112
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,580
It's quite nostalgic.

113
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,900
Then you can take your sweet time here and miss her.

114
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,630
I'm leaving.

115
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,260
Wait.

116
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,260
What now?

117
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,230
Aren't you going to think of your first love here?

118
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,650
My legs are numb.

119
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,380
What was your first love like?

120
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,980
What?

121
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,780
Forget it.

122
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,180
What "felt the taste of love"?

123
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,130
What "making a new bottle of wine together"?

124
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,620
These are just a load of crap.

125
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,000
What are you thinking?

126
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,530
Going home!

127
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,060
Lu Fenfen.

128
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,700
I have something to tell you.

129
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,370
Sometimes I wonder

130
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,890
what I like about you.

131
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,610
Is it your kiss?

132
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,980
No.

133
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,030
I think what I really like about you

134
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,860
is every moment I'm with you.

135
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,500
You know?

136
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,440
People often say that getting full marks is more precious.

137
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,900
But in my heart,

138
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,750
you are more precious than full marks.

139
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,740
Don't look back and hear me out.

140
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,100
You once took a step closer to me.

141
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,860
I promised

142
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,380
I would finish the 99 steps.

143
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,460
Do you think we're competing for our step rankings on WeChat?

144
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,220
Since childhood,

145
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,130
my life has been like a blueprint.

146
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,060
I never took the wrong steps

147
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,740
or made any mistakes.

148
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,880
I thought this would be my ending.

149
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,660
A perfect ending.

150
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,020
But until I met you, Lu Fenfen.

151
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,940
You're like an unexpected wind in the sea

152
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,060
that gives a new route to the boat

153
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,180
and a new path to my life.

154
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,540
So since you've come to my world,

155
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,780
I won't let you go.

156
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,380
Do you think

157
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,700
you can pretend nothing happened

158
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,430
after you confessed your love to me, Xu Mingchen?

159
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,340
Is this the so-called way

160
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,000
that asked her out and took care of the investor?

161
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,460
And you have said these sweet words

162
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,180
to your first love too, right?

163
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,700
I really mean it.

164
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,580
You mean it?

165
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,380
If it were the first time, I might have believed it.

166
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,900
But now I know your tricks too well.

167
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,860
People like you, who know

168
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,120
how to use emotions and people's hearts,

169
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,760
would never do something that has no return.

170
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,040
You're still so angry,

171
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,060
so you wouldn't talk to me nicely.

172
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,540
So I want to talk to you more now.

173
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,740
I'm afraid there won't be a chance for me in the future.

174
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,200
What are you trying to say?

175
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,210
I don't know.

176
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,740
But I want to cherish

177
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,940
every minute and every second with you.

178
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,470
I don't have time to be emotional with you.

179
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,260
I'm going back to the office.

180
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,100
Are you okay?

181
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,560
Does it still hurt?

182
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,260
Let me take you to the hospital.

183
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,660
I'm fine.

184
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,220
Actually, I know the real meaning behind the Kiss.

185
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,380
What?

186
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,819
Whether it's sour

187
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,220
or sweet,

188
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,060
it's love itself.

189
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,380
Sometimes, when people live too hard,

190
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,819
they will want sweet love.

191
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,460
But without tasting the bitterness and sourness,

192
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,390
they won't know what sweetness is.

193
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,380
Without any kind of flavor,

194
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,020
it is not complete love.

195
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,060
Actually, I'm thinking

196
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,860
there's no need to make a single choice

197
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,900
when it comes to wines.

198
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,230
We can name it in different phases of a relationship.

199
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,760
Every phase is different,

200
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,340
so the flavor that corresponds to the phase will be different.

201
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,700
Breakup is sour.

202
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,900
Reunion is sour and sweet.

203
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,700
If a couple gets married,

204
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,940
marriage is the fruit.

205
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,140
The taste should be mature, comprehensive,

206
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,300
and sweet.

207
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,420
So there should be a series of wines in Kiss.

208
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,780
When customers experience different phases of love,

209
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,580
they can drink different wines from the Kiss series.

210
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,220
Yes.

211
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,420
I'm going to open a bottle to celebrate.

212
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,540
Let me do it.

213
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,380
That's not right.

214
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,180
Why is he so weak now?

215
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,420
Your medicine.

216
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,490
If you need medicine,

217
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,020
you can go to the hospital and get it yourself.

218
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,500
I don't want to do any more tests.

219
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,030
Didn't I ask you to prescribe me more bottles?

220
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:21,980
More?

221
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,430
Do you think they are vitamins?

222
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,420
Do you know

223
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,350
all your indicators are dropping?

224
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,300
Mingchen, you can die anytime.

225
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,300
Yijiang, leave me alone.

226
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,060
I just need to maintain the basics.

227
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,620
I'll call Qingran now.

228
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,520
What are you doing?

229
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,560
Do you know what you are doing now?

230
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,020
I've called my sister.

231
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,620
Do you know why she supports

232
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,940
my decision to refuse treatment?

233
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,700
Why?

234
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,210
Because she knows

235
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,620
this might really be my last time.

236
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,220
She loves me more than anyone else.

237
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,500
So in the end, she hoped I could be happy.

238
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,020
I hope you can give me one last chance.

239
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,580
I can't just watch you pass away like this.

240
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,940
Give me more time.

241
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,300
I will find a good treatment.

242
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,500
Trust me.

243
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,140
I once watched a movie.

244
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,460
There's a line in it

245
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,540
saying that life is about letting go,

246
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,700
but the most heartbreaking thing

247
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,240
is that you didn't say goodbye properly.

248
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,580
I'm happy to have this moment now.

249
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,580
Thank you.

250
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,940
I will never forget you.

251
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,660
Mr. Li, our latest version

252
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,260
is designed and named

253
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,140
based on different phases of a relationship.

254
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,460
Each phase

255
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,700
has a different flavor.

256
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,700
For example, the First Love,

257
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,550
[First Love] [Breakup] [Reunion]

258
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,170
is sweet.

259
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,740
The Breakup is sour.

260
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,220
Last, the Reunion is full of fruity fragrance.

261
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,340
The taste of tannin is soft, with a distinct sweet aftertaste.

262
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,380
This is the last wine

263
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,780
in our series.

264
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,580
It's both the sour and sweet taste of love.

265
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,000
[Breakup] [Reunion]

266
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,500
At the same time, it's our Kiss series' expectation

267
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,700
and interpretation of love.

268
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,380
I'm sorry, Miss Lu.

269
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,420
I may not be able to fulfill my promise

270
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,650
to invest in you.

271
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,420
Why?

272
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,540
Haven't we found

273
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,900
the soul of the Kiss?

274
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,570
And I also cooperated with Xu Mingchen

275
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,430
according to your requirements.

276
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,770
Calm down, Miss Lu.

277
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,700
I mean, I personally can't invest in you.

278
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,580
What do you mean?

279
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,100
I have to say that

280
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,620
the quality of your demo

281
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,140
and the concept you described

282
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,660
are far beyond my expectations.

283
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,740
It deserves a higher valuation.

284
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,220
I've recommended you

285
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,820
to the industrial fund specializing in investing in wine companies.

286
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,900
Really?

287
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,570
You mean...

288
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,510
Congratulations, Miss Lu.

289
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,260
You'll get more investments.

290
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,700
Ten, hundred, thousand, hundred thousand, million,

291
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,500
hundred thousand...

292
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,550
Since we saved the Kiss,

293
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,300
should we celebrate?

294
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,060
Is he asking me to forgive him?

295
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,980
Of course.

296
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,620
I have to celebrate with my colleagues first.

297
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,820
What about you and me?

298
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,900
Yes. I have to thank someone

299
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,560
for his cooperation anytime.

300
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,340
Just thanks?

301
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,700
Fenfen, I need your help.

302
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,860
Yijiang.

303
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
What is it?

304
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,050
If you don't help, Mingchen will...

305
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,420
Come with me.

306
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,980
Let go of me. It hurts!

307
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,860
You can feel hurt too?

308
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,290
You don't have to be sarcastic.

309
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,140
What did I do?

310
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,300
Fenfen.

311
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,400
Can you fall in love with Mingchen again?

312
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,900
Why should I have to fall in love with him again?

313
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,980
I beg you.

314
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,220
Please fall in love with him again, okay?

315
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,260
You beg me?

316
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
Why?

317
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,500
Why should I have to fall in love with a man

318
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,820
who has been lying to me all along?

319
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,180
Because he is a patient.

320
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,110
Mingchen never intended to lie to you.

321
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,770
Without your love, he would...

322
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,860
he would die!

323
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,790
Are you that cold-blooded?

324
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,100
Don't you even have a little compassion?

325
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,860
I'm cold-blooded?

326
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,860
Don't act as if

327
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,980
Xu Mingchen has been wronged.

Let me get this straight.

330

I'm saving him by kissing him right now.

331
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,140
Besides, it's not my duty.

332

who is far away

and has some strange disease

335

and needs my kisses to save him,

336
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,780
do I have to kiss him too?

I'm not a Bodhisattva.

Mingchen is just a passerby to you?

No.

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,290
Come here.

343
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,710
Look carefully.

344
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,880
The woman standing in front of you

345
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,660
doesn't love you at all.

346
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,580
You're right.

347
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,940
I don't love him.

348
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,540
Is there a problem?

349
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,740
Let me tell you.

350
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,300
I kiss you out of humanism.

351
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,940
But my feelings are mine.

352
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,180
I'm free.

353
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,540
Okay.

354
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,420
Let's go, Yijiang.

355
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,660
Are you Miss Lu?

356
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,260
Yes.

357
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,380
These are handmade, sun-dried flowers specially made for you

358
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,310
without pollen.

[Customized Flower] [Xu Mingchen]

361
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,140
I can only agree with half of your terms.

362
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,940
Which half?

363
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,340
I can not go back to France for a while.

364
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,800
I can take care of Qingran.

365
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,940
But Fenfen...

366
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,710
You take care of your own woman.

367
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,120
Why are you still like a child?

368
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,270
Can an adult ignore your life?

369
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,710
Or can adults accept anything?

370
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,220
They don't care even if their family dies?

371
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,780
I never said I would give up.

372
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,170
I just have to prepare for the worst.

373
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,140
Fenfen.

374
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,520
I really can do nothing about her.

375
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,340
She's too stubborn.

376
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,560
Didn't you ask Mr. Li to arrange everything for you?

377
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,180
You're quite clear.

378
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,060
So I hope you can promise me.

379
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,460
My time is running out.

380
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,410
[Contract expired. You can have the house. Don't worry]

♫Will we meet again at the next intersection?♫

382
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,540
Is this my end?

♫Like the answer you can't tell me♫

384

♫Let the wind say what you want to say♫

♫Maybe I've been walking for too long and forgot to stop♫

388
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,610
♫Will stepping on your shadow count as a hug?♫

♫But your sweet words♫

♫I would say yes with a smile♫

402

00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,660
♫You cover your sight clumsily♫

406

♫I'm afraid you'll get tired of me being in love alone♫

407
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,360

417
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,820
Lu Fenfen.

418
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,310
Do you really have a clear conscience?

419
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,780
What exactly do you want?

420
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,660
If you're here to help Xu Mingchen

421
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,540
accuse me meaninglessly,

422
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,860
you are not welcome here.

423
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,190
Do you know Mingchen...

424
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,620
Mingchen is dying.

425
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,340
Fenfen.

426
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,900
I've never easily begged anyone in my life.

427
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,060
But I can't stand there and watch my brother

428
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,390
lie in the hospital bed.

429
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,980
He has tubes all over his body

430
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,430
and waits for death, you know?

431
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,820
As a doctor,

432
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,500
I can do nothing.

433
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,980
If possible,

434
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,580
I really hope I'm the one lying there

435
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,460
instead of him.

436
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,860
Fenfen, I beg you.

437
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,500
Please help him.

438
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,500
Please save him.

439
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,460
What do you mean he's dying?

440
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,980
I know. I have nothing to say

441
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,420
to a woman like you.

442
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,740
Mingchen is just a stepping stone

443
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,820
to achieving your great dream.

444
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,100
Have you ever cared about his life

445
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,540
or whether he's doing well?

446
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,740
Love is not a single give-and-take.

447
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,460
Lu Fenfen.

448
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,020
You're too selfish and self-righteous.

449
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,380
You don't deserve Mingchen's love.

450
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,780
Tell me.

451
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
What do you mean by "he's dying"?

452
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,700
What do you mean he's dying?

453
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,460
Go see him for the last time.

454
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,340
Maybe...

455
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,580
maybe you can see him one last time.
