5
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,420
Will Mingchen wake up?

6
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,690
This time, he will.

7
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,500
Tell me.

8
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,820
What will happen next?

9
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,170
Tell me.

10
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,300
He will faint again

11
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,940
and be unconscious for a long time.

12
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,490
No one can tell when he'll wake up again.

13
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,100
Maybe in a few weeks. Maybe longer.

14
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,100
And then, he will…

15
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,500
Can I stay with him?

16
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,090
Mingchen told me

17
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,220
if that day really comes,

18
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,780
he wants to leave quietly.

19
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,660
He doesn't want us to get all teary-eyed.

20
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:06,140
I believe he wants to say goodbye to you with a smile.

21
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,980
I see.

22
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,780
Fenfen.

23
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,740
Yijiang, how is he?

24
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,890
Mingchen.

25
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,060
Mingchen! Xu Mingchen!

26
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,540
Xu Mingchen!

27
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,300
Fenfen, calm down.

28
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,950
Qingran.

29
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,540
Is it my fault?

30
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,420
This is not the time

31
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,780
to blame yourself.

32
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,380
Don't worry.

33
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,580
I'll do everything I can to save him.

34
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,020
Sorry, Fenfen.

35
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,140
We have no idea why your kiss doesn't work.

36
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,100
When did it start?

37
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,380
After you found out that Mingchen got close to you

38
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,620
because your kiss could save him.

39
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,340
It's because of me?

40
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,850
Because I don't love him anymore?

41
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,780
We don't know.

42
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,500
We don't know either

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,600
why your kiss saved him

44
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,140
when you two met

45
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,180
for the first time

46
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,820
or why it didn't do the trick this time.

47
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,060
I love him.

48
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,020
I did say the opposite, but…

49
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,580
Fenfen, this is not your fault.

50
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,300
Why does my kiss not work?

51
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,660
You're wrong, Miss Lu.

52
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,620
Your kiss still works.

53
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,380
You just said it doesn't work

54
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,860
and now you say it does.

55
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,060
You're contradicting yourself.

56
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,380
Miss Lu,

57
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,020
we've done a lot of research

58
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,610
on molecular biology, immunology,

59
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,220
and protein molecules.

60
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,860
We monitored how your saliva

61
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,100
worked in Mr. Xu's body

62
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,300
and how different protein expressions

63
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,659
affected each other.

64
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,380
We've come to a conclusion.

65
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,540
The enzymes in your saliva

66
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,980
are the same as normal people's.

67
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,060
From a pharmacological perspective,

68
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,620
your kiss has no special effects.

69
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,810
It's not Mr. Xu's cure.

70
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,820
However,

71
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260
we did notice

72
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,420
that every time you kissed Mr. Xu,

73
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,700
his numbers

74
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,980
improved greatly.

75
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,380
It's an undeniable fact.

76
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,020
So does my kiss work or not?

77
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,340
The sun rises not because the cock crows,

78
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,860
but there is indeed

79
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,940
an intricate connection between them.

80
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,060
Maybe your kiss and Mr. Xu's condition

81
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,700
have some sort of connection too.

82
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,500
The connection between me and Mingchen?

83
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,780
Yes, sometimes,

84
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,660
dying patients recover miraculously.

85
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,140
They see light

86
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,250
in their darkest moments.

87
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,100
Usually, people call the light

88
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,250
a miracle.

89
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,940
But we prefer to call such a miracle

90
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,290
the magic of love.

91
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,340
You love Mr. Xu.

92
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,100
Mr. Xu loves you deeply too.

93
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,180
It's your love and care for each other

94
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,300
that healed him.

95
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,300
I didn't heal him.

96
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,900
If I had,

97
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
he wouldn't be lying there now.

98
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,740
You haven't told me

99
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,180
whether my kiss works or not.

100
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,780
Has he fallen out of love with me?

101
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,860
Miss Lu,

102
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,060
life is not a fairy tale.

103
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,100
The only thing we know

104
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,660
is that without you,

105
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,940
Mr. Xu would've passed away half a year ago.

106
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,900
None of us here and no doctors

107
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,500
in the world can do what you did.

108
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,420
Fenfen, I want to thank you.

109
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,340
Not for saving Mingchen,

110
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,930
but for giving him

111
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,940
great memories.

112
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:46,100
You two were in love and happy.

113
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,659
That's enough.

114
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,220
Life is all about letting go.

115
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,620
What hurts me the most

116
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,140
is that I haven't said goodbye to Mingchen.

117
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,340
Where are you going?

118
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,980
I want to be with Mingchen.

119
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,220
Mingchen, you're awake.

120
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,250
Wait a moment.

121
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,460
Will you forgive me?

122
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,410
Don't talk. Have a good rest.

123
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,860
Don't worry.

124
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,460
Qingran will try her best to cure you.

125
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,180
She said she'd send you abroad for treatment.

126
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,610
Yijiang told me everything.

127
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,010
So when are you leaving?

128
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:59,210
In about a week.

129
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,250
Then I'll take a week off.

130
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,020
You don't want me to leave, right?

131
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,420
Of course I don't.

132
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,060
A week is too short.

133
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,490
I want to be with you every day.

134
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,100
You're suddenly so nice. I'm not used to it.

135
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,540
You don't like it?

136
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,420
I've made up my mind.

137
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,700
If you're really going to leave me,

138
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,180
no matter how many days,

139
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,450
weeks,

140
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,460
or years you'll be away,

141
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,220
you'll always hold a place in my heart.

142
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,940
I'll blame myself for the rest of my life.

143
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,500
I'll live in guilt.

144
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,940
Sorry.

145
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,660
I'll be away for a long time,

146
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,140
because my disease is complicated.

147
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,940
I can't keep in touch with you.

148
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,610
I can't call you,

149
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,860
text you,

150
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,820
or Skype you.

151
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,540
But no matter how long we'll be apart,

152
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,980
I'll never forget you.

153
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,340
I'll always wait for you.

154
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,940
I won't forget you either.

155
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,300
I won't call you

156
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,340
when I miss you.

157
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,370
I'll listen to our old voice messages.

158
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,460
I won't Skype you either.

159
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,980
I'll just look at our old photos.

160
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,260
In the next seven days,

161
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,890
we'll take lots of photos.

162
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,740
I'll miss you

163
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,860
when the sun rises

164
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,980
and when the sun sets.

165
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,300
When you miss me,

166
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,820
you must know that I'm missing you too.

167
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,500
And we still have a lot of time before you go.

168
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,100
Seven days.

169
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,820
It's a long period of time.

170
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,770
We can do lots of things.

171
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,620
There are so many things we haven't done together.

172
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,500
We'll create many great memories.

173
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,500
Let the memories of the seven days light up

174
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,180
every day of our lives in the future, okay?

175
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:28,260
[ICU] [Operation Room]

176
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,180
Don't move.

177
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,180
Right now.

178
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
I'm not leaving.

179
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,660
Why did you turn off the light?

180
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,700
What's going on?

181
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,060
Wait a moment.

182
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,900
Make a wish.

183
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,380
A wish?

184
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,380
What I'm going to say next

185
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,260
is all from the bottom of my heart.

186
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,500
I'll just speak my mind.

187
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,460
You can't interrupt me.

188
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,100
You're the person I hate the most

189
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,100
because you always lie to me.

190
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,180
But actually,

191
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,980
I fell in love with you

192
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,340
when I first met you.

193
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,140
I think every day

194
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,420
that if my kiss could save you,

195
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,380
it would be wonderful.

196
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,260
Unfortunately, they told me

197
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,700
it can't.

198
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,819
I'm useless to you now.

199
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,380
Every time you lied to me,

200
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,220
I was angry.

201
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,540
You went too far this time.

202
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,060
How could you do this to me?

203
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,930
I love you.

204
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,700
I didn't dare to say it to you,

205
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,340
because I didn't know

206
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,460
whether I love you because I need your kiss

207
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,660
or because I'm really drawn to you.

208
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,180
I never told you

209
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,050
I love you.

210
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,220
Now I finally realize

211
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,860
that it has nothing to do

212
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,260
with my disease or anything else

213
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,380
in the world.

214
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,420
Lu Fenfen.

215
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,100
I love you.

216
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,700
I love you too.

217
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,020
Mingchen.

218
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,380
Fenfen.

219
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,580
When you read this letter,

220
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,060
I've already left.

221
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,940
All the past days

222
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,540
and every moment I spent with you

223
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,540
are like movies.

224
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,140
They keep playing in my mind.

225
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,620
Do you remember when we first met?

226
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,730
It's funny

227
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,900
that our love story began

228
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,420
in the men's bathroom.

229
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,420
I bet

230
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,740
I must have scared you.

231
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,260
I took one glance at you.

♫I'm caught unprepared♫

236

♫Intertwined or paralleled♫

241

♫How should I organize my words♫

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,060
No medicine can heal a broken heart.

344
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,770
I'm worried

345
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,380
that if she goes on like this,

346
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,770
she'll suffer from severe depression

347
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,300
and hallucinations.

348
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,140
Depression will make her body break down.

349
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,420
She may even commit suicide.

350
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:08,270
[I drank a lot today, although you told me not to. Are you angry?]

351
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,390
[If you are, tell me off.]

352
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,500
I regret it so much now.

353
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,940
Xu Mingchen tried his best

354
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,540
to do so many things for me,

355
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,460
but I didn't know it until now.

356
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,460
When I realized what he did,

357
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,740
it was already too late.

358
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,620
Even in the last days we spent together,

359
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:58,080
[Let bygones be bygones]

360
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,580
I couldn't do anything for him.

361
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,130
He told me

362
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,580
not to miss him for too long.

363
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,220
He told me to forget him.

364
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,010
I can't forget him.

365
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,540
I won't forget him.

366
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,700
For the rest of my life,

367
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,780
I'll keep thinking about him

368
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,140
and missing him like I do now.

369
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:33,990
[Six months later]

370
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,340
I made this wine

371
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,380
in collaboration with Anda Winery.

372
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,720
[Bring the best wines to the world. It starts with you.]

373
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,540
It's called Tomorrow.

374
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,380
It means tomorrow will always be a new day.

375
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,570
I designed it

376
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,180
for a special person.

377
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,500
For me,

378
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,140
every day I wait for him

379
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,330
is full of hope.

380
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,650
I want to share this wine with you.

381
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,380
I wish everyone drinking this wine

382
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,740
can have hope

383
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,540
and believe that miracles will happen.

384
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,060
Fenfen.

385
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,380
Fenfen.

386
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,660
Fenfen.

387
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,700
Fenfen!

388
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,060
Call an ambulance!

389
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,620
Fenfen.

390
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,250
Yijiang,

391
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,540
Fenfen has passed out frequently lately.

392
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,010
What's wrong with her?

393
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,460
I checked her test reports repeatedly.

394
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,650
Everything is normal.

395
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,260
Maybe she just has overworked herself.

396
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,250
We should let her rest quietly.

397
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,420
Let's go.

398
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,420
We'll go back.

399
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,930
You must get better.

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,440
