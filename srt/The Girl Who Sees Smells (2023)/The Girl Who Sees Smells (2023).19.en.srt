4
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,590
This is the egg you want.

5
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,979
You are good at cooking breakfast.

6
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,060
I bought them at the supermarket. All semi-finished.

7
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,620
He Le, did we sleep together last night?

8
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,940
Yes.

9
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,730
Get up.

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,410
It's okay.

11
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,740
Qiao Yi, I've made up my mind.

12
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,020
I want to marry you.

13
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,020
Marry me?

14
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,579
Are you crazy?

15
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,780
You don't have to do that.

16
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,010
I'm serious.

17
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,350
I have to do that for myself.

18
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,430
Everything is fine.

19
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,460
When the test result comes out,

20
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,990
it should show no problems.

21
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,090
As long as Fenfen is with you,

22
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,740
you are a healthy person like anybody else.

23
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,340
You just need to have a health check once a year.

24
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,940
Good joke.

25
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,100
Mingchen,

26
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,900
do you have a plan for the long-term future?

27
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,300
A plan for the future?

28
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,860
I hope Dr. Jian

29
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,660
can find the cure for my disease

30
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,620
so that I won't

31
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,260
have to kiss her every day.

32
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,900
This is not funny.

33
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,780
I'm a magical doctor.

34
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,660
Sometimes, advancements in medical science won't work.

35
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,380
I think

36
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,140
your plan for the future

37
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,200
should be something about Lu Fenfen.

38
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,010
What do you mean?

39
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,579
I mean

40
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,510
you should get married to her.

41
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,850
Maybe her love is your cure.

42
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,290
I want to marry her for sure.

43
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,140
But we've been lying to her.

44
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,590
If she finds out the truth one day,

45
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,740
will she…

46
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,350
Will she still want to marry me?

47
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,620
Guys,

48
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm getting married.

49
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,780
Married? To whom?

50
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,620
Fenfen.

51
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,020
Her best friend, Qiao Yi.

52
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,790
He Le, don't make such a joke again.

53
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,100
I was shocked.

54
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,779
Why are you getting married?

55
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,770
Why Qiao Yi?

56
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,900
Are you crazy?

57
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,710
Or did Qiao Yi threaten you?

58
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,260
When did you start dating each other?

59
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,620
How come we know nothing about it?

60
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,820
Stop. Sit down.

61
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,670
Let's have a meeting.

62
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,820
First,

63
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
Qiao Yi and I really love each other.

64
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,659
I know it happened a little bit fast,

65
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,220
but don't be jealous of me

66
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,700
because of this.

67
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,780
Second,

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,060
you know

69
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,900
I'm used to spending very freely.

70
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,620
Now I'm getting married, the cost will be...

71
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,100
I need

72
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,660
a bigger house.

73
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,420
And I should also have

74
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,410
a more fancy car, right?

75
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,380
So,

76
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,540
I'm here to tell you

77
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,220
not to spend too much money

78
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,820
before I get married.

79
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,420
I don't need to…

80
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,710
Where are you going?

81
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,550
Where are you going?

82
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,060
Yijiang, you have to help me.

83
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,060
Come on, Mingchen.

84
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,380
I'm sure you'll get my gift money.

85
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,300
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,900
I'm not that kind of person.

87
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,620
How much will your gift money be?

88
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,030
Everybody is here.

89
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,620
I asked you to come today

90
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,680
because I have something to tell you.

91
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,870
Pear in Wine just called me.

92
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,460
She complained a lot about Ding Nana.

93
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,860
I think their collaborations didn't go well

94
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,920
and she wants to collaborate with us.

95
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,020
So what do you think?

96
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,550
I am fine with it.

97
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,250
After all, she's a top KOL now.

98
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,820
It's a good thing if she can work with us.

99
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,710
Don't you remember that she once stood you up?

100
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,540
Forget about it.

101
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,900
You are the boss. You make the decision.

102
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,760
I decide not to collaborate with her.

103
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,460
If Qiao Yi feels too tired,

104
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,860
we can let He Le do it.

105
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,500
No, I really can't do it.

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,630
I have a lot of work to do in the company.

107
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,270
It's okay. I'll give you a few days off.

108
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,100
You're not doing your job anyway.

109
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,060
He Le, can you do the live stream?

110
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,120
When does it start?

111
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,020
Deal. It's you.

112
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,700
Anyway,

113
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,540
I will never accept Pear in Wine.

114
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,660
She lied to us.

115
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,670
So she's not trustworthy anymore.

116
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,290
Fenfen,

117
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,540
that's how doing business is all about.

118
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,540
I don't mind it anymore.

119
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,740
You shouldn't either.

120
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,380
It's not just about that.

121
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,780
It's about principles.

122
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,240
A liar should never be given a second chance.

123
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,300
And I will never

124
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,500
make friends with people who lied to me.

125
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,180
Fine, it's your decision.

126
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,500
You are the boss.

127
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,980
Okay.

128
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,380
I have something to tell you.

129
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,140
Are we liars?

130
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,940
Not really.

131
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,820
What's wrong, Miss Qiao?

132
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,980
Why are you being so mysterious?

133
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,460
Please stay cool when you hear the news.

134
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,940
Don't be too surprised.

135
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,500
Are you going to quit?

136
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,620
The company has just started to operate.

137
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,550
You can't leave.

138
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,320
No. What are you thinking?

139
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,970
Thank God it's not about that.

140
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,030
Tell me. What is it?

141
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,260
I am getting married.

142
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,419
What do you think?

143
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,620
I'll give you much...

144
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,500
You are getting married?

145
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,380
To whom?

146
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,300
How about He Le?

147
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,700
He Le?

148
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,260
When did you start fooling around with him?

149
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,860
Why didn't you tell me?

150
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,620
Mind your language.

151
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,180
It's not fooling around.

152
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,540
You don't think he is the right person for me?

153
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,700
I didn't mean that.

154
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,700
The thing is,

155
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,370
at the beginning,

156
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,220
it didn't seem like you would be a couple.

157
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,500
But gradually, I feel like he may be your Mr. Right.

158
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,200
So do you think this is good or bad?

159
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
I don't know.

160
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,100
But my opinion doesn't matter.

161
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,830
What matters is your feelings.

162
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,300
Do you really like him?

163
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,060
Well, yes.

164
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,180
He is quite serious about the marriage thing.

165
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,740
I just didn't expect myself to get married so soon.

166
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,420
But you know just one night…

[Renmin Hospital Pregnancy Test Result]

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
So sudden, right?

169

You are pregnant?

Don't shout.

He Le doesn't know this yet.

172

It all happened so quickly.

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,660
So, so, sudden.

175
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,150
He must have been trained for this.

176
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,660
I make things between me and He Le a very low-key affair.

177
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,010
Your boyfriend is so slow in action.

178
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,460
Besides,

179
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,540
you've been dating for a long time.

180
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,940
Did he say anything about getting married?

181
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,060
Stop it.

182
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,160
He hasn't said anything about it yet.

183
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,100
Stop drinking.

184
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,620
I don't know why you're so unhappy.

185
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,250
He Le,

186
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,740
you're so lucky.

187
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,300
I can't believe a man like you

188
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,770
is getting married soon.

189
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,570
You will be in a new stage of life.

190
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,590
You've got everything now.

191
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,140
Yes.

192
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,160
So you just think too much.

193
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,420
Learn from me.

194
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,740
Hold the ring in your left hand and the roses in your right hand.

195
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,100
Kneel on one knee and say,

196
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,690
"Lu Fenfen, do you want to marry me?"

197
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,940
She will answer, "Yes, I do."

198
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,940
That's it.

199
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,540
Then you and Fenfen can be happy

200
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,650
in bed.

201
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,980
Not necessarily in bed.

202
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
This is not difficult at all.

203
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,380
Sit down.

204
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,260
He Le.

205
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,180
Mingchen is not you.

206
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,980
He needs to consider his marriage carefully.

207
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,510
What are you talking about?

208
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,460
Didn't you see the look in Fenfen eyes?

209
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,580
She made it clear.

210
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,180
Either it's because you don't want to marry her,

211
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,100
or you are just not that serious about this relationship.

212
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,770
What do you want? Just a lover?

213
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,620
I do want to marry her.

214
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,420
But I don't want to lie to her.

215
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,620
You didn't lie to her.

216
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,540
Are you talking about your disease?

217
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,340
But Fenfen

218
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,940
has already known about it.

219
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,380
It's the fact

220
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
that only Lu Fenfen's kiss

221
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,340
can alleviate his pain.

222
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Are you going to tell her about this?

223
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,940
You can't do that.

224
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,060
Are you crazy?

225
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,260
Why?

226
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,590
Marriage concerns two people.

227
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,540
We should be honest with each other.

228
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,730
It's not about honesty.

229
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,020
I don't think you should do that.

230
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,580
Look.

231
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,020
Even a Frankenstein knows it.

232
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,580
Don't be silly.

233
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,640
Mingchen, listen.

234
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,620
You marry Lu Fenfen now.

235
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,300
Cherish her like you did before.

236
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,180
Though she doesn't know the truth,

237
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,420
she will be happy.

238
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,700
However,

239
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,260
if you tell

240
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,320
everything to her,

241
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,220
do you think she'll be happy?

242
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,620
No. She will be in pain.

243
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,860
She will probably break up with you.

244
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,700
Then all our efforts

245
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,960
will be in vain.

246
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,310
Mingchen, listen to me.

247
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,380
Sometimes, telling lies is better than being honest.

248
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,060
No, I can't do it.

249
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,700
Why?

250
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,360
She will never find out if you don't tell her.

251
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,180
You remember Pear in Wine?

252
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,260
Lu Fenfen said

253
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,580
she will never make friends with people who lied to her.

254
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,940
She hates lies.

255
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,740
Mingchen.

256
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,540
You can't do that.

257
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,700
Come on.

258
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,620
Look.

259
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,390
I'm pregnant now. Can I still lose weight?

260
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,100
I look fat.

261
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,260
That's not true.

262
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,780
You are so thin.

263
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,140
You are so pretty. You have a slim waist.

264
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,860
Fenfen,

265
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,220
will my belly become larger next month?

266
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,980
How about I get a larger size?

267
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,460
I don't know.

268
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,100
I don't think so.

269
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,740
I am so jealous of you.

270
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,180
Is it possible

271
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,900
that I am still not married

272
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,350
after your baby is born?

273
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,020
Xu Mingchen is strange.

274
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,020
He likes you a lot.

275
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,540
Why didn't he mention the marriage thing?

276
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,600
I don't know what he's worried about.

277
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,780
Maybe he thinks marriage is not good for your career.

278
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,460
No way. Such a ridiculous excuse.

279
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,540
It's possible.

280
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,250
He looks weird

281
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,580
and has many strange ideas.

282
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,980
But with what he has now,

283
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,460
he can find a wife easily.

284
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,580
There is no chance for you.

285
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:29,930
You…

286
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,500
To be honest,

287
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,130
I think

288
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,900
he is a man

289
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,060
of avoidant attachment.

290
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,170
He looks very negative.

291
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,850
But he wants to be loved badly.

292
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,940
He needs the external stimulus sometimes.

293
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
You need to push him when necessary.

294
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,250
What should I do?

295
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,180
Should I propose to him.

296
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,340
Why not?

297
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,060
You're starting your own business now.

298
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,740
You are an independent woman.

299
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,300
You can take the initiative

300
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
instead of waiting for him to do something.

301
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,660
But I...

302
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,160
Conventional wisdom tells us

303
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,220
it is much easier for a girl

304
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,300
to chase a boy than vice versa.

305
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,530
Got it.

306
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,460
Got it.

307
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,540
Look.

308
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,360
[Anda Hotel]

309
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,310
Hello, Mr. Wang.

310
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,660
Yes, Anda is now in difficulties.

311
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,380
But don't worry.

312
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,640
We will solve the problems immediately.

313
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,500
Hello?

314
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,100
Sister, Xu Song is so well prepared this time.

315
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,980
No one is willing

316
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,940
to help Anda now.

317
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,820
I can't believe it.

318
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,730
He really wants to ruin Anda.

319
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,050
He also has shares in Anda.

320
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,120
If I do not guess wrong,

321
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,340
he has sold them all.

322
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,940
He is really cruel.

323
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,660
Did you drink?

324
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,440
I could smell alcohol on your breath.

325
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,180
I'm fine. Don't worry.

326
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,660
I know you're anxious.

327
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,130
That's why I came here

328
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,790
to tell you what has happened.

329
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
I saw the news.

330
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,180
But I don't understand it.

331
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,850
Mingchen didn't come back.

332
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,820
He Le is extremely busy now,

333
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,580
let alone Xu Mingchen.

334
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,300
By the way,

335
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,940
Xu Le told me this is a hostile takeover.

336
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,620
A foreign company has always wanted to take over Anda.

337
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,860
He Le and Mingchen both refused.

338
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,420
But Xu Song betrayed them.

339
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,380
Xu Song?

340
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,660
Mingchen's uncle?

341
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,940
Yes, that's him.

342
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,180
Let me tell you.

343
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,300
What Bai Bing did

344
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,180
was actually his order.

I know.

346
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,770
I heard he was fired.

347
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,660
But he kept his shares.

348
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,460
He has sold them all.

349
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,980
And he revealed

350
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,510
many trade secrets of Anda.

351
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,900
Judging from the current situation,

352
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,300
Anda is in great trouble.

353
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,460
What can I do?

354
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,849
Just take good care of yourself.

355
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,020
That's what Xu Mingchen

356

Don't think too much.

362
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,460
He Le told me

363
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,660
they're just hyping.

364
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,940
I know.

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,020
I have my own a company.

I know this is just a business strategy.

I understand.

368

But I'm afraid you will be unhappy.

369
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,180
I'm not.

I have faith in Xu Mingchen.

Let's go on preparing these documents.

374

Only when I am stronger,

can I give him some help.

that Fenfen is preparing for some competition.

379
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,700
She wants to win a big prize and help us.

380
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,380
She is naive.

381

We need much more money than she can ever imagine.

382

Well,

383

I am happy that she wants to help.

she still wants to help us.

386

Everything looks a little bit strange here.

396

But Fenfen is not that kind of person.

397
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,220
She is not going to propose to you.

this is not just a party, right?

You realize it?

442
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,630
Xu Mingchen has been procrastinating

443

so Fenfen decided to take actions today.

444
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,490
Is Fenfen going to propose to Mingchen?

445

Why are you so nervous?

446
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,260
Xu Mingchen will say no to Fenfen?

447

Does he want to marry Ding Nana?

448
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,740
That's impossible.

The weather is so hot

462
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,740
but we have to wear thick clothes.

463
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,540
Our clothes and boat are rented.

464
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,080
You have to pay us more.

465
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,660
250 yuan each.

466
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,580

Turn around.

474
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,700
Turn around.

475
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,380
Yijiang.

476
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,700
Open it.

is the best thing that can ever happen to me.

480

I know this is not the best timing.

481
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,380
But I still want to ask you,

482
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,520
will you let me take care of you for the rest of your life?

483

Ready.

484
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,230
Marriage concerns two people.

485
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
We should be honest with each other.

486
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,700
I can't do it.

487

488
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,060
Let me ask you again.

489
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,730
Will you let me take care of you forever?

490
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,900
Fenfen.

491
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,060
Fenfen.

492
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,700
This must be your prank.

493
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,860
You got Xu Mingchen, right?

494
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,140
Yes, this is a prank.

495
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,060
Now it is over.

496
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,060
Xu Mingchen, you can leave now.

497
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,380
Leader.

498
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,380
Fenfen.

499
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,980
Actually,

500
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,140
I have a feeling

501
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,500
that Fenfen's kiss

502
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,560
is not what has been alleviating my pain.

503
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,660
Her love is.

504
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,060
I was wrong.

505
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,950
I regret that I lied to you, Fenfen.

506
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,540
What should I do?

507
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,860
Fenfen doesn't know anything about it.

508
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,810
If she finds out...

509
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,770
Sir, what would you like?

510
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,380
Whisky.

511
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:10,980
Okay.

512
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,820
Thank you.

513
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,980
Fenfen, Mingchen definitely wants to marry you.

514
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,660
He rejected for a reason.

515
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,180
What reason?

516
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,180
What does he mean?

517
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,380
Mingchen.

518
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,380
It's really you.

519
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,220
I thought you are somebody else.

520
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,140
Why are you here?

521
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,100
Fenfen.

522
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,020
You're drunk.

523
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,780
Mingchen.

524
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,540
You look so sad.

525
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,580
I thought you are getting married.

526
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,020
You should be happy.

527
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:55,220
Fenfen, it's not because I don't want to marry you,

528
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,140
but please give me more time.

529
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,460
Mingchen, it's me.

530
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,020
Thank you.

531
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,980
What do you think I intended to do?

532
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,700
I don't know.

533
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,560
I don't know about you.

534
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,790
This is a nice house.

535
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,500
You're lucky.

536
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,060
But in this world,

537
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,180
luck won't help you get everything.

538
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,110
People in the world are like different wines.

539
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,160
They have different social status and origins.

540
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,980
No matter how good the wine from an ordinary vineyard is,

541
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,310
it can't be labeled as Chianti.

542
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,880
What are you trying to say?

543
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,940
I know you proposed to him today,

544
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,220
but you got rejected.

545
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,340
I feel very happy about it.

546
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,620
You deserve this.

547
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,860
If you're done,

548
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,140
you can leave.

549
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,760
Of course I will leave.

550
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
But you will have to leave Mingchen.

551
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,060
Those like Xu Mingchen

552
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,700
care much about the family background of their future wife.

553
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,250
He can date you,

554
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,550
but he will never marry you.

555
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,770
And now Anda is in great trouble.

556
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,300
At this time,

557
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,940
he needs the Ding family

558
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,860
and Ding Nana more than ever.

559
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,820
Mingchen is not that kind of person.

560
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,110
And I'm not the same person I used to be.

561
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,540
I know you want to say you won a big prize.

562
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,100
Yes, I won a big prize.

563
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,940
The first round of financing for Kiss is about to begin.

564
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,700
Ten million.

565
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,820
You think ten million is a big number?

566
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,540
Maybe it's just

567
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,620
Ding Nana's allowance for one year.

568
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,440
Anda needs much money. It's a astronomical figure.

569
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,860
Why do you think you are?

570
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,230
[Goodbye]

571
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,500
Lu Fenfen.

572
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,780
Fenfen.

573
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,260
Hello, He Le.

574
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,740
Was Qiao Yi with you yesterday all the time?

575
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,660
I can't find Fenfen now.

576
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,620
Did something else happen

577
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,610
after we had been apart?

578
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,710
I don't know.

579
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,280
But I feel like something else happened.

580
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,790
Xu Mingchen.

581
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,510
I really don't know what you're thinking.

582
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,380
What was in your mind at that time?

583
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,020
Do you know how much courage

584
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
it took for Fenfen to propose to you?

585
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,310
How could you do that to her?

586
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,060
She will be too embarrassed to see her colleagues in the company.

587
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,900
Leader, don't be angry.

588
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,690
Fenfen will be fine.

589
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,740
Xu Mingchen, let me tell you.

590
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,780
If anything bad happens to Fenfen,

591
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,660
you'll regret it.

592
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,380
You can't find any other girl

593
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,820
as good as Fenfen.

594
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,740
Sit down. Don't talk to him.

595
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,600
Don't be angry.

596
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,420
Yijiang, any progress?
