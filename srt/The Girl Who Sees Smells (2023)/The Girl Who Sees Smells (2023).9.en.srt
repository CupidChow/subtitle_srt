[Episode 9]

4
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,830
You asked a wrong question.

5
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,780
You should ask

6
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,500
who you offended,

7
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,430
and who would do harm to you.

8
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,979
Who would do harm to me?

9
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,500
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,140
Be careful.

11
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,780
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,180
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,180
Could it be...

14
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,979
Who?

15
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,060
Forget it.

16
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,860
I shouldn't say it without evidence.

17
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,460
The wine you chose

18
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,419
is the most suitable for the theme of that contest.

19
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,380
But the contest is over.

20
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,950
I can't let you join the class.

21
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,880
It's okay.

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,400
For me,

23
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,660
the most important thing is to get your recognition.

24
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,060
You agree with my choice.

25
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,150
That's enough.

26
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,430
I haven't finished yet.

27
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,780
Fenfen.

28
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,860
Would you like to be my teaching assistant?

29
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,880
Your teaching assistant?

30
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,680
My assistant is in France now.

31
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,740
But there is a lot of work in the master class.

32
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,220
I need a new assistant.

33
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,540
Would you like to be my new assistant?

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,420
Of course, I'd love to.

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,620
Okay. Let's go celebrate.

36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,010
Actually, I have a date today.

37
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,860
I'm already late.

38
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,579
So I have to go now.

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,490
A date? With whom?

40
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,870
Your boyfriend?

41
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,380
He's not my boyfriend yet.

42
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,860
But pretty much.

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Since when do you have a boyfriend?

44
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,980
So sudden.

45
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,220
Hello?

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,740
Hello?

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Where are you now?

48
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,790
Is everything okay?

49
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,300
I am waiting for you. Let's have a barbecue together.

50
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,340
How could you let me

51
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,329
wait so long?

52
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,750
I like barbecue.

53
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,690
I...

54
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,170
It's a long story.

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,140
I'll be there soon.

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,600
I'll tell you in detail when I get there. Bye.

57
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,020
You recommended that barbecue restaurant to him?

58
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,540
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,980
I really have to go.

60
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,540
If you don't mind,

61
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,740
I can introduce him to you next time.

62
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,300
Okay.

63
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,710
What's his name?

64
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,060
Xu Tianran.

65
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,420
What?

66
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,220
Xu Tianran?

67
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,820
He is the second son of Xu's Group.

68
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,460
He went abroad when he was a kid

69
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,860
and came back recently.

70
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,860
Are you sure his name is Xu Tianran?

71
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,060
You know him?

72
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,860
Yes, I know him.

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
We are very close.

74
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,380
Really?

75
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,279
How about this?

76
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,980
You tell him

77
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,060
that you're my assistant now

78
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,460
and that you are my special choice.

79
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,000
No problem.

80
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,100
I'll tell him.

81
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,620
I should go now.

82
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,659
Bye.

83
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,260
Bye.

84
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,860
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,020
Sorry I'm late.

86
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,780
Are you upset?

87
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,980
No.

88
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,659
Yes, you are.

89
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,540
No, I'm not.

90
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,610
This is your favorite barbecue.

91
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,520
Guess who I met on the way here.

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,100
Who?

93
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,340
I have some good news.

94
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,460
Good news?

95
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,860
If it is really good news,

96
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,140
I can forgive you for being late.

97
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,660
I met Phillip!

98
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,380
I signed up for

99
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,820
his master class

100
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,659
but didn't get to join it.

101
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,690
I was sad about it for a long time.

102
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,060
I met him at the barbecue restaurant today.

103
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,100
He said I failed the test

104
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,560
because someone cheated.

105
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,580
And then?

106
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,420
Then he asked me to be his assistant.

107
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,659
Although I cannot be in the master class as a student,

108
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,780
being his assistant is even better.

109
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,100
This didn't happen even in my wildest dream.

110
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,580
Isn't this good news?

111
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,340
By the way, he wanted you to know

112
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,940
that I'm his special choice.

113
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,100
Really?

114
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,480
Congratulations.

115
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,670
He also said you two are very close.

116
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,300
What's wrong?

117
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,380
Nothing.

118
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,220
Nothing.

119
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,380
Lu Fenfen.

120
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,520
I want to ask you question.

121
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,380
Go ahead.

122
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,230
No matter what happens in the future,

123
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,980
you will still love me and pick me, right?

124
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,300
Why are you so serious?

125
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,150
Answer my question.

126
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,540
Are you trying to tell me

127
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,180
you're a big boss

128
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
and you are dating me

129
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,370
for a special purpose?

130
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,500
I will definitely pick you.

131
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,140
This is for you.

132
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,100
Why are you giving me flowers?

133
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,410
Lu Fenfen.

134
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,350
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

135
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,660
This is a love confession?

136
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,470
No matter what happens in the future,

137
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,700
I'll stay with you.

138
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,380
I don't want you to be sad.

139
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,900
I don't want to see you in danger.

140
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,860
I don't want you to date others.

141
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,050
You know what,

142
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,420
every time I knew you were in danger,

143
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
my heart almost stopped beating.

144
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,740
Promise me

145
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,240
you'll never leave me.

146
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,940
OK?

147
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,980
Actually, I'm not as good as you think.

148
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,420
Many people think I'm stupid.

149
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,620
Don't you think I'm stupid?

150
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,740
Don't say that again.

151
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,620
But…

152
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,220
You've been giggling since you came back.

153
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,010
I'm still single.

154
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,130
Don't make me jealous.

155
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,020
Let me tell you,

156
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,380
Tianran asked me to be his girlfriend today.

157
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,180
He said I'm perfect

158
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,340
and I am the most adorable girl in the world.

159
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,420
I know.

160
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,740
After you came back,

161
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,820
the room is in a romantic atmosphere.

162
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,820
You asked Lu Fenfen to be your assistant?

163
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,100
Yes. You don't like it?

164
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,210
We all know

165
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,620
Lu Fenfen has a great talent for wines.

166
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,940
It's her honor to be your assistant.

167
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,040
Aren't you afraid?

168
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,420
I have faith in her love.

169
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:07,780
Really?

170
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,580
If so,

171
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,910
why don't you tell her your real identity?

172
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,350
As the president of the Anda Group,

173
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,980
you don't even dare to reveal your identity when you are in love.

174
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,620
This sounds like a joke.

175
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,300
A romantic relationship only concerns two people.

176
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Why should I care what others think?

177
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,380
You are right.

178
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,980
So why can't you

179
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,520
be honest with each other?

180
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,620
Is this love in your eyes?

181
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,660
This is complicated.

182
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,000
Hypocritical.

183
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,300
Anyway,

184
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,700
Lu Fenfen shouldn't be involved

185
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,100
in the things between us.

186
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,300
You shall never hurt her.

187
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,740
Be honest with her before you teach me a lesson.

188
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,960
You big president.

189
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,320
Your package has arrived.

190
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,560
Your package has arrived.

191
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,460
Did you make a mistake?

192
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,210
[To Hisashi Mitsui]

193
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,270
Hisashi Mitsui.

194
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,260
Philip's student.

195
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,820
[To Philip's student]

196
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,860
Is this your package?

197
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,540
Come with me.

198
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,380
Philip's student?

199
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,420
Let me explain.

200
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,300
Explain what?

201
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,060
Why do you include Philip in your nickname?

202
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,420
To show my respect for Phillip.

203
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,900
Respect, you know?

204
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,420
I'll change it right away.

205
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,790
Change it into what?

206
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,650
Into Hisashi Mitsui's wife?

207
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,150
Into Xu Tianran's wife.

208
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,400
I didn't expect you want to be my wife so much.

209
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,780
You liar!

210
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,420
Hello, I'm Phillip.

211
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,940
This is our first class.

212
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,770
On my right is Lu Fenfen.

213
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,470
She will be my teaching assistant.

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,060
Let's get started.

215
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,860
You are really good.

216
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,060
After failing the admission test for the master class,

217
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,860
you can still manage to be the teaching assistant.

218
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,700
I'm not as good as you.

219
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,830
What do you mean?

220
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,460
What do I mean?

221
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,740
Adding grape fruitade into the wine.

222
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,260
Only you

223
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,200
can come up with such a good trick.

224
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,950
You must be very familiar with that taste.

225
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,670
What are you talking about?

226
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,860
I don't understand.

227
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,050
I know everything you did

228
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,100
behind my back.

229
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,550
I'm warning you. Don't mess with me again.

230
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,820
Otherwise, I will tell the truth

231
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,340
to our teacher.

232
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,490
Other students will be curious

233
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,340
how you got to join the master class.

234
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,340
I can join the class

235
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,740
because I passed the admission test.

236
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,660
You can't slander me.

237
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,740
However, you

238
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,020
failed the test.

239
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,780
I don't know what dirty tricks you played

240
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,710
to become our teaching assistant.

241
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,280
You even hold a grudge against me.

242
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,960
Fine, keep pretending you are innocent.

243
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,310
[Anda Hotel]

244
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,010
[Where are we going this weekend?]

245
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,180
Where are we going this weekend?

246
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,990
This is the budget for our project.

247
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,780
Boss, do you have anything to say?

248
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,400
[I have to work this weekend. Philip will give lectures to the master class this weekend.]

249
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,260
Boss.

250
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,940
You can tell us if you have any thoughts.

251
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,270
We can make a new budget.

252
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,580
[Again? We haven't had a date for a long time.]

253
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,980
Yesterday's meeting ended late.

254
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,180
How about we

255
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
take a break now?

256
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,500
Mr. Xu.

257
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,660
Let's take a break.

258
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,960
You hung out last night?

259
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,760
Yesterday was one of my girlfriend's birthday.

260
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,700
Tell me.

261
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,350
When will a couple begin to lose passion after their first date?

262
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,340
Lose passion?

263
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,220
For me,

264
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,890
from one week to three months after the first date.

265
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,540
The passion will be gone after the couple fully know each other.

266
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,820
It's normal.

267
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,220
I understand.

268
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,060
It's not me.

269
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,100
Not you?

270
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,860
You mean Lu Fenfen is bored of you?

271
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:40,850
Forget it.

272
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
It's useless asking you for advice.

273
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,910
What are you looking at?

274
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,020
[Philip's master class starts today. The atmosphere is warm.]

275
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,820
Lu Fenfen is so busy now.

276
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,420
She doesn't even have the time to go on a date with me.

277
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Your gave a really deep sigh.

278
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,760
You look so down like a woman who died for her man.

279
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,540
Yes, that's more like it.

280
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,060
With disdainful eyes

281
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,920
and an arrogant look. This is you.

282
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,780
You scared me just now.

283
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,819
Get out!

284
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,339
Right now.

285
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,859
How can a workaholic like you

286
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:23,460
complain that others work too much?

287
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,619
Are you going or not?

288
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,900
No.

289
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,740
This girl…

290
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,540
Why is she making herself so busy

291
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,270
instead of enjoying the time with her boyfriend?

292
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,980
It must be Phillip's fault.

293
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,300
He is so close to Lu Fenfen now.

294
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,820
It can't be like this. I have to do something.

295
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,820
Otherwise, my bro, who was single for such a long time

296
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,280
will lose his future wife.

297
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,790
What are you going to do?

298
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,050
You are like an idiot when you are in a relationship.

299
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,420
You don't understand women.

300
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:11,940
Remember,

301
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,100
if a man wants a girl to care more about him,

302
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,290
he should follow this old rule.

303
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,460
That is, to make her jealous.

304
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,260
To get her to become

305
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,980
possessive of you.

306
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,500
Xu Tianran.

307
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,900
Are you wearing lipstick today?

308
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,410
Of course.

309
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,140
This handsome boy, let's have a drink.

310
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,630
I have a girlfriend.

311
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,050
Hi,

312
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,200
my girdles are loose. Can you help me?

313
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,980
Let me help you.

314
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,430
Are you jealous?

315
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,660
No.

316
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,360
No one can steal my boyfriend.

317
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,500
If I don't take it seriously,

318
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,100
they will think I'm weak.

319
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,900
You see,

320
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,820
it was He Le's idea.

321
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,700
Now you are the bad guy.

322
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,100
I did it for my bro.

323
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,460
Enjoy yourselves.

324
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,620
Have fun.

325
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,370
Yeah.

326
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,950
Enough. You'll get drunk again.

327
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,500
No, no.

328
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,300
I won't. You underestimated me.

329
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
Fenfen is right.

330
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,100
Come on,

331
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,660
Fenfen.

332
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,180
Cheers.

333
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,230
I agree with Fenfen.

334
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,660
We rarely hang out together like this.

335
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,820
Today, we are here.

336
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,780
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

337
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,020
Yijiang, do you think so?

338
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,650
Okay.

339
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,900
Why do you look so frivolous?

340
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,340
Frivolous?

341
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,020
Come on, I'm a lady-killer.

342
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,270
Are you kidding?

343
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,420
So many women are attracted to me because of my handsome face.

344
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,350
Do you know that?

345
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,260
A lady-killer?

346
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,980
-Disgusting. -Drink.

347
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,220
Didn't you feel embarrassed when you said that?

348
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,300
A filthy man

349
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,420
like you

350
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,460
will only be despised by good women.

351
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,900
Those women around you

352
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,500
will eventually leave you as you get old.

353
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,030
They just want to get some benefits from you.

354
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,110
Come on, Fenfen.

355
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,980
They are always like this.

356
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,820
Cheers.

357
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,460
Mingchen.

358
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,010
Drink, Qiao Yi.

359
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,940
Cheers.

360
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,820
Don't let her drink anymore.

361
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,820
My wine is good.

362
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,780
Cheers.

363
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,570
-Let's enjoy ourselves. -Okay.

364
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,620
Let's enjoy ourselves today.

365
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,660
No problem.

366
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,340
Cheers.

367
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,520
Fenfen.

368
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,220
Stop.

369
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,460
You're drunk.

370
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,350
Let me take you to your room.

371
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,670
I'll go with you.

372
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,700
Qiao Yi.

373
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,710
Sit down.

374
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,060
Explain it to me.

375
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,660
What?

376
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Explain.

377
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,820
Who said I'm getting old?

378
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,280
Qiao Yi.

379
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,260
Sit here.

380
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,660
I haven't finished yet.

381
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,790
I cannot believe it.

382
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
Sit here.

383
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,420
Let's have a talk.

384
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,340
Who said I'm getting old?

385
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,170
Lu Fenfen, come on!

386
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,500
Get it done tonight.

387
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,020
Lu Fenfen.

388
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,700
Why did you embarrass yourself at that moment?

389
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,660
Gosh.

390
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,140
He is so gentle.

391
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,100
He's coming. What should I do?

392
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,940
Gosh, I'm so excited.

393
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,380
Wait.

394
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,700
What is he doing?

395
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,260
Will he fall over

396
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,810
and ask me for help?

397
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,780
Xu... Xu Tianran.

398
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,220
Weren't you sleeping on the sofa last night?

399
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,170
So you weren't drunk yesterday.

400
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,820
Darn it.

401
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,580
Lu Fenfen.

402
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,560
How can you forget you pretended to be drunk?

403
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,940
Of course I was drunk.

404
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,820
I woke up last night

405
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,700
and saw you sleeping on the sofa.

406
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,020
Yes, you were drunk.

407
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,500
I was afraid you would do something bad to me

408
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,980
after you got drunk.

409
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,820
That's what you would do.

410
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,540
Never seduce me.

411
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,050
It's dangerous.

412
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,940
Mingchen.

413
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,140
I didn't expect you would miss

414
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,060
such a good opportunity.

415
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,770
What happened to you?

416
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,300
I saw her sleeping.

417
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,580
But she trusted me so much.

418
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,700
I...

419
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,600
Are you thinking too much?

420
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,730
Don't tell me

421
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,560
you have that problem.

422
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
Yijiang, let him have a health check

423
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,420
I have to go.

424
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,900
Health check.

425
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,950
The door is open.

426
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,210
Why are you back?

427
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,660
You don't welcome me?

428
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
I never said that.

429
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,320
One day away from you is as long as three years for me.

430
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,380
I always want to ask you a question.

431
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,260
Why is your skin so good?

432
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,140
Really?

433
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,060
What are you doing?

434
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,260
Don't be distracted.

435
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,580
I really, really like you.

436
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,300
I want to be with you every day.

437
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,720
Then I'll let you be with me every day.

438
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,490
Okay.

439
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,560
This is for you.

440
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,660
Try them on.

441
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
I know many people

442
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,900
like to buy expensive high-heeled shoes for their girlfriend.

443
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,860
But I just want you to have comfortable shoes.

444
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,020
I hope the shoes will always be with you

445
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,820
just like me.

446
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,220
So beautiful.

447
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,380
But I take the subway a lot. It's very crowded there.

448
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,260
I'm afraid they will be worn out.

449
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,060
Shoes are for people to wear.

450
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,530
Don't worry about it.

451
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,800
I just hope the shoes are comfortable

452
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
and suitable for you.

453
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,620
Thank you.

454
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,180
There will be an important event at Anda Hotel, right?

455
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,700
How did you know that?

456
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,560
I pay much attention to your work.

457
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,270
That will be a formal occasion, right?

458
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,540
Are you going?

459
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,800
I hope you will be wearing this pair of shoes.

460
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,220
Okay.

461
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,580
Qiao Yi will be back soon.

462
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,940
You should go now.

463
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,020
I need to work.

464
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,330
Go.

465
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,500
Go.

466
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,820
Okay.

467
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,060
Remember to miss me.

468
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,020
I'm missing you already.

469
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,940
Just go.

470
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,120
[Anda Hotel]

471
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,620
Fenfen.

472
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,820
Master, what brings you here?

473
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,750
Have a guess.

474
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,060
Oh, you're Kaysersberg's spokesperson.

475
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,790
The guest of honor of the event.

476
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,620
I forgot to congratulate you.

477
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,310
Take a seat, master.

478
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,220
You know

479
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
I don't want to be the guest of honor.

480
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,300
I told you the reason.

481
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,380
I remember.

482
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,780
You don't like the people of the Xu family,

483
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,540
right?

484
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,700
But I think

485
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,100
you shouldn't let it bother you that much.

486
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,380
Think about it.

487
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,900
Not everything about our work

488
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,140
will make us happy,

489
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,260
right?

490
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,530
I am not able to think that way.

491
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,460
I'm not as optimistic as you think.

492
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,700
However, when I walk into the hotel every time,

493
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,980
I'll think of you

494
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,630
and then I won't hate this place that much.

495
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,070
How is everything going with you and your boyfriend?

496
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,140
Not bad.

497
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,140
By the way,

498
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,060
I have a gift for you.

499
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,940
Tell me if you like it.

500
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,660
Why do you give me this pair of shoes, master?

501
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,420
When I was in France,

502
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,380
I would pick a gift

503
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,660
for every assistant coming to work in my studio.

504
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,860
Thank you, Master.

505
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,740
But the shoes are too expensive.

506
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,100
They don't suit me.

507
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,620
Take them.

508
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,640
Consider this gift as a blessing from me.

509
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,420
A woman once told me

510
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,340
a pair of good shoes

511
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,980
can take a woman

512
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,540
to any place she wants to go.

513
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,940
Alright.

514
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,820
What took you so long?

515
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,220
What are you looking for?

516
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,020
Nothing.

517
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,910
Have a seat.

518
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,560
I just saw the agenda.

519
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,560
You'll announce the brand ambassador soon.

520
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,740
Why aren't you wearing the shoes I gave you?

521
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,980
I can barely walk in high-heeled shoes.

522
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,860
Put on them later.

523
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,750
You will go on stage with me.

524
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,860
Me?

525
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,860
You are my assistant.

526
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,520
Shouldn't you do that?

527
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,050
No, no.

528
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,740
I can't do this.

529
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,310
As a member of the master class,

530
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,740
it is also an important job for you

531
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,670
to establish a good reputation for the master class.

532
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,540
Alright.
