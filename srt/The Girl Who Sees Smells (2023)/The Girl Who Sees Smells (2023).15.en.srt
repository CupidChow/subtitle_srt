[Episode 15]

4
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,180
Have you heard? The Ding family took action again.

5
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,020
I also heard that they were getting engaged?

6
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,080
What about Fenfen?

7
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,380
Although Fenfen is a good person,

8
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,130
she's far inferior to the CEO.

9
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,670
Ding Nana is different.

10
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,930
She's a perfect match.

11
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,979
She's not beautiful.

12
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,310
Keep your voice down. It's bad for her to hear you.

13
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,320
So what?

14
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,450
I think she's pretty.

15
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,840
Just so so.

16
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,920
I've always been curious about what will happen to you.

17
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,620
I've been wondering,

18
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,510
with your appearance and conditions,

19
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,060
how you caught Mingchen's fancy, getting promoted

20
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,390
and sitting in the same position as me.

21
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,780
Now, I take a closer look.

22
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,340
There's nothing special at all.

23
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,140
Turns out

24
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,870
even a wise man like Mingchen

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,570
will be obsessed sometimes.

26
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,140
You are jealous.

27
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,470
I'm jealous, but not jealous of you.

28
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,530
I'm not like you.

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,670
I have self-knowledge.

30
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,030
I know I don't deserve him.

31
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,260
So I just stay by his side.

32
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,170
But I didn't expect him to like you.

33
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,590
But now,

34
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,530
what is wrong is corrected.

35
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,380
After what happened,

36
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,480
I'd like to see

37
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,430
if you can go back to normal.

38
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,290
This is between me and Mingchen.

39
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,190
It has nothing to do with you.

40
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,660
Yes.

41
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,930
But seeing you like this,

42
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,150
I'm so happy.

43
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,880
Don't even think about getting things

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,370
that I can't get.

45
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,150
It's not me.

46
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,220
I didn't do it.

47
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,630
Mingchen will believe me.

48
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,620
He can fix it.

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,050
You deserve it.

50
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,150
If I can't stay,

51
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,770
you won't be able to live happily.

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,950
How was the photo leaked?

53
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:41,310
Why would this happen?

Are you done?

57
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,510
How is it?

58
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,650
Still working on it.

59
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:39,600
I really don't know what happened.

60
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,130
Will you trust me?

61
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,900
I trust you.

62
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,590
But what can I do?

63
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,000
I know it's troublesome.

64
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,760
I'll fix it.

65
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,540
But can you tell me

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,730
what's going on with the photo?

67
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,030
Didn't I tell you not to send it out?

68
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,260
I didn't do it.

69
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,420
Then how would this happen?

70
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,190
I don't know.

71
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,500
Forget it.

72
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,030
It's late. You should go back first.

73
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,630
Okay, I won't bother you then,

Mingchen didn't think straight.

77
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,690
Don't take it personally.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,130
Thank you for what you did today, He Le.

79

You changed so fast!

To protect Fenfen,

83
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,750
clarifying that you two are not dating

84
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,880
is also a way.

You're back!

86
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,140

87
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,620
we haven't drunk Red Wine Vanilla Tea for a long time.

88
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,670
Sit down.

89
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,350
I'll go get some chocolate.

90
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,120
Chocolate that I put away.

91
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,169
All right, don't be upset.

92

93

it's just a piece of cake.

Can you stop?

96
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,910
I don't want to accept anyone's comfort now.

97
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,590
Listen.

98
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,350
Mingchen even helped you...

99
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,340
I've heard this hundreds of times.

100
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,100
Everyone told me like this.

101
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,330
And I said OK, thank you.

102
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,270
But I'm the one who gets hurt!

103
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,240
I'm the one who needs to face it!

104
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,090
Everyone would mention Xu Mingchen!

105
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,180
Why?

106
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,240
I'm really tired!

107
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,190
It's all about the photo.

108
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,300
How was the photo spread?

109
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,570
I kept it in my phone.

110
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,970
I only sent it to Xu Mingchen!

111
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,100
Why would this happen?

112
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,260
All right, don't be sad.

113
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,210
One more.

114
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,190

Sit.

116
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,490
Sit!

117
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,890
Don't drink too much!

118
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,090
How do you think such a private photo

119
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,520
was leaked?

120
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,810
Could it be Fenfen...

121
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,170
What do you mean?

122
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,200
No. I was just saying.

123
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,350
No wonder Fenfen is unhappy.

124
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,450
Turns out that both you and Xu Mingchen think of her like that!

125
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,670
No, no, no. It only represents my personal opinion.

126
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,730
It has nothing to do with Xu Mingchen.

127
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,590
I went out to buy wine without my phone.

128
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,030
I went home only to find that the lock is dead!

129
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,770
Why don't you just strike me to death?

130
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,650
Why are you here?

131
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,560
Master, why are you here?

132
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,080
I came to see you.

133
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,720
I called you all night,

134
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,020
but no one answered.

135
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,880
I left my phone at home.

136
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,190
And the lock is dead.

137
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,170
Sorry for being a joke.

138
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,900
Where is Xu Mingchen?

139
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,930
I thought he could take good care of you!

140
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,590
All right. It's almost dawn.

141
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,410
Let me take you to have breakfast.

142
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,290
No need.

143
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,510
No?

144
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,680
Then what can you do if you keep sitting here?

145
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,400
Come with me.

146
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,170
Drink some lemon water to sober up.

147
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,890
I'm sorry.

148
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,450
I really have no appetite.

149
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:49,990
It's okay.

150
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,210
Let me tell you a story then.

151
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,100
There used to be a little boy

152
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,310
who tried hard to win everyone's recognition.

153
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,240
Once,

154
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,970
he finally got the first place.

155
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,900
He told everyone happily.

156
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,490
But everyone

157
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,120
was preparing a birthday party for his elder brother.

158
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,380
And then?

159
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,730
He was very upset.

160
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,290
He couldn't control his expression.

161
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,180
He couldn't celebrate happily.

162
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,970
I understand.

163
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,670
He was scolded because of that.

164
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,980
Why?

165
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,750
Luckily,

166
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,440
his elder brother noticed everything

167
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
and invited him to play basketball.

168
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,490
But the birthday party was delayed because of them.

169
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,820
Everyone blamed the little boy, saying he did it on purpose.

170
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,490
That's too much!

171
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,350
I'm the little boy.

172
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,680
Were you sad?

173
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,220
I'm telling you this to comfort you,

174
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,050
not to make you comfort me.

175
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,130
Actually, life is like this.

176
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,090
Something inexplicable will happen.

177
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,060
Even if we do nothing wrong,

178
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,650
we will still get hurt.

179
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,970
And I believe

180
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,980
the Lu Fenfen I know

181
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,350
would never do such a thing.

182
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,310
Thank you.

184
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,690

192
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,090
It's okay.

193
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
I'll wait for you.

194
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,150
If you're touched,

195
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,100
accept my offer earlier.

196
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,310
I'll think about it.

198
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,580
Didn't you say I need to do a check-up?

199
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,330
You don't need a checkup.

200
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,940
You need to find a place to calm down.

201

Your current situation

202

209
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,300
Fenfen submitted her resignation letter.

210
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,200
But I haven't decided whether to agree or not.

211

212
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,460

213
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm scared of hurting her.

214
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,970
Little girl, are you planning to ride it alone?

215
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,830
You look so familiar.

216
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,900
By the way,

217
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,440
aren't you the girl of the couple

Of course!

Your boyfriend is very romantic.

223
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,230
He asked me to snap you that day

224
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,240
and make a jigsaw.

225
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,730

But as her best friend,

I have to take her side.

Instead of coming to her,

is Zhuiaibao, the Weibo account.

is most likely to be someone in the company.

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,420
Fenfen's so wronged!

344
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,570
He just figured it out.

345
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,070
Don't get him wrong.

346
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,930
Mingchen has always believed Fenfen.

347
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,680
He did this

348
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,110
to protect her.

349
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,130
Heroine, please help me.

350
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,250
All right.

351
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,520
In my life,

352
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,180
I haven't published an unpaid news release yet.

353
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,050
It's good.

354
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,620
Rich people prefer

355
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,200
to solve problems with money.

356
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,470
But Xu Mingchen's money may not work.

357
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,730
Fenfen, it's all settled.

358
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,330
The photo was spread by Bai Bing.

359
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,720
It's my fault.

360
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,200
I put you to trouble.

361
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,100
No.

362
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,420
She thought I was not good enough for you.

363
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,810
Just ignore what she said.

364
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,530
Isn't that what you think?

365
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,880
Haven't you ever complained

366
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,940
when the matter plagued you?

367
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,800
I admit that I was being rude before.

368
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,610
I apologize.

369
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,400
Xu Mingchen, I'm not your plaything.

370
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,370
If you're happy, you would coax me.

371
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,300
If not, you would just push me away.

372
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,950
I didn't mean that.

373
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,930
I just wanted to focus on solving the problem.

374
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,910
But I still care about you.

375
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,880
I know.

376
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,070
But there's a huge gap between us.

377
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,040
I'm tired.

378
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,030
Lu Fenfen!

379
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,860
Are you really going to break up with me?

380
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,270
We already broke up.

381
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,540
I didn't agree!

382
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,790
Xu Mingchen.

383
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,030
Dating is a matter of two people.

384
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,760
But one is enough to break up.

385
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,650
Don't come to me again.

386
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,990
I've apologized to you.

387
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,010
Can you be reasonable?

388
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,030
I'm really tired.

389
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,090
Aren't you tired?

390
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,130
Lu Fenfen.

391
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,260
I want you to remember

392
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,960
that it's you who choose to be a deserter

393
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,620
and that I never give up on you.

394
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,370
Don't drink too fiercely. You'll get drunk.

395
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,950
Get lost.

396
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,440
Then don't take it out on me, okay?

397
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,620
Actually, I think

398
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,800
Fenfen and Mingchen still have feelings for each other.

399
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,830
So what?

400
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,050
Even if they make up,

401
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,740
can they make up for the gap between them?

402
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,770
Incidents like the bed photo incident and the wine incident

403
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,170
will arise in the future.

404
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,460
Men are all bad.

405
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,370
Rich men are worse.

406
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,410
Don't tar me with the same brush.

407
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,870
You don't deserve it.

408
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,570
I'm actually a very good person.

409
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,720
Don't just think about Fenfen.

410
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,900
You can also look around.

411
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,880
I concentrate on my career.

412
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,790
Love will only affect the development of my career.

413
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,050
Oh, I remember.

414
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,780
Phillip invited Fenfen

415
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,880
to help him.

416
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,140
But this silly girl

417
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,830
rejected him because she was afraid that Xu Mingchen would be upset.

418
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,720
Why did Xu Tianran cause trouble?

419
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:55,810
Why?

420
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,830
I think Xu Tianran

421
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,180
is much better than Xu Mingchen.

422
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,190
Not at all!

423
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,840
I think he should be called Troublemaker, instead of Xu Tianran!

424
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,250
Lu Fenfen and Xu Mingchen broke up.

425
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,420
You look very happy?

426
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,950
You can see that?

427
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,300
Do you think

428
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,060
you can take advantage of their breakup

429
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,510
and get Xu Mingchen?

430
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,410
Isn't this our common goal?

431
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,530
Don't just talk about me.

432
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,440
You can seize the chance

433
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,960
to win Lu Fenfen's heart?

434
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,680
I'm different from you.

435
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,540
If I want something,

436
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,770
I'll go head-on.

437
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,310
I won't take any advantage,

438
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,970
or gloat at it.

439
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,280
Whatever.

440
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,390
Anyway, they've broken up.

441
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,100
Say something!

442
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,550
I knew something bad would happen after I heard about it,

443
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,410
so I came to inform you right away.

444
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,820
I know. You can leave.

445
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,520
Listen.

446
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,350
In terms of this matter,

447
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,870
you can't be self-willed.

448
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:43,580
[Lu Fenfen: Mingchen, I'm leaving. I'm going to break up with you.]

449
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,640
[I hope you are free to do whatever you like.]

450
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,670
[Xu Mingchen]

451
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,440
[Xu Mingchen: I hope you are free to do whatever you like.]

452
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,460
[Phillip Studio]

453
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,739
Nice to meet you, Mr. Phillip.

454
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,690
Since you came back,

455
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,790
the industry has highly expectations and comments on you.

456
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,350
As a young

457
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,940
but famous Master of Wine,

458
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,639
do you have any experience to share with us?

459
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,280
Not really.

460
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,880
Just some of my past experiences

461
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,650
that have a deep impact on me.

462
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,040
I believe

463
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,060
everyone

464
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,070
would add some personal features

465
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,960
when he or she is making red wine that can represent his or her style.

466
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,190
Indeed, what the public pays much attention to

467
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,790
is the story behind the wine.

468
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,510
As far as we know,

469
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,730
this will be the first wine to be released

470
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,290
after you came back.

471
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,180
Could it be possible for you to tell wine lovers

472
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,610
and your fans

473
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,380
what kind of wine it will be?

474
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,210
I'm not the only creator of this wine.

475
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,260
My female pupil

476
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,730
will also take charge of designing the wine.

477
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,790
Your female pupil?

478
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,440
Can you introduce her to us?

479
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,310
Of course.

480
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,100
Her name is Lu Fenfen.

481
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,710
Soon,

482
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,120
her talent will make you shocked.

483
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,590
Now you are anxious?

484
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,950
I don't know what you were thinking.

485
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,350
You can send Fenfen to your rival in love?

486
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,220
If they are really together,

487
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,050
it's time for you to cry!

488
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,800
No one treats you like a fool if you don't talk.

489
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,810
You're the fool!

490
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,710
The biggest fool in the world!

491
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,260
I hope Fenfen can be free.
