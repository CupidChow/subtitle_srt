It's so amazing.

5
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,140
Welcome, Miss Lu.

6
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,620
Mr. Xu told us

7
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,180
we only serve you today.

8
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,660
If you want to try on any dress,

9
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,780
just tell me.

10
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,180

Where is he?

13
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,130
Mr. Xu said

14
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,539
he has something to deal with. He'll be here later.

15
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,540
Before he comes,

16
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,380
please enjoy yourself

Fine.

19
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,460
He did so much for me.

20
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,860
I can forgive him for being late.

21
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,140
Get up. Take a seat.

22
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,090
I want to eat wontons.

23
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,880
Okay, I'll buy wontons for you right now.

Don't be silly.

27
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,420
You hurt yourself for Mingchen.

28
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,020
But he won't know this at all.

29
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,740
He's getting married.

30

Yijiang, where are you?

34
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,100
We've arrived.

35
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,140
I have something to deal with now. I'll be there later.

36
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,990
Are you going to congratulate him?

37
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,740
Go.

38
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,620
You know it.

39
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,140
Why did you hurt yourself

40
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,000
for someone who doesn't love you?

41
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
Have you forgotten

42
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,470
that you still have your family and me?

43
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,620
I'm your friend.

44
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,920
I will always be there for you.

45
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,690
And

46
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,480
you said you want to make wine.

47
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,180
Family?

48
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,300
My family abandoned me long ago.

49
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,180
They

50
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,420
just want my money.

51
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Wine?

52
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,380
I worked so hard.

In the end,

54
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,850
I'm nothing

55
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,380
compared with Lu Fenfen.

56
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,140
Why?

57
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,700
Why can she

58
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,580
have the perfect sense of taste?

59
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,260
Why does Xu Mingchen love her so much?

60
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,700
Why is she always much luckier than me?

61
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,060
I don't want to argue with you here.

62
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,180
But you know what?

63
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,180
You look more like yourself now.

64
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,020
So beautiful.

65
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,100
Miss Lu, are you satisfied?

66
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,930
Yes.

67
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,780
I'm so jealous.

68
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,500
How about we get married again?

69
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,240
You want me to marry you twice?

70
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,940
Miss Lu, you are so beautiful.

71
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,140
And you have such a sweet boyfriend.

72
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,660
It makes me jealous too.

73
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,590
Miss Lu, is everything okay with this dress?

74
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,740
Yes.

75
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,140
Fenfen,

76
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,140
I used to worry that you

77
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,900
might pick a wrong guy to be your husband.

78
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,630
But now, you are getting married. How time flies.

79
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,380
What are you doing?

80
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,740
You are like my mom.

81
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,120
Don't say that. I am not like your mom.

82
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,990
No matter what happens,

83
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,000
you must live happily.

84
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,220
Don't worry.

85
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,860
My life will be very happy.

86
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,100
Don't be too sad.

87
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,050
Sometimes,

88
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,960
you just cannot get what you want.

89
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,420
I know.

90
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,740
I just cannot let it go.

91
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,810
Actually, there are many reasons

92
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,300
why Mingchen and Fenfen should be together.

93
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,860
It's their destiny.

94
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,820
If everything could start over,

95
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,060
Mingchen

96
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,260
might choose you.

97
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,740
What destiny?

98
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,380
I don't believe in destiny.

99
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
Jian Yijiang,

100
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,830
is there something you didn't tell me?

101
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,299
Tell me.

102
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,760
You shouldn't ask.

103
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,540
Don't do this.

104
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,230
Okay, I'll tell you.

105
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,580
When Fenfen gave artificial respiration

106
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,310
to Mingchen for the first time,

107
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,070
Mingchen's pain was alleviated.

108
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,750
What do you mean?

109
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,420
We did a lot of experiments

110
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,980
to find out whether this is true.

111
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,300
Our conclusion

112
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,260
is that in Fenfen's kiss,

113
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,920
there is a special bio-enzyme

114
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,260
which can balance

115
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,460
the growth hormones in Mingchen's body

116
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,300
alleviate his pain.

117
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,820
So Lu Fenfen's kiss

118
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,420
can help treat Mingchen's illness.

119
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,230
I've booked the ticket for you.

120
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
But Master,

121
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,580
is this your final decision?

122
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,430
I've made up my mind.

123
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,940
If you want to stay in China,

124
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,900
I can help you.

125
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,260
No, Master.

126
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,860
I'll always follow you.

127
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,720
Wherever you go, I'll go with you.

128
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,920
Tianran, I need to talk to you.

129

The formal invitation letters are being prepared.

130
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,980

[Fenfen is the most important woman in my life. You are the family member that Fenfen and I value the most.]

134
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,900
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,470
I've booked a flight to France.

136
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,790
I can't make it.

137
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,790
You are my only brother.

138
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,500
I hope

139
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,980
you can attend my wedding.

140
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,420
Are you here to show off?

141
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,660
Tianran.

142
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,700
I'm very sick.

143
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,540
Does Fenfen know about this?

144
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,900
So this is the reason

145
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,780
why you rejected her proposal.

146
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,940
Yes.

147
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,330
I wanted to tell her everything,

148
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,660
but I was too afraid.

149
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,110
What are you going to do?

150
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,070
My happiness can only be short-lived.

151
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,390
I'll just take life as it comes.

Tianran.

153
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,270
I hope you can come back to the Group

154
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,120
and take over my position.

155
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,230
Don't worry.

156
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,540
I'll do my best to help you.

157

Da will also help you.

158
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,880
Some of the board of directors may oppose it,

159
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,980
but my sister and I will support you.

160
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,430

Tianran.

162

Anda was founded by our father.

163
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,350
You don't want to see it ruined, do you?

164
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,990
I'll think about it.

165
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,560
I've investigated that car accident

166
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,760
and found something suspicious.

167
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,020
It was not just an accident.

168
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,700
What?

169
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,140
It's Xu Song.

170
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,820
He wanted to control the business

171
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,350
so he tried to kill us when we were travelling.

172
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,820
He did it so well

173
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,350
that we didn't suspect him.

174
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,100
After he betrayed the Group,

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,500
I investigated him and found out the truth.

176
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,260
Probably this is our fate.

177
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,270
Don't worry.

178
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,550
I've given the evidence to the police.

179
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,510
He will definitely be punished this time.

180
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,360
I haven't told Sister about this.

181
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,660
I'm afraid it's too much for her.

182
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,650
When everything is over,

183
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,070
we'll talk to her together.

184
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,640
-Thank you. -Come on, Fenfen.

185
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,100
Have a seat.

186
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,980
Sit.

187
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,020
Let me help you.

188
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,480
This place is good for taking photos.

189
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,860
Let me tell you.

190
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,580
Based on my experience in taking wedding photos,

191
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,890
I think you have to show

192
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,780
your slim figure.

193
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,900
Show the beauty of your sexy body.

194
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,230
I don't have a sexy body.

195
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,460
You have.

196
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,820
Come, sit down.

197
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,550
The weather is so hot. Sit down.

198
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,990
Have some water.

199
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,300
Here.

200
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,460
I don't think you should come here.

201
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,040
I'm here to send my best wishes to you.

202
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,740
Fenfen is very happy.

203
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,660
You've sent your wishes.

204
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,170
You can go now.

205
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,900
Fenfen.

206
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,340
I have something to tell you.

207
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,100
You will be interested in it.

208
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,300
Qiao Yi, this pair of shoes doesn't fit.

209
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,700
Find a new pair for me.

210
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,500
Fenfen.

211
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,620
It's okay.

212
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,830
Just a small problem. I can handle it.

213
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,020
Don't worry.

214
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,010
I warn you. Don't do anything that will hurt her.

215
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,960
Have a seat.

216
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,420
What happened to your hand?

217
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,710
It's just a small wound.

218
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,020
So what do you want to tell me?

219
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,620
Fenfen.

220
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,060
I really envy you.

221
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,280
You have such a happy life.

222
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,540
Thank you.

223
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,250
You will find your own happiness.

224
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,260
Do you really think everything just happened by coincidence?

225
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,500
Mingchen can't live without you.

226
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,770
He needs your kiss.

227
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,860
What do you mean?

228
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,380
It's true

229
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,350
that those who are naive are always the happiest.

230
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,460
You still can't let it go?

231
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,390
I don't want our relationship to be like this.

232
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,830
Even if we can't be friends,

233
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,500
we shouldn't be enemies.

234
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,340
You're so kind.

235
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,650
So what are you really trying to say?

236
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,780
Are you done?

237
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,950
Fenfen, try on the shoes first.

238
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,700
All right, I've sent my wishes.

239
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,940
I should go now.

240
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
I think Fenfen should know it now.

241
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,820
I'm the most honest person

242
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,620
you meet today.

243
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,060
Fenfen, what did she say to you?

244
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,440
I don't understand what she said.

245
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,980
I'm confused.

246
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,550
Alright, don't think too much.

247
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Let's take the wedding photos first.

248
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,430
Xu Mingchen is dressed. He is waiting for you.

249
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,180
OK.

250
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,380
Two brides.

251
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,420
Fenfen.

252
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,420
You look so beautiful today.

253
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,740
Xu Mingchen,

254
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
Fenfen is the most important person

255
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,420
in my life.

256
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,470
If you dare to treat her badly,

257
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,010
I'll kill you.

258
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,020
Don't worry.

259
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,869
I'll hold her tight.

260
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,579
Okay.

261
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,780
Let's take photos.

262
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,540
Okay.

263
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
I'll put you down.

264
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,860
Okay.

265
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,540
Done.

266
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,580
Okay.

267
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,860
-What's wrong? -Are you okay?

268
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,590
Are you okay?

269
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,550
Are you okay?

270
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,940
My foot.

271
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,560
Let me take you back first.

272
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,540
What's wrong?

273
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,340
She sprained her ankle.

274
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,700
Oh my god. Hurry up.

275
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,150
Sit here.

276
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,700
Here.

277
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,500
How did it happen?

278
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,960
Is it because of the shoes?

279
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,940
No.

280
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,150
Are you okay?

281
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:10,900
I'm fine.

282
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,180
If this pair of shoes does not fit,

283
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,640
I'll get you another pair.

284
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,220
Okay.

285
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,220
It's true

286
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,990
that those who are naive are always the happiest.

287
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,420
Qiao Yi.

288
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,220
I'm hungry.

289
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,670
I want to eat the dumplings made by you.

290
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,580
Now?

291
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,740
Okay, let's go home and eat dumplings.

292
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,220
Okay.

293
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,620
To serve the bride first.

294
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,340
Let's go.

295
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,880
Be careful.

296
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,540
Slowly.

297
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,860
Qiao Yi.

298
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,340
I do not

299
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,740
feel good.

300
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,580
What's wrong?

301
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,620
I am thinking about

302
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,500
what Bai Bing said just now.

303
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,340
Don't do that.

304
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,460
Just remember

305
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
you are the bride.

306
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,340
Okay?

307
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,220
Okay, let's eat dumplings.

308
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,730
Okay.

309
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,680
Be careful.

310
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,340
Why do I feel so tired today?

311
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,610
You are tired today?

312
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,580
What about the wedding day? It will be more tiring.

313
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,170
Qiao Yi, you go back first.

314
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,080
I need to buy some vinegar.

315
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,620
Okay.

316
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,500
Go.

317
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,960
I gave him artificial respiration the first time I met him.

318
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,140
In the hospital, he forced me to kiss him.

319
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,510
He even wanted to make a contract to get my kisses.

320
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,020
Then he suddenly moved to my neighborhood

321
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,980
and we became neighbors.

322
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,220
The night when we were stuck in the elevator shaft,

323
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,580
he became so active after he kissed me.

324
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,900
And…

325
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,540
Lu Fenfen, don't think too much.

326
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
It must be a misunderstanding.

327
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,030
It's definitely not like that.

328
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,420
Sir, have you made up your mind?

329
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,420
The price will go up very soon.

330
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,920
Let me tell you.

331
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,850
We have several good apartments

332
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,540
in this neighborhood.

333
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,420
Rich people all like our apartments.

334
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,820
The price has increased again recently.

335
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,740
Yes, this is definitely

336
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,340
the lowest price I can offer.

337
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,060
I...

338
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,020
Listen.

339
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,380
If you don't believe me,

340
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,310
take a look at this apartment, 110.

341
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,660
Guess what?

342
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,200
It was sold at a price three times higher than the market price.

343
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,220
How is that possible?

344
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,660
I...

345
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,340
I'm serious.

346
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,020
Excuse me.

three times higher than the market price?

Yes.

Let me tell you.

352
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,460
There is a long story

behind this apartment.

354
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,260
I received a call from a stranger

356
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,010
I didn't give him my number before.

I don't how he got it.

I told him this apartment had been rented.

Guess what.

360
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,300
He said he had to move in that day

361
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,420
at any cost.

362
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,460
He said money was not a problem

363
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,920
and he would buy that apartment at any price.

364

367
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,540
I got the deposit.

368
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660

369

Fenfen.

522
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,520
From now on,

523
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,750
you are Mingchen's wife.

524
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,980
If Mingchen treats you badly,

525
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,610
tell me.

526
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,570
I won't let him off easily.

527
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,340
Let's drink later.

528
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,610
Okay. That's for sure.

529
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,590
Mingchen.

530
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,230
Fenfen.

531
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,410
I sincerely wish you and Mingchen

532
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,610
can be happy forever.

533
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,800
Mingchen, I have something to tell you.

534
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,800
Mingchen.

535
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,310
Nana.

536
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,050
Is the chair

537
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:52,890
good now?

538
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,490
Mingchen.

539
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,100
I hope you can be happy in the future.

Wait.

557
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,810
I'll take another photo with Fenfen.

558
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,860
Just me and Fenfen.

559
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,370
Okay.

560
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,630
I've never taken a photo with Fenfen.

561
