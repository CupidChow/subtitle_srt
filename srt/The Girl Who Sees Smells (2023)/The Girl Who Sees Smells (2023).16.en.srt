[The Girl Who Sees Smells]

[Episode 16]

4
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,229
You're out of condition.

5
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,370
I suggest you get back together with Fenfen.

6
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,380
You need her kiss.

7
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,140
I do miss her.

8
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,060
But I don't want her kiss.

9
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,280
Just seeing her

10
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,390
will make me happy.

11
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,600
What's the difference?

12
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,640
You don't understand.

13
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,700
I don't.

14
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,210
I only know your health is deteriorating rapidly.

15
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,540
Fenfen has started a new chapter of her life.

16
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,690
I should leave her alone.

17
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,090
We used to love each other very much.

18
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,260
But I failed to protect her.

19
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,060
Is it because of Bai Bing?

20
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't expect

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
she would have such feelings for me.

22
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,880
Then one mistake led to another.

23
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,060
Master, what brings you here?

24
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,620
Judging from your reaction, you haven't got the news.

25
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,540
I have two pieces of news. A good one and a better one.

26
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,880
Which one do you want to know first?

27
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,350
The better one.

28
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,900
I've already announced

29
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,050
one of the three Philip Craft Wines

30
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,730
will be

31
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,870
made by you.

32
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,180
Me?

33
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,840
That will be the first wine

34
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,210
made by you in your life.

35
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,970
You need to work hard.

36
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,410
Don't worry, Master.

37
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,880
I will work hard.

38
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,110
I will do my best.

39
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,430
No, I'll exceed my best.

40
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,019
I won't let you down.

41
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,790
I look forward to it.

42
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,160
Okay.

43
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,460
By the way, Master,

44
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,560
what is the other piece of news?

45
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,540
I have a spare apartment.

46
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,990
You can move in

47
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,760
so that you won't spend so much time in commuting.

48
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,800
Thank you, Master.

49
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,970
But I'm used to living with Qiao Yi.

50
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,470
Commuting is like taking exercise for me.

51
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,250
I'm such a coward.

52
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,020
I miss her so much.

53
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,470
Why don't I have the courage to go to see her?

54
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,000
But she doesn't need me now.

55
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,880
She's doing well.

56

[2020 Decanter WORLD WINE AWARDS Gold Award]

57

Master.

58
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,210
You're amazing.

59
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,530
I only saw these awards on TV before.

60
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,760
Master,

61
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,270
I think our wine

62
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,830
will sell very well.

63
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,670
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

64
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,230
It is expected that we will succeed.

65
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,270
Nothing new about it.

66
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,410
How can you say so?

67
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,800
To achieve success is a good thing.

68
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,790
I don't care those things

69
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,510
that I can get easily.

70
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,370
Does his confidence

71
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,720
come from the fact that he can inherit

72
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,980
a large family business if his own career is unsuccessful?

73
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,700
Do you think

74
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,730
I am better than Xu Mingchen now?

75
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,170
I don't know.

76
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,230
Actually, I've always envied Xu Mingchen.

77
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,610
My parents love him.

78
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,450
My sister cares about him.

79
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,910
And I...

80
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,550
I still remember what happened that year.

81
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,580
Come on, Mingchen.

82
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,600
I'll get you out.

83
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,580
Mingchen, I'll save you.

84
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,040
Sister.

85
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,270
Sister. Help me.

86
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,760
Sister.

87
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,150
Help me.

88
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,340
Sister.

89
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,650
At that moment, my sister only cared about

90
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,330
my elder brother and saved him.

91
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,660
She completely forgot me.

92
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,090
I still remember that moment.

93
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,420
My parents died in front of me.

94
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,720
Since then, I've hated the Xu family.

95
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,650
No wonder you got so angry

96
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,679
when you mentioned the Xu family.

97
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,810
Now I know the reason.

98
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,180
Do you pity me?

99
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,790
I just don't understand

100
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,120
why everyone cares about Xu Mingchen.

101
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,560
Master,

102
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,510
I think that was an accident.

103
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,320
Your sister must have done that for a reason.

104
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,660
Lu Fenfen.

105
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,680
It seems that I am in love with you.

106
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,710
You're so kind.

107
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,340
How did you become my student?

108
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,680
I just don't want you to feel sad.

109
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,050
If you keep thinking about things that make you unhappy,

110
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,050
you'll lose your natural aptitude.

111
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,660
My natural aptitude? You are good.

112
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,340
You've made so much progress.

113
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,070
I can seek comfort from you now.

114
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,150
Master, didn't you ask me

115
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,170
who I think is better between you and Xu Mingchen?

116
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,480
Actually, I think

117
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,210
everyone has his or her own merit.

118
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,440
You don't have to compare yourself with others.

119
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,240
Just focus on your own progress.

120
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,710
In my eyes,

121
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,600
you are really, really amazing.

122
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,410
Otherwise,

123
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,290
I wouldn't let you be my teacher.

124
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,030
Master,

125
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,370
every person who does wine business

126
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,110
has a good heart.

127
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,400
But sometimes, we will be heartbroken.

128
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,360
Look at you now.

129
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,250
I am such a good student.

130
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,750
It's a blessing for you to be my teacher.

131
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,370
I will do my best

132
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,800
to make the wine.

133
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,620
I won't let you down.

134
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,190
Fine.

135
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,350
Since my student cares me so much…

136
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,070
I've put the document on your desk.

137
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,270
Remember to check it.

[Let bygones be bygones]

139
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,810
I think that restaurant is right ahead.

140
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,210
-Fenfen, here. -Really?

141
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,130
Cheers.

142
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,130
You don't look well.

143
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,820
You must be tired.

144
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,410
There must be something wrong with you.

145
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,260
I thought I could move on

146
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,690
and start a new life.

147
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,030
But the wine I made today

148
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,650
told me I can't.

149
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,590
I made a wine today.

150
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,940
It tasted bitter.

151
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,180
As bitter as how I felt when I left him.

152
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,530
So,

153
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,610
why not just forgive Xu Mingchen?

154
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,660
You like him a lot, don't you?

155
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,000
Of course I do.

156
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,410
But I'm afraid, Qiao Yi.

157
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,250
I'm afraid if we get back together,

158
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,430
we'll still quarrel.

159
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,670
I will still cause him trouble.

160
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,850
You love Xu Mingchen so much.

161
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,640
You'll get hurt if you continue to be like this.

162
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
I would rather get myself hurt

163
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,470
than see him become unhappy.

164
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,390
You do not know how tired Xu Mingchen's was.

165
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,370
He had meetings day and night.

166
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,090
He had to clean up the mess for me.

167
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,830
And he needed to make me happy.

168
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,750
I thought I was so useless at that time.

169
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,490
I was wondering why I was not a superwoman.

170
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,150
If I had been one, I could have helped him.

171
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,410
Alright, silly girl.

172
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,710
Don't think too much.

173
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,420
Let's drink.

174
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,070
Come on.

175
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,690
Yijiang.

176
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,670
How is my body?

177
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,790
I have nothing to say.

178
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,890
You see it for yourself.

179
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,550
Your health

180
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,290
is back to the previous level.

181
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,370
How much time do I still have?

182
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,590
I'm not sure. We cannot be optimistic.

183
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,650
I don't agree.

184
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,430
You deserve it.

185
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,410
I don't think

186
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,840
I'm feeling unwell.

187
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,530
You scotched rumors for Lu Fenfen.

188
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,070
Does she know you did so much for her?

189
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,890
I did it for the company too.

190
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,120
Screw the company.

191
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,790
Look.

192
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,320
Think about your health.

193
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,450
You wanted Lu Fenfen and Xu Tianran to be together

194
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,590
just because you think this is good for her career.

195
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,340
Have you ever thought about the consequences?

196
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,530
What if they really fall in love with each other?

197
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,460
How can you live without Lu Fenfen?

198
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,990
Why are you here again?

199
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,570
Are you stalking me?

200
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,430
I come to see Fenfen.

201
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,390
Is this yours?

202
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,450
Take a look.

203
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,460
These are the things Mingchen did for you.

204
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,670
This is the evidence that Bai Bing bribed the supplier.

205
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,690
This is a fake wine label

206
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,420
the supplier left before he disappeared.

207
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,180
This is the IP address of Bai Bing's

208
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,840
Weibo post.

209
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,070
Bai Bing

210
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,040
has left Anda and will never be back.

211
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,640
She will never show up again.

212
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,510
That's not all.

213
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,500
Mingchen

214
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,990
always believed you were wronged.

215
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,190
So he secretly investigated.

216
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,370
He didn't want to make things difficult for you

217
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,000
so he deliberately alienated you.

218
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,520
He even offended Qingran for you.

219
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,060
Fenfen, ask yourself.

220
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,660
Do you really think Mingchen is a cold-hearted man?

221
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,390
If he had only cared about the company,

222
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,450
he wouldn't have done so many things.

223
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,000
In his eyes, you are much more important

224
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
than the reputation of the company.

225
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,080
He did everything to protect you.

226
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,220
Then why didn't he

227
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,410
tell me in person?

228
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,800
If he didn't care about you

229
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,640
or love you,

230
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,950
why would he have done that?

231
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,650
I have known Mingchen for over 20 years.

232
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,530
He never loved anyone so much.

233
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,310
He is like a fool in front of you.

234
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:35,850
You know?

235
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,530
He said things he didn't mean.

236
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,300
As long as you take one step towards Mingchen…

237
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,100
Just one step.

238
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,870
Mingchen will take 99 steps towards you.

239
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,960
And this fool

240
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,530
has already taken 98 steps.

241
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,500
Can you understand what I mean?

242
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Are you sure there are only 100 steps between me and him?

243
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,560
Fenfen.

244
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,740
What brings you here?

245
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,940
Mingchen...

246
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,540
He has been too tired recently

247
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,670
and refused to rest.

248
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,190
You go to see him.

249
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,810
I heard you're not feeling well.

250
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,880
It's nothing serious.

251
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,620
Go take a rest.

252
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,980
I'll make Red Wine Vanilla Tea for you.

253
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,520
I thought after I left you,

254
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,550
you would have a better life.

255
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,010
What happened to you?

256
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,710
Fenfen.

257
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,600
I think you can be more brave.

258
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,620
I didn't want you

259
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,180
to get stuck in it again,

260
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,220
but you like him so much.

261
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,570
But I don't think I should do that.

262
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,180
And I'm afraid…

263
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,460
I'm afraid I'll hurt him again.

264
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,420
Have you asked Xu Mingchen?

265
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,800
Does he care about such things?

266
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,590
Love is the strangest thing in the world.

267
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,710
You may not be good enough,

268
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,200
but for Xu Mingchen,

269
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,430
you may be his only true love.

270
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,210
Really?

271
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,720
Of course.

272
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,740
Be confident.

273
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,250
[Bai Bing]

274
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,380
[Bai Bing: When will you be free? I want to see you.]

275
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,330
Bai Bing wants to see me.

276
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,070
I didn't expect I would lose to you.

277
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,850
Bai Bing, I never wanted to have rivalry with you.

278
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:39,840
Yeah.

279
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,780
I made myself look like a clown.

280
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,770
Lu Fenfen.

281
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,080
I've always hated you.

282
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,130
We have similar family background.

283
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,960
I always feel uneasy and insecure.

284
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,520
But you feel okay with everything.

285
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,550
Everyone grows up in a different environment.

286
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,520
No one can choose his or her origin.

287
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,290
I know.

288
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,590
That's why I always work so hard.

289
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,160
I'm not like you.

290
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,750
I don't have perfect sense of taste.

291
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,580
Everything I own today

292
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,590
is earned by me through hard work.

293
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,360
You did work hard.

294
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,790
But it's no use.

295
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,290
Xu Mingchen only cares about you.

296
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,210
You know what, Bai Bing?

297
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,920
When I knew it's you who did those things,

298
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,390
I was very surprised.

299
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,460
Xu Mingchen trusted you a lot.

300
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
And the Xu family valued you so much.

301
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,810
I didn't mean to do that.

302
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,350
Xu Mingchen is so brilliant.

303
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,820
I don't understand

304
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,660
why he would be attracted to you?

305
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,890
So you chose to deliberately hurt him?

306
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,110
I didn't mean it.

307
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,880
I was tricked by Xu Song.

308
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,610
I regretted it

309
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,420
when the thing about that wine got out of control.

310
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,390
I never meant to hurt them.

311
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,270
I just don't like you.

312
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,650
Why are you so lucky?

313
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,460
So you showed the photo to the public.

314
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,610
You wanted to ruin my reputation and the whole Group.

315
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,120
You don't understand.

316
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,140
If you had been in my position,

317
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,610
you would have done the same.

318
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,280
I wouldn't.

319
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,550
If I had been your position,

320
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,190
I might feel unhappy at first,

321
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
but I would never

322
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,220
hurt Xu Mingchen.

323
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,440
You said you love him.

324
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,530
But what you did

325
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,960
only hurt him.

326
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,930
That's not true.

327
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,180
Anyway, I should thank you.

328
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,710
If you don't tell me this,

329
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,400
I wouldn't realize

330
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,040
me leaving Xu Mingchen actually hurt him.

331
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,210
I'm sorry.

332
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,200
You must have laughed at me.

333
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,950
You put too much pressure on yourself.

334
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,050
I thought you would shout at me.

335
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,530
After all…

336
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,910
I don't know what's wrong with me.

337
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,990
I feel like I was a different person at that time.

338
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,450
I never intended to hurt Mingchen.

339
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,090
I was just too angry.

340
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,650
Why does Lu Fenfen have everything

341
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,700
Why?

342
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,410
I know no one understands me.

343
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,120
They all said I was crazy.

344
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,260
I was too jealous.

345
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,780
I deserve it.

346
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,150
But I'm happy to see you today.

347
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,930
I'm leaving.

348
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,610
Where are you going?

349
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,130
Anywhere but here.

350
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,270
I don't want to look like a joke here.

351
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,980
No, Bai Bing, you are not a joke.

352
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,830
Lu Fenfen and Mingchen are not what you think.

353
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,340
They...

354
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,800
There is a problem between them?

355
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,680
No, that's not what I mean.

356
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,320
I mean,

357
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,460
just be yourself.

358
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,620
Don't be influenced by others too much.

359
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,270
Here, have some water.

360
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,240
Sit here.

361
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,290
Sit.

362
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
He Le,

363
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,280
every time

364
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,500
you see Qiao Yi,

365
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,810
you show a different posture. Why?

366
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,110
You know nothing.

367
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,440
Thank you very much

368
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,030
for being here.

369
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,610
This is a huge moment.

370
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,850
I've decided to get back together with Mingchen.

371
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,180
You look beautiful today.

372
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,770
Really?

373
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,710
I have a gift for you.

374
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,890
A gift?

375
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,000
What gift?

376
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,070
I know all the things

377
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,800
you did for me.

378
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,530
I'm so touched.

379
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,630
What thing are you talking about?

380
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,640
Many things.

381
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,640
I did them all for the company.

382
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,400
Why don't you just admit it?

383
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,010
You really care about me.

384
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,520
Ready?

385
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,330
Yes.

386
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,300
He Le.

387
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,670
He Le, get up.

388
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,700
Are you alright?

389
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,630
I'm fine.

390
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,440
Xu Mingchen.

391
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,220
Xu Mingchen, you...

392
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:16,990
Are you okay?

393
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,210
I'm sorry.

394
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,980
Get up.

395
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,670
What happened to the wire?

396
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,800
I checked it before.

397
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,820
Why is there a problem with the switch?

398
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,440
Yijiang.

399
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,940
Where did you buy the switch?

400
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,210
So it is my fault now?

401
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,680
I just let you do one thing.

402
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,310
And you messed it up.

403
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,700
It's okay. Look.

404
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,630
The result is good. We did it.

405
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,230
It doesn't matter how we did it.

406
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,760
I'm fine.

407
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,670
It took me so much time to prepare all these things.

408
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,890
These candles.

409
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,490
I even spent three hours on my makeup.

410
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,590
But it ended up like this.

411
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,520
I'm sorry.

412
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,830
Do you think I'm a fool?

413
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,680
You are a fool.

414
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,080
But you are my little fool.
