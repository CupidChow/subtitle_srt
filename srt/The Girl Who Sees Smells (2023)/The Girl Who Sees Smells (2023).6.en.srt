[Episode 6]

4
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,990
Fenfen.

5
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,130
He's so handsome.

6
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,770
Who is he?

7
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,340
-My neighbor. -Her boyfriend.

8
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,910
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

9
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,120
Let's sit down.

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,270
Come on.

11
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,030
-Come. -Sit here.

12
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,490
Okay.

13
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,350
I reserved a seat for you.

14
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,210
Naughty boy.

15
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,330
What's wrong with you?

16
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:04,880
Six six.

17
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,460
I'm fine.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,680
Fenfen.

19
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,550
If your neighbor doesn't want to stay,

20
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,640
he can leave.

21
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,720
Well...

22
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,160
Boy, let me tell you.

23
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,980
Boy,

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,500
Fenfen is too kind.

25
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,590
She's always ready to help.

26
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,900
People nowadays are sophisticated

27
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,960
and unreliable.

28
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,550
Young boys like you

29
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,560
enjoy stringing girls along.

30
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,200
So sometimes we have to look out for her.

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,660
Who are you talking about?

32
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,640
Well,

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,860
I'm not throwing shade at you.

34
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,870
Leader, why don't you sing a song?

35
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,050
You sing so well. Sing a song now.

36
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,480
Fenfen, you know me.

37
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,040
I wasn't talking about him.

38
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,490
Leader, let's play a game.

39
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,340
-Good idea. -Sure.

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,470
Okay.

41
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,950
How about Truth or Dare?

42
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,460
-Okay. -Okay.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,220
Then let's make a deal.

44
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,370
If you choose Truth, you have to be honest.

45
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,580
If you choose Dare, you can't get cold feet.

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,300
-Okay. -Okay.

47
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,350
No cheating.

48
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,280
Let's use this bottle.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,040
Ready?

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,590
Go.

51
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,430
Fenfen.

52
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,770
I choose Truth.

53
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,329
Let me ask her.

54
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,150
Are you in love with anyone now?

55
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:30,370
Someone I love? No.

56
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,400
I want to focus on my career now.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,860
I'm not interested in men.

58
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,800
You're no fun.

59
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,100
In the next round,

60
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,500
whoever is the lucky dog has to choose Dare.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,540
-Okay. -No problem.

62
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,260
Come on.

63
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,350
Dare it is.

64
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,400
OK.

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,700
Again.

66
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,380
I'll do it for him.

67
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,430
I choose Dare.

68
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,190
He chose Dare.

69
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,500
Good for him.

70
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,030
Let's come up with something interesting.

71
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,720
How about this?

72
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,170
Let him

73
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,280
kiss someone at present.

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,420
The person who's chosen can't say no.

75
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,150
Okay.

76
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:16,990
What?

77
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,390
Wait.

78
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,570
Well...

79
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,360
Fenfen…

80
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,290
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

81
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,110
Kiss! Kiss!

82
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:46,680
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

83

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,850

enjoy stringing girls along.

91
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,700
Am I stringing her along now?

♫How should I organize my words♫

Well, you guys keep playing.

95
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,570
Go on.

96
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,350
Fenfen.

97
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,800
He's so petulant.

98
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,980
He just ran away.

99
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,170
Let's go back to play.

100
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,480
I know boys like him.

101
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,900
They're willful.

102
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,210
We were having fun

103
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,430
and he suddenly ran away.

104
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,040
No biggie. Just ignore him.

105
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,770
Let's continue.

106
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,500
Come on. Let's drink.

107
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,180
It was so embarrassing.

108
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,330
I must have looked stupid back there.

109
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,300
Fenfen.

110
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,660
Daxiong, what are you doing here?

111
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,050
I'm worried about you.

112
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,770
You didn't look good.

113
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,110
Are you okay?

114
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,790
I'm fine.

115
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,470
You don't have to be strong for me.

116
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,530
I saw your face in there just now.

117
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,670
Fenfen.

118
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,430
An excellent girl like you

119
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,860
will definitely meet

120
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,750
your Mr. Right in the future.

121
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,180
Really?

122
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm sure about it.

123
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,880
Thank you, Leader.

124
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,360
Was he out of his mind?

125
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,440
He got cold feet at the last moment?

126
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,760
I was so embarrassed.

127
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,080
You have no idea how awkward it was.

128
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,790
You're acting weird.

129
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,420
Do you have feelings for him?

130
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,150
No. Not at all.

131
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,770
Why would I have feelings for that brat?

132
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,740
I just felt so embarrassed.

133
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,910
He kept saying how much he liked me,

134
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,920
but today,

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,460
he embarrassed me in front of so many people.

136
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,610
How are the test results?

137
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,740
As I expected,

138
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,680
you're back to where you started.

139
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,860
Mingchen.

140
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,080
You missed such a good chance.

141
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,750
What were you thinking?

142
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,080
She knows nothing about all this.

143
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,680
It's despicable of me

144
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,720
to kiss her just to stay alive.

145
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,090
Have you fallen in love with her?

146
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,100
I don't know.

147
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,100
I wanted to keep her in the dark forever,

148
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,850
but I can't bring myself to do that now.

149
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,250
Yijiang, I'm going home.

150
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,230
It's strange.

151
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,130
Why did he look so sincere at that time?

152
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,440
Was he serious?

153
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,770
But why did he run away?

154
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,870
Wait.

155
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,230
Did my heart just beat fast for him?

156
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,370
No way.

157
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,220
It must be an illusion.

158
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
Have you taken it seriously?

159
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,370
I was just kidding.

160
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,660
What a nightmare!

161
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,090
Young boys can't be trusted.

162
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,290
Yijiang.

163
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,400
How are things with you?

164
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,420
I talked with a German company about the new medicine yesterday.

165
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,420
I'm still waiting for further news.

166
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,740
How is Mingchen?

167
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,170
He's fine, sleeping like a baby now.

168
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,990
That's good.

169
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,670
Okay.

170
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,840
Keep me posted.

171
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,640
Bye.

172
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,770
Lili.

173
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,470
I'm stuck in traffic.

174
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,990
The traffic is terrible today.

175
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,160
I'll be there soon.

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,320
Hey, Qiao Yi.

181
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,210
Fenfen, come to meet me.

182
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,550
I need a hand with the interview.

183
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,310
Okay. I'll be right there.

184
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,590
Something's burnt.

185
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,820
Wake up. Your house is on fire. Wake up!

186
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,090
You're awake.

187
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,730
Are you okay?

188
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,060
I'm a kind person

189
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,570
who's always ready to help.

190
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,880
Even if you were

191
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,510
a total stranger,

192
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,030
I'd help you all the same.

193
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,330
So, don't read into it.

194
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,440
You said you want to focus on your career.

195
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,990
What are you going to do?

196
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,520
I'm going to take part in

197
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,300
the contest held by Phillip, the Master of Wine.

198
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,220
Phillip?

199
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,580
You know him?

200
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,140
He's a very gifted Master of Wine.

201
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,080
Everyone in this industry knows him.

202
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,780
A nobody like me

203
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,500
stands little chance of

204
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,350
winning the contest.

205
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,190
However,

206
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,040
everyone has the right to dream big.

207
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,930
I may lose but it's not a big deal.

208
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't put yourself down.

209
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,540
If you're to compete in the contest,

210
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,470
you should go all out to win

211
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,840
so that you won't have any regrets afterward.

212
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
I trust you.

213
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,230
Hello, Qiao Yi.

214
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,290
Where are you, Fenfen?

215
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,270
I'm in a hurry. I can't wait for too long.

216
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,740
Sorry.

217
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,670
Something came up.

218
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,850
I'll come to you later, okay?

219
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,180
I was surprised

220
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,790
when the outstanding eldest son of the Xu family

221
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,450
reached out to me.

222
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,140
When will you come home?

223

224

You own it?

225
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,630
You sell tea instead of wine now?

226
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,760
Don't change the subject.

227
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,860
You must be busy as the CEO of Xu's Group.

228
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,660
What made you suddenly interested in me?

229
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,850
You can't get along with that woman either

230
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,670

231

239

I won't let her control me

240
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,390

346
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,350
When I was here,

347
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,110
I hated it.

348
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,720
But after I left,

349
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,350
I missed it.

350
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,760
I got it.

351
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,700
You...

352
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,210
Wait. You...

353
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,890
What did you get?

354
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,380
I remember.

355
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,270
It's not here.

356
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,760
Wait.

357
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,390
That's it.

358
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,990
This one?

359
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,590
It just costs a bit more than 200 yuan.

360
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,900
Even the manager wouldn't have it at his birthday party.

361
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,160
Phillip is a great Master of Wine.

362
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,890
You're giving him this for blind tasting?

363
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,820
I don't think you can muddle through.

364
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,620
I'm not going to muddle through.

365
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,770
I'll win fair and square.

366
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,420
The best wine doesn't have to be expensive.

367
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,310
Philip said

368
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,040
that in his heart,

369
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,990
home is a place he misses and hates.

370
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,920
That's how this wine impresses you.

371
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,850
It tastes very sour

372
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,870
and bitter at first,

373
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,230
but once you try it, you'll somehow

374
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,210
miss its taste very much.

375
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,740
This is exactly how Philip described home.

376
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,050
Fine. Whatever you say.

377
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,070
You sell this wine.

378
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,640
You can have a 50% discount.

379
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,220
Thank you!

380
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,860
No worries.

381
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:02,060
[Best Sommelier of China Contest 2021. Bring Chinese wine to the world.]

382
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,000
To ensure absolute fairness,

383
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,740
we will use an anonymous way

384
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,670
to choose four candidates to enter the master class.

385
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,420
You can submit your wines now.

386
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,560
The judges will score your wines

387
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,880
and select the best four candidates.

388
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,760
Please wait here for a while.

389
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,620
The result will come out soon.

390
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,250
Sorry.

391
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,090
Be careful.

392
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,890
I'm sorry.

393
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,740
Let's get started.

394
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:05,940
OK.

395
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,070
The judges carefully evaluated your wines.

396
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,130
The four candidates who will enter the master class are

397
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,310
Miss Bai Bing,

398
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,320
Mr. Han Kai,

399
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,360
Miss Li Zhizhi,

400
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,400
and Mr. Dai Haiwen.

401
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,610
Excuse me.

402
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,580
I want to know my ranking.

403
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,010
There's not a ranking.

404
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,110
You failed the test if your name wasn't called.

405
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,160
I'm sorry.

406
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,290
Watch out. My clothes are expensive.

407
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,710
Didn't you say that I was way off the mark?

408
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,240
Just because you have a perfect sense of taste

409
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,530
doesn't mean you can reach for the moon.

410
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,860
Wake up, dreamer.

411
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,180
I advise you to leave this industry.

412
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,110
You don't fit in here.

413
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,730
Not everyone can work in the wine industry.

414
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,700
Do you think selling wine in the supermarket

415
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,500
is working in the wine industry?

416
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,490
This is a very expensive industry.

417
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,720
You can't afford to work here.

418
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,410
What's wrong with selling wine in the supermarket?

419
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,350
Not everyone in China

420
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,280
can squander money on expensive wines.

421
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,340
Does one have to be rich to enjoy wine?

422
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,280
I'm not rich and can't afford expensive wines,

423
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,180
but I love wine.

424
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,490
And I want to recommend

425
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,630
cheap but great wines to others like me

426
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,200
who can't afford expensive wines.

427
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,650
All you want is just a title.

428
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,800
Do you really understand wine?
