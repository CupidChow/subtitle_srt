00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,060
Are you also curious about

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,140
why I'm only close with Il Ram?

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,130
People think there is some special story.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,170
But there is no story.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,090
There is a story.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,980
What?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,720
You guys were siblings in your previous lives.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,640
A very affectionate older brother and sister who couldn't live without each other.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,390
Who was the younger sister?

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,900
It's Il Ram, right?

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,520
It was you.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,820
You were the younger sister who grumbled to your older brother every day.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,320
That is—

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,130
That is...

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,900
a secret from Il Ram, okay?

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,270
Are you able to...

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,250
- see my future, too?
- What?

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,870
You saw my previous life, so what about my future?

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,130
Close your eyes.

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,420
What do you see?

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,420
You can't see anything, right?

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,700
- That is your future—
- You.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,340
I close my eyes and I can see you.

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,370
No,

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,080
I can see only you.

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,590
Are you my future?

27
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,570
How would I know the future? I can't even see what's in front of me right now.

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,790
I'll explain everything.

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,320
Madam, why are you here— Ouch!

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,560
Mom!

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
I am sure that you two planned and did something to my son.

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,650
Do you think I will just stand by and watch?

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,080
Pardon?

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,430
Mom!

35
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,910
Go.

36
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,810
I'll take care of it here, so go.

[Beautiful Bodhisattva]

I'm sorry, Ahjumma. This is all because of me.

39
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,210
I'm sorry Doo Shim, I'll leave.

40
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,410
And go where?

41
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,380
I don't like it when people get harmed because of me.

42
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,170
Don't worry.

43
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,440
Everything is ruined.

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,940
Looks like we have to close the shop here too.

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,270
You should also transfer schools.

✨The Great Shaman Ga Doo Shim✨

Aigoo.

48
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,160
What are you doing instead of studying as I told you?

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,710
Honey, don't worry too much. He will be fine.

50
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,870
This is all because you as a mother have been hanging out with a shaman!

51
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,460
Let me ask you one thing.

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,750
Is that pity or friendship?

53
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,490
How can the first rank student be friends with the last rank student of the school?

54
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,980
If I don't study well, you won't even treat me as your child?

55
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,840
Woo Soo.

56
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,630
Of course.

57
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,660
Sometimes an adult's thought is like an evil spirit's.

58
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,020
What?

59
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,620

Stop the car, secretary Kim!

Na Woo Soo!

I am so busy, how can you come now? If you are going to do this, then don't do anything.

67
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,890
What is that?

68
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,460
It's an axe made from the foxglove tree with a blade of bronze.

69
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,480
With this, I have to strike the top of his head.

70
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,960
Come out of that child's body immediately!

71

I will make sure you never set foot on this world!

What will you do?

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,160
I can't stop now that I've come this far.

74
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,520
Even if I transfer schools, I will complete what has to be done.

75
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,470
There is no way you can, but let's assume that you catch the evil spirit in Songyeong High School.

76
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,400
Who would like that?

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,640
No one cares about it.

78

The students who study well aren't dying, right?

Stop it if you don't want your mom to become a laughingstock.

It seems that Il Ram went to school suddenly, saying he left something.

83
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,540
I'm going to school now. Don't come.

Il Ram is my friend.

What will someone like me do by living?

Useless jerk.

cruel way and

He's not my friend.

This is my friend.

101

What do I need to do now?

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,430
The evil spirit will come out of Il Ram's body soon.

108
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,650
Then you just have to hit the top of his head.

Have you done it before?

110

Woo Soo, Doo Shim, what are you doing?

114
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,110
He's not Il Ram.

115
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,040
What are you talking about?

116

Let go of me. Woo Soo, release me.

Then who else would I be?

119
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,600
He's not. The evil spirit is putting on an act.

120
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,980
There's something you always say to me.

121

- What do you say when I am annoying you?

What did he use to say?

123
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,390
The most annoying punk.

You really are annoying.

125
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,280
You are more annoying.

126

Shut up. Come out of Il Ram immediately.

Here, hit me. Don't hesitate, quick.

- I said, come out!
- Hit me!

If you hit me right now, I can disappear forever.

Did you think you could stop me with things like that?

When you go to college.

132
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,390
And meet other students from last rank.

133
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,480

No!

Il Ram!

137
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,980
Il Ram!

138
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,750
Il Ram.

139
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,580
What is this?

140
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,160
Did I perhaps die?

141
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,330
I can hear it. His heart is beating.

142
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,860
You can live.

143
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,690
You can't die, you have to live!

144
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,240
We have to take him to a hospital before it's too late.

145
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,350
It's too late.

146
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,300
You would have to reach the hospital within 5 minutes.

147
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,150
He can't go back into the body after 5 minutes.

148
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,360
We can't get there in 5 minutes.

149

- Go inside Il Ram's body.

158
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,220

159
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,050
Wait, what is he doing?

160
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,410
What's this?

161
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,960
Student! Are you okay?

162
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,510
I'll ready him for CPR.

163
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,460
Are you okay?

164
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,960
You?

165
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,840
It hurts a lot here.

166
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,110
You'll be okay soon.

167
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,270
But what hurts more is...

168
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,280
this. I'm so frustrated and angry.

169
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,290
