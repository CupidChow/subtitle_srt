2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,170
Why do we have exams so often?

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,770
I did well on the last mock test.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,780
Another exam?

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,390
What do you mean?

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,090
It's a secret from the others. I want to be the last rank in this test.

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,630
Suddenly, it seems like the last rank is a good position.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,970
Listen carefully.

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,360
You seem to look down on the last rank. It isn't that easy.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,760
It is. I only have to beat your score.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,890
You do your best to answer as many questions as you can.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,420
I'll try to get as many wrong answers as I can.

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,140
What if your worst is still better than my best?

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,890
I didn't think of that.

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,790
Forget it.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,270
I'll be the last rank. Whatever it is, I'll face it. I won't die.

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,140
Il Ram was also like that.

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,430
And the opponent is an evil spirit.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,570
What? Evil spirit?

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,000
The evil spirit posses the last rank students and manipulates them.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,480
You can't handle it.

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,700
Doo Shim, save me.

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,060
I don't want to die.

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,210
Hey!

25
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,960
You can only kill the last rank students. That is the rule.

26
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,160
Wait a bit more, I'll give you what you want.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,430
What is it?

28
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,810
You're not planning anything without telling me, right?

29
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,550
Come on, what are you saying?

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,120
Look at me.

31
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,550
Why?

32
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,670
So that I can see the look in your eyes.

33
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,320
Do you think I'm fooling you?

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,500
You are very cheesy today.

35
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,320
Can I kiss you?

36
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,360
Can I? I'm asking you, right?

37
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,380
Would I let you? Crazy jerk!

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,370
You! What did you do to me?

39
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,380
What are you saying?

40
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,870
My head hurts a lot and my body is sore.

41
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,640
What the hell did you do to me?

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,330
It was strange from when you called me over to your house.

43
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,870
It was like something strange suddenly came inside my body.

44
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,970
I don't have any memory from then.

45
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,120
Soo Jung, I'll explain it later.

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,000
Tell me now.

47
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,230
Did Doo Shim ask you to torture me?

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,760
No.

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,310
You went to the basement with your students and saw an evil spirit?

50
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,190
I didn't see it for myself, but there was something for sure.

51
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,650
I also didn't believe it at first, but Doo Shim and Woo Soo weren't saying any nonsense.

52
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,320
So?

53
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,050
What do you mean by "so"?

54
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,470
We have to cancel the exam immediately and do whatever we can to catch the evil spirit.

55
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,220
Even if we have to close the school, as long as our students don't die.

56
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,040
Let's just say that an evil spirit exists.

57
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,870
Who do you think is the better educator?

58
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,770
Principal!

59
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,740
Is it you, who wastes time on students who don't study or who can't score well even if they study,

60
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,430
or is it the evil spirit, who makes the students study very well on their own?

61
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,880
Principal, let go of me.

62
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,630
Who is the reason that these students go to a good college?

63
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,390
Hey! Answer me.

64
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,440
Is it you? Is it because of you? Is it because of you?

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,510
Tell me. Tell me. Yes?

66
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,650
Answer me, you jerk!

67
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,150
It's the evil spirit.

68
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,070
You should just make sure you aren't the teacher of the last rank student, Teacher Sa.

69
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,220
What would you do if you find the evil spirit?

70
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,980
I'm raising the future generation's famous personalities. Why

71
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,930
does a useless jerk like you come and...

72
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,330
How did you come out?

73
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,390
I used the exam as an excuse and talked back to my parents. It was much easier than I thought it would be.

74
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,090
For the exam? Does that mean you will do that more often?

75
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,890
When I need to.

76
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,960
What were you doing here? Why is your expression like that?

77
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,060
My heart is breaking.

78
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,660
What?

79
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,150
Just the thought of whether we will be able to catch the evil spirit.

80
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,500
Even if we catch it, will someone even recognize our efforts?

81
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,660
Did you start this with the intention that someone would recognize your efforts?

82
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,390
That's not it, but

83
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,400
it's too hard.

84
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,920
I want to be kicked out of this game.

85
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,150
Get up.

86
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,530
Are we going somewhere?

87
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,330
I don't think I can keep going this way.

88
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,200
I can't handle the hospital fee either.

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,690
Mrs. Kim, please hang in there for a little more time.

90

92

We will definitely

93

save Il Ram.

94

95
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,350
I will meet the evil spirit.

96
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,100
I may be able to catch the evil spirit, but

97
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,490
there is also a chance that I become like Il Ram.

Hey, Na Woo Soo. Why are you sticking your nose in my business?

I did write one correct answer for each subject out of courtesy, though.

But there won't be a problem with getting a last-rank student, right?

Principal, I can't manipulate the grades.
