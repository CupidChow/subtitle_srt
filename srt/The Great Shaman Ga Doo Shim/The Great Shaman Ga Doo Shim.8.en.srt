Yes, I can do it alone.

169
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,590
What do you mean by that? Are you worried that I might get hurt?

170
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,490
I'm worried I might get hurt.

171
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,560
If it works, we have to fight with the school and your parents.

172
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,020
Fighting with evil spirits is enough fighting for me.

173
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,320
There must be a reason why this ability has been given to me.

174
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,090
I am clumsy because I started this game just now.

175
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,820
But if you, who are already used to this game, help me, I'll become accustomed to it.

176
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,620
And like that, there will be something with which I can help you.

177
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,000
This isn't a game.

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,060
I've decided to think of it as a game.

179
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,530
An eighteen-year-old high school student fighting an evil spirit

180
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,170
and saving his friends. Is this possible in real life?

181
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,460
I want to be at the top of this game too.

182
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,110
What about Il Ram?

183
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,410
I've hidden him well.

- Don't say anything more.

185
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,020
- I remembered.
- I told you not to say anything.

186
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,200
Not that.

187
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,400
When I brought Il Ram here, there was someone who had followed the evil spirit.

188
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
What?

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,720
Be bound by my words and stop!

Be bound by my words and stop!

Draw a circle with your left hand, and a triangle with your right.

198
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,660
This is the best to help your memory.

199
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,230
If you do that, you'll remember that person and your mom too.

You need to transfer schools immediately.

- Immediately.

What are you talking about?

210

There is something in your school.

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,550
I know. The evil spirit.

230
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,180
Then do you mean the evil spirit has locked up the dead students forever? Why?
