1
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:36,057
PRO BONO

2
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:42,021
-I got it!
-My goodness!

3
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:43,231
You scared me!

4
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:44,440
You got what?

5
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:46,317
You're innocent.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,486
Of what?

7
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,822
You're innocent, Mr. Kang! Innocent!

8
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:56,119
What?

9
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,165
Innocent?

10
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:01,624
EPISODE 7

11
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,501
-What do you mean, Gi-ppeum?
-What?

12
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:07,839
Did you do something wrong?

13
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:12,093
Why say he's innocent while holding
checkup results? What does that mean?

14
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:14,804
Innocent! There's nothing wrong…

15
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:17,390
No symptoms! I'm clean.

16
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:20,894
She was saying the results
of my colonoscopy came out clean.

17
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:23,813
I recently told Ms. Park

18
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,107
that I'd been having trouble in my gut

19
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:28,026
and maybe I got sick
after joining this team.

20
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:29,736
-So maybe I thought …
-Colorectal cancer?

21
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,571
-What?
-Cancer?

22
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,157
Cancer all of a sudden?

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,035
It's… it's all right.

24
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:38,953
The result came out clean.

25
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:42,665
Maybe I was too stressed
about Kaya's case.

26
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:43,875
Right, Ms. Park?

27
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,627
I'm glad you're okay.

28
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:49,213
Were you always that close
with Gi-ppeum though?

29
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:50,340
What?

30
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:52,634
You two seemed pretty distant recently.

31
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,595
That's nonsense!

32
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:59,599
Ms. Park got worried
and was paying attention to my health.

33
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:00,934
Right, Ms. Park?

34
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:02,518
Are you out of your mind?

35
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:03,811
That's right.

36
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:05,521
Yes.

37
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:10,443
It must have been hard
keeping it to yourself

38
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,612
to not worry the others.

39
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:15,990
I don't have colorectal cancer
so don't worry.

40
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:20,245
Hey, you… I mean, Ms. Park.
Why don't we have some coffee

41
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:21,788
on the rooftop?

42
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:23,706
Sure.

43
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:28,419
That was very awkward.

44
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:29,963
That was very strange.

45
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:31,714
What was?

46
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:36,469
Disband Team Pro Bono.

47
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:38,513
Father.

48
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:45,144
Why are you doing this suddenly?

49
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,399
We need Team Pro Bono
to build a new Oh & Partners--

50
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:52,360
Don't get confused.
You're not my only child.

51
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:58,324
From the cornerstone
to each pillar and brick,

52
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:02,120
I built Oh & Partners with my own hands.

53
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:05,957
It's the first child I bore and raised
long before you came along.

54
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,002
Right.

55
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,797
And I'm trying
to turn your precious Oh & Partners

56
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,342
into a firm that is beloved
by people around the world.

57
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:19,971
We can change the firm's image
by using public sentiment a little--

58
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:21,264
"Beloved"?

59
00:03:21,347 --> 00:03:22,807
Does that make money?

60
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:31,441
Here are the pro bono request statistics.

61
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:34,819
Ever since Kang joined,

62
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,697
they've increased twentyfold.

63
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,949
They'll complain if we ignore them all,

64
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:44,495
so we have to increase
the number of cases we accept.

65
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:50,376
Love from the people
who could never become our clients?

66
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:53,921
That's just cost, not profit.

67
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:57,216
I only trust the numbers.

68
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:03,389
How much has that team contributed
to our income statement?

69
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:07,477
How much?

70
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:23,993
Are you out of your mind?

71
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:28,289
Why don't you just tell the whole team
that I took the apple box with cash…

72
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:31,084
They'll be thrilled to see the video

73
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,795
of me receiving
the apple box full of cash.

74
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:37,048
Nan-hui would especially make a fuss
and call the cops at once.

75
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,216
What…

76
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:41,636
-I get it now.
-About what?

77
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:44,722
No wonder something felt off
every time I watched that video.

78
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:48,267
I knew I'd seen something similar before.

79
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,895
What do you mean?
We only met recently.

80
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:51,854
Forget it.

81
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,107
Think carefully

82
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:57,235
about the endoscopy you got
during your checkup.

83
00:04:58,194 --> 00:04:59,195
Why?

84
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:02,865
Everyone, I'm an attorney.

85
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,326
You have to tell me
the exact size and length

86
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,413
-of the camera that'll go into my body--
-Is it your first time?

87
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:11,707
-Does it hurt a lot?
-Everyone's scared their first time.

88
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,876
Don't worry. It won't hurt.

89
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:17,338
Okay, here comes the anesthetic.

90
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:19,590
-Ten.
-I'm pretty sensitive.

91
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:21,175
-Nine.
-So the anesthetic won't…

92
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,386
Eight.

93
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,513
Seven.

94
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:27,557
Six.

95
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:29,308
Five.

96
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:32,728
Four, three…

97
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:34,063
See?

98
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,941
My body doesn't respond…

99
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:38,443
What doesn't respond?

100
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:42,780
Ms. Park.

101
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,951
You're not getting the endoscopy?

102
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:52,999
We've already returned to work
after finishing our checkups.

103
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:56,669
You're the only one who's late
after making a big fuss.

104
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,758
Gosh, it was so hilarious though.
It's a shame only I saw it.

105
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:05,178
What are you talking about?

106
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:07,597
What?

107
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,390
I was asleep for two hours?

108
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:12,518
Did I really get the endoscopy?

109
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:14,020
During the whole time,

110
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:17,356
you made a fuss about suing the doctor
and you thrashed around.

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,400
I heard you were very animated.

112
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,527
Did I really sleep here

113
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,030
for two hours?

114
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:26,240
But I don't remember a thing.

115
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,952
Right. That was a bit weird,

116
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:32,663
but what does that have to do
with the apple box?

117
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:34,582
That's the key.

118
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:36,542
-A time slip.
-A time slip?

119
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:40,546
You said you didn't remember anything
about making a scene.

120
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,298
I didn't make a…

121
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:46,344
I swear I was being put under,
and then I woke up in the recovery room.

122
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,221
That's how anesthesia is.

123
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:49,805
-What?
-It doesn't make you

124
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,057
completely unconscious.

125
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,725
It sedates you briefly,

126
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:55,728
so you won't remember
what happened during the examination.

127
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,980
It's retrograde amnesia.

128
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:03,444
Are you telling me…

129
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:06,864
When you came out of the endoscopy,
you were a total mess.

130
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:10,243
-Your face and gestures were peculiar.
-Come on.

131
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:13,663
I had never seen you like that,
but it felt strangely familiar.

132
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:16,541
I laughed about it back then,
but I get it now.

133
00:07:16,624 --> 00:07:18,334
The way you looked in that moment…

134
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:21,879
was just like this.

135
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:27,552
That's how I looked

136
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:30,346
-under anesthesia?
-Yes.

137
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:33,933
My father was exactly like this
after he was put under too.

138
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:36,519
He wasn't his usual self. He looked drunk.

139
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:38,563
Look, Mr. Kang.

140
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:39,730
You're in his arms.

141
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:43,150
You're practically being carried by him,
as if you're totally drunk.

142
00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:46,862
But I did get drunk that night
after a few drinks.

143
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:50,283
No, you don't completely let yourself go
even when you're drunk.

144
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:54,579
At our after-work gatherings, your eyes
were always alert even when drunk.

145
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:56,414
They kept observing others.

146
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,209
Is that how I was?

147
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,461
Yes. You have that disturbing stare.

148
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:04,505
And look.

149
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,550
You usually don't make
such big gestures when you're drunk.

150
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:10,469
You always do those kinds of petty moves.

151
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:11,429
Like this.

152
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:13,097
And like this.

153
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:15,975
-Like this.
-Come on, "petty" is a bit…

154
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:18,185
Look again, Mr. Kang.

155
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:21,731
You never smile this brightly.

156
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:25,192
The corners of your mouth
don't go up this high.

157
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:28,154
You've been observing me pretty closely.

158
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:30,323
Of course.

159
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:31,782
-Is that so?
-Yes.

160
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:34,952
As you know, my parents are deaf.

161
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:36,829
Right.

162
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:40,249
They talk with their hands
and facial expressions.

163
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,335
If you want a real conversation,

164
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,005
you have to look at others carefully.

165
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:48,382
Like this.

166
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,218
I see. So that's why.

167
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:52,720
Yes.

168
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:56,557
But the anesthesia for endoscopies

169
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,643
usually makes you
just talk gibberish in bed.

170
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:01,687
I don't know if it can make you
move around like this.

171
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,692
Maybe it's a similar substance
but more powerful.

172
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:10,446
So instead of just talking in your sleep,
it makes you sleepwalk.

173
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:16,035
Instead of being drunk from alcohol,
I was drunk from sleep?

174
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:21,165
This means he approached you
after researching your childhood.

175
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:24,585
Who would go to such lengths to do this?

176
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:25,753
For what?

177
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:27,797
Isn't there anyone you suspect?

178
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:32,968
I think about it
every moment of every day.

179
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,220
But there are too many.

180
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:38,224
In the end, being a judge means
you brandish a knife at others.

181
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:40,518
There's likely a long list of people

182
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:42,645
who hold a grudge against me.

183
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:45,564
It must've been hard
to deal with that alone.

184
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:49,193
Well, I've dug around as much as I could,

185
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,071
but things haven't changed much.

186
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,573
It's as if I'm in quicksand.

187
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:56,617
But one thing has changed.

188
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:57,535
What?

189
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:00,121
We're on the same team.

190
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,540
Let's find out together.

191
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:07,461
Not everything is as it seems.

192
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,218
What's with that look?

193
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,346
Did you just swear at me?

194
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:20,057
I think you did.

195
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:21,434
Let's go.

196
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:23,394
The team will get suspicious of us.

197
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:29,567
Mr. Kang!

198
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,944
What took you so long?

199
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:33,154
What?

200
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:37,908
Geez, what's with you?
I said I don't have colorectal cancer.

201
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:39,493
What do we do?

202
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:41,954
What's going on?

203
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:44,290
Nan-hui, what is it?

204
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:46,792
Why are you overreacting so much?

205
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:50,045
What? Did someone tell us
to break up the team?

206
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:56,093
If no one answers, then that means…

207
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:58,345
They do want us to disband.

208
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:00,890
Dr. Oh Gyu-jang made the decision himself.

209
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:01,974
What?

210
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,309
The founder of this firm?

211
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,939
Then, are we being transferred
to a different team that's profitable?

212
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:10,232
As if!

213
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:13,778
They're going to fire us all.

214
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,071
starting with you, the team leader.

215
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:17,281
Da-wit, what do we do?

216
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:20,326
I have nowhere else to go.
Please go up and say something!

217
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:21,577
Get off me!

218
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,998
ENDING AND DISBANDMENT OF TEAM PRO BONO

219
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:27,625
Damn it.

220
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:35,883
What's the reason?

221
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:38,344
You can't do this.
You have to make an appointment first.

222
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:43,098
Are you Judge Kang?

223
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:44,683
I'm sorry, Dr. Oh.

224
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,768
It's all right.

225
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,229
You can go, Ms. Seo.

226
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:49,438
Yes, sir.

227
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,619
Dr. Oh Gyu-jang,
the chair of the bar association.

228
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:07,081
The founder of Korea's biggest firm,
Oh & Partners.

229
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:11,502
The giant among giants who controls
the legal world from the shadows.

230
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:13,504
No, not a giant. A monster.

231
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:18,384
I wanted to thank you earlier
but you were on a business trip overseas.

232
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:19,468
Sure.

233
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,929
I allowed you to register as an attorney

234
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:25,724
because Jung-in kept pestering me to,
which was unlike her.

235
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:29,270
Then, why are you kicking me out now

236
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:30,604
after taking me in?

237
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:32,439
You know,

238
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,777
I've worked my whole life
in the legal industry,

239
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:40,864
and I don't want it to be a place
where corrupt judges and prosecutors

240
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,157
can resign and hide.

241
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:45,619
I can't bear to watch it anymore.

242
00:12:45,703 --> 00:12:48,205
Of course, I'm talking about the video.

243
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:55,421
You know that's not it.

244
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:00,634
You knew about the video from the start.

245
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:05,014
How did you know he came to see me?

246
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:12,229
Ms. Seo, I need to see you for a moment.

247
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:20,154
Did you ask for me, sir?

248
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:21,989
Thanks for everything.

249
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:25,743
-Today will be your last day.
-Pardon?

250
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:28,245
-Sir!
-Call the security team

251
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,666
so they can take back your laptop
and other equipment

252
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,709
within 30 minutes.

253
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,378
Did I do something wrong?

254
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:39,673
You'll have to hurry to pack your stuff.

255
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:42,635
Yes, sir.

256
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,981
Was that really necessary?

257
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:57,900
You know very well

258
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:01,320
I love receiving information
about other people.

259
00:14:01,403 --> 00:14:03,781
But I despise employees

260
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:06,867
who tell others about my visitors.

261
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:26,011
What on earth could be the reason?
We've been doing great lately.

262
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,429
Exactly.

263
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:29,974
We've been on a winning streak
since Mr. Kang's been here.

264
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:32,226
Pro bono cases
have never been this popular.

265
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,144
Other pro bono attorneys
are so happy, so why?

266
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,146
That could be the reason.

267
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,232
What do you mean, Mr. Jang?

268
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:40,985
Hey, what did you mean?

269
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:44,279
Why are you cleaning wheels right now?

270
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:49,243
I heard attorneys from other teams
have been speaking ill of us.

271
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,954
They didn't like
that we used the firm's name

272
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:53,789
because we don't have
elite qualifications.

273
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:56,792
"We can't have those losers
keep representing our firm on the news."

274
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:00,254
That's embarrassing for them.
Did they really say that?

275
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:02,548
Well, they're not totally wrong.

276
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:06,927
-Hey!
-Also, Ms. Oh made our team.

277
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:10,431
Do the other partners really want us…

278
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:12,933
to succeed?

279
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:17,062
But still, she is Dr. Oh's daughter.

280
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:19,565
Why would he do this
to a team his daughter made?

281
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:23,068
You took Mr. Kang in
despite knowing everything.

282
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,446
Please reconsider your decision.

283
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:35,080
His team is in charge of the entire firm's
mandatory public service hours.

284
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:37,958
Do you know how much money
we save from that?

285
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,209
That's not the problem.

286
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:41,754
The more high-end a brand is,

287
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:46,050
the more they make people wait
to even enter and look around the store.

288
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:49,178
When it's less accessible,
we get to control the price.

289
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:51,055
What empowers us

290
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:55,142
is jealousy, envy, and fear,
not love from the people.

291
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:58,145
But you're making it easier

292
00:15:58,228 --> 00:16:01,732
for people to bring up
our firm so casually

293
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,401
by gathering low-class losers

294
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:07,821
to represent a dog, a kid with disability,

295
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:10,741
and an illegal alien.

296
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:14,495
I thought I'd taught you enough
about how power works.

297
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:17,122
Are you dumb?

298
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,751
Or have you become weak
like your dead mother?

299
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:27,257
I'll prove it with numbers.

300
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:31,178
-What?
-I just need to show you

301
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:33,097
that we can be profitable, right?

302
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,264
How about this?

303
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:37,768
Baekseung Law Firm has been
close behind Oh & Partners in revenue.

304
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:40,479
What if we can take away their clients?

305
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,065
Mr. Kang.

306
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:44,733
Hey, Judge Kang.

307
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:47,402
I like to gamble too,

308
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:52,157
but one needs something at stake
to make a bet work.

309
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:54,159
I've already ordered the disbandment.

310
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:58,747
If we lose,

311
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:03,127
we'll disband the team for free.

312
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,419
For free?

313
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,380
If you force us to disband,

314
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:09,550
I'll immediately sue you
for wrongful termination.

315
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:13,428
And of course,
I'll drag it out as much as possible

316
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:14,805
until your costs pile up.

317
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:17,808
How interesting.

318
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:27,901
Please let me know. I'll wait.

319
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:33,115
Also,

320
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:35,576
let me correct one thing.

321
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:38,745
The person we represented, Kaya,
wasn't an illegal alien.

322
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:43,125
She came to Korea legitimately
with a marriage visa.

323
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:48,547
I was taught that fact-checking
is a basic requirement for any attorney.

324
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:56,972
A bet?

325
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:00,726
Sounds good.

326
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,942
Thank you, Mr. Jang.

327
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:10,903
Don't worry. You trust me, right?

328
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:12,362
Yes.

329
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,742
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

330
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:21,747
-By the way, Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

331
00:18:22,414 --> 00:18:24,708
You're so handsome.

332
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:29,922
What?

333
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:34,760
Hey, handsome lawyer man.

334
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:37,554
Why are you blushing?

335
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,181
Well, I'm not ugly.

336
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:41,433
-My goodness.
-Yeong-sil.

337
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:45,020
She's Song Ji-hye, isn't she?

338
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:46,939
I heard a social worker sent her to you.

339
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:50,150
Yes. Ji-hye has
a Grade 3 intellectual disability,

340
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:52,736
and her parents passed away
from a car accident.

341
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:53,987
Goodness.

342
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,113
Really?

343
00:18:58,325 --> 00:18:59,493
Gather around.

344
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:01,578
I have something to tell you.

345
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:04,957
A competition?

346
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,127
We're pro bono attorneys.
We're people who defend the weak.

347
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:11,713
Baekseung only handles cases
with tax-evading chaebols

348
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,715
and corporate raiders
who conduct mass layoffs.

349
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,342
You want us to take that kind of case?

350
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:18,387
Do you know who Mr. Jang
just agreed to represent?

351
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,180
An abused intellectually disabled person.

352
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:23,267
We're attorneys
who help those kinds of people.

353
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:30,315
We're the ones getting laid off here.
We're the weak.

354
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:33,193
Can't you think of it
as defending ourselves?

355
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:36,530
But you should've made a bet we could win.

356
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:38,073
If we lose this epically,

357
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:40,409
someone like me
won't be able to find another job.

358
00:19:40,492 --> 00:19:42,244
We'll just win then!

359
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,420
Yes, this is Team Pro Bono. Sorry?

360
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:54,047
Yes.

361
00:19:56,174 --> 00:20:00,470
Mr. Bae wants all of us
to come to the conference room at once.

362
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:01,638
Right now?

363
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:05,392
It's almost time,
so take care of it quickly.

364
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:11,606
-Hello.
-Hello, sir!

365
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,524
Hello.

366
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,277
Why did you need us so urgently?

367
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,905
Attorney Kang, I heard you made
an "adorable" proposal to Dr. Oh.

368
00:20:19,614 --> 00:20:21,992
You promised to beat Baekseung
to secure a case?

369
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:27,414
Yes, "whatever" case that maybe.

370
00:20:27,497 --> 00:20:31,001
Really? "Any" case, right?

371
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:35,172
How may I help you?

372
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,424
We have an appointment
with Oh & Partners at noon.

373
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:40,886
You mean her?

374
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:58,278
We happen to have a meeting today,
so give it your best.

375
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:00,572
They're coming here
after meeting with Baekseung.

376
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:03,492
You suddenly called us here
to meet with a client?

377
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:05,535
What? The first meeting's
only for introductions.

378
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:10,040
You made a bet with Dr. Oh
without even having that much confidence?

379
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:13,794
Keep your word and disband the team
without any complaints if you lose.

380
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:16,671
They should be here by now.

381
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:18,632
-Why are you standing like that? Sit.
-Right.

382
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:19,800
Behave yourselves.

383
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:22,052
Don't make a scene or scream.

384
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:23,720
Scream?

385
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:25,430
Hello.

386
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:26,473
It's Elijah.

387
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:34,106
Oh, my gosh! It's Elijah! I'm a big fan!

388
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:35,774
Elijah!

389
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:38,985
-What's going on?
-Sir, Elijah is here.

390
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:40,654
-Elijah?
-Yes!

391
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:41,905
-"Korea's sweetheart"?
-Yes!

392
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,407
Let's go take a photo!

393
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:45,951
They must be here.

394
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,036
Goodness, welcome.

395
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:49,913
Hello.

396
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:52,582
No way.

397
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:57,379
It's Elijah. What is she doing here?

398
00:21:59,047 --> 00:21:59,923
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:03,552
Mr. Hwang's a big fan,
so he must've gotten excited for a moment.

400
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:06,054
-I'm not late, am I?
-No, it's all right.

401
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:10,142
Hello, I'm Attorney Bae Yong-hun
of Oh & Partners.

402
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:11,059
Nice to meet you.

403
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:12,769
-I'm Cha Jin-hui.
-Hello, sir.

404
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:16,314
By the way, who are these people?

405
00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:18,108
-Right.
-Hello.

406
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:22,404
I'm Attorney Kang Da-wit,
former chief judge

407
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:25,240
of Seoul Central District Court.

408
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:26,241
I see.

409
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:28,201
Hello, I'm Park Gi-ppeum.

410
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:29,244
Okay.

411
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,329
I'm Hwang Jun-u. I'm a big fan.

412
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:34,624
I'm Jang Yeong-sil.

413
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,795
Geez. Why do I smell oil?

414
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:41,673
I'm sorry. I was in the middle of work
before I came.

415
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:46,970
-I'm sorry.
-The vibe of Oh & Partners' attorneys is…

416
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:49,848
very colorful.

417
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,685
Everyone at Baekseung Law Firm
went to SNU Law School.

418
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:56,438
Their team leader is
a former CID prosecutor from the SPO.

419
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:58,690
The SPO's
Central Investigation Department?

420
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,067
Mr. Woo Myeong-hun?

421
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:02,277
Yes.

422
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,114
I assume you obviously went to SNU
if you're a former chief judge?

423
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,079
Am I wrong?

424
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:19,419
I specifically asked for a team
with the best attorneys.

425
00:23:19,502 --> 00:23:22,380
Ms. Cha, this team's been
on a roll these days.

426
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:25,425
You must've seen them on the news.
Team Pro Bono.

427
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:27,802
Team Pro Bono?

428
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:30,972
From that abandoned dog case?

429
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,016
-That…
-Yes!

430
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:36,186
Yes, we handled that case.

431
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:40,732
Wait, did you bring me a team
that handles dog cases?

432
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:42,943
I knew it.

433
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:45,654
You can't bring in nobodies like this.

434
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:48,740
"Nobodies"?

435
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:52,410
We're not the people
who can be called nobodies.

436
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:54,496
I'm sure you have heard about me.

437
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:55,872
The people's judge--

438
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:57,916
What?

439
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:03,922
You can't just give yourself
such a title like that.

440
00:24:04,005 --> 00:24:08,009
I didn't give myself the title.
Then, let me explain in detail.

441
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:10,845
The number of my followers is--

442
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:14,140
I'm sorry.

443
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:17,394
Our team leader's had to pull
a lot of all-nighters these days.

444
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:18,478
-You must be tired.
-No.

445
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:21,147
Shall we begin the meeting
after a short break?

446
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:22,899
-We just met.
-Okay, come here.

447
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:25,652
Elijah, I'm a big fan. It's such an honor.

448
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:27,654
-Ms. Park, why…
-Come here.

449
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:29,447
-Wait, that's not…
-You're so heavy.

450
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:31,199
Ms. Park, what I meant was…

451
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:32,367
Let go of me.

452
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:34,536
Will you hear me out?

453
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:36,579
She keeps saying
Seoul National University.

454
00:24:36,663 --> 00:24:39,040
What, did she graduate
from an elite school

455
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:40,959
to become a celebrity?

456
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:43,086
-Elijah goes to a prestigious university.
-Yes.

457
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:45,213
-Really?
-Yes.

458
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:48,758
How many followers does she have then?

459
00:24:48,842 --> 00:24:51,052
Ms. Park, I have 380,000 followers now.

460
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:54,848
She has 25 million.

461
00:24:57,851 --> 00:24:59,811
25 MILLION FOLLOWERS

462
00:24:59,894 --> 00:25:03,773
Mr. Kang, who was
the last K-pop idol you liked?

463
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:12,741
-Tell me--
-Mr. Kang!

464
00:25:12,824 --> 00:25:15,243
How can you not know Elijah,
"Korea's sweetheart"

465
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:17,579
and the one everyone wishes
was their daughter?

466
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:20,165
An angel with a beautiful smile
who donates to charities,

467
00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:22,792
she got into a top college
while working hard as an idol.

468
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:24,794
Elijah is every parent's dream!

469
00:25:25,712 --> 00:25:27,589
Why are you so quiet? This isn't like you.

470
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:29,174
Don't you know who Elijah is?

471
00:25:29,257 --> 00:25:30,633
-Am I supposed to know?
-Well?

472
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,262
Anyway, her group was disbanded
three years ago,

473
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:36,639
and she debuted
as a solo artist last year.

474
00:25:36,723 --> 00:25:38,767
EK Entertainment CEO Cha Jin-hui
is her mother.

475
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,478
And company director Kim Ju-won
is her brother.

476
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:43,188
Those years as a nerd really help.

477
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:47,442
Save it. When you go inside,
you better be on alert.

478
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:49,569
You saw how they belittled us.

479
00:25:51,237 --> 00:25:52,572
Fix your tie too.

480
00:25:52,655 --> 00:25:54,157
Let's go. Move out.

481
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,034
Let's go!

482
00:25:56,117 --> 00:26:01,331
You said earlier we're pro bono attorneys
who defend the weak.

483
00:26:02,248 --> 00:26:05,001
They don't look that weak at all.

484
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:08,546
Since we're here anyway,
we'll explain the situation.

485
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:10,590
-Mr. Kim?
-Yes, ma'am.

486
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:17,555
I'm going to take videos again today.

487
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,224
-Yeah.
-She is so pretty.

488
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:22,310
Elijah!

489
00:26:22,894 --> 00:26:24,813
Elijah, can you take off your cap?

490
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,855
Fuck!

491
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:34,030
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,742
What's wrong, Elijah?

493
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:39,077
Are you okay? Did something--

494
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,746
Enough is enough, you crazy bitches!

495
00:26:43,456 --> 00:26:44,416
Get lost.

496
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,918
I said fuck off!

497
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:54,968
Were you surprised?

498
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:58,221
I'm pretty good at cursing.
And colorfully too.

499
00:26:58,304 --> 00:26:59,556
Stay still, Elijah.

500
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:01,850
Their parents want to sue Elijah,

501
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:05,603
claiming their daughters
were hospitalized due to shock.

502
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:06,938
If this gets out of hand,

503
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:09,315
all her endorsement deals
will be terminated,

504
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,526
and she'll have to pay
billions of won in penalties.

505
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:15,029
Her recent ambassador deal
with a luxury brand will be canceled too.

506
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:18,616
There's also an internet channel
that's been harassing her since long ago.

507
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,410
I told you, everyone.

508
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:23,413
This is all plastic surgery and editing.

509
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,165
Korea's sweetheart, my foot.

510
00:27:25,707 --> 00:27:30,628
Okay, everyone. Now, I will reveal
Elijah's before photos.

511
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:33,173
How much facial contouring did she do?

512
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:35,884
With that much surgery,
isn't she more robot than human?

513
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:39,888
The whole country is being fooled by her.

514
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:44,601
The Cyber Crusader
will uncover the truth on this channel.

515
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:47,061
Make sure to turn on notifications,
like, and subscribe!

516
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:48,980
My goodness.

517
00:27:49,606 --> 00:27:52,817
Those are downright lies, of course.

518
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:54,944
If they get a hold of this video,

519
00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:58,448
these lies will turn into the truth.

520
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,866
The public jumps to conclusions.

521
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:01,117
By the way,

522
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:04,662
who took this video?

523
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:06,831
There must be a camera that recorded it.

524
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:09,459
Right. This one?

525
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:14,506
Yes, her whole body is in frame,
so it was taken from ten meters away.

526
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:15,715
Elijah didn't notice

527
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:18,760
that there was a camera at all.

528
00:28:18,843 --> 00:28:20,720
You think we didn't follow up on it?

529
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:23,515
-What?
-The driver of the taxi the girls rented

530
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:25,141
took it with the girl's phone.

531
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:27,393
They rented a taxi?

532
00:28:27,477 --> 00:28:30,104
Yes, because it was 3:00 in the morning.

533
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,483
She gave the phone to the driver
to film them meeting Elijah.

534
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:36,861
The video hasn't spread yet?

535
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:40,281
Some of the parents
are using the video to ask for money,

536
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:42,909
but we've stopped it
from circulating for now.

537
00:28:42,992 --> 00:28:45,245
Don't worry, Elijah.
I'll make sure nothing gets out.

538
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:48,748
Just focus on preparing
for the album, okay?

539
00:28:58,508 --> 00:29:01,135
Well, the first match was a total defeat.

540
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:02,929
They didn't even take our business cards.

541
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:06,224
They suddenly called us
when we weren't even ready.

542
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:07,141
That was so unfair.

543
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:09,477
They don't want us to win at all.

544
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,896
Are we going to be disbanded
before we even get a chance?

545
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:16,943
-What's my name?
-Sorry?

546
00:29:17,777 --> 00:29:20,238
-What is my name?
-What is he doing?

547
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,201
Aren't you Mr. Kang Da-wit?

548
00:29:25,827 --> 00:29:28,997
Yes. It's Da-wit, like David,
who beat the giant Goliath.

549
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,166
I'm getting tired
of saying it now, okay? We…

550
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,169
-will win no matter what.
-Yes.

551
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:39,966
Sure, sure. As you know,

552
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:41,342
I'm always…

553
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:43,595
full of faith.

554
00:29:44,762 --> 00:29:46,055
What's gotten into you?

555
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:48,516
But my job is at stake
this time, Mr. Kang.

556
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,185
Instead of a vague speech,

557
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:53,646
you should give us specific measures.

558
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:57,108
-Jun-u, why are you so worked up--
-Why wouldn't I be?

559
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:00,987
What on earth made you make that bet?

560
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:08,661
Mushrooms.

561
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:11,205
-Anger issues.
-Hey!

562
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:13,875
A serious nerd and a tall idiot.

563
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:16,794
How are we going to beat
a mega law firm?

564
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:18,004
What's with you?

565
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:19,422
-Calm down.
-Let go of me.

566
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:20,924
-Sorry, he's drunk.
-I'm not drunk.

567
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:22,550
-Sit down.
-I'm not drunk!

568
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:27,889
Am I wrong?

569
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,809
You've done well your entire life,

570
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:34,979
so the whole world
is like a joke to you, isn't it?

571
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:40,193
This team might be like a hobby for you,
but I tried four times to get this job.

572
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:43,404
This job is my lifeline!

573
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:51,663
This team is my lifeline too.

574
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:54,207
What?

575
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:59,379
I was fired after getting blackmailed
with a video of me taking a bribe.

576
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:01,714
Then, I came here.

577
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,061
I've been pushed to the brink too.

578
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,447
I'm sorry.

579
00:31:27,156 --> 00:31:28,533
I should have told you before.

580
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,493
We're on the same team.

581
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,830
But you knew about it, Gi-ppeum.

582
00:31:33,913 --> 00:31:35,957
-Well…
-Yeah.

583
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,125
I'm sorry.

584
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:39,460
As I told you,

585
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:43,172
I ended up seeing the video very suddenly.

586
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:45,466
I couldn't tell you because I wasn't sure.

587
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,094
Is your judgment
the only one that matters?

588
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:51,389
You should have asked for our opinions.

589
00:31:55,351 --> 00:31:58,521
We ended up working
with a person under suspicion,

590
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:01,024
and it was for public interest cases.

591
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:02,692
Nan-hui, that's--

592
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:05,486
It's not her fault. It's all my fault.

593
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,780
I should've told you sooner

594
00:32:07,864 --> 00:32:09,991
and let you decide.

595
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:14,662
We'll need to discuss it among ourselves.

596
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:17,540
This was very unexpected.

597
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:19,792
Right.

598
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,544
Go ahead and discuss.

599
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,551
I'll step aside.

600
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:38,770
Me too?

601
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:42,440
Okay.

602
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:44,025
All right.

603
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:54,160
Geez, why on earth did you bring that up?

604
00:32:54,243 --> 00:32:55,953
It's either you do or you die.

605
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:58,122
We can't win if we can't unite.

606
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:00,625
But it's too risky.

607
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:03,544
The two of us should've tracked down
the culprit first.

608
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,547
We needed to check the number
that sent the video to me.

609
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:11,219
Ms. Park, I'll handle it
on my own from now on.

610
00:33:11,302 --> 00:33:14,097
-Don't get involved anymore.
-Mr. Kang.

611
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,515
It's dangerous.

612
00:33:15,598 --> 00:33:19,143
The culprit did this to someone
who was a chief judge at the time.

613
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:21,771
And he probably didn't do it alone.

614
00:33:23,397 --> 00:33:25,900
But you are alone.

615
00:33:26,943 --> 00:33:28,152
You believed me.

616
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:29,862
That's enough for me.

617
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:33,199
Mr. Kang!

618
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:36,619
Okay.

619
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:39,413
Let's talk again later.

620
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,422
The use of sedative makes sense,
but it's still just a theory.

621
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:50,424
That's true.

622
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:52,510
But we can't be certain

623
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:55,388
that Mr. Kang accepted a bribe
based on that one video.

624
00:33:56,848 --> 00:33:59,767
There are strange circumstances
that Ms. Park found too.

625
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:09,527
We've decided to presume
you're innocent until proven guilty.

626
00:34:10,194 --> 00:34:11,028
Ms. Yoo.

627
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:13,698
If what you claim is true,

628
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:17,743
it means you're an innocent victim
who was unfairly framed.

629
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:21,831
As a pro bono attorney,
I can't ignore such a person.

630
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:28,045
-Ms. Yoo.
-Of course, I don't totally trust you.

631
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:29,797
Although I've decided to trust you,

632
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,050
I'll keep my eye on how things go.

633
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:35,136
Ms. Yoo.

634
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:39,098
I was a bit worked up before.

635
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm sorry.

636
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:44,520
But honestly,
I'm very disappointed in you, Mr. Kang.

637
00:34:45,104 --> 00:34:49,942
You kept saying we were a team,
but you didn't trust us at all.

638
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:55,448
I'm sorry.

639
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:57,575
I was a coward.

640
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,370
To be honest, I was afraid

641
00:35:01,954 --> 00:35:04,957
because I thought
none of you would believe me.

642
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:07,335
-Honestly, I didn't really trust you.
-What?

643
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,587
-Mr. Jang.
-Mr. Jang?

644
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,506
Every pro bono attorney
has their own reason

645
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:14,717
for choosing this job.

646
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,552
But for Mr. Kang,

647
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,554
I couldn't find his.

648
00:35:19,347 --> 00:35:22,892
"Why did he force himself
to take a job he didn't want to do?"

649
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:26,187
"There must be some other reason

650
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:29,523
for using this job as a stepping stone."

651
00:35:31,192 --> 00:35:35,112
Why didn't you ever ask me
why I took this job?

652
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:37,615
Does the intent really matter?

653
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,951
What?

654
00:35:40,034 --> 00:35:43,037
You don't need a license
to be a good person and do good things.

655
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:45,665
No matter what may be the case,

656
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:50,544
you've given it your best
and done well as a pro bono attorney.

657
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:53,714
It's okay to wait to see how someone acts
before you criticize them.

658
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:57,677
You don't know what their intentions are,
so what's the point of doubting them?

659
00:36:02,223 --> 00:36:03,391
-Mr. Jang…
-On top of that,

660
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:05,476
you're obviously not the type

661
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,729
to accept a bribe so openly.

662
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:10,147
-That's true.
-Yeah.

663
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:14,235
He'd cleverly cook up multiple ways
to get away with it before taking one.

664
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:16,487
Right? I knew I wasn't
the only one who thought so.

665
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,655
Yeah.

666
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:20,283
What…

667
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,662
What on earth
did you think of me all this time?

668
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:26,122
-A petty--
-Miser.

669
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:28,874
-A scrooge.
-An apple box…

670
00:36:30,418 --> 00:36:32,712
Forget about that.
Treat us to drinks tonight.

671
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:35,339
Let have the petty one buy us a drink.

672
00:36:35,423 --> 00:36:37,758
Okay, tonight's talk ends here.

673
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:40,219
When I say "Pro bono,"
you'll say "Let's go."

674
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:43,222
-Pro Bono!
-Let's go!

675
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:46,726
That didn't really feel…

676
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,978
Fine. Let's go.

677
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,731
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

678
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:03,868
-I'll go out to the scene of the incident.
-Okay. Good.

679
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,871
Are you going to check online, Mr. Jang?

680
00:37:09,957 --> 00:37:11,459
Mr. Kang.

681
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,169
-Yes?
-What are you looking at?

682
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:14,420
Well…

683
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:17,631
What are you doing? You're in the way.

684
00:37:22,136 --> 00:37:23,179
What?

685
00:37:23,262 --> 00:37:24,555
Why are you all so free?

686
00:37:24,638 --> 00:37:26,390
-What brings you here?
-What do you think?

687
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:29,101
-You got crushed at the first meeting?
-Geez.

688
00:37:29,977 --> 00:37:30,978
It wasn't that bad.

689
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:33,356
I barely appeased Ms. Cha
and got a second meeting.

690
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:35,858
It's at EK Entertainment this time.

691
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:38,027
You'll pitch against Baekseung.

692
00:37:38,694 --> 00:37:40,654
What? A pitch?

693
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,823
Come with me, everyone.

694
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,533
Now? Where to all of a sudden?

695
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:46,285
To get ready for battle.

696
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:52,833
I'll get going.

697
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:57,380
They look so expensive.

698
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:06,555
This kind of outfit
actually suits you, Ms. Park.

699
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,349
But Ms. Oh,

700
00:38:08,432 --> 00:38:10,351
the price isn't written here.

701
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:11,894
Don't worry about that.

702
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,730
How could I not worry?
You know how much my salary is.

703
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:18,984
Just win. If you lose,
that will be your severance pay.

704
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:20,945
Oh, my gosh. It's that expensive?

705
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:26,909
Ms. Park.

706
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:27,910
-How do I look?
-Move.

707
00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:34,583
This is a nice color.

708
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:36,836
Are you going to bring
all your team members?

709
00:38:38,504 --> 00:38:41,507
-What?
-The client's fussy about qualifications.

710
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,426
How about going
with just Ms. Park this time?

711
00:38:46,262 --> 00:38:48,180
They're my team.
They each have their own role.

712
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:49,682
Is that so?

713
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:51,392
Gosh, this…

714
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:52,643
-What?
-This looks cool.

715
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:54,103
How's this? How do I look?

716
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:56,522
-Is this over your card limit?
-No way.

717
00:38:57,064 --> 00:38:59,275
Excuse me. Please pay for all of them.

718
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:00,317
Yes, ma'am.

719
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:02,820
The CEO's company card.

720
00:39:03,696 --> 00:39:05,448
-Hold on.
-Yes?

721
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:11,328
Thank you for the other day with Dad.

722
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:14,123
Don't mention it.

723
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:17,793
Good luck.

724
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:19,962
Don't embarrass me.

725
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:29,138
So, what's your solution?

726
00:39:29,221 --> 00:39:30,514
We believe

727
00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:33,309
the best option is to fix things
as quickly as possible.

728
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:37,730
We'll meet with the girls' parents,
pay them an adequate settlement,

729
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:41,108
and get them to sign an NDA
and an agreement

730
00:39:41,192 --> 00:39:43,611
to not file any civil
or criminal lawsuits.

731
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:46,697
"The signatory will not file
any civil or criminal lawsuits

732
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,282
on this matter in the future."

733
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:49,700
It's neat and clean.

734
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:54,580
But aren't we giving
too much money for the settlement?

735
00:39:55,623 --> 00:39:58,334
Why do we have to pay them so much
for a broken camera?

736
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:02,087
You have to consider
the cost of Elijah's public image.

737
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:03,255
That's right, Ju-won.

738
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:06,091
It's about your sister.
We shouldn't save our pennies.

739
00:40:06,175 --> 00:40:07,676
Still…

740
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,179
Oh & Partners are a bit late.

741
00:40:28,864 --> 00:40:31,992
Why are they walking
in a flying V formation?

742
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:35,329
What on earth?

743
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:49,218
Are they the same team?

744
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:56,809
Where are they?

745
00:40:56,892 --> 00:40:57,726
I see them.

746
00:40:58,352 --> 00:40:59,353
Me too.

747
00:41:01,855 --> 00:41:04,441
Sorry, we're late. We're Team Pro Bono.

748
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:07,027
You're the same team from before?

749
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:09,697
Yes. We are, Elijah.

750
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,533
Were you on a makeover show or something?

751
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:15,119
For an attorney,

752
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,122
a suit is like armor.

753
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:19,582
Cool.

754
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,378
From now on,
we'll be protecting you, Elijah.

755
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:26,255
Just be on time.

756
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:33,095
I guess you were stunned
after I beat you. What was that?

757
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:35,097
A suit of armor?

758
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,141
Do you know each other? Same university?

759
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:41,729
He's a legendary figure.

760
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:44,231
He was appointed to court
with only a high school degree.

761
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:46,483
How amazing is that?

762
00:41:47,735 --> 00:41:48,736
You must be kidding.

763
00:41:51,614 --> 00:41:54,700
No, he's right.
I only have a high school diploma.

764
00:41:54,783 --> 00:41:57,202
I knew you didn't go to SNU, but…

765
00:41:58,871 --> 00:42:02,041
If the team leader didn't go to college,
what about the others?

766
00:42:02,124 --> 00:42:04,752
Ms. Park Gi-ppeum graduated
from SNU Law School.

767
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:06,629
And what about you?

768
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:10,257
Well, I…

769
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:13,135
You might not be familiar with it.

770
00:42:13,218 --> 00:42:14,053
It's far down…

771
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:15,721
in the south.

772
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:19,725
In the south. Isn't that amazing?

773
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:23,062
They ignore academic and work backgrounds.

774
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,567
Do you litigate with your college diploma?

775
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:30,319
Not at all.

776
00:42:30,402 --> 00:42:32,946
I go in fully prepared.

777
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,281
I see.

778
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:36,867
We have warned the parents already.

779
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:40,412
"If the video leaks, you'll face a lawsuit

780
00:42:40,496 --> 00:42:44,583
demanding a devastating amount of money
from Baekseung Law Firm."

781
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:45,709
So don't worry about it.

782
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,630
You're way too confident about this.

783
00:42:50,464 --> 00:42:52,800
-What?
-That kind of video

784
00:42:52,883 --> 00:42:55,260
is like a knife that could stab someone.

785
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:58,305
No matter what, once the knife is made,

786
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:00,724
it'll end up stabbing someone.

787
00:43:02,184 --> 00:43:03,268
Did something happen?

788
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:07,147
To prepare contingency plans,

789
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,816
our team has been monitoring

790
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:11,110
the changes in traffic of her fansite

791
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:12,945
and related pages in real time.

792
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:16,907
Mr. Jang here once made an app
for such things.

793
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:21,120
I just checked traffic on my way here,

794
00:43:21,787 --> 00:43:23,330
and on Cyber Crusader's channel,

795
00:43:23,914 --> 00:43:25,666
this video was uploaded.

796
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:27,751
What?

797
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:32,256
Hey, didn't you say
you took care of the parents?

798
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:35,092
I did, and I sufficiently warned them.
The situation--

799
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:38,220
Did you check the taxi driver's phone too?

800
00:43:38,303 --> 00:43:41,056
He shot it with the phone
one of the girls gave him.

801
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,182
Don't you get it?

802
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:46,520
The taxi driver took it
with his own phone and sent it.

803
00:43:48,397 --> 00:43:52,693
In K-pop idol fandom, there's something
called an "ST." You know that, right?

804
00:43:56,947 --> 00:43:58,115
An ST?

805
00:43:59,032 --> 00:44:01,076
It's short for "stalker taxi."

806
00:44:01,702 --> 00:44:04,580
These sasaeng fans, or obsessive fans,

807
00:44:04,663 --> 00:44:07,291
use these taxis to stalk celebrities.

808
00:44:07,374 --> 00:44:10,794
It means he wasn't just
a regular taxi driver.

809
00:44:10,878 --> 00:44:14,423
Do you think someone like that
would stay quiet after shooting a video

810
00:44:14,506 --> 00:44:16,133
that will make him a fortune?

811
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:22,264
I guess not enough research
was done on the client's industry.

812
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:26,518
Ms. Cha, you don't have to worry.

813
00:44:26,602 --> 00:44:28,020
We can handle this.

814
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:29,021
How?

815
00:44:29,104 --> 00:44:30,981
They said it's already been uploaded!

816
00:44:31,064 --> 00:44:34,443
We'll send a certified letter
in our firm's name to the channel owner.

817
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:36,653
"Take it down immediately,
or you'll be held liable."

818
00:44:36,737 --> 00:44:38,989
"Take the video down,
and let's meet to settle."

819
00:44:39,573 --> 00:44:40,783
I'll make sure to resolve it.

820
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:44,119
It's probably spread
all over the place by now!

821
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:46,747
You should admit your daughter
to a hospital for now.

822
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:47,664
What?

823
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,251
"Due to severe insomnia and anxiety
caused by exhaustion from her tour

824
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:54,630
and her new album preparation,
she wasn't thinking straight."

825
00:44:55,297 --> 00:44:57,549
"Her doctors ordered her to rest,
so she was admitted."

826
00:44:57,633 --> 00:45:00,302
"But there is no excuse
for committing a huge mistake

827
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:02,679
of treating her fans like this."

828
00:45:02,763 --> 00:45:06,558
"She deeply apologizes to everyone
who are disappointed."

829
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:07,476
And then,

830
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,813
she needs to cry cutely
at the right moment.

831
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:17,110
You want me to "cry cutely"?

832
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:23,200
My choice of words was a bit poor.
I apologize.

833
00:45:23,283 --> 00:45:26,495
The important thing is
we need to keep emotions out of this

834
00:45:26,578 --> 00:45:29,122
and give the public what they want

835
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:30,958
as quickly as possible.

836
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:35,420
Isn't it important
to set all the facts straight first?

837
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:39,174
What do you mean?

838
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:40,467
To see if anything was missed,

839
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,636
I went to the security office
of her apartment.

840
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:44,596
I watched
the surveillance footage all night.

841
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,808
It wasn't the girls' first time there.

842
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:52,813
Hey, when is she coming out?

843
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:56,066
-Elijah!
-Elijah!

844
00:45:56,149 --> 00:45:57,818
Come on. It's not her.

845
00:45:57,901 --> 00:45:59,444
-Shut up, bitch.
-Are you blind?

846
00:45:59,528 --> 00:46:00,696
You're here again?

847
00:46:00,779 --> 00:46:04,408
I warned you I'd call the cops next time.

848
00:46:04,491 --> 00:46:06,535
You'll call the cops on us?

849
00:46:06,618 --> 00:46:08,245
What? Who are you to say that, old lady?

850
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:10,497
Hey, she's the stylist
who stopped us before.

851
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:14,376
Right. I remember that fucking ugly face.

852
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:17,087
A mere stylist calling the cops on us?
What the hell?

853
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:19,881
Get lost, minion.

854
00:46:19,965 --> 00:46:21,341
You're hopeless.

855
00:46:21,425 --> 00:46:22,801
-Damn it.
-Damn it.

856
00:46:23,343 --> 00:46:25,470
You aren't her fans. This is a crime.

857
00:46:25,554 --> 00:46:28,432
-Move the fucking phone.
-Taking secret photos in vans.

858
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:29,850
-Stealing things.
-I said move it.

859
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:32,019
-You fucking bitch, seriously!
-Nice.

860
00:46:32,102 --> 00:46:33,103
-Kick her.
-Give it.

861
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:36,106
Ms. Cha.

862
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:41,528
You didn't mention anything about this.

863
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:45,991
This is what
the entertainment business is like.

864
00:46:46,074 --> 00:46:47,909
Public image is what matters.

865
00:46:47,993 --> 00:46:51,622
Even if we pick a fight and say
the high school students were wrong first,

866
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:53,248
we're the ones who take the hit.

867
00:46:54,124 --> 00:46:59,713
The best thing to do is
to settle the matter quickly and quietly.

868
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:06,053
I bet it is since it's more important
for you to cover up something else.

869
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,554
Elijah!

870
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:09,848
Cover up? What do you mean?

871
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,018
On the night I threw that camera,

872
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:15,187
-I wasn't coming down from my place.
-Are you nuts?

873
00:47:15,979 --> 00:47:17,230
Sit down. I'm an adult now.

874
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:19,232
Mr. Kim, sit down.

875
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:21,985
Elijah.

876
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:24,905
You'll know
when you check the phone video.

877
00:47:24,988 --> 00:47:26,615
I live in Building 101.

878
00:47:26,698 --> 00:47:29,076
But I came out
of Building 103's elevator that night

879
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:30,494
from my boyfriend's place.

880
00:47:33,246 --> 00:47:34,331
Hold on.

881
00:47:34,414 --> 00:47:37,042
This is a completely different situation.

882
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,795
If that news breaks
on top of everything else,

883
00:47:39,878 --> 00:47:42,923
this will seriously damage
the brand that is Elijah.

884
00:47:43,006 --> 00:47:45,300
She's a person, not a brand.

885
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:52,474
Before being a product,
she is a human being.

886
00:47:52,557 --> 00:47:54,518
An adult woman in her twenties.

887
00:47:57,229 --> 00:48:00,732
Her stylist is like a big sister,
and she's her best friend.

888
00:48:02,526 --> 00:48:03,819
She may have the face of a baby,

889
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:06,571
but she's a strong woman
who can't overlook injustice.

890
00:48:07,072 --> 00:48:09,991
She's someone
who went to Yeouido by herself,

891
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:13,328
wrapped in a scarf and with a candle,
because she just couldn't sit back.

892
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:14,871
That kind of person!

893
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:16,415
Jesus Christ.

894
00:48:16,498 --> 00:48:19,000
You want to put her in a hospital
for mental instability

895
00:48:19,793 --> 00:48:22,421
and make an apology video
with her crying cutely?

896
00:48:22,504 --> 00:48:24,423
You can't treat another person that way.

897
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:26,675
Why is she rampaging like this?

898
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:28,093
Just keep quiet.

899
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:32,264
Miss, by any chance,

900
00:48:33,098 --> 00:48:34,516
are you a Ponies member?

901
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:36,810
Yes.

902
00:48:37,477 --> 00:48:38,437
For three years.

903
00:48:41,648 --> 00:48:43,275
-"Ponies"?
-It's her fan club.

904
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:44,359
I see.

905
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:48,947
I've never told anyone about my stylist.

906
00:48:50,615 --> 00:48:51,825
Did you…

907
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:54,703
come to a fansign
after I put out my solo album?

908
00:48:54,786 --> 00:48:56,538
-"Fansign"?
-A meet-and-greet event.

909
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:01,835
You said you're pro bono attorneys?
That means public interest cases.

910
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,756
That's right.

911
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,592
You're the cowardly big sis, aren't you?

912
00:49:08,675 --> 00:49:10,051
-Cowardly?
-Cowardly?

913
00:49:10,135 --> 00:49:10,969
What?

914
00:49:11,052 --> 00:49:13,388
How do you know me?

915
00:49:22,189 --> 00:49:23,356
TO YOO NAN-HUI
BEST WISHES

916
00:49:25,317 --> 00:49:26,276
HUMAN RIGHTS ACT

917
00:49:29,863 --> 00:49:31,865
You want to be a pro bono attorney?

918
00:49:31,948 --> 00:49:32,866
Yes.

919
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:35,327
-That's incredible.
-Not at all.

920
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:38,747
Is there a special reason?

921
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:44,336
It's because I'm a coward.

922
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,254
-What?
-In seventh grade,

923
00:49:46,338 --> 00:49:48,215
I was bullied.

924
00:49:48,298 --> 00:49:49,925
You were bullied?

925
00:49:50,675 --> 00:49:51,635
Yes.

926
00:49:51,718 --> 00:49:55,764
I guess I was an easy target
because I was small and weak.

927
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:05,524
Bring all of them here next time.

928
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:06,983
I'll kill them all.

929
00:50:12,697 --> 00:50:13,824
It must've been really hard.

930
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:18,453
Yes.

931
00:50:24,918 --> 00:50:27,045
Actually, I…

932
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:30,048
People call me sensitive

933
00:50:30,131 --> 00:50:32,300
and say I make a big deal
out of everything.

934
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:34,761
Frankly, it's all because
I'm a big coward.

935
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:38,557
I'm sensitive to crimes
because I'm afraid of violence.

936
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,770
I'm sensitive to discrimination
because I hate rudeness and disrespect.

937
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:46,356
I'm really afraid of the world.

938
00:50:50,026 --> 00:50:52,112
That's why I want to be
a pro bono attorney.

939
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:54,489
I want to build a world…

940
00:50:55,907 --> 00:50:59,327
where even cowards like me
can live happily.

941
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,374
Hey, big sis.

942
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:06,793
You're really amazing.

943
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:08,795
No, I'm not.

944
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:11,464
You are.

945
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:19,472
You really remember me?

946
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:20,473
Of course!

947
00:51:20,557 --> 00:51:23,268
I remember all of you
because you give me so much love.

948
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:27,147
I'm nothing but one of the fans
who just passed by though.

949
00:51:27,939 --> 00:51:30,734
I told you back then
not to be afraid of anything.

950
00:51:30,817 --> 00:51:33,486
I promised I'd protect all the Ponies.

951
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:36,489
Big sis.

952
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:39,951
I missed you so much!

953
00:51:41,161 --> 00:51:43,288
-Big sis.
-Isn't Nan-hui the older one?

954
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:45,540
You're the big sister
if you're the cool one.

955
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:48,084
Well, this is a strange development.

956
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,712
This wasn't part of our plans.

957
00:51:50,795 --> 00:51:52,047
Can I give you a hug too?

958
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:54,215
Of course!

959
00:51:58,428 --> 00:52:02,057
Mr. Kang, didn't you say Nan-hui
could be the key to this case?

960
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:03,642
I did.

961
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:05,435
What are you doing? You're in the way.

962
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,654
Of course, she's on my team.

963
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:16,947
You're unbelievable, sir.

964
00:52:22,327 --> 00:52:23,286
Yoo Nan-hui.

965
00:52:24,788 --> 00:52:27,582
EASTERN DISTRICT COURT

966
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:29,751
CIVIL SUIT FOR DAMAGES

967
00:52:30,502 --> 00:52:33,213
-What is it?
-He looks familiar.

968
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:37,634
Defense counsel.

969
00:52:37,717 --> 00:52:40,178
If you have something to say,
please state your case.

970
00:52:41,012 --> 00:52:43,473
Yes, Your Honor.

971
00:52:43,556 --> 00:52:44,641
This trial

972
00:52:44,724 --> 00:52:47,936
is tyranny by powerful people
to infringe on the people's right to know

973
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:49,604
and their freedom of expression.

974
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:51,648
We ask that you dismiss
the plaintiff's claim.

975
00:52:51,731 --> 00:52:53,900
-Who are the powerful people?
-Who do you think?

976
00:52:54,818 --> 00:52:57,153
The star beloved by the people.

977
00:52:57,988 --> 00:53:00,490
If Elijah's not the powerful person,
who else would it be?

978
00:53:00,573 --> 00:53:04,911
Is it fun to appoint
a former chief judge as an attorney

979
00:53:04,995 --> 00:53:07,539
and oppress a mere YouTube creator?

980
00:53:08,373 --> 00:53:09,582
A hundred million for damages?

981
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:14,129
This is violence to silence the public.

982
00:53:14,212 --> 00:53:16,423
That's right!
One hundred million won is no joke!

983
00:53:16,506 --> 00:53:17,632
Please lower your voice.

984
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:19,968
You are here before the court.

985
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:23,346
Yes, this is the court of truth.

986
00:53:25,056 --> 00:53:27,475
I, Ma Yeong-suk the Cyber Crusader,

987
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:32,772
am ready to be martyred
at any moment for the truth.

988
00:53:34,649 --> 00:53:38,069
Truth? Is this the truth
you're talking about?

989
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:41,489
Breaking news, everyone!

990
00:53:41,573 --> 00:53:45,785
The Cyber Crusader's got
the biggest scoop for you today.

991
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:50,582
Have you all seen that real video
of Elijah uploaded last week?

992
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:54,210
Korea's sweetheart
can curse pretty viciously, can't she?

993
00:53:54,294 --> 00:53:56,838
Do you know when the video was shot?

994
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,883
It was three in the morning.

995
00:53:59,966 --> 00:54:01,468
And at that time,

996
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:05,764
where was Korea's innocent sweetheart
coming down from?

997
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:08,433
None other than his house.

998
00:54:08,516 --> 00:54:10,727
Ta-da! You know him, right?

999
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:14,814
What did our Elijah do in her rapper
boyfriend's house until 3:00 a.m.?

1000
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,274
Did she get a rap lesson?

1001
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:18,359
Or was it a different kind of lesson?

1002
00:54:18,443 --> 00:54:19,903
My goodness.

1003
00:54:19,986 --> 00:54:22,530
It's so dirty, I can't watch.

1004
00:54:22,614 --> 00:54:24,282
Is this the truth you were talking about?

1005
00:54:25,158 --> 00:54:26,409
Prying into one's privacy?

1006
00:54:26,493 --> 00:54:28,411
She's a public figure,
so she should bear it.

1007
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:31,498
Did someone force her
at knifepoint to be a celebrity?

1008
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,585
If she doesn't want the attention,
she should live quietly as a civilian.

1009
00:54:35,668 --> 00:54:38,671
What is the meaning of "public figure"?

1010
00:54:39,297 --> 00:54:41,508
Of course, a public figure is…

1011
00:54:42,092 --> 00:54:45,136
According to
the Standard Korean Language Dictionary,

1012
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,305
it means "a person engaged
in public service."

1013
00:54:47,388 --> 00:54:50,058
But celebrities make money
from popularity with the public--

1014
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:53,561
So if one earns money from the public,
they're public figures?

1015
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:56,439
The lady selling sundae-guk out front
must be a public figure too.

1016
00:54:56,523 --> 00:55:00,485
She makes a fortune every day
from hundreds of people.

1017
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:03,738
How can you compare
some mom-and-pop store to her?

1018
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:05,865
Is scale the issue now?

1019
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:08,660
What about the CEO who makes money
by selling phones to everyone?

1020
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:11,538
What about the CEOs who make money
selling clothes or cosmetics?

1021
00:55:11,621 --> 00:55:14,916
Thanks to popularity with the public,
they make tons of money.

1022
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:16,835
They must be public figures too then?

1023
00:55:16,918 --> 00:55:19,796
But why aren't you
digging through their private lives

1024
00:55:19,879 --> 00:55:21,172
or leaving nasty comments?

1025
00:55:22,298 --> 00:55:24,634
You're afraid
their legal teams will sue you

1026
00:55:24,717 --> 00:55:25,844
for huge financial payments.

1027
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:27,428
They're not as weak as celebrities.

1028
00:55:27,512 --> 00:55:28,388
Am I wrong?

1029
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:30,598
What are you doing, Counsel?

1030
00:55:30,682 --> 00:55:33,059
Are you saying stars
are the same as ordinary people?

1031
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:35,019
A celebrity's every move is always--

1032
00:55:35,103 --> 00:55:38,523
You're right.
They receive everyone's attention.

1033
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:41,317
It's true their jobs
have a big influence on society.

1034
00:55:41,943 --> 00:55:45,071
That's why they're more careful
not to be a bad influence.

1035
00:55:45,155 --> 00:55:48,116
And since they're beloved,
when they do wrong,

1036
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:49,701
they endure heavy criticism.

1037
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:54,747
Still, they're not obligated
to endure such malicious twisting of facts

1038
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:56,499
and groundless humiliation.

1039
00:55:56,583 --> 00:56:01,671
Before Elijah is a star,
she's a human being with rights.

1040
00:56:01,754 --> 00:56:04,007
Yes, she's a person.

1041
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,885
A person who does things like this
to young high school girls.

1042
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:09,137
The public is entitled to know.

1043
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:12,640
Enough is enough, you crazy bitches!

1044
00:56:14,642 --> 00:56:17,312
Get lost. I said fuck off!

1045
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,148
Yeah, that is her.

1046
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:28,031
Yes, the public is entitled to know.

1047
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:31,451
You're hopeless.

1048
00:56:31,534 --> 00:56:33,745
You aren't her fans. This is a crime.

1049
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:36,664
-Move the fucking phone.
-Taking secret photos in vans.

1050
00:56:36,748 --> 00:56:37,665
Stealing things.

1051
00:56:41,085 --> 00:56:43,880
Well, what do you say?

1052
00:56:43,963 --> 00:56:47,258
I don't think you can find words
that better describe the situation

1053
00:56:47,342 --> 00:56:50,428
than the ones Elijah used earlier.

1054
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:53,223
"Enough is enough, you crazy bitches!"

1055
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:56,726
-What?
-Ms. Park.

1056
00:56:56,809 --> 00:56:58,269
Plaintiff's counsel! What are you…

1057
00:56:58,353 --> 00:57:00,021
It was a quote.

1058
00:57:00,104 --> 00:57:01,314
Yes.

1059
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:04,692
Please don't be upset.

1060
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:09,113
Are you looking down on the public?

1061
00:57:09,197 --> 00:57:13,159
The public is enraged
by her despicable hypocrisy.

1062
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:16,496
-Sit down.
-She always says she loves her fans.

1063
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:18,831
And this is how she repays her fans' love?

1064
00:57:18,915 --> 00:57:21,626
They're not fans. They are criminals.

1065
00:57:21,709 --> 00:57:22,669
They're still minors,

1066
00:57:22,752 --> 00:57:24,963
but we'll hold their parents
legally responsible.

1067
00:57:25,547 --> 00:57:28,383
But the public is condemning Elijah--

1068
00:57:28,466 --> 00:57:32,011
You keep saying "the public."

1069
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:33,930
Who is that really?

1070
00:57:34,013 --> 00:57:36,224
The public is the public.

1071
00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:37,809
Numerous people.

1072
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:40,228
How many people does it take?
Is there a number?

1073
00:57:40,311 --> 00:57:42,146
The public is
an unspecified number of people.

1074
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,357
Are you going to
keep quibbling over words?

1075
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,402
When you go
to any major entertainment site,

1076
00:57:47,485 --> 00:57:49,529
hundreds of people are commenting on them.

1077
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:54,325
The public is made up of many people
who make up the majority of society.

1078
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:58,121
Your Honor, may I ask a question?

1079
00:57:59,163 --> 00:58:00,415
Thank you.

1080
00:58:01,082 --> 00:58:03,543
Out of everyone here in court,

1081
00:58:04,168 --> 00:58:06,337
is there anyone
who has ever left a comment

1082
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:07,880
on a celebrity news article?

1083
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:09,048
Could you raise your hands?

1084
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:10,341
-Not me.
-Me neither.

1085
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,177
No one.

1086
00:58:13,803 --> 00:58:16,472
Your Honor,
have you ever left a comment before?

1087
00:58:16,556 --> 00:58:17,599
That's enough, Counsel.

1088
00:58:17,682 --> 00:58:20,018
You haven't. I understand.

1089
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:23,521
That is so strange.

1090
00:58:23,605 --> 00:58:27,233
Of the many people who make up
the majority of society,

1091
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:29,986
why isn't a single one here?

1092
00:58:30,653 --> 00:58:33,990
Still, have you seen the comments?
Have you read what they say?

1093
00:58:34,073 --> 00:58:35,742
Yes. Comments like these, right?

1094
00:58:39,287 --> 00:58:40,204
Goodness.

1095
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,750
"Didn't she fix her whole face?"

1096
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,293
"How blessed she is."

1097
00:58:45,376 --> 00:58:47,837
"The blessing of Korean doctors."

1098
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,006
She's the most overrated these days.

1099
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:52,383
She pretended to be pretty and kind.

1100
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:54,427
Admit you got plastic surgery first.

1101
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,847
"Did she make all those donations
to evade taxes?"

1102
00:58:59,641 --> 00:59:03,728
I wonder how many people there are

1103
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:06,022
who leave comments like these.

1104
00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:10,318
Are they really the only ones
who make up the public?

1105
00:59:10,943 --> 00:59:14,405
There are people
who don't even know Elijah at all.

1106
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:17,450
There are those
who love her music quietly.

1107
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:21,204
There are many
who frown upon comments like these.

1108
00:59:21,704 --> 00:59:26,542
Ms. Ma, did you at least take
a public survey from every citizen?

1109
00:59:26,626 --> 00:59:28,461
On what premises

1110
00:59:28,544 --> 00:59:30,963
do you dare to represent
the public's opinion?

1111
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:32,423
-That's--
-Don't.

1112
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:42,517
Your Honor, may I ask our team's Ms. Yoo
to make arguments from now on?

1113
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,102
Yes, you may proceed.

1114
00:59:46,187 --> 00:59:47,355
Ms. Yoo.

1115
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,524
Yes, sir.

1116
00:59:57,573 --> 00:59:59,659
I've always been curious.

1117
01:00:00,326 --> 01:00:02,495
Those persistent comments online.

1118
01:00:02,578 --> 01:00:05,540
How many people are actually behind them?

1119
01:00:05,623 --> 01:00:10,128
Are we mistaking an anonymous minority
for the unspecified majority?

1120
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:12,046
So, we've verified it

1121
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:15,550
with the help of our colleague
with exceptional IT skills.

1122
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:21,097
We've marked the IP addresses

1123
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,308
of those who wrote
these anonymous posts and comments

1124
01:00:24,392 --> 01:00:26,769
with cute animal icons.

1125
01:00:27,437 --> 01:00:28,479
Like this.

1126
01:00:34,736 --> 01:00:35,737
Why are they the same?

1127
01:00:36,362 --> 01:00:38,573
-It's a rat.
-Did one person write them all?

1128
01:00:38,656 --> 01:00:40,992
Do you see these mice icons?

1129
01:00:41,743 --> 01:00:42,910
Isn't it shocking?

1130
01:00:42,994 --> 01:00:45,329
Out of 250 comments,

1131
01:00:45,413 --> 01:00:47,957
the same person wrote 168 of them.

1132
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,169
Moreover, this same person
is the one who made the post.

1133
01:00:53,129 --> 01:00:55,965
So, we tracked the address just in case,
and to our surprise…

1134
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,430
it was the same IP address
as the Cyber Crusader's channel.

1135
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:07,185
They were totally made up.

1136
01:01:07,268 --> 01:01:10,354
You're so diligent. I'll give you that.

1137
01:01:11,314 --> 01:01:13,149
You wrote a lot of posts too.

1138
01:01:13,232 --> 01:01:15,401
Your writing skills were superb.
For example…

1139
01:01:18,571 --> 01:01:20,865
"Am I the only one
who thinks Ma Yeong-suk is pretty?"

1140
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:23,493
"I think she's so pretty too."

1141
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:26,329
"Yeah, she is so stylish
and sophisticated."

1142
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:29,373
"Honestly, aside from age, Ma Yeong-suk…"

1143
01:01:29,457 --> 01:01:31,417
-"is better than Elijah."
-She must be crazy.

1144
01:01:36,631 --> 01:01:37,757
They're all fabricated.

1145
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,091
She did that all by herself?

1146
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:41,385
-Has she nothing else to do?
-That is so embarrassing.

1147
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:43,387
-Seriously.
-That's so…

1148
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:44,764
What an intense life you have.

1149
01:01:48,226 --> 01:01:52,355
Your Honor, when people see
celebrities like Elijah,

1150
01:01:52,438 --> 01:01:54,357
they scream their names and envy them.

1151
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,235
But they're actually lonelier
and weaker than anyone else.

1152
01:01:59,195 --> 01:02:01,739
Even as they bleed
from the dagger-like words of people

1153
01:02:01,823 --> 01:02:03,366
who speak recklessly about others,

1154
01:02:03,449 --> 01:02:06,327
it's not easy for them
to say that it hurts.

1155
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:09,413
Think about it.

1156
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:13,543
How many times have we lost

1157
01:02:14,836 --> 01:02:16,712
those lonely and vulnerable stars

1158
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:20,424
that shined…

1159
01:02:22,593 --> 01:02:24,554
so brightly?

1160
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:32,144
Does the price for popularity
have to be that cruel?

1161
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:40,945
Ms. Ma.

1162
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:44,407
You must take responsibility now

1163
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:47,493
for that persistent spite
and obsession of yours.

1164
01:02:49,704 --> 01:02:51,831
What did I do that was so wrong?

1165
01:02:52,456 --> 01:02:53,416
What?

1166
01:02:53,499 --> 01:02:56,127
I only fought
for the public's right to know!

1167
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,713
At least, I don't hide in the shadows
like a coward!

1168
01:03:00,756 --> 01:03:04,427
My client is not a coward
who hides in the shadows.

1169
01:03:06,804 --> 01:03:08,222
Please come in.

1170
01:03:13,311 --> 01:03:14,186
Oh, my gosh!

1171
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,187
-It's Elijah!
-Elijah!

1172
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:19,692
Order in the court!

1173
01:03:19,775 --> 01:03:22,486
-Bailiff.
-Order in the court!

1174
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:25,907
Is the plaintiff
attending the trial in person?

1175
01:03:29,201 --> 01:03:31,829
Yes, Your Honor.
My apologies for being late.

1176
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:40,671
Your Honor, the plaintiff would like
to share something.

1177
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:43,299
May she have a chance to speak?

1178
01:03:43,925 --> 01:03:45,176
You may proceed.

1179
01:03:56,312 --> 01:04:00,358
First off, I apologize to everyone
who was disappointed in me

1180
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:01,442
because of this incident.

1181
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:10,576
No matter what the reason was,

1182
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,913
it was my fault for cursing
and throwing stuff

1183
01:04:14,747 --> 01:04:16,040
at the young students.

1184
01:04:16,123 --> 01:04:18,542
I will compensate them for all damages

1185
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:19,835
and apologize to them.

1186
01:04:20,628 --> 01:04:23,631
I will become a more mature person
so that I won't let down

1187
01:04:24,548 --> 01:04:26,342
those who support and love me.

1188
01:04:34,433 --> 01:04:35,476
But here…

1189
01:04:41,315 --> 01:04:43,067
I'll call her the defendant.

1190
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:46,195
I have something to say to the defendant.

1191
01:04:46,278 --> 01:04:47,113
Okay.

1192
01:04:51,993 --> 01:04:53,327
I am standing

1193
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:55,663
right in front of you.

1194
01:04:56,789 --> 01:04:58,499
Look me in the eyes,

1195
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:01,502
and do it.

1196
01:05:02,044 --> 01:05:02,878
Do what?

1197
01:05:03,879 --> 01:05:05,715
All those things

1198
01:05:05,798 --> 01:05:07,800
you have said about me.

1199
01:05:09,969 --> 01:05:11,387
The lies.

1200
01:05:14,223 --> 01:05:15,641
Those filthy words.

1201
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:19,812
Those words didn't hurt just me.

1202
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:24,275
They hurt my fans,

1203
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,528
who I love more than anyone else.

1204
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:37,997
Elijah! I'm a fan
who supports you from Japan.

1205
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,293
I'm working on my own dreams
as I listen to your music.

1206
01:05:42,376 --> 01:05:45,337
So, please stay strong!

1207
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:49,550
There are many more fans who love you,
so don't worry and trust in us.

1208
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:52,178
Elijah, I love you. Stay strong.

1209
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:54,764
I'll protect you. Good luck.

1210
01:05:54,847 --> 01:05:58,225
When I was at my lowest,
your songs cheered me up.

1211
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:59,602
-I love Elijah.
-I love you.

1212
01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:01,437
-Let's go!
-Stay strong!

1213
01:06:02,146 --> 01:06:05,024
-We'll protect you, Elijah!
-Ponies are always by your side!

1214
01:06:05,107 --> 01:06:06,150
Hang in there!

1215
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:09,070
We love you, Elijah!

1216
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:10,362
Go, Elijah!

1217
01:06:10,446 --> 01:06:12,031
-Elijah, let's go!
-We love you!

1218
01:06:12,114 --> 01:06:14,492
-Hang in there!
-We love you! Stay strong!

1219
01:06:22,249 --> 01:06:25,711
Okay, then. Say it to my face now.

1220
01:06:29,548 --> 01:06:31,425
Those awful words that hurt

1221
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:33,511
the ones who love my music quietly

1222
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:37,765
and the ones who trust and love me.

1223
01:06:37,848 --> 01:06:40,976
Look me in the eyes and say them

1224
01:06:43,145 --> 01:06:47,316
instead of cowardly hiding
behind the mask you call "the public."

1225
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,244
Gosh, Elijah is so tough.

1226
01:06:59,245 --> 01:07:02,540
This is why I can't stop loving her.

1227
01:07:05,709 --> 01:07:07,211
Your eyes are boring through her.

1228
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,273
EASTERN DISTRICT COURT

1229
01:07:27,356 --> 01:07:28,190
Judge Kang.

1230
01:07:30,192 --> 01:07:32,820
I mean, Attorney Kang.

1231
01:07:32,903 --> 01:07:33,779
What is it?

1232
01:07:35,656 --> 01:07:37,616
Are you really going to
see this to the end?

1233
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,244
We'll stop now
if you pay the 100 million at once.

1234
01:07:41,036 --> 01:07:42,371
Let's stop here.

1235
01:07:42,454 --> 01:07:44,999
It won't benefit either side to continue.

1236
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:46,792
I don't think so.

1237
01:07:46,876 --> 01:07:48,544
We'll have many benefits.

1238
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:51,714
We were thinking

1239
01:07:51,797 --> 01:07:56,010
of taking all the cases from every star
who's been harassed by the defendant.

1240
01:07:59,597 --> 01:08:00,681
Do you know

1241
01:08:00,764 --> 01:08:03,934
who informed us about Elijah's boyfriend?

1242
01:08:06,061 --> 01:08:06,896
Do you?

1243
01:08:07,688 --> 01:08:11,442
Who is this person
that you're taking so long to reveal?

1244
01:08:15,779 --> 01:08:16,614
There she comes.

1245
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,824
It's her.

1246
01:08:21,952 --> 01:08:23,037
Ms. Cha Jin-hui.

1247
01:08:23,913 --> 01:08:25,331
Pick whichever one you need.

1248
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:27,958
Elijah!

1249
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:30,920
My goodness, congratulations!

1250
01:08:33,088 --> 01:08:36,842
-Congratulations!
-Elijah's mother tipped us off herself.

1251
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,761
Do you know that?

1252
01:08:39,762 --> 01:08:44,058
I had been so angry
because of Ma Yeong-suk.

1253
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:46,936
How did you make time?

1254
01:08:47,937 --> 01:08:49,730
Well, I just had to come, of course.

1255
01:08:56,362 --> 01:08:58,155
STAY TUNED TO WATCH THE EPILOGUE

1256
01:09:16,257 --> 01:09:17,341
But they're family.

1257
01:09:17,424 --> 01:09:19,134
How could a parent
do that to her child?

1258
01:09:19,218 --> 01:09:21,262
Drive those losers away, okay?

1259
01:09:21,345 --> 01:09:22,972
Elijah, what brings you here?

1260
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:25,140
I want to end the exclusive contract
with my company.

1261
01:09:25,224 --> 01:09:26,225
Please file a lawsuit.

1262
01:09:26,308 --> 01:09:27,851
What have I done that was so wrong?

1263
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,437
I've only done my best for my daughter.

1264
01:09:30,521 --> 01:09:32,815
We tracked it down,
and it was a life insurance plan.

1265
01:09:32,898 --> 01:09:34,191
A life insurance for Elijah.

1266
01:09:34,275 --> 01:09:36,485
Wasn't the failed investment
due to accounting fraud?

1267
01:09:36,568 --> 01:09:38,445
No! Those were all fabricated!

1268
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:39,947
Exemption of Crimes by Family.

1269
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:43,575
Property crimes committed
within family cannot be punished.

1270
01:09:43,659 --> 01:09:45,160
Just please sue me.

1271
01:09:45,244 --> 01:09:47,288
Elijah. Is this what you wanted?

1272
01:09:47,371 --> 01:09:49,164
Stop that lawsuit at once.

1273
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:50,207
And break up the team.

1274
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:53,168
Mr. Kang. We have to do something.

1275
01:09:53,252 --> 01:09:54,378
Let's go.

1276
01:09:54,461 --> 01:09:55,921
The biggest stage would be…

1277
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,506
Let's go to the National Assembly.

1278
01:10:00,592 --> 01:10:01,677
Mr. Kang…

1279
01:10:03,554 --> 01:10:04,847
Park Gi-ppeum.

1280
01:10:07,057 --> 01:10:08,851
How can you do this to me?

1281
01:10:11,186 --> 01:10:13,439
Of all people,
you should've trusted me.

1282
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:17,401
You didn't trust me,

1283
01:10:18,068 --> 01:10:19,194
so it made me upset.

1284
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:24,575
I'm sad.

1285
01:10:26,577 --> 01:10:27,703
Oh, my gosh!

1286
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:29,330
-Nurse! He's…
-Yes.

1287
01:10:29,413 --> 01:10:31,290
The anesthesia hasn't worn off yet.

1288
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:34,126
Is that so?

1289
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,380
I'm so upset.

1290
01:10:38,464 --> 01:10:39,882
I'm hurt.

1291
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:42,843
I'm so hurt.

1292
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:46,013
You hurt my feelings.

1293
01:10:47,514 --> 01:10:48,557
I feel so sad.

1294
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,482
