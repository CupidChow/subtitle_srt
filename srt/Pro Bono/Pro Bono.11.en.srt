1
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:36,099
PRO BONO

2
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,481
Mr. Kang.

3
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:46,192
The Court will consider this
a confession of your crime,

4
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,945
and you manipulated the trial
out of personal resentment.

5
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:50,572
-Your Honor…
-No.

6
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,201
To be exact,

7
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:59,414
the defendant only testified how he felt

8
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:01,457
when he was assigned
to the case, Your Honor.

9
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:05,795
Ms. Park.

10
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,341
Who are you representing?
The plaintiff or the defendant?

11
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:12,802
Of course, I represent the plaintiff,
Your Honor.

12
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:14,345
But I just want…

13
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:19,809
to take it step by step
to prove the crime.

14
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:22,979
May I continue, Your Honor?

15
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:28,943
Proceed.

16
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:35,283
Mr. Kang,

17
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,660
you just admitted

18
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:41,789
you harbored a desire for revenge
against Mr. Yoo Baek-man.

19
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, I did.

20
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,418
That desire for revenge…

21
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:48,296
Did that influence your trial?

22
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:57,889
Mr. Kang?

23
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:00,642
Answer the question.

24
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:08,942
Actually, I don't know.

25
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:18,326
Order in the court.

26
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:22,330
Mr. Kang, please answer
the question properly.

27
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:25,792
For a very long time,

28
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:29,629
I thought about it over and over again.

29
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:34,217
Did my desire for revenge
affect the trial?

30
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,929
I had believed it didn't,

31
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:40,890
but is it really true?

32
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:45,103
Can a person really separate
their feelings and be objective?

33
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:50,900
That's why judges can recuse themselves
if there is concern

34
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:54,278
that they might conduct an unfair trial.

35
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,157
But I did not do that.

36
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,577
That alone is a dereliction of duty.

37
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:06,624
I am guilty of it.

38
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,336
But the charge against you isn't that.

39
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:14,048
It's abuse of authority
to manipulate a trial.

40
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:17,885
Mr. Kang, let me ask you again.

41
00:03:19,303 --> 00:03:20,972
Did you manipulate the trial?

42
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:43,703
No.

43
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:53,629
You just said

44
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:56,090
you wanted to get revenge
against Yoo Baek-man.

45
00:03:56,716 --> 00:04:00,261
And you thought it was God's will
when the case was assigned to you.

46
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:04,640
But are you saying
you did not manipulate the trial?

47
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,982
If you're asking about the crime
I committed in my mind… Yes, I'm guilty.

48
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:17,737
When the trial began,
I was willing to do whatever it took.

49
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,698
I was prepared to do everything
in my power to get my revenge.

50
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:21,824
However,

51
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:25,620
there was someone who stopped me.

52
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:30,541
Then, we will close the arguments.

53
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,920
The verdict will be delivered
at 10:00 a.m. on May 23…

54
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:41,135
It was…

55
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:47,767
the plaintiff's mother.

56
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,769
Shut up, you scum…

57
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:51,437
Baillif!

58
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:53,773
Calm down.

59
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:59,654
The hearing will take place
in this court at 10:00 a.m.

60
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,907
All rise.

61
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:05,910
Your Honor.

62
00:05:06,494 --> 00:05:08,830
Please spare my husband.

63
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:15,002
I'm begging you. Please spare him.

64
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,506
Please.

65
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:24,929
At that moment, I realized.

66
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:32,145
The one with power
that she feared the most was me.

67
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,941
I realized I had become just like
the people I hated and despised.

68
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,485
If I didn't stop there,

69
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:45,408
I would make others
suffer just the way I did.

70
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,368
So, I…

71
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:50,496
-You…
-Calm down, Mr. Yoo!

72
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,415
-Let go!
-Remove him from the courtroom.

73
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,168
Let go of me!

74
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:56,794
You can't fool me!

75
00:05:56,878 --> 00:06:00,131
Wait! Get over here!

76
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:03,634
All right, order in the court.

77
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:07,263
We will continue this trial

78
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:10,141
and set a date at a later time.

79
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:23,863
EPISODE 11

80
00:06:23,946 --> 00:06:26,199
What on earth are you doing?

81
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,328
Are we representing Kang Da-wit?
He almost confessed,

82
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,581
but you allowed him
to make a ridiculous excuse!

83
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:35,833
You thought it was ridiculous?

84
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,669
-What?
-For the first time,

85
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:42,465
it felt like I saw
Kang Da-wit's true side.

86
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,510
It surprised me a little.

87
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:51,182
I realized he was capable
of being sincere too.

88
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:55,811
There was someone who stopped me.

89
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:59,190
It was the plaintiff's mother.

90
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:02,944
"Stopped me…"

91
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,572
What did you think, Mr. Jang?

92
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:09,700
-It felt like a confession.
-A confession?

93
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:13,955
It seemed like
he was letting go of a burden

94
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:17,750
he'd been carrying in his heart
for a very long time.

95
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:26,384
Are you crazy?

96
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:29,512
"Yes, it was my desire for revenge"?

97
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,305
I'm your attorney, Da-wit.

98
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,766
What are you doing
without consulting your attorney?

99
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:36,352
Jung-in.

100
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:42,358
You know better than anyone
that a trial is a game.

101
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,861
And the ones who win are the smart ones.
But why are you acting like a fool?

102
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,990
What, do you feel bad
about wanting to get revenge?

103
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:53,077
Or did you actually do something bad?

104
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:57,957
No.

105
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,335
It doesn't matter
whether you did or not.

106
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,380
Don't do anything risky anymore.

107
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:08,843
Stop acting like a fool.

108
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:14,640
"No one can be a judge
in their own case."

109
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:18,060
That's what they say.

110
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:20,479
What?

111
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,901
Nothing.

112
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:30,323
JI DONG-CHEOL

113
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,451
Just a second.

114
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:41,667
-Hey, go ahead.
-Just as you had predicted,

115
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,669
Justice Shin acted quickly out of fear.

116
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:45,921
So? Who did he meet with?

117
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,632
The person he met with was…

118
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,399
You're withdrawing?

119
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:06,859
Yes.

120
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:08,986
What's the reason?

121
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,948
I'll do my best to find out the truth
about your father's case.

122
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,117
Then why?

123
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:19,664
What are you going to do if that truth
isn't something you had hoped for?

124
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:27,129
An attorney has to work
for the benefit of their client.

125
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:29,465
I see.

126
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:34,345
You're saying you want to work
for the truth, not my benefit.

127
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:35,680
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:37,014
If you want,

129
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:38,474
we can change his charge

130
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:41,394
to dereliction of duty,
which he admitted to.

131
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:45,481
For not recusing himself from the trial?

132
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:49,193
Are you telling me
to just settle for that?

133
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:51,987
Ten years.

134
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:56,992
For ten years, I've dreamed
of getting revenge on Kang Da-wit.

135
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:00,037
Mr. Yoo.

136
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:02,373
What I want is the truth too.

137
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:07,294
The truth that will take off the mask
worn by that shameless hypocrite.

138
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:12,591
Ms. Park.

139
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,010
Find it.

140
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:17,138
Whatever it may be…

141
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:21,392
find the truth.

142
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:25,646
Why me?

143
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:32,111
Why did you choose me…

144
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,406
to find that truth?

145
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:41,120
Because it would hurt him the most?

146
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:06,645
So?

147
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:11,066
-You want to start over from square one?
-Yeah.

148
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,617
We were only supposed to file
a lawsuit on Yoo Jae-beom's behalf

149
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,036
with evidence he had collected
over the past ten years.

150
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,790
He said he wants the truth too.

151
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:31,795
Truth, my foot.

152
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:36,550
You're all just siding with Kang Da-wit.

153
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,010
Are we his attorneys?

154
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:41,263
I get it now.
Just because we worked together for a bit,

155
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,765
you're trying to be loyal now?

156
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:45,184
-Jun-u.
-Tell me! What?

157
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:51,857
Doesn't it make you angry?

158
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:53,734
Yeong-sil, I…

159
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:55,861
I really liked him.

160
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:58,614
I wanted to be like him.

161
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,991
I trusted and followed everything he did.

162
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:02,076
Elijah's case?

163
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,329
I was against it but followed in the end
because it was his decision!

164
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:06,622
Jun-u.

165
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:08,207
But what is this?

166
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,459
The desire for revenge?

167
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:12,086
A manipulated trial?

168
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:15,005
He made fools out of us.

169
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:17,883
A judge shouldn't do that!

170
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,843
An attorney shouldn't do this either!

171
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,722
Why are you jumping to conclusions?

172
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,601
Does admitting to wanting revenge mean
admitting to manipulating the trial?

173
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:28,811
No, it isn't.

174
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:32,523
Everyone has the freedom to think.

175
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,944
The crime he committed in his mind
isn't a crime in court.

176
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:40,614
Our job is to find out if he took action
to commit a crime, isn't it?

177
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,828
She's right.

178
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,627
She's right, Jun-u.

179
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:06,307
Okay.

180
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,185
What is it you want to revisit?

181
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:14,773
A person.

182
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:17,109
A person?

183
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:20,404
The most crucial person in the case

184
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:22,656
that we haven't met yet.

185
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:32,166
Whenever I think of Min-seok,

186
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,211
my heart still breaks.

187
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:43,010
Imagine how hot it must have been
in that pit of fire.

188
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:51,477
His hands and feet were broken.

189
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:54,772
He must have struggled so much to get out.

190
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:01,070
How shameless am I

191
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,324
to keep living after my child has died?

192
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:19,672
I heard you sued the judge from that case.

193
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,967
No, you can't do that.
You'll be punished by the heavens.

194
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:28,097
When everyone, including the police
and prosecutor, listened to Yoo,

195
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,392
he was the only one who listened to me.

196
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:35,396
He believed in that photo
of Min-seok's cup noodles too.

197
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:36,438
Sorry?

198
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:39,108
That photo is real then?

199
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:40,275
Yes.

200
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:44,071
Min-seok said he'd be working late
and packed the cup noodles.

201
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:46,865
I told them all about it
from the beginning,

202
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:48,993
but none of it was recorded
in the documents.

203
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:52,246
Gosh, those bastards.

204
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,623
They were either indifferent

205
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,750
or were bribed by Yoo.

206
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:01,171
I see.

207
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:08,303
Ma'am, was Min-seok paid properly
when he worked at the factory?

208
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:10,014
His wages?

209
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:11,724
Yoo, that bastard.

210
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:14,685
He used technical high school students
to save money.

211
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:16,311
He only gave a small sum,

212
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:18,647
saying they were getting
practical training.

213
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,108
Really? I can't believe it.

214
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:23,527
One day,

215
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,282
when Min-seok brought home
a few leftover sheets of paper,

216
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:30,409
he accused him of stealing

217
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:34,246
and went ballistic over it.

218
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,499
He blamed Min-seok
for everything that had been missing

219
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:39,918
and told him to work it off,

220
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:44,006
so he was working for free.

221
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,926
For free? My goodness, that thief.

222
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:54,183
Papers… That means…

223
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,351
Gi-ppeum.

224
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:58,020
Yeah.

225
00:15:58,896 --> 00:15:59,897
That's right.

226
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:15,579
BURNT CUP NOODLE SHOWS
WORKING CONDITIONS

227
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:17,414
It was all true.

228
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,083
The cup noodles.

229
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,959
And the security screening area.

230
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:24,004
Yeah. At the very least,
Mr. Kang didn't tamper with the facts.

231
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:27,132
It was only for the media anyway.

232
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:29,843
What on earth do the cup noodles
and security screening area

233
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:31,386
have to do with the fire?

234
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,307
When a judge relentlessly attacks
a defendant's morals

235
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,144
to create a negative public opinion,
that also constitutes abuse of authority.

236
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,814
-Is that all there is to it?
-What?

237
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:45,192
It differs from Mr. Kang's
typical media manipulation tactics.

238
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:47,528
It seems to be a bit random.

239
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:50,364
He kept persistently asking
a few questions

240
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:52,908
that were seemingly unrelated.

241
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,702
The defendant
toured the factory every day,

242
00:16:55,786 --> 00:16:58,455
checking all equipment
and inventory. Correct?

243
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:01,708
-Yes, Your Honor.
-He said equipment kept going missing,

244
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:05,420
so he even installed
a security screening area at the doors.

245
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:06,922
Yes, Your Honor.

246
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,552
The defendant fussed over every sheet
of paper and pressured you to cut costs.

247
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,888
With proper facilities,
couldn't the accident have been prevented?

248
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:16,181
Your Honor!

249
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:17,808
It is not true.

250
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:22,688
It was unavoidable. Doesn't it say so
in the fire inspection report?

251
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:24,481
Let me ask you again, Witness.

252
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,568
Was there really nothing
you were instructed to do

253
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:30,696
by the defendant?

254
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:33,824
That was obviously
because of his desire for revenge.

255
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:34,908
No.

256
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:37,494
Mr. Jang is right.

257
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:40,455
We all know Mr. Kang very well.

258
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:42,833
If he wanted someone
to fall for a trap to get revenge,

259
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,295
he wouldn't have insisted on
repeatedly asking the same questions.

260
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:48,589
Yeah. Instead, it sounds more like…

261
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,800
I don't know. Desperation?

262
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:54,928
Yes, desperation.

263
00:17:56,138 --> 00:18:00,475
He desperately wanted to get
to the bottom of something…

264
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:02,561
What could that be?

265
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,230
The papers.

266
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,858
The security screening area.

267
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:09,568
Emergency evacuation facilities.

268
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:12,863
-Nan-hui.
-Yes?

269
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:15,407
-Do we have the factory's floor plan?
-What?

270
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:18,202
I think I made a copy
just in case we'd need it.

271
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:19,953
-Hold on.
-Yeong-sil.

272
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,917
-Are you really going to keep doing this?
-Do what?

273
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,629
Our job is to find out the truth
about Kang Da-wit's manipulated trial.

274
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:30,714
We're not defending him.

275
00:18:30,797 --> 00:18:34,718
Yoo Jae-beom wants the truth too.
The truth is for public interest too.

276
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,473
This is the floor plan
for the whole factory.

277
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:43,602
This is where the accident happened.
This is the enlarged view of that area.

278
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:47,522
-There.
-This is the exit, right?

279
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:50,359
Yes. That's the only one.

280
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:54,780
Yes, Mr. Bae?

281
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:56,657
Have you decided on your final argument?

282
00:18:57,324 --> 00:18:59,076
What is this new evidence
you're submitting?

283
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:01,828
Right, so…

284
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,378
I'll get it right away
and report back to you, sir.

285
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,755
I mean, can't you do it any faster?

286
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,257
Hurry up, will you?

287
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,424
Yes, sir.

288
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:27,479
CRIMINAL COURT, SINGLE-JUDGE DIVISION
WITNESS EXAMINATION

289
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:31,024
Jun-u.

290
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:35,153
Stop being so late, will you?

291
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,078
Prosecution, are you done
with your direct examination?

292
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,664
-Yes. No further questions, Your Honor.
-Your Honor.

293
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:50,294
If I may,

294
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:53,171
may I ask the witness just a few things?

295
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:55,424
Go ahead.

296
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,467
Thank you, Your Honor.

297
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,224
Sir.

298
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:08,353
You worked as the factory manager
at the time of the fire. Correct?

299
00:20:08,437 --> 00:20:09,688
Yes, that is right.

300
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:11,732
During that trial ten years ago,

301
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:16,778
Mr. Kang used his authority
to summon you three times

302
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:18,405
and asked about evacuation facilities

303
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:20,949
and if Mr. Yoo gave you
any instructions. Correct?

304
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,368
-Yes.
-Were there really no instructions?

305
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,871
I told you already. There was none.

306
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:27,789
Yes, that was how you testified,

307
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:30,584
stubbornly until the end.

308
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:34,963
You admitted Yoo Baek-man
had always emphasized cost reduction

309
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:37,549
and you couldn't properly keep up
evacuation facilities

310
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:39,343
because you didn't have the budget.

311
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:43,263
But it was unavoidable given the realities
of a small, struggling company.

312
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:47,976
Other than that, you never got
any specific instructions from Yoo.

313
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,894
Correct?

314
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,356
-That's right.
-And did you testify

315
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,441
without hiding anything then?

316
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:57,611
Pardon?

317
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:05,494
Since paper kept disappearing at the time,

318
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:08,955
you installed a security screening area
at the doors. Correct?

319
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,250
Yes, but why do you ask about that?

320
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:14,503
A security screening area to prevent theft

321
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:17,506
is usually installed
at an exit, isn't it?

322
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:20,175
Yes.

323
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,681
-Is this the factory's floor plan?
-Yes.

324
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,310
If you take a look,
the emergency exits are located

325
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,437
here

326
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:33,563
and here.

327
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:37,484
The area in between was covered
with intense flames.

328
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:38,902
So over here,

329
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:43,073
Min-seok was working on the other side
and couldn't escape. Correct?

330
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,702
Yes. It was very unfortunate.

331
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:49,413
However,

332
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,165
if you look closely over here,

333
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:54,084
there is a small door…

334
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:57,003
right here.

335
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,800
Yes.

336
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:06,847
These are photos
from the scene of the fire.

337
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,390
What door is this?

338
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,184
It seems there was another exit.

339
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:16,148
I already said this
at the trial ten years ago,

340
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:19,192
but it was a side door
for the night shift.

341
00:22:19,276 --> 00:22:22,279
It hadn't been used for a long time,
so it was rusty and broken.

342
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:23,864
That's why it didn't open.

343
00:22:23,947 --> 00:22:26,992
Right. You consistently said so
at the trial.

344
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:29,703
It was one of the facilities
you mentioned earlier

345
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:32,998
that you couldn't keep up
due to a lack of budget. Correct?

346
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:35,584
Yes, that's right.

347
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,920
Due to the layout of the factory,
those who worked in this area

348
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:40,964
only had this door
as a fire escape. Correct?

349
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,051
They couldn't go to the other side
since the fire was already too strong.

350
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:47,637
That's right.

351
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,523
Min-seok

352
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:01,902
struggled so hard to open that door

353
00:23:02,986 --> 00:23:04,905
and died with broken hands
and feet. Correct?

354
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:15,832
Hey!

355
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,419
Please answer the question.

356
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,631
Yes.

357
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,594
-Are you sure it was broken?
-Pardon?

358
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,557
Sir, was the door really broken?

359
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:38,230
Ma'am, what are you talking about?

360
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:40,523
I already told the truth back then.

361
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:42,275
For your information,

362
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,361
it has been ten years.

363
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:47,614
The statute of limitations has expired.
You cannot be punished for it.

364
00:23:50,158 --> 00:23:51,409
What do you mean?

365
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:55,372
If you hid something back then
because you were afraid of being punished,

366
00:23:55,455 --> 00:23:58,166
it means you can say it now.

367
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:00,794
However,

368
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,255
if you make perjury in this court…

369
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:08,301
you will be severely punished.

370
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:16,935
Did you really receive no instructions?

371
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:27,904
You damn thief!

372
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:30,198
They were defective,
so we were going to discard them--

373
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:31,241
Discard them?

374
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:33,743
If there's ever another thief
like this prick,

375
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:35,495
I'll fire you first.

376
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:38,164
I already said there weren't any.

377
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,751
Is that so?

378
00:24:42,877 --> 00:24:46,131
All the managers must have gotten
their stories straight back then.

379
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:49,718
But now, most of them have left
and some will have changed their minds.

380
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:52,846
Should I call all of them here
for witness examination?

381
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:56,224
Sir.

382
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:59,436
The truth will come out eventually.

383
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,605
Even if you've lied
about something up until now,

384
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:05,233
if you tell the truth
before this testimony ends,

385
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:07,277
no perjury will have been committed.

386
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:12,198
Let me ask you again.

387
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:14,993
Did you really…

388
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:18,496
receive no instructions from Yoo?

389
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:25,545
Hey!

390
00:25:28,757 --> 00:25:29,591
Hey!

391
00:25:29,674 --> 00:25:31,217
I'm in here!

392
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:44,647
I…

393
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm sorry.

394
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,235
That door…

395
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:51,863
I locked that door.

396
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:03,875
I'm still young. Don't worry.

397
00:26:05,585 --> 00:26:10,298
Mr. Yoo had kept hounding me to lock it.

398
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:14,886
He said the trainees might use the door

399
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:17,639
to steal things.

400
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,976
So that's what it was.

401
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:25,313
That's why…

402
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:29,818
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

403
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,072
If I disobeyed his orders,

404
00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:35,698
I'd get fired right away.

405
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:37,826
If I got fired,

406
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:40,954
I had no way of providing for my family.

407
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:42,789
Stop lying! My father would never do that!

408
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:44,082
Calm down, Mr. Yoo.

409
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:46,835
Let me say a few words.

410
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:49,003
Please.

411
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:53,466
Kang Da-wit.

412
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:56,594
You did this, didn't you?

413
00:26:57,178 --> 00:26:58,012
Again!

414
00:26:58,972 --> 00:27:01,933
What did you cook up again this time?

415
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:04,727
Calm down, Mr. Yoo!

416
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:08,606
Your Honor, this is wrong!

417
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:11,484
-Your Honor, this is wrong!
-Please remove him.

418
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:13,486
-Remove him from the court now!
-This is a lie!

419
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:15,530
Let go of me!

420
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:31,337
The truth? There's no such thing.

421
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:34,174
Everyone just has their side of the story.

422
00:27:34,257 --> 00:27:37,635
The winner's side of the story
after fighting in court.

423
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:41,931
That's the only truth
the world acknowledges.

424
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:45,310
Do you want to know the truth?

425
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:49,731
Then, defeat me.

426
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:52,650
Okay.

427
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,112
I'll defeat you.

428
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,996
We'll take a ten-minute recess.

429
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,084
10 YEARS AGO, SEOUL SOUTHERN DC

430
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:12,086
-Mr. Yoo.
-Yes, Your Honor?

431
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,547
There's something
I've been meaning to ask.

432
00:28:14,631 --> 00:28:16,758
Sorry? Yes, go ahead.

433
00:28:17,383 --> 00:28:19,886
Has it ever crossed your mind

434
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:24,349
that the workers at your factory
have loving families too?

435
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:25,975
Pardon?

436
00:28:27,477 --> 00:28:29,145
Well, of course.

437
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:31,439
They're not machines that make you money.

438
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:33,816
They are people of flesh and blood.

439
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:36,319
Do you know that?

440
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:40,782
I did everything I could as a judge,

441
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:46,371
but I couldn't prove back then
that they locked the door intentionally.

442
00:28:47,497 --> 00:28:51,668
"We admit we failed to properly maintain
evacuation facilities to save costs."

443
00:28:52,418 --> 00:28:55,505
That was the best I could uncover

444
00:28:56,464 --> 00:28:57,507
in court.

445
00:28:58,633 --> 00:28:59,926
Based on that,

446
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:02,887
I had to decide on the sentence.

447
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:04,681
I knew it was common practice

448
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:08,601
to give business owners
a slap on the wrist in cases like this.

449
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:12,814
But no matter how much I thought about it,

450
00:29:12,897 --> 00:29:15,066
just to save a few pennies,

451
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:18,486
a business owner caused
a 17-year-old to burn to death

452
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,281
with broken hands and feet

453
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:23,491
after he struggled
to open a door to get out.

454
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:28,079
So, I couldn't impose anything
but the maximum sentence on him.

455
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:30,874
Your Honor.

456
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,837
Whether my judgment was guided
by my conscience as a judge

457
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:40,884
or by my personal desire for revenge
that caused an abuse of authority,

458
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:44,345
I ask this Court to decide.

459
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:48,057
And I will accept its decision.

460
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,659
-Plaintiff's counsel.
-Yes, Your Honor?

461
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:09,621
Do you have any final words?

462
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:30,725
No, Your Honor.

463
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,605
This concludes the final arguments.

464
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:38,900
The verdict shall be delivered
at 10:00 a.m. on December 15

465
00:30:38,983 --> 00:30:41,152
in this court.

466
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:58,378
A FEW DAYS LATER,
THE DAY THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED

467
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:13,726
Well done, Mr. Kang.

468
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:16,145
It's finally over.

469
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:17,772
Yes.

470
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:20,149
An acquittal seemed likely,

471
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:22,735
so the prosecution dropped
the charges right away.

472
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:25,071
All right.

473
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:27,198
Welcome back.

474
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:28,282
Welcome back!

475
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,284
-Welcome back!
-Sure.

476
00:31:33,913 --> 00:31:35,832
Here. Have a block of tofu.

477
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:39,877
Why would I need to eat tofu?
I didn't go to prison.

478
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:43,297
You were about to
if we didn't go easy on you.

479
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:44,966
Go easy on me?

480
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:46,759
You were ruthless.

481
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:48,803
You used all kinds of tricks.

482
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:52,682
And who do you think
we learned all that from, Master?

483
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:56,019
Geez, all you picked up
was the bad stuff.

484
00:31:56,102 --> 00:31:58,271
So you do know
you taught us only bad stuff.

485
00:31:58,354 --> 00:32:00,773
Why are you arguing?
Are you an attorney or something?

486
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:03,443
-Yes.
-Still, I'm relieved.

487
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:05,737
I had a pretty bad feeling

488
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,448
about how the presiding judge
conducted the trial.

489
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:09,741
Judge Oh Jae-seop?

490
00:32:10,491 --> 00:32:13,036
As I told you before,
he has a faint heart.

491
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,412
What?

492
00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:16,789
I wondered why
there were so many reporters.

493
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:19,167
-There were especially a lot, right?
-Geez.

494
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,127
So, you had insurance in place.

495
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:24,172
Of course, you would.

496
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:26,382
Ms. Park.

497
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:28,509
Thank you.

498
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:31,596
-About what?
-Well… You know.

499
00:32:32,722 --> 00:32:34,974
Thank you. Do you really have to ask?

500
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:39,020
No, thank you.

501
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:40,521
About what?

502
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:45,318
I want to believe you.

503
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:49,989
You gave our family hope
that this world was still worth living in.

504
00:32:50,073 --> 00:32:51,699
You may appear to complain,

505
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:54,911
but you fight harder
than anyone else for those in need.

506
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,288
I want to trust that person.

507
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:04,295
I'm just thankful for everything.
Do you really have to ask?

508
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:07,298
Why are you two being so cringey?

509
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,432
Hey, Jun-u. Why are you so quiet?

510
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:20,520
That reminds me.
What made you come to the hearing?

511
00:33:20,603 --> 00:33:22,522
I thought you wouldn't come at all.

512
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:24,732
I had to since it'd be my last time.

513
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:26,609
-What?
-What?

514
00:33:26,692 --> 00:33:28,528
-Your last?
-What do you mean, Jun-u?

515
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:31,489
I'm going to get fired…

516
00:33:32,907 --> 00:33:34,242
by Mr. Bae.

517
00:33:34,325 --> 00:33:35,243
What?

518
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:39,372
You didn't report to him
about our plan for the last hearing.

519
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:43,209
Report what? Are you a spy?

520
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,627
Mr. Kang, please!

521
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:48,673
Then, before you came to court that day…

522
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:52,844
They're submitting this?

523
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,847
For what purpose?

524
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,849
Yes, from my understanding,

525
00:33:57,932 --> 00:34:00,351
they'll argue
factory facilities were fine at the time,

526
00:34:00,434 --> 00:34:04,730
but Kang Da-wit imposed
oversight liability unreasonably.

527
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:06,899
Really? Unreasonably?

528
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,943
Yes, unreasonably.

529
00:34:10,444 --> 00:34:12,822
Has Park Gi-ppeum
finally come to her senses?

530
00:34:12,905 --> 00:34:15,700
Yes, the factory was so thorough
with their security

531
00:34:15,783 --> 00:34:17,535
they even set up
a security screening area.

532
00:34:17,618 --> 00:34:19,745
They plan on proving that too.

533
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:21,455
That's from my understanding.

534
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,374
-Is that so?
-Yes, sir.

535
00:34:23,457 --> 00:34:24,333
Good job.

536
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,629
Is that what happened?

537
00:34:31,674 --> 00:34:33,593
I'm sorry, Mr. Kang.

538
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:36,095
Geez, that is so like you.

539
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,847
Why did you work as a spy?

540
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,266
Did he promise to send you
to another team?

541
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:44,103
No, not at all.

542
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:45,104
-It's true.
-No…

543
00:34:45,188 --> 00:34:47,315
Busted. So which team? The M&A team?

544
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:51,235
-Yeah, it must've been the M&A team.
-No, I never said it was the M&A team.

545
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:52,153
No, it's not.

546
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:54,322
-It was the M&A team.
-Yeah, he's getting fired.

547
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:56,115
-For lacking understanding.
-Hey, Jung-in.

548
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,451
What? I'm with my team right now.

549
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:00,745
Yeong-sil, when did I ever…

550
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:02,121
Where are you?

551
00:35:02,955 --> 00:35:04,498
No, I'll go to you.

552
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:06,959
We need to talk anyways.

553
00:35:08,669 --> 00:35:10,713
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

554
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:13,925
-I can finally breathe.
-Me too.

555
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:18,304
-I've always wondered about something.
-Yeah?

556
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:22,183
How do you all
understand everything so fast?

557
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:28,231
I'm glad you're back.

558
00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:29,899
-It's good to see you, oppa.
-What?

559
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:35,696
Gi-ppeum!

560
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,448
You did a great job!

561
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,950
-Well, we all did.
-What?

562
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:40,785
-You did the best.
-"Oppa"?

563
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:41,744
Me too…

564
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:43,204
Wait for me!

565
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:45,331
-What?
-What do you mean "What?" Come on.

566
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:46,999
-I'll root for you.
-Don't be silly.

567
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,377
-What? Come on.
-Hey, your face is red.

568
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,754
No, it's not! Your ears are red.
It's due to the cold.

569
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:03,015
-Hi.
-Hey.

570
00:36:04,558 --> 00:36:06,602
What do you think? Isn't it nice here?

571
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:07,770
Yeah, it's good.

572
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:09,063
This is a date.

573
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,606
Hey.

574
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:12,233
I'm kidding.

575
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:14,068
Here.

576
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:16,737
What do you think?

577
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:20,741
Are you relieved now
after facing Team Pro Bono in a trial?

578
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:30,501
You said, "No one can be
a judge in their own case."

579
00:36:32,378 --> 00:36:36,090
Is that why you wanted to be judged
by your own team?

580
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:38,259
Well…

581
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:43,264
Anyway, I have a question.

582
00:36:43,347 --> 00:36:46,183
What is it? Is it something serious?

583
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:48,894
You resigned to represent me.

584
00:36:48,978 --> 00:36:50,021
I appreciate that.

585
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:52,982
What's with this all of a sudden?

586
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:55,735
I truly appreciate it
from the bottom of my heart.

587
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:59,113
But I kept wondering.

588
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:03,826
Why go out of your way to do that
when you didn't have to?

589
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:07,788
It was as if something
was weighing on your mind.

590
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:10,499
As if you were feeling guilty.

591
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:13,085
What is this?

592
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:16,589
Come to think of it, you and Dr. Oh
have been in constant conflict.

593
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,758
You brought me in as a team leader

594
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,926
when I couldn't even work as an attorney.

595
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,304
When Yoo Jae-beom sued me,

596
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:25,139
you even resigned.

597
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:27,433
So?

598
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:29,935
What's your point?

599
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:32,980
You know,
after Yoo Jae-beom turned himself in,

600
00:37:34,273 --> 00:37:36,901
I deliberately went to see Justice Shin

601
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:38,486
to spook him a bit.

602
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:42,573
When I did that, he quickly scurried to…

603
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:45,618
Guess who?

604
00:37:47,703 --> 00:37:49,038
Dr. Oh.

605
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:50,915
Your father.

606
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:01,300
Why did Shin Jung-seok,
Yoo Jae-beom's accomplice,

607
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:04,011
go see Dr. Oh?

608
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,807
And why do that
while trying to avoid attention?

609
00:38:08,557 --> 00:38:11,352
I just saved your life,
and this is the thanks I get?

610
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:14,021
What on earth are you talking about?

611
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:23,948
That day wasn't your first time
seeing Yoo Jae-beom.

612
00:38:25,991 --> 00:38:28,119
It was for a moment, but I definitely saw…

613
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:31,330
how he looked at you.

614
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:36,168
My apologies for being late, Your Honor.

615
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:39,088
I'm Oh Jung-in,
attorney for defendant Kang Da-wit.

616
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:55,187
Just how much do you know
about the trap I fell into?

617
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:06,699
My apologies, Dr. Oh.

618
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:10,035
Oh Jae-seop is a reliable guy,

619
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,580
but it seems the atmosphere
at court wasn't good.

620
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:17,960
Geez, it's been getting harder
to see lately.

621
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:21,630
Attorney Bae.

622
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:22,548
Yes, sir?

623
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:27,928
I guess being a first-time CEO
doesn't suit you.

624
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:30,347
I apologize.

625
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,016
I'll correct it, sir.

626
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,059
How are you going to correct it?

627
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:37,813
It would look bad
if Oh & Partners gets directly involved.

628
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:39,148
It might give the impression

629
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:41,734
-that we can't handle our employees.
-And so?

630
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:46,572
-Let's use a mercenary.
-A mercenary?

631
00:39:48,282 --> 00:39:49,158
Come in.

632
00:39:58,626 --> 00:39:59,919
Hello, Dr. Oh.

633
00:40:16,393 --> 00:40:19,813
Our office is gone!

634
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:21,190
What happened?

635
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:23,901
My mushrooms…

636
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:27,404
Your mushrooms aren't important right now!

637
00:40:27,488 --> 00:40:30,616
These jerks!

638
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:31,700
My mushrooms…

639
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:33,661
DISBANDMENT OF TEAM PRO BONO

640
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:37,248
Sir! No, I shouldn't even
call him that. Hey!

641
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:39,458
What is the meaning of this?

642
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:40,918
What do you mean?

643
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:42,920
You could've just fired me
and ended it there.

644
00:40:43,003 --> 00:40:45,923
Why did you get rid
of Team Pro Bono's office?

645
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:49,009
Why keep a team that violates
the basic ethics of being an attorney?

646
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:51,762
Violate the basic ethics?
When did we ever do that?

647
00:40:51,845 --> 00:40:53,889
You defended the opposition
instead of your client.

648
00:40:53,973 --> 00:40:55,641
How could attorneys do such a thing?

649
00:40:55,724 --> 00:40:58,143
Yoo Jae-beom clearly said
he wanted the truth too.

650
00:40:58,227 --> 00:41:02,439
The management group voted unanimously
to disband your team and fire all of you.

651
00:41:02,523 --> 00:41:03,607
Got that?

652
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:06,694
And I just signed off on it myself as CEO.

653
00:41:08,862 --> 00:41:11,490
Go to the security office
and take your personal belongings.

654
00:41:11,574 --> 00:41:12,950
-By any chance…
-Right.

655
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:16,036
-Take those mushrooms too.
-Okay.

656
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,123
Get out!

657
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,376
This is the CEO's office.

658
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:25,004
CLAIM FOR DAMAGES

659
00:41:25,087 --> 00:41:28,549
I will reveal for everyone to see

660
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:30,467
how former judge Kang Da-wit

661
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:33,637
shamelessly manipulated the trial

662
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:36,015
of Chairman Jang Hyeon-bae's case.

663
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,518
For sending an innocent businessman
to jail by manipulating a trial

664
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:42,479
in order to fulfill his own desires
to become a justice,

665
00:41:42,563 --> 00:41:45,899
former judge Kang will face
the full force of the law.

666
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,526
-Mr. Woo.
-Yes?

667
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,820
Recently, former judge Kang

668
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:54,116
was cleared of abuse of authority charges
from a trial he conducted ten years ago.

669
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:57,911
He simply got away with it
by abusing the fact that it's very hard

670
00:41:57,995 --> 00:41:59,997
to legally prove abuse of authority.

671
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,252
So, I will file a civil lawsuit
for damages with a broader scope for…

672
00:42:08,964 --> 00:42:11,216
-One hundred million won?
-One hundred million won?

673
00:42:12,926 --> 00:42:15,137
A claim of one billion won.

674
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,305
One billion?

675
00:42:16,388 --> 00:42:17,222
One billion won?

676
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:21,644
Let's take another photo.

677
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:22,561
CLAIM FOR DAMAGES

678
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:26,649
Goodness. At least the view is nice.

679
00:42:28,108 --> 00:42:29,693
It just never ends.

680
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:33,739
It hasn't been a week since we celebrated
the end of the trial. What is this?

681
00:42:33,822 --> 00:42:37,493
This place is currently vacant.
I had to pull some strings to get it.

682
00:42:37,576 --> 00:42:39,203
For me, I'll be fine,

683
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:42,373
but you've all become
unemployed overnight.

684
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:45,292
How about you worry about yourself?

685
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:46,460
Why, Ms. Jobless?

686
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:47,628
One billion won…

687
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:51,256
You were sued today
for a billion in damages!

688
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,926
A billion? That's insane.

689
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:58,972
I am so sick of that guy. Geez.

690
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:03,227
Why does he keep trying to interfere
with everything you do, Mr. Kang?

691
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,062
You said you went to JRTI together.

692
00:43:05,145 --> 00:43:07,731
There must be a reason
if a former cohort hates you this much.

693
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:11,735
Well, the thing is…

694
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:13,654
16 YEARS AGO

695
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:15,322
THE 40TH JRTI ENTRANCE CEREMONY

696
00:43:16,824 --> 00:43:18,117
No. Don't.

697
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:23,080
Are you insane?

698
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:26,458
Why are you kneeling?

699
00:43:27,835 --> 00:43:29,336
-I…
-Lose the sunglasses.

700
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:31,630
Hey, if they're all bad,

701
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:33,716
what am I supposed to do then?

702
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:35,342
They're all bad, so what can you do?

703
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:39,430
-My bangs look weird, right?
-I told you they look cute.

704
00:43:39,513 --> 00:43:42,349
Who on earth is making you this nervous?

705
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:43,809
Her?

706
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:47,563
I've had a crush on her for four years.

707
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:49,857
She's my junior
from SNU Law School.

708
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:54,778
You have no idea how much courage
it's taking me to tell her.

709
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:56,029
All right, I get it.

710
00:43:56,113 --> 00:43:58,073
-Hey, you can do it. Okay?
-I can do it.

711
00:43:58,699 --> 00:43:59,658
Bye.

712
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:01,034
Hey, she's here.

713
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:04,455
-Is that her?
-Stop staring.

714
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:05,873
All right, already.

715
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,543
Hey, Jung-in!

716
00:44:11,545 --> 00:44:13,046
What a surprise to see you here.

717
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,177
I almost didn't recognize you in that…

718
00:44:20,888 --> 00:44:22,097
Hey.

719
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:26,894
What's your name?

720
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,191
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

721
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:36,737
It's Da-wit. Kang Da-wit.

722
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:38,822
Da-wit.

723
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,241
What an interesting name.

724
00:44:42,618 --> 00:44:44,536
Nice to meet you. I'm Oh Jung-in.

725
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:49,666
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

726
00:44:56,381 --> 00:44:59,384
Well, there were things that happened.

727
00:45:00,093 --> 00:45:01,845
What are we going to do
about Chairman Jang?

728
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:05,182
He must be so bent on getting back at you.

729
00:45:05,265 --> 00:45:07,851
More important than that,
before the trial starts,

730
00:45:07,935 --> 00:45:10,312
there's one thing we need to address.

731
00:45:10,395 --> 00:45:12,105
What? Address what?

732
00:45:18,028 --> 00:45:20,989
How long are you going to
hide this for, Mr. Jang?

733
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,908
-Sorry?
-What?

734
00:45:22,991 --> 00:45:25,994
-What did Yeong-sil do?
-What is this about all of a sudden?

735
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,999
Did you think I wouldn't know?

736
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,091
Just as expected,

737
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:41,677
you knew about it.

738
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:44,012
Mr. Jang.

739
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:45,472
What on earth is going on?

740
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:50,435
Chairman Jang Hyeon-bae.

741
00:45:52,396 --> 00:45:54,690
He's my father.
I've cut ties with him though.

742
00:45:56,275 --> 00:45:58,277
-What?
-What?

743
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:09,955
Go up.

744
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:11,873
Good.

745
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:12,833
Good job.

746
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,088
-Attorney Woo.
-Yes, sir?

747
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:22,009
-You're sure about this trial, right?
-Of course, sir.

748
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:23,468
Just count on me.

749
00:46:23,552 --> 00:46:26,263
Every attorney says that. But…

750
00:46:26,346 --> 00:46:28,640
After being sentenced to jail,

751
00:46:28,724 --> 00:46:31,852
I don't trust the lies attorneys say.

752
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:37,899
Are you really sure about this trial?

753
00:46:39,526 --> 00:46:40,360
Well…

754
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:42,195
I mean…

755
00:46:47,868 --> 00:46:52,414
Last time, I told you about my father
and how he'd beat me every week.

756
00:46:52,998 --> 00:46:56,418
That person is Chairman Jang Hyeon-bae.

757
00:46:57,085 --> 00:46:58,003
My goodness.

758
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:00,005
Mr. Jang.

759
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:03,800
I'm sorry, everyone.

760
00:47:03,884 --> 00:47:06,178
I didn't mean to deceive you,

761
00:47:07,846 --> 00:47:09,806
but I couldn't bring myself
to tell the truth.

762
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,018
Then, you're the illegitimate child
of a wealthy family?

763
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:15,646
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

764
00:47:15,729 --> 00:47:16,897
It's okay.

765
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,651
It's okay, Nan-hui.
It doesn't bother me anymore.

766
00:47:21,526 --> 00:47:24,738
But seriously,
what kind of life have you lived?

767
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,783
You said you worked with labor unions

768
00:47:27,866 --> 00:47:29,826
and fought for them.

769
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:36,083
Honestly, I did all of that

770
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:39,878
because I just hated him so much.

771
00:47:40,837 --> 00:47:43,382
I didn't want to be like him.

772
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:46,677
I did whatever would drive him crazy,

773
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,261
and that's led me here.

774
00:47:48,929 --> 00:47:53,558
It might have been
a childish desire for revenge.

775
00:47:54,768 --> 00:47:57,562
Who goes that far just for revenge?

776
00:47:57,646 --> 00:47:59,314
Mr. Jang.

777
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:01,733
You're just someone who's not like him.

778
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:06,196
That's right. You look different too.
I'm sure you resemble your mom.

779
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:07,698
Yeah, like your mom's side, right?

780
00:48:08,865 --> 00:48:10,826
Thank you, everyone.

781
00:48:11,535 --> 00:48:12,369
But Mr. Kang.

782
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:14,871
-Yes?
-How on earth did you know?

783
00:48:16,832 --> 00:48:18,583
Well, I just happened to find out

784
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:22,504
as I put the puzzle pieces together.

785
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:27,092
Mr. Kang, you were worried about me,
weren't you?

786
00:48:27,175 --> 00:48:30,387
Because you have to fight
against my father in court.

787
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:32,723
Mr. Jang.

788
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:36,685
Don't mind me at all

789
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:39,229
and try as best as you can.

790
00:48:39,312 --> 00:48:42,482
I'm also going to fight

791
00:48:43,316 --> 00:48:45,360
to bring him to justice.

792
00:48:49,072 --> 00:48:50,741
Are you really going to be okay?

793
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:54,536
This lawsuit isn't for you or me.

794
00:48:55,078 --> 00:48:59,541
He's made numerous people suffer.

795
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:04,921
This is a pro bono case for them.

796
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:07,966
We have to do this.

797
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:19,436
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

798
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:21,021
COURT 305, TODAY'S TRIALS

799
00:49:21,104 --> 00:49:22,898
PLAINTIFF JANG, DEFENDANT KANG
IN SESSION

800
00:49:22,981 --> 00:49:24,900
-Plaintiff's counsel.
-Yes, Your Honor?

801
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:27,110
You filed a claim for damages,
alleging the defendant

802
00:49:27,194 --> 00:49:30,781
sentenced your client to prison
with a malicious trial. Is this correct?

803
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:32,949
Yes, the key criminal acts
for which the defendant

804
00:49:33,033 --> 00:49:34,868
sentenced my client to prison

805
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:37,370
were verbal and physical abuse
against his secretaries

806
00:49:37,454 --> 00:49:41,792
and sexual assault
against his housekeepers.

807
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:45,545
But all the secretaries have come forward

808
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:48,840
and said such things never happened.

809
00:49:48,924 --> 00:49:52,135
These are their statements.

810
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:54,930
I will submit these
as an additional exhibit.

811
00:49:55,013 --> 00:49:57,808
And for the sexual assault
against the housekeepers,

812
00:49:57,891 --> 00:50:01,728
due to a lack of objective evidence
aside from the victims' statements,

813
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:05,440
the Supreme Court has already rendered
a judgment acquitting my client.

814
00:50:05,524 --> 00:50:09,778
The defendant baselessly
framed and imprisoned

815
00:50:09,861 --> 00:50:13,031
a businessman who leads Korea's economy.

816
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:16,952
Shouldn't he face
appropriate consequences for such crimes?

817
00:50:20,997 --> 00:50:23,291
-Your Honor.
-Yes, Mr. Kang?

818
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:26,294
I listened carefully
to the plaintiff counsel's claim.

819
00:50:26,378 --> 00:50:29,506
And of course,
to defend myself against it,

820
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:32,676
I'd like the Court to summon
the person who was too busy to be here.

821
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:33,802
That jerk's at it again…

822
00:50:33,885 --> 00:50:37,681
I request a direct examination

823
00:50:37,764 --> 00:50:40,475
of the plaintiff Chairman Jang Hyeon-bae.

824
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,354
This request is unnecessary, Your Honor.
The witness statements are enough.

825
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:48,692
Why don't you request
the secretaries as witnesses first?

826
00:50:49,317 --> 00:50:53,530
They've reversed their statements,
saying they had never been abused.

827
00:50:54,447 --> 00:50:55,615
That's correct, Your Honor.

828
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:56,700
But, Plaintiff's counsel,

829
00:50:56,783 --> 00:51:00,704
after Chairman Jang was sentenced to jail,
weren't those employees assigned

830
00:51:00,787 --> 00:51:02,539
to posts in the countryside

831
00:51:02,622 --> 00:51:05,250
and only recently returned
to headquarters?

832
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:08,795
Right after reversing
their statements, right?

833
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:13,842
That was ultimately a normal shift
of personnel on group-wide rotation--

834
00:51:13,925 --> 00:51:16,469
I can imagine
just the sheer amount of pressure

835
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:20,599
they must have received
after being branded as whistleblowers.

836
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:23,435
The Plaintiff's counsel is great at that.

837
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:26,313
-Your Honor, he's--
-I do not wish to call them back to court

838
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:28,732
and put the pressure of perjury on them.

839
00:51:28,815 --> 00:51:32,277
That is too cruel. Shouldn't the one
who filed this suit against me

840
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,740
appear and state his position first
since that's the natural order of things?

841
00:51:37,324 --> 00:51:41,286
Just as a reference, Mr. Yoo Jae-beom,
the person who sued me in my last trial,

842
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:43,371
attended court every time

843
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:47,542
despite being in custody
because he wanted to see me so badly.

844
00:51:49,252 --> 00:51:52,088
Doesn't Chairman Jang want to see me?

845
00:51:52,923 --> 00:51:58,511
Don't tell me he doesn't have
the confidence to talk to me face to face.

846
00:51:58,595 --> 00:52:01,222
-Should I give him a call or--
-Be quiet.

847
00:52:08,396 --> 00:52:09,981
NOTICE OF HEARING DATE FOR EXAMINATION

848
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:40,971
Damn it.

849
00:52:43,348 --> 00:52:45,141
I'll make a new pot.

850
00:53:02,951 --> 00:53:04,536
CIVIL PANEL COURT

851
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:07,038
Okay. What do you want to know so badly?

852
00:53:07,122 --> 00:53:08,039
Ask me.

853
00:53:08,873 --> 00:53:11,251
Thank you for making the time
to come, Chairman.

854
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:12,919
Don't worry about it.

855
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,505
That was just a greeting.

856
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:17,173
I will refer to you as "Plaintiff."

857
00:53:17,257 --> 00:53:19,551
You're claiming I made a judgment

858
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:22,929
that you verbally and physically
abused your secretaries

859
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:25,265
without any concrete evidence. Correct?

860
00:53:25,348 --> 00:53:29,269
I am not someone
who would lay a hand on others.

861
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:33,815
And likewise about the sexual assault
against your housekeepers?

862
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:37,235
That is ridiculous slander! How dare you?

863
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:39,612
That is very interesting.

864
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:41,990
I clearly remember

865
00:53:42,073 --> 00:53:44,617
you were trying to settle
with the victims back then,

866
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:47,120
so you asked me for more time.

867
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:51,833
Your Honor, we have already explained this
through our written statement.

868
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:55,211
A critical international deal
was imminent at that time.

869
00:53:55,295 --> 00:53:57,630
So, despite thinking it was unfair,
he had no choice

870
00:53:57,714 --> 00:53:59,966
but to settle and conclude the trial.

871
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:03,636
The defendant clearly knew about this,
but he conducted the trial

872
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,723
to embarrass my client
and increase his popularity.

873
00:54:07,432 --> 00:54:09,059
To embarrass him?

874
00:54:10,143 --> 00:54:11,311
Okay.

875
00:54:12,145 --> 00:54:13,188
Your Honor.

876
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:16,983
May my attorney proceed
with the examination?

877
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:19,402
-Yes, go ahead.
-Thank you.

878
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:29,537
It won't be Ms. Park
doing the examination?

879
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:45,512
I'm Attorney Jang Yeong-sil, Your Honor.

880
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:46,471
All right.

881
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:09,202
Are you sure it'll be okay?

882
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:16,167
You don't have to do it. We can handle it.

883
00:55:16,251 --> 00:55:17,252
No.

884
00:55:17,836 --> 00:55:21,297
Today, I want to do it.

885
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:31,683
Defense counsel, start your examination.

886
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:40,441
-Plaintiff…
-I'm so glad to see you,

887
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:43,194
Attorney Jang.

888
00:55:43,278 --> 00:55:46,447
I can't believe we have a reunion here
between father and son.

889
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:48,992
-They're father and son?
-Those two?

890
00:55:49,075 --> 00:55:50,326
-Really?
-It seems so.

891
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,746
Did you say you're father and son?

892
00:55:54,372 --> 00:55:57,834
Yes, Your Honor.
The defendant's attorney, Mr. Jang,

893
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:01,963
is a blood relative of Chairman Jang.

894
00:56:02,046 --> 00:56:05,675
But they haven't been in contact
for a while since he ran away from home.

895
00:56:05,758 --> 00:56:07,635
That's enough.

896
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:11,306
Your Honor, there is no regulation

897
00:56:11,389 --> 00:56:15,268
for an attorney to recuse themselves,
but wouldn't this be inappropriate?

898
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:21,149
Conducting a hostile examination
between father and son is a bit--

899
00:56:21,232 --> 00:56:23,318
No, it's okay.

900
00:56:24,444 --> 00:56:26,196
I can't help it as a father.

901
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:30,325
When he was young,
I was always terribly concerned

902
00:56:30,408 --> 00:56:32,702
that he wouldn't grow up
to be a proper human being.

903
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:36,164
But now that I see him here
standing so confidently,

904
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:38,666
that's enough to make me happy.

905
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:41,878
Go ahead and ask, Mr. Jang.

906
00:56:47,592 --> 00:56:48,843
P… Plaintiff.

907
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:50,803
What?

908
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:55,725
I can't hear you.
Could you please speak louder?

909
00:56:57,268 --> 00:56:59,812
-Plaintiff…
-When you talk to someone!

910
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:03,983
Didn't I tell you the polite thing to do
was to make eye contact?

911
00:57:04,651 --> 00:57:06,402
Where on earth are you looking right now?

912
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:17,872
Didn't I tell you…

913
00:57:21,209 --> 00:57:23,461
to make eye contact
when talking to someone?

914
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:25,880
Didn't I?

915
00:57:32,512 --> 00:57:35,306
Plaintiff, this is a court of law!

916
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:38,476
No matter how close you two may be,
please be respectful!

917
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:42,564
Mr. Kang, what are you doing?

918
00:57:43,189 --> 00:57:46,484
That is what His Honor will say.

919
00:57:46,568 --> 00:57:50,405
Right, Your Honor?
That's what I did when I was a judge.

920
00:57:50,488 --> 00:57:52,073
Mr. Kang, please sit down.

921
00:57:52,156 --> 00:57:54,200
-Sit.
-Yes, Your Honor.

922
00:57:55,618 --> 00:57:58,204
Plaintiff, be careful.

923
00:57:58,288 --> 00:58:01,165
My apologies, Your Honor.
I will be careful.

924
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:04,460
Defense counsel.

925
00:58:06,963 --> 00:58:08,214
Please proceed.

926
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,882
Yes, Your Honor.

927
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:16,973
P…

928
00:58:17,056 --> 00:58:18,057
-What?
-P…

929
00:58:18,725 --> 00:58:20,685
P… Plaintiff…

930
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:23,479
P…

931
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:28,860
Yes, the plaintiff is right there.
He's not going anywhere.

932
00:58:28,943 --> 00:58:31,654
Just take your time.

933
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:36,117
This is causing
a lot of delay in the hearing.

934
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,745
Are you going to
continue with this, Defense?

935
00:58:39,412 --> 00:58:41,873
Your Honor, I will continue from here--

936
00:58:42,582 --> 00:58:43,666
I can do it.

937
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:46,461
-Ms. Park.
-Ms. Park, I…

938
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:48,963
I can do it.

939
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:04,812
Your Honor.

940
00:59:04,896 --> 00:59:05,897
May I…

941
00:59:08,566 --> 00:59:11,110
continue with the examination?

942
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:14,530
-Yes, you may.
-Thank you.

943
00:59:23,247 --> 00:59:24,165
Plaintiff.

944
00:59:26,668 --> 00:59:28,419
Please answer

945
00:59:29,712 --> 00:59:30,546
my question.

946
00:59:32,715 --> 00:59:33,716
Okay.

947
00:59:34,509 --> 00:59:37,637
Before you hit a person,

948
00:59:38,971 --> 00:59:39,972
you…

949
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:42,475
always…

950
00:59:43,476 --> 00:59:45,019
always make them kneel. Correct?

951
00:59:45,728 --> 00:59:46,729
What?

952
00:59:46,813 --> 00:59:49,649
Did you know it is scarier…

953
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:54,237
to wait…

954
00:59:55,363 --> 00:59:57,240
to be hit…

955
01:00:00,368 --> 01:00:01,911
than to actually be hit?

956
01:00:01,994 --> 01:00:04,414
Give me a proper question.

957
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:08,376
Stop talking about ridiculous things
that have nothing to do with me.

958
01:00:10,002 --> 01:00:13,548
Nothing… to do with you?

959
01:00:13,631 --> 01:00:17,510
Your Honor, Defense counsel is asking
baseless, nonsensical questions…

960
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:22,765
What is this?

961
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:26,269
This is the office
of Chairman Jang's secretaries.

962
01:00:31,023 --> 01:00:32,233
Damn it.

963
01:00:32,316 --> 01:00:34,360
You little!

964
01:00:34,444 --> 01:00:35,528
Damn it!

965
01:00:38,948 --> 01:00:40,658
Damn it!

966
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:42,618
You little!

967
01:00:42,702 --> 01:00:44,287
I think that's really him.

968
01:00:46,038 --> 01:00:47,123
Order in the court.

969
01:00:50,001 --> 01:00:51,586
What is that video?

970
01:00:51,669 --> 01:00:56,299
Didn't all the secretaries
reverse their statements

971
01:00:56,382 --> 01:00:58,342
and say there was
no physical abuse then?

972
01:00:58,426 --> 01:00:59,343
Yes, they did.

973
01:01:00,011 --> 01:01:04,015
But one employee, who couldn't sit back
and let the truth get buried,

974
01:01:04,849 --> 01:01:06,726
sent this video to us.

975
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,479
We will submit it as additional evidence.

976
01:01:10,772 --> 01:01:13,608
That's an altered video!
Is there any proof

977
01:01:13,691 --> 01:01:16,027
that the person in that video
is the plaintiff?

978
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:20,323
I am certain that it is an unverified
and altered video, Your Honor!

979
01:01:24,911 --> 01:01:28,873
Plaintiff, are you sure that isn't you?

980
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:31,834
That's not me.

981
01:01:33,795 --> 01:01:36,798
Then, that means there are
no publicity rights in this video.

982
01:01:37,423 --> 01:01:38,674
To all the journalists here,

983
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:43,262
we will send you the video,
so please upload it as much as you like.

984
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:46,849
-Use it.
-You can modify it like this too.

985
01:01:47,683 --> 01:01:48,643
What?

986
01:01:52,063 --> 01:01:53,564
What on earth?

987
01:01:53,648 --> 01:01:55,066
What are you doing?

988
01:01:56,692 --> 01:01:57,819
You just said

989
01:01:58,736 --> 01:02:01,948
that wasn't you.

990
01:02:03,783 --> 01:02:05,076
Sorry.

991
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:06,744
Your Honor!

992
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:10,081
He's distorting the truth
with an altered video

993
01:02:10,164 --> 01:02:11,749
with an unverified source.

994
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,543
Please intervene and stop him!

995
01:02:14,168 --> 01:02:18,256
Yes. Defense counsel, please refrain
from making unnecessary comments.

996
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:20,466
My apologies, Your Honor.

997
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:24,887
The Court will determine
the authenticity of the submitted video.

998
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:28,349
Then, what about the sexual assault
against the housekeepers?

999
01:02:28,432 --> 01:02:32,186
Aside from the victims' statements,
due to a lack of evidence,

1000
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,313
the Supreme Court reversed the decision.

1001
01:02:35,064 --> 01:02:39,110
Don't you have any videos for this?
If you do, why don't you submit those too?

1002
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:41,153
There is no video.

1003
01:02:41,237 --> 01:02:45,366
Of course not. How could there be
such evidence in a case of gold diggers

1004
01:02:45,449 --> 01:02:48,536
falsely accusing their employer
to extort money--

1005
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:50,997
Instead, we have a witness.

1006
01:02:52,123 --> 01:02:53,207
That is ridiculous…

1007
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:58,671
How can there be a witness
if it had happened inside the house?

1008
01:03:06,888 --> 01:03:07,889
Your Honor.

1009
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:10,683
We request the plaintiff's…

1010
01:03:17,148 --> 01:03:18,149
live-in partner,

1011
01:03:20,026 --> 01:03:21,444
Lee Yun-hui

1012
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,447
as a witness.

1013
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,741
What?

1014
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:57,271
It was all my fault.

1015
01:03:58,314 --> 01:04:00,650
After spending my entire life
in the shadows,

1016
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,444
I moved into his house in my later years

1017
01:04:04,153 --> 01:04:05,404
because of my lingering hope…

1018
01:04:08,824 --> 01:04:10,159
that he'd acknowledge

1019
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,412
his one and only son

1020
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:15,790
as family.

1021
01:04:18,918 --> 01:04:22,088
But that man

1022
01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:25,007
treated me

1023
01:04:25,675 --> 01:04:28,761
worse than used furniture.

1024
01:04:30,596 --> 01:04:32,598
Right before my eyes,

1025
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,477
he sexually harassed the housekeepers.

1026
01:04:38,938 --> 01:04:40,398
When he got drunk at night,

1027
01:04:41,816 --> 01:04:43,609
he'd break into their room

1028
01:04:45,111 --> 01:04:46,320
and act like an animal.

1029
01:04:49,281 --> 01:04:52,243
I kept my mouth closed
even after witnessing that,

1030
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:55,121
so I am an accomplice.

1031
01:04:56,497 --> 01:04:57,581
Please punish me.

1032
01:05:12,763 --> 01:05:14,765
COURT 305, TODAY'S TRIALS

1033
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:15,808
RECESS

1034
01:05:15,891 --> 01:05:16,892
Cigarette.

1035
01:05:17,893 --> 01:05:20,563
-I don't have them, sir.
-You don't even have any damn cigarettes?

1036
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:32,783
Did you coax your mom
into this little scheme of yours?

1037
01:05:32,867 --> 01:05:36,037
You think I'm going to let you two slide?

1038
01:05:36,662 --> 01:05:40,207
I'm not afraid of you anymore, Chairman.

1039
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,168
What?

1040
01:05:47,006 --> 01:05:49,675
Don't go too far.
The trial isn't over yet.

1041
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:02,855
Good job, Mr. Jang.

1042
01:06:02,938 --> 01:06:04,398
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

1043
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:06,317
You should take the baton now, Mr. Kang.

1044
01:06:08,194 --> 01:06:09,361
It's time to strike back.

1045
01:06:14,909 --> 01:06:16,077
Tag me in.

1046
01:06:20,122 --> 01:06:22,541
Your Honor,
the defense submitted today

1047
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,835
an unverified video

1048
01:06:24,919 --> 01:06:27,463
and his attorney's mother as a witness.

1049
01:06:27,546 --> 01:06:31,467
Not enough objective evidence
has been provided, so--

1050
01:06:32,093 --> 01:06:34,804
Plaintiff's counsel, don't get worked up.

1051
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:37,473
This trial has only just begun.

1052
01:06:37,556 --> 01:06:41,727
We have a list of additional witnesses
we'd like to request.

1053
01:06:45,064 --> 01:06:46,941
Your Honor, we first would like to summon

1054
01:06:47,024 --> 01:06:50,528
the one who manipulated a trial
for the plaintiff Jang Hyeon-bae

1055
01:06:50,611 --> 01:06:53,155
and transformed a guilty verdict
to an acquittal.

1056
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:56,283
-The dirty trader in a judge's gown.
-No way.

1057
01:06:56,367 --> 01:06:59,620
We will request Shin Jung-seok…

1058
01:07:02,123 --> 01:07:03,374
as a witness.

1059
01:07:10,756 --> 01:07:12,258
Mr. Kang, by Shin Jung-seok,

1060
01:07:13,259 --> 01:07:15,719
do you mean
a current Supreme Court justice?

1061
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:16,846
Yes, Your Honor.

1062
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:18,556
Your Honor!

1063
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:21,100
This is an insult to the judiciary!

1064
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:24,645
This is public defamation
against one of our nation's justices!

1065
01:07:24,728 --> 01:07:27,439
I am not done yet!

1066
01:07:34,029 --> 01:07:35,322
Justice Shin,

1067
01:07:35,906 --> 01:07:39,201
did you get the research analyst's review
of Chairman Jang's case?

1068
01:07:39,285 --> 01:07:40,369
Not yet, sir.

1069
01:07:41,162 --> 01:07:43,539
Young judges these days
lack a sense of duty.

1070
01:07:44,248 --> 01:07:47,168
Why are they dragging their feet
on such a clear case?

1071
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:50,546
I'll tell them again. Don't worry, sir.

1072
01:07:51,255 --> 01:07:52,506
That fellow, Chairman Jang.

1073
01:07:53,382 --> 01:07:57,136
We need him for our suffering economy.

1074
01:07:57,219 --> 01:08:00,598
Make sure a wise conclusion is reached.

1075
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:03,601
We're in the same boat anyway, right?

1076
01:08:07,479 --> 01:08:10,357
We also request
the mastermind behind all of this,

1077
01:08:10,441 --> 01:08:12,318
the founder of Oh & Partners,

1078
01:08:13,277 --> 01:08:16,739
Dr. Oh Gyu-jang,

1079
01:08:16,822 --> 01:08:19,575
as another witness.

1080
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:11,210
We've stirred up the hornet's nest,
so they can't ignore us.

1081
01:09:11,293 --> 01:09:12,544
We'll have a proper fight.

1082
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:14,630
The trial was suddenly reassigned

1083
01:09:14,713 --> 01:09:17,299
to a new senior chief judge
who's close with Justice Shin.

1084
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:18,467
To uncover the truth,

1085
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:21,178
we request
a confrontation cross-examination

1086
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:23,347
with Jang Hyeon-bae,
Shin Jung-seok, and Oh Gyu-jang.

1087
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,307
Can we do this
as pro bono attorneys though?

1088
01:09:25,391 --> 01:09:28,435
We have to shake things up
to create an opportunity.

1089
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:30,354
It won't be easy
to go up against my father.

1090
01:09:30,437 --> 01:09:32,773
If you want to beat him,
look into the truths.

1091
01:09:32,856 --> 01:09:34,108
What he's hiding.

1092
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:37,611
What if Jang speaks nonsense
in court when I'm not there?

1093
01:09:37,695 --> 01:09:40,447
Is this also a part of your big picture?

1094
01:09:40,531 --> 01:09:43,659
-Are you afraid of something?
-You will be detained immediately.

1095
01:09:43,742 --> 01:09:44,576
Bailiff.

1096
01:09:45,577 --> 01:09:47,121
Why did you want to see me?

1097
01:09:47,204 --> 01:09:49,915
Your lifelong dream
was to be a justice, right?

1098
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:52,334
I'll give you Shin Jung-seok's post.

1099
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,633
