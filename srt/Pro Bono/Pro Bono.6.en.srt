PRO BONO

2
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:42,313
The plaintiff Kaya had already given birth
in her country before she got married.

3
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:46,860
What? What on earth is he talking about?

4
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,862
It's not true, is it?

5
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:51,072
The plaintiff hid the fact
that she had given birth

6
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:52,323
and deceived the defendant

7
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:54,158
for a fraudulent marriage.

8
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,743
Why didn't you tell us?

9
00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:58,872
You gave birth before marriage?
Is that really true, Kaya?

10
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,416
We're in a totally different
situation now.

11
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:04,669
An annulment of marriage
is different from a divorce.

12
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:06,754
It nullifies the marriage itself,

13
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:09,549
so it'll be
as if you were never married at all.

14
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,844
The marriage visa you used to come here
will be canceled.

15
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:15,847
You'll be kicked out
from this country, Kaya!

16
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:17,265
What?

17
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:23,313
PRO BONO

18
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:26,149
It's one problem after another.

19
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:29,193
Just as we uncovered the truth,
a marriage annulment?

20
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:32,530
They want a marriage annulment
after sexually abusing her?

21
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:35,658
This is something
you can't fix with a legal approach.

22
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:37,827
-We need to use our fists!
-Hey!

23
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:39,037
Calm down.

24
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:40,788
No need to get worked up.

25
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:43,833
What we do
is someone else's problem in the end.

26
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,461
What? How could you say
something like that?

27
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,296
With my mouth.

28
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:53,635
-"With my mouth!"
-Ms. Park!

29
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:54,844
Yes?

30
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:58,765
You all remember you have
medical checkups this week, right?

31
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,768
That also includes our new hire, Mr. Kang.

32
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:04,938
Don't miss it this time. Where's Mr. Jang?

33
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:06,231
I can take it.

34
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:08,024
Right now, we don't have time to--

35
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,984
It's company policy for all employees.

36
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:11,569
There's an endoscopy as well,

37
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:14,113
so please start fasting
from the night before.

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,617
Geez. How could the least busy team
not have time?

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,869
Hold on. What did you just say?

40
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:21,329
Have a nice day.

41
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:24,999
Don't get heated.
If they want us to do it, we'll do it.

42
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,044
Do you know you're making me
even more heated?

43
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:31,506
Then, cool down.

44
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,385
BLOOD PRESSURE RANGES

45
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:51,734
I didn't put it in yet.

46
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:54,195
Breathe in.

47
00:02:54,904 --> 00:02:55,863
And hold.

48
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:00,243
Six, two, eight, three, five.

49
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:02,286
-And this?
-8, 3, 5, 2, 9.

50
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,080
-And now?
-5, 9, 6, 4, 2.

51
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:05,164
-And?
-2, 9, 5, 7, 4.

52
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:06,666
-Now?
-3, 8, 2, 3, 7.

53
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:10,795
Four, three…

54
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:13,923
See?

55
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:16,759
My body doesn't respond

56
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:21,472
to anesthesia…

57
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:22,974
What doesn't respond?

58
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:28,104
Ms. Park.

59
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:31,566
You're not getting the endoscopy?

60
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:39,032
We've already returned to work
after finishing our checkups.

61
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:42,744
You're the only one who's late
after making a big fuss.

62
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:49,500
Gosh, it was so hilarious though.
It's a shame only I saw it.

63
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:52,795
What are you talking about?
Did I say something?

64
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,964
Forget it.
Go get changed and come out.

65
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:56,466
Come on out.

66
00:03:57,842 --> 00:03:58,676
What?

67
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,054
What on earth?

SUWON FAMILY COURT
SINGLE-JUDGE DIVISION

69
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:10,855
"Marriage is a sacred promise."

70
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:13,649
"Just as a castle built on sand
doesn't last,

71
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:18,821
a marriage built on lies

00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:21,324
"Judge Gu Ji-won."

73
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:23,117
I admire you, Your Honor.

74
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:27,330
While working
as a family court judge for ten years,

75
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,665
you've emphasized
the importance of being faithful

76
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:31,084
in a marital relationship.

77
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:34,212
Marital history, parental status,
and criminal record.

78
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:35,630
Whatever it may be,

79
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:38,174
when someone married through deception,

80
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:41,010
you didn't hesitate
to annul their marriage.

81
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,887
I've only ruled according to the law.

82
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,097
Yes, Your Honor.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,769
For this case, please render justice
according to the law as well.

84
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:52,563
Article 816, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Act.

85
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:54,649
"When the declaration
of intention to marry

86
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,567
has been made
through fraud or under duress…"

87
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,570
If hiding childbirth history
doesn't fall under this,

88
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:02,657
I don't know what would.

89
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:06,702
Is the plaintiff going to accept
the physical examination

90
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,454
to reveal her childbirth history?

91
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,334
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

92
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:16,629
The physical examination
won't be necessary.

93
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:18,589
That means…

94
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:21,300
We admit the fact
that the plaintiff gave birth…

95
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:24,137
before this marriage.

96
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,849
That damn bitch!

97
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:29,267
Is that true, Ms. Kaya?

98
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,393
Kaya.

99
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:42,071
Yes, Your Honor.

100
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,203
At first, you filed a lawsuit,
claiming your husband strangled you.

101
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:52,915
Now, are you saying
you had a child before your marriage?

102
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:56,377
I don't know which part
of your story is true anymore.

103
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,296
My apologies, Your Honor.

104
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,716
We will make sure
to reveal the whole truth.

105
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:05,595
Please allow us to examine
the plaintiff one more time.

106
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:09,182
WITNESS

107
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:10,683
Thank you, Your Honor.

108
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:13,603
Have you given birth to a child

109
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:16,022
before you got married?

110
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:24,447
Yes.

111
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,992
How old were you then?

112
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:34,415
I was 14 years old.

113
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,045
How old was the child's father?

114
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:43,132
He was 32.

115
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:44,550
Did you know him?

116
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,512
I'd never seen him before.

117
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:54,101
I know it's hard, but please tell us.

118
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,687
What exactly happened?

119
00:07:03,736 --> 00:07:04,654
When I…

120
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:09,408
When I was 13,

121
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,915
I was picking firewood in the mountains.

122
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:27,134
He kidnapped me.

123
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:31,597
And…

124
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,516
No!

125
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,142
No!

126
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,478
It's a lie!

127
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:39,272
Son! Dong-min!

128
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:43,442
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but may we have a short recess?

129
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:49,615
COURT 301, TODAY'S TRIALS

130
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:54,912
It's hard, isn't it?

131
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,373
Ms. Park.

132
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:02,044
This is just the beginning.

133
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:07,091
You have to remember every detail
of that terrible incident

134
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:10,970
and say them as is.

135
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:15,600
A trial can be really cruel.

136
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,815
Kaya. You can do it, right?

137
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:28,529
COURT IN SESSION

138
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,364
-Well done.
-Thank you.

139
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:34,869
Your Honor.

140
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,787
As you have just heard,

141
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:41,375
she was only 13 when she was abducted
by a man in a neighboring village.

142
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,212
She was confined in his house
and sexually assaulted for a week.

143
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:59,101
She had an unwanted pregnancy
as a result of that sexual assault.

144
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:03,272
If necessary, we'll present the neighbors
from her village as witnesses.

145
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:04,231
I'm sorry, but…

146
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:08,444
First off, thank you for the examination.
You prepared very well.

147
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:12,073
But was this information even necessary?

148
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:16,911
Did the defendant's counsel
not hear a word of the examination?

149
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:19,288
When she was 13, she was locked--

150
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:22,083
And so what does that
have to do with this case?

151
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:33,094
I'm not a heartless, merciless person.

152
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:37,932
It must have been terrible to go through
such a thing at a young age.

153
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:42,269
Regardless of the reason she gave birth,

154
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:46,273
I am not here to hold her responsible
for the childbirth itself.

155
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:52,321
I am asking her why she did not tell
her spouse-to-be such an important fact

156
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:55,116
before getting married.

157
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,158
Am I wrong?

158
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:58,452
How is this any different
from a fraudulent car dealer

159
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:01,831
who sells a car
by highlighting only its positive aspects

160
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:03,749
while concealing its negative ones?

161
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,836
The defendant, as you just saw…

162
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,923
He's not someone who can hide anything.

163
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:12,007
But the plaintiff,

164
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:16,887
who is so smart she studied Korean
on her own to speak it fluently,

165
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,973
failed to say a single word to Mr. Cho

166
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:22,309
about this significant matter
before getting married.

167
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:25,896
Is this really being faithful
to one's future spouse?

168
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:30,651
-Then, let me ask the defendant's counsel.
-Yes.

169
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:33,320
Before you got married,
have you told your wife

170
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:37,074
everything about getting bitten by a dog
when you were young?

171
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,785
What kind of pointless question is this?

172
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:41,245
-How is this any different?
-What?

173
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:44,331
The plaintiff was basically bitten
by a mad dog.

174
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:48,377
She was subjected to an assault
completely against her will.

175
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,380
Fundamentally, what's so different?

176
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:54,091
-But still, this is--
-I see.

177
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:55,926
It's different
because it's sexual assault?

178
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:58,387
Because it involves sex?

179
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,347
Then, let me ask you again.

180
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:02,892
Before getting married,
did you tell your wife

181
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,935
about all of your sexual partners

182
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,396
and about when, where,
and every detail of--

183
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,273
What on earth are you doing right now?

184
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:12,526
Plaintiff's counsel,
I see the point you want to make.

185
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,487
But please make your argument
more serious.

186
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:17,573
Did I go overboard?

187
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,409
My apologies if I did, Your Honor.

188
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:25,331
I am just asking whether the argument
that the defense claims is so obvious

189
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,416
is truly obvious.

190
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,586
Still, the history of childbirth
is another story.

191
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,922
"Your wife-to-be has a child."

192
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:35,424
What's more crucial than that?

193
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:39,094
The assailant's parents
took the baby right after it was born.

194
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:42,598
She has never met
or seen the baby since then.

195
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,017
But we can't predict the future, can we?

196
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,646
We also do not know
how giving birth at such a young age

197
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:51,732
will affect
future pregnancies or childbirth.

198
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,567
History of childbirth

199
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:58,614
is one of the most important facts
that must be disclosed before marriage.

200
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,032
Isn't that common sense?

201
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,994
The plaintiff's counsel is desperately
using all sorts of misleading arguments

202
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,957
to divert our attention
from this common sense,

203
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,874
Your Honor.

204
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:17,341
He's a former SPO prosecutor all right.
How do we defend against this?

205
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:22,930
I admit it. That is common sense.

206
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:25,975
It's important.

207
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:28,769
The law should be based on common sense.

208
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:31,855
However, sometimes…

209
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,649
Once in a while,

210
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:36,986
common sense can miss some things.

211
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:42,283
Most people don't experience
what Kaya went through.

212
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:46,412
At the young age of 13, she was kidnapped,
confined, and sexually assaulted.

213
00:12:46,495 --> 00:12:48,497
Common sense can easily fail to grasp

214
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:52,543
the pain and fear of such a person.

215
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,754
To resolve this discrepancy,

216
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,008
the Constitution protects
fundamental human rights.

217
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:00,593
Article 17 of the Constitution.

218
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:01,802
"No citizen shall have

219
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:05,764
their right to privacy and freedom
of private life infringed upon."

220
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:08,684
There are some things in this world

221
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,104
that are just too cruel
to demand disclosure.

222
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:15,357
Yes, it is true
that having a history of pregnancy

223
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:17,026
is an important fact

224
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:19,069
that should be notified
to a future spouse.

225
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:20,279
It's common sense.

226
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:22,281
However, when it comes

227
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:25,701
to basic human rights
protected by the Constitution,

228
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:29,079
shouldn't common sense
at least allow an exception?

229
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:32,499
Compelling a victim of child sexual abuse

230
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,878
to disclose what happened to her…

231
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:38,047
How could… Hey, how could you do that?

232
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:41,759
Your Honor.

233
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,512
Please look
at the big picture of this case.

234
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:49,099
This is the case
of a child sexual abuse victim

235
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,769
requesting to end a marriage
that cannot continue

236
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:56,106
after being sexually abused again
by her father-in-law.

237
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:59,234
But the assailant, her in-laws…

238
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:02,279
Her in-laws,
who haven't apologized at all,

239
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:06,033
are actually trying to use
the child sexual abuse she went through

240
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,120
as a reason to deny
and annul this marriage.

241
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:13,165
According to my common sense,

242
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:15,959
this is the culprit
pretending to be the victim…

243
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,421
and it's despicable retaliation.

244
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:23,175
Your Honor.

245
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:27,179
Between my common sense
and the defense's,

246
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:30,683
I kindly ask you to make a wise judgment
as to which one is correct.

247
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:48,492
Your Honor,
I would also like to add a few words.

248
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,952
I am not saying

249
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:55,165
that the plaintiff should have told
any random person on the street

250
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:57,334
about what she had gone through.

251
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:01,088
We are arguing
she should have told

252
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:04,925
the person she would spend
the rest of her life with,

253
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,510
her spouse-to-be.

254
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:10,305
But she hid the fact
instead of telling him. Why?

255
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:11,724
She knew perfectly well

256
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:15,144
that he wouldn't marry her
once she told the truth.

257
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:19,565
If that's not a fraudulent marriage,
then what is, Your Honor?

258
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:22,526
Despite the fancy arguments made
by the plaintiff's counsel,

259
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:25,571
the nature of the case has not changed.

260
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:27,698
Marriage is a contract.

261
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:31,160
And a fraudulent contract can be annulled.

262
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:35,748
Please rule on the principles, Your Honor.

263
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:49,428
-You did a great job, Mr. Kang.
-You too, Ms. Park.

264
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:53,265
Thank you, both.

265
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,268
Kaya.

266
00:15:56,351 --> 00:16:00,147
This judge is known for being stubborn
and adhering to principles.

267
00:16:01,398 --> 00:16:02,816
She has previously ruled

268
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,569
in favor of annulment before
due to childbirth history.

269
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:09,782
She won't go against
her past rulings that easily.

270
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,825
Even so, it's fine.

271
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:14,828
What?

272
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:18,749
For the first time in my life,
someone stood up for me.

273
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,796
And it was in this faraway land
where I'm a foreigner.

274
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:28,634
Thank you so much.

275
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:43,107
Congratulations, Mr. Kang.

276
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:46,276
-What?
-I think you've taken your first step

277
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,612
as a public interest attorney.

278
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,115
What do you mean by that?

279
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:54,409
You went into a fight,
knowing that you'll lose.

280
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:56,954
That's a pro bono attorney.

281
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:01,083
That is certainly not my thing.

282
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,964
My car is this way.

283
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,549
I know.

284
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:19,518
Civil case number 2025-674221.

285
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:22,646
Civil case number 2025-674519.

286
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:25,399
The Court will deliver the verdict.

287
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:29,153
Article 816, Paragraph 3
of the Civil Act states

288
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:33,365
when the declaration of intention to marry

289
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:35,784
has been made
through fraud or under duress

290
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,914
a spouse can request
to annul the marriage.

291
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:44,293
Before two people enter
the serious promise called marriage,

292
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:46,962
they should not withhold
any lies from each other.

293
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:50,924
Not to mention that having given birth
before the marriage

294
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:55,512
is an important fact that can affect
the marriage in a tremendous way.

295
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:56,972
So of course,

296
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:00,309
a soon-to-be wife is obligated
to notify her potential husband.

297
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,061
However…

298
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:05,105
However,

299
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,861
there are times
when the law must allow exceptions.

300
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,656
It is true that the plaintiff
gave birth to a child,

301
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,075
but it was against her own will,

302
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,579
and she was the victim
of child sexual abuse.

303
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:25,167
And the relationship with the baby
was severed a long time ago.

304
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:28,503
It cannot be denied
that it is excessively cruel

305
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:31,798
to compel the victim of a crime

306
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,635
to bear the duty of disclosing
what they went through.

307
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:40,182
Therefore, the plaintiff's failure
to disclose her childbirth history

308
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:43,393
does not warrant condemnation

309
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:46,355
in light of her duty of good faith.

310
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:48,190
The Court renders the following judgment.

311
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:49,691
The Court orders…

312
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:55,530
the plaintiff and the defendant
to divorce as a result of this case.

313
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:01,328
The defendant's counterclaim is dismissed.

314
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,793
You have won, Plaintiff.

315
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:12,172
This is absurd!

316
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:13,882
This is a scam!

317
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:16,426
-Ridiculous! You bitch!
-Thank you, Your Honor.

318
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:19,346
Let go of me! Mr. Woo!

319
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:20,973
We won!

320
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:23,976
Do I get to live in Korea?

321
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,560
-Really?
-Yes!

322
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:31,191
Thank you, Ms. Park!

323
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:32,442
COURT 301, TODAY'S TRIALS

324
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:36,613
Geez.

325
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:40,450
You upset the order of the court
with cheap sentimentality.

326
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:44,329
-Stop it. You're dropping our standard.
-What? I dropped something?

327
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:54,298
Shut it.

328
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:56,425
See you soon.

329
00:19:57,676 --> 00:20:01,179
Sure, sure.

330
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,142
-Will they appeal?
-Well, it's up to them.

331
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,602
-Anyway, Ms. Park.
-Yes?

332
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:10,188
I'll treat you to a meal since we won.

333
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:12,065
-Now?
-Aren't you hungry?

334
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:17,112
What's he up to?

335
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:20,741
Gosh. This burger is so good.

336
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,702
And the view's great too.

337
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:27,706
What's gotten into you today?

338
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,586
Now that the trial is over,
we need to talk.

339
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:34,504
Attorney Park Gi-ppeum.

340
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:35,922
She's an interesting one.

341
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,175
Ms. Park? Why?

342
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:39,384
She threatened me

343
00:20:40,552 --> 00:20:41,803
with your video.

344
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,015
I heard you saw the video.

345
00:20:48,643 --> 00:20:49,478
Yes.

346
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:54,441
Who sent it?

347
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:56,568
The sender was unknown.

348
00:20:57,194 --> 00:20:59,780
But obviously, it's someone
who wants to attack you.

349
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:01,406
Of course, it's a setup.

350
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,493
Do I look like someone
who would accept a bribe?

351
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:08,497
Right. It would be clumsy of you
to accept it so openly.

352
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,915
Of course. How would I…

353
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,001
Wait a second.

354
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:17,214
You think of me as someone
who does accept bribes then?

355
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:20,092
I rewatched it several times
because it didn't make sense.

356
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:23,011
But no matter how I look at it,
it was you.

357
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:24,721
And there's no trace of manipulation.

358
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,808
I'm disappointed, Ms. Park.

359
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,394
-Disappointed?
-Yes.

360
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:32,687
Based on that single uncertain video,

361
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:35,232
you suddenly started
to treat me as a criminal?

362
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:37,776
Where's the benefit of the doubt?

363
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,987
You're making light of something serious.

364
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:42,030
In what way?

365
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,032
Isn't it suspicious
based on the situation?

366
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:45,409
In what way?

367
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:47,911
-I'm not just talking about the video.
-Then what?

368
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:50,288
You don't have any interest
in pro bono cases.

369
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:53,542
But you suddenly quit as a prominent judge
to be a pro bono attorney?

370
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:55,961
You don't think that's weird?

371
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:58,797
You shouldn't misinterpret
someone's goodwill.

372
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,217
I'm using my experience and skills
to help the socially disadvantaged--

373
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,345
You made a deal
with a 70% winning rate as a condition.

374
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:08,140
My goodness, you didn't know?

375
00:22:08,223 --> 00:22:09,850
He proposed a 70% winning rate.

376
00:22:11,518 --> 00:22:14,813
In return, he wants a recommendation
to be a justice candidate next year.

377
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:18,400
I'll disband Team Pro Bono
if he can't maintain that condition.

378
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:24,531
I didn't know we were working hard

379
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:28,827
to win the bet you made
to become a Supreme Court justice.

380
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,540
I said that to show I'd do my best--

381
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:34,583
I…

382
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:38,253
I still want to believe

383
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:41,965
that you're a good person.

384
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:43,300
What?

385
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:46,303
You look sincere in court
when you make your arguments.

386
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:51,349
But if the others on the team find out,

387
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:55,604
I don't know
if they will still believe in you.

388
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:58,857
-Nan-hui didn't like you in the first--
-Why should I care?

389
00:22:59,482 --> 00:23:01,651
-What?
-Think whatever you want.

390
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:05,030
I don't care about
what others think of me.

391
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:08,033
Whatever my intention is,
I can just win for you guys.

392
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:10,619
Is it fun to win only 20% of the time?
You like that?

393
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:14,748
I mean, losing isn't your hobby. Right?

394
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:21,463
We've done enough team building
for today, so I'll get going.

395
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:24,925
I'll pay for what I ate,
so don't worry about it.

396
00:23:45,654 --> 00:23:48,490
Hello, everyone!

397
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:51,326
Hey, we won. What's with this vibe?

398
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:52,911
DEFENDANT CHO SUBMITS APPEAL

399
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:54,287
-What?
-What is it?

400
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,332
Mr. Woo submitted an appeal.

401
00:23:57,415 --> 00:24:00,377
Really? My goodness.

402
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,796
He's a passionate guy
who doesn't know how to give up.

403
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:04,297
It's because he gets too obsessed.

404
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:07,342
Runner-ups are always like that.

405
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:10,470
What argument
is he going to make this time?

406
00:24:11,054 --> 00:24:12,681
-Will it be okay?
-Will it be all right?

407
00:24:12,764 --> 00:24:16,059
The case already has a touching story.

408
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:16,977
Here.

409
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:19,354
Look.

410
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:22,774
How could he beat this?
He's just being a sore loser.

411
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:24,067
That must be it.

412
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,987
And what's there to worry about
when we have Mr. Kang?

413
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:28,530
Of course.

414
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,950
-Gosh, I hate him.
-Here. Look.

415
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:37,205
SUWON FAMILY COURT,
APPELLATE COURT

416
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:38,206
Ms. Kaya,

417
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:40,667
after that man kidnapped you,

418
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:43,420
how long did you stay at his house?

419
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:45,755
For about nine months.

420
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,633
That's almost a year.

421
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:50,885
During that long period of time,

422
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:54,139
were you confined
in some kind of locked room?

423
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,435
-No.
-Really?

424
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:01,062
Then, why didn't you run away?

425
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:05,859
Did the man treat you so well
that you didn't miss your mom?

426
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,569
Your Honor.

427
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:10,071
Mr. Woo, please be mindful
of your wording.

428
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:11,906
Yes, I will, Your Honor.

429
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,658
Ms. Kaya, let me ask you again.

430
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:16,619
Why didn't you run away?

431
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:18,204
I did.

432
00:25:27,547 --> 00:25:28,882
A week after I was kidnapped.

433
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:33,219
And then, after that,
you came back to the man's house.

434
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,347
You came back voluntarily?

435
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,099
I didn't go back because I wanted to!

436
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,482
My child! You must've been so scared.

437
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:48,193
Mom…

438
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,197
Mom…

439
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,114
Go back!

440
00:25:53,782 --> 00:25:56,242
-Dad.
-You've already lost your worth

441
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:58,661
and dignity as a girl.

442
00:25:58,745 --> 00:26:00,330
Do you understand that?

443
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:04,876
Who would ever marry you in now?
There is nothing we can do.

444
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:07,754
When he comes,
go live with him in his village.

445
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:09,798
-Honey!
-You be quiet!

446
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:11,925
-Dad!
-Go back! Get out!

447
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,302
Mom, please help me!

448
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:16,763
Mom, I don't want to go!

449
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,932
Mom, I'm scared!

450
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:20,934
Mom!

451
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:25,188
Your parents sent you back to him.

452
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,190
"Go live with him in his village."

453
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:30,860
Isn't that an approval
of the marriage then?

454
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:34,114
Right?

455
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:36,950
Marriage?

456
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:41,079
You call that marriage?

457
00:26:41,162 --> 00:26:44,416
Isn't it? You lived at your in-laws' house
with permission from your parents.

458
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:48,753
That man hit me every day!

459
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,549
And every night…

460
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:57,345
I was violated.

461
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:03,560
I was only 13 years old, sir.

462
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:06,771
Still, if you lived with him
for nine months,

463
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:10,108
wouldn't you say
you had a stable relationship?

464
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:18,491
I ran away again

465
00:27:18,575 --> 00:27:20,326
after nine months.

466
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:22,370
What about the childbirth?

467
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:25,331
-You didn't give birth at his house?
-No!

468
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:36,134
I couldn't live in that hell anymore,

469
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:38,720
so I ran away and went back home!

470
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:44,142
While I was pregnant.

471
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:47,687
Did you give birth at your home then?

472
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:53,568
No.

473
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:55,778
Why not?

474
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:06,331
Mom, Dad!
Open the door for me, please!

475
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:08,666
-My child!
-Mom!

476
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,834
My child, are you okay?

477
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:11,878
Honey!

478
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:13,421
-Go back now!
-Dad!

479
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:16,341
Why didn't you listen to me?
Why did you decide to come back?

480
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:17,675
With that body of yours,

481
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:20,303
it will bring us bad luck! Go back now!

482
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:21,221
Go! Get out!

483
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:23,473
My child!

484
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:25,600
Mom! Dad!

485
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,393
Mom!

486
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:29,229
My father

487
00:28:30,313 --> 00:28:32,565
didn't let me back in the house.

488
00:28:36,486 --> 00:28:37,695
I…

489
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:41,699
I gave birth there…

490
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:46,329
KAYA

491
00:28:47,622 --> 00:28:49,541
…with the help of others.

492
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,294
I see.

493
00:28:55,463 --> 00:28:56,464
Okay.

494
00:28:57,632 --> 00:28:58,925
Thank you, Ms. Kaya.

495
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,386
Nothing further, Your Honor.

496
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:21,447
The Court will deliver the verdict.

497
00:29:22,657 --> 00:29:25,076
According to the proceedings
of this appeal case,

498
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,372
it is true that the plaintiff
was kidnapped and sexually abused,

499
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:33,918
but it is also true she lived with the man
for approximately nine months.

500
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:36,629
-However…
-However…

501
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:40,967
Moreover,
considering the date of childbirth,

502
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,553
the plaintiff became pregnant

503
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:46,347
not during the first time
she was kidnapped

504
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:48,641
but during the time she lived with the man

505
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:51,144
under the permission of her parents.

506
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:54,314
No way.

507
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:56,357
Considering all of these circumstances,

508
00:29:56,441 --> 00:30:00,486
it is hard to say
the plaintiff's pregnancy and childbirth

509
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,822
seriously harmed her reputation.

510
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:04,282
That's nonsense!

511
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:07,118
-Bailiff.
-Yes, Your Honor. Please be seated.

512
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:10,038
We will continue.

513
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:13,958
Thus, compelling the plaintiff
to bear the duty of disclosing such facts

514
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:16,502
does not excessively infringe
on her right to privacy

515
00:30:16,586 --> 00:30:18,588
and freedom of private life.

516
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:22,133
The act of not disclosing
her history of childbirth

517
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:24,093
is a cause for annulling the marriage.

518
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:28,389
And so, the Court renders
the following judgment.

519
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,894
The first trial's ruling, which reached
a different conclusion, is reversed.

520
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:36,773
The marriage reported
to the chief of the town

521
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:40,109
on March 13, 2023, is annulled.

522
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,782
The plaintiff will pay the defendant
10 million won in compensation.

523
00:30:45,865 --> 00:30:46,783
Your Honor.

524
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:49,452
-Thank you!
-This concludes the Court's decision.

525
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:57,460
What does that mean, Ms. Park?

526
00:30:59,003 --> 00:31:00,296
Did we lose?

527
00:31:02,256 --> 00:31:03,675
Kaya…

528
00:31:18,064 --> 00:31:21,067
Her father gave his permission,

529
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:24,278
so it's not sexual assault.

530
00:31:27,156 --> 00:31:30,410
What kind of crap is that?

531
00:31:30,493 --> 00:31:31,911
Hey, that was mine.

532
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:33,413
Damn it.

533
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:35,957
This doesn't make sense!

534
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,125
I mean, how can they…

535
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:41,212
Hold on.

536
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:44,882
Mr. Cho is a governor
with a big local influence.

537
00:31:45,842 --> 00:31:46,843
Who's their assemblyman?

538
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:51,973
Lee Du-cheol.

539
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:54,267
It's Assemblyman Lee Du-cheol. Wait.

540
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,978
A former chief prosecutor
and three-term assemblyman?

541
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:01,566
No way! He's the plaintiff's father
from Byeol's case!

542
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:03,109
Judge Kang, that fool.

543
00:32:03,192 --> 00:32:05,111
He just called and threatened me.

544
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:08,281
He said you abused an animal.

545
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:11,868
I just got goosebumps!
Was it external pressure? Or connections?

546
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:14,370
If it was that kind of reason,

547
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:16,789
it would've been better.

548
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:17,874
What do you mean?

549
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:21,794
I got goosebumps when I heard
the grounds for the verdict.

550
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:25,840
She was certain
it was correct from a legal standpoint.

551
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:30,511
"She got pregnant after the sexual abuse.
She should've notified him."

552
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:35,475
She looked so calm,
as if she were solving a math problem.

553
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:40,605
Those darn legal principles
are like some kind of monster!

554
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:43,191
Doesn't the law exist for the people?

555
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:45,109
The law isn't the monster.

556
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:50,198
It's the indifference of judges
who treat it like a math problem.

557
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,498
Let's go to the Supreme Court.

558
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:11,886
Kaya is really amazing.

559
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:14,097
I got her a used sewing machine,

560
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:18,810
and she's about to hold
a fashion show at the shelter.

561
00:33:20,603 --> 00:33:21,521
How cute!

562
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:22,605
-Is it nice?
-Yes.

563
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:26,818
President Choi Yeong-seop
will deliver a historic speech

564
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:29,070
at the UN General Assembly in two months.

565
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:32,698
The speech is to celebrate
World Refugee Day.

566
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:36,160
It is expected to show the world
Korea's current status

567
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:39,330
as a leader in not only economy
and culture but also…

568
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:40,706
-Kaya.
-…in human rights.

569
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,125
Are you okay?

570
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:43,918
Yes.

571
00:33:44,585 --> 00:33:45,795
I'm fine.

572
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:49,298
You're the ones
who are having a tough time.

573
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:50,800
No.

574
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,139
Though we lost the appeal,
at the Supreme Court, we'll--

575
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:57,306
I'm not worried.

576
00:33:58,141 --> 00:34:00,059
I believe.

577
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,686
You believe?

578
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:07,733
Bad things can happen anywhere.

579
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:11,445
But Korea is amazing

580
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:15,491
because it corrects everything in the end.

581
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,287
You get rid of presidents
if they do something wrong.

582
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:24,709
My father-in-law is a powerful man,
but you arrested him right away.

583
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:27,378
I believe

584
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:31,507
that our trial will also turn out well.

585
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,467
Yes.

586
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,846
I'll make sure that happens, Kaya.

587
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,978
SUWON DISTRICT COURT,
CRIMINAL PANEL DIVISION

588
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:47,106
In this case,
the father-in-law sexually assaulted

589
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,068
his lonely daughter-in-law,
who had come from a distant land.

590
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:54,197
Under Article 5, Paragraph 1
of the Act on Special Cases

591
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,407
Concerning the Punishment
of Sexual Crimes,

592
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:59,869
it is a felony with a fixed term
of over seven years in prison,

593
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:04,248
and the defendant
has to be held fully accountable.

594
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:08,586
The Court cannot dare to imagine

595
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:14,342
the pain the victim is enduring
because of this.

596
00:35:15,843 --> 00:35:18,638
-Therefore…
-Therefore…

597
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:20,264
-However…
-What?

598
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:21,557
…the defendant is of old age,

599
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:26,646
and hundreds of local residents
have appealed for clemency.

600
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:30,191
Moreover, he is a first-time offender
without any criminal history.

601
00:35:30,274 --> 00:35:33,194
No way. He isn't building up
to a suspended sentence, is he?

602
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:36,614
The statutory penalty is seven years.
A reduction is three years and six months.

603
00:35:36,697 --> 00:35:40,159
A suspended sentence is possible
for up to three years. It won't happen.

604
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:42,787
Meanwhile, many residents testified

605
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:47,041
and criticized how the victim
typically dressed and behaved.

606
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:51,045
Considering the annulment of her marriage

607
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:54,382
due to the victim's premarital childbirth
and fraudulent act,

608
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:59,011
these testimonies cannot be taken lightly.

609
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:02,848
At the time of the incident,
the defendant was heavily intoxicated,

610
00:36:02,932 --> 00:36:05,268
and as a result,
he lacked the capacity for judgment

611
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:08,020
or the ability to make decisions.

612
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:12,692
With diminished mental capacity
as the first mitigating factor

613
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:15,695
and the various aforementioned facts
as the second,

614
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:19,573
the Court renders the following judgment
mitigated at its discretion

615
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,742
within the applicable sentencing range.

616
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:24,996
Double mitigation? No way.

617
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:28,040
The defendant is sentenced
to three years in prison.

618
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,294
However, this sentence

619
00:36:31,377 --> 00:36:34,380
will be suspended for five years
from the date of this ruling.

620
00:36:34,463 --> 00:36:36,382
-What the…
-Order in the court.

621
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:40,219
To hold the defendant fully accountable,

622
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:42,388
the Court imposes
200 hours of community service

623
00:36:42,888 --> 00:36:46,851
and 80 hours
of sexual violence treatment courses.

624
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:50,021
This concludes the Court's ruling.

625
00:36:51,939 --> 00:36:53,524
All rise.

626
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:10,499
Thank you, Mr. Woo.

627
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,213
But aren't those too many hours
for community service?

628
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:18,049
Geez, Mr. Cho.

629
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:21,052
You have always
provided service for the community.

630
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:23,054
You can do a little more.

631
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:24,680
Okay. Have a good day.

632
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:26,265
All right. Goodbye.

633
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:32,229
After sitting on the judge's bench
for so long, I'd forgotten…

634
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:43,657
the despair you feel below the bench.

635
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:51,874
What?

636
00:37:51,957 --> 00:37:53,751
What? What is it now?

637
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:56,212
Kaya's final appeal was dismissed.

638
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:57,546
-What?
-What?

639
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,632
Nonsense. We just filed that appeal.

640
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:00,883
Let me see.

641
00:38:01,425 --> 00:38:03,469
How could it be so fast?
That was the final appeal.

642
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:06,472
This means it was dismissed
as soon as the petition was submitted.

643
00:38:06,972 --> 00:38:07,973
Who's the justice?

644
00:38:08,974 --> 00:38:10,684
It's Justice Shin Jung-seok.

645
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:11,977
Justice Shin Jung-seok?

646
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,272
Wasn't he your court chief
when you were a judge?

647
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:19,068
I trusted and guided you

648
00:38:19,151 --> 00:38:21,946
when you were a nobody
without a college degree.

649
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:25,324
How could you betray me like this,
you snake?

650
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,120
If the appeal is dismissed,
the marriage annulment becomes final.

651
00:38:30,037 --> 00:38:32,957
Kaya's visa will be canceled,
and she'll be deported!

652
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,041
Oh, no.

653
00:38:44,093 --> 00:38:45,010
Mr. Kang.

654
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:46,762
Mr. Kang?

655
00:38:48,597 --> 00:38:50,599
-Mr. Kang!
-Where are you going?

656
00:39:20,754 --> 00:39:24,842
For the first time in my life,
someone stood up for me.

657
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:29,763
And it was in this faraway land
where I'm a foreigner.

658
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:38,355
In my address to the UN General Assembly
to celebrate World Refugee Day,

659
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:42,443
I will proudly illustrate
how Korea will lead the world

660
00:39:42,526 --> 00:39:46,363
not only in economy and culture
but also in human rights--

661
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:49,533
Don't make me laugh.

662
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:09,303
Ms. Park. You're already here?

663
00:40:09,845 --> 00:40:12,223
-Why are you here so late?
-What?

664
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:13,724
I've already finished the draft

665
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:17,144
of the deportation deferral request
to send to the Ministry of Justice.

666
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:20,731
What about the others?

667
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:25,319
They're researching data
on the Immigration Act in the archives.

668
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:28,697
-Did you sleep well?
-Hello, sir.

669
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:32,368
What about Mr. Jang?

670
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:36,830
He is at the Immigration Office
while you ran away.

671
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,625
Ran away? Don't be ridiculous.

672
00:40:42,044 --> 00:40:43,379
Are you going to give up?

673
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:46,173
We have to find some sort of way.

674
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:56,809
Who says I'm giving up?

675
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:58,894
How much have you prepared so far?

676
00:40:59,603 --> 00:41:00,437
Let's get started.

677
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:06,193
When the annulment of marriage
is finalized,

678
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:08,696
the Ministry of Justice
and the Immigration Office

679
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:10,864
notify the residency termination
right away.

680
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:12,950
Now, we're really fighting
against time here.

681
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:15,244
Yes, Article 46, Paragraph 1
of the Immigration Act.

682
00:41:15,327 --> 00:41:17,037
It becomes the reason for deportation…

683
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:18,539
Here.

684
00:41:18,622 --> 00:41:19,582
-Take a look.
-Mr. Kang.

685
00:41:19,665 --> 00:41:21,584
Could you look at this?

686
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,173
Well, we can't just sit by and watch.

687
00:41:28,257 --> 00:41:29,717
There's the suspension of execution

688
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,052
in Article 23
of the Administrative Litigation Act.

689
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:36,056
We can buy time if we file it
along with a deportation annulment suit.

690
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,474
But there's a problem.

691
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:40,644
The current Immigration Act
doesn't allow a suspension of execution.

692
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,940
We have to carry out
a media campaign at the same time.

693
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:50,279
Okay. There's one conclusion then.

694
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:53,324
First, immediately file
a deportation annulment suit.

695
00:41:53,907 --> 00:41:56,493
Second, accompany it with a request
for suspension of execution.

696
00:41:56,577 --> 00:42:00,956
Third, emphasize humanitarian reasons
to pressure the court to decide…

697
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:09,423
We have to get
the documents ready by tonight.

698
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,718
When they issue the protection order,
she'll be repatriated…

699
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,305
in a short amount time.

700
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:20,726
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
SUWON IMMIGRATION OFFICE

701
00:42:40,663 --> 00:42:41,789
Damn it.

702
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:44,875
How did it go?

703
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:47,211
It got suspended, right?

704
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:50,923
It was dismissed?

705
00:42:52,174 --> 00:42:54,218
Let's post it
on the national petition site.

706
00:42:54,301 --> 00:42:56,679
-And let the media know.
-It's pointless.

707
00:42:56,762 --> 00:42:58,430
They're deporting her tomorrow

708
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,225
with other illegal aliens.

709
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,018
What? What did you say?

710
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:06,563
No way. What is this?

711
00:43:07,272 --> 00:43:08,399
That's ridiculous.

712
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:12,069
They're going to let the man
who committed sexual assault go

713
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:14,697
and deport the victim?

714
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:18,283
What kind of country is this?

715
00:43:24,915 --> 00:43:26,083
Stand right here.

716
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,169
One, two, three, four, five, six…

717
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:32,756
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

718
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,300
I need to go home…

719
00:43:35,384 --> 00:43:36,677
-Okay, all right.
-Excuse me.

720
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,512
Sir, I haven't been paid yet.

721
00:43:38,595 --> 00:43:40,472
-I need that money.
-Okay, all right.

722
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:42,766
Okay, let's come forward. Please line up.

723
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,102
Follow me. Please come inside.

724
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:49,523
Do not talk to each other. This way.

725
00:43:49,606 --> 00:43:50,816
Slowly.

726
00:43:50,899 --> 00:43:52,317
Hold on!

727
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:55,863
Mr. Kang.

728
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:57,865
I'm Kaya's attorney.

729
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,660
We officially request
her immediate release.

730
00:44:01,744 --> 00:44:04,621
This person's visa was canceled,
so she does have to be deported.

731
00:44:04,705 --> 00:44:05,706
On behalf of Kaya,

732
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:09,334
who's been persecuted in this country…

733
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,296
What kind of country is this?

734
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,549
Let's seek asylum.

735
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:18,510
Pardon? What did you say?

736
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,931
Let's apply for asylum…

737
00:44:24,475 --> 00:44:26,310
from this country at once.

738
00:44:27,811 --> 00:44:28,812
Asylum?

739
00:44:28,896 --> 00:44:30,147
Mr. Kang.

740
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,692
Under Article 5, Paragraph 6
of the Refugee Act,

741
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:35,152
a refugee applicant may stay

742
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:38,530
in the Republic of Korea
until a final decision is made

743
00:44:39,156 --> 00:44:41,074
regarding the recognition
of refugee status.

744
00:44:46,038 --> 00:44:47,164
Let Kaya go.

745
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:49,374
Right now.

746
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:57,090
SEOUL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

747
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:58,675
REFUGEE STATUS DENIAL ANNULMENT SUIT

748
00:45:04,223 --> 00:45:05,682
Order in the court.

749
00:45:05,766 --> 00:45:07,643
-Plaintiff's counsel.
-Yes, Your Honor?

750
00:45:07,726 --> 00:45:08,977
What is the meaning of this?

751
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:10,938
Is this trial is a joke?

752
00:45:11,021 --> 00:45:12,564
Of course not.

753
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:17,402
I'm just in an annulment suit
of a refugee status denial.

754
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:20,989
I officially requested the defendant,
the Chief of the Immigration Office,

755
00:45:21,073 --> 00:45:25,953
to recognize the plaintiff, Kaya,
as a refugee,

756
00:45:26,036 --> 00:45:27,162
but it was denied.

757
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:29,706
So, we have simply filed suit
to annul the decision.

758
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:32,209
No, what I mean is

759
00:45:32,751 --> 00:45:35,796
how is the plaintiff a refugee?

760
00:45:36,797 --> 00:45:39,132
She came to Korea two years ago

761
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:41,468
through an international marriage.

762
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:42,594
Your Honor.

763
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:45,639
You know what the plaintiff
has been through.

764
00:45:46,223 --> 00:45:48,559
From her father-in-law
sexually assaulting her

765
00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:50,936
to a marriage annulment suit
and deportation.

766
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:53,605
What do they have to do
with refugee application?

767
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:55,357
According to Supreme Court precedent,

768
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,026
persecution that requires
recognition of refugee status is…

769
00:45:59,778 --> 00:46:02,698
"a threat to the life, body, or freedom

770
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:04,241
as well as the act

771
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:08,579
of violating and discriminating
the fundamental dignity of humans."

772
00:46:09,371 --> 00:46:13,208
If what she had experienced
wasn't persecution, then what is?

773
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,002
Let's say it was.

774
00:46:15,085 --> 00:46:19,423
Then, why on earth did you apply
for refugee status so absurdly…

775
00:46:19,506 --> 00:46:21,049
Asylum?

776
00:46:22,426 --> 00:46:23,635
Where?

777
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:26,221
America? France?

778
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:29,683
Why does she seek refuge in Korea?

779
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:33,103
You said she was persecuted in Korea.

780
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:34,563
Then of course,

781
00:46:34,646 --> 00:46:37,316
common sense would be
to seek refugee status

782
00:46:37,399 --> 00:46:40,193
or asylum in a different country.

783
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:43,363
Why is she seeking asylum
in the Republic of Korea?

784
00:46:48,243 --> 00:46:50,996
-Is that the real Republic of Korea?
-What?

785
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:55,250
Your Honor, I'm asking
the judiciary of the Republic of Korea.

786
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:59,046
A country that releases offenders
of sexual assault and deports the victims.

787
00:46:59,963 --> 00:47:02,132
A country that treats someone
as a marriage scammer

788
00:47:02,215 --> 00:47:04,426
for hiding her past
as a child sexual abuse victim.

789
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:07,179
Is that kind of country
the real Republic of Korea?

790
00:47:07,846 --> 00:47:10,140
After being a leader
in economy and culture,

791
00:47:10,223 --> 00:47:13,560
this country now boasts to the world
of being a leader in human rights.

792
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:16,063
That is the Republic of Korea I know.

793
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,690
Your Honor, don't tell me

794
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:22,819
you acknowledge that barbaric country

795
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:27,991
that trampled on the plaintiff's dignity
as the Republic of Korea, do you?

796
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:28,992
Your Honor,

797
00:47:29,076 --> 00:47:32,287
the plaintiff's counsel is employing
ridiculous and misleading arguments.

798
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:35,791
If this country isn't Korea,
then where on earth are we?

799
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:40,587
Then, let me use the legal reasoning
that the defendant's counsel loves.

800
00:47:41,546 --> 00:47:44,716
According to the Constitution,
the territory of the Republic of Korea

801
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,761
consists of the Korean peninsula
and all of its adjacent islands.

802
00:47:47,844 --> 00:47:50,263
It's just that the territory
north of the MDL

803
00:47:50,347 --> 00:47:53,100
is effectively occupied
by the North Korean government,

804
00:47:53,183 --> 00:47:55,519
a legally defined
anti-government organization.

805
00:47:55,602 --> 00:48:00,315
As you can see, different countries
can exist within Korean territory.

806
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:04,236
A country that neglects victims
and is generous only to assailants.

807
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:07,864
A country that ignores the powerless
and protects the powerful.

808
00:48:08,615 --> 00:48:12,160
A country of assailants,
their protectors, and bystanders.

809
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:16,873
Surely, that can't be
all there is in Korea.

810
00:48:16,957 --> 00:48:20,377
They're just occupying
a part of the territory effectively.

811
00:48:21,044 --> 00:48:24,923
Because Kaya was persecuted
in that barbaric country,

812
00:48:25,507 --> 00:48:28,719
we go to the only legal government
in this territory,

813
00:48:28,802 --> 00:48:32,472
and we seek asylum
in the free and just Republic of Korea.

814
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:43,316
Which version of Korea is yours,
Your Honor?

815
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:49,614
Which country's judiciary are you part of?

816
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:52,159
Mr. Kang!

817
00:48:58,373 --> 00:48:59,541
We will take a brief recess.

818
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:03,879
Both counsels,
I want to see you in my chambers.

819
00:49:05,505 --> 00:49:07,090
All rise.

820
00:49:13,054 --> 00:49:14,473
We're coming in, sir.

821
00:49:23,899 --> 00:49:25,567
Judge Kang Da-wit!

822
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:28,653
I'm an attorney now, Your Honor.

823
00:49:28,737 --> 00:49:32,491
For someone who used to be a judge,
what on earth are you doing?

824
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:35,911
I've served this country
my entire life as a patriot.

825
00:49:35,994 --> 00:49:39,498
And now, all I'm waiting for
is the day I can honorably retire!

826
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:43,293
Do you expect me
to play along in this clown show?

827
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:45,587
A clown show?

828
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:49,299
Sure, I may be a clown.

829
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:52,302
But this trial isn't a clown show.

830
00:49:52,844 --> 00:49:55,597
It's a desperate fight.

831
00:49:58,683 --> 00:49:59,601
Your Honor.

832
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,979
Are you sure

833
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,732
this is a trial you're trying to win?

834
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,530
Isn't this just a trial you're using
to publicly embarrass the country?

835
00:50:11,613 --> 00:50:14,157
You have a horde of reporters
in the first row!

836
00:50:14,241 --> 00:50:17,494
You keep saying "Republic of Korea"!

837
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,581
What are you trying to do
by exposing my country's flaws?

838
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:25,085
Don't you have
the slightest bit of patriotism?

839
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:28,046
He's always been someone
who'd do anything to win.

840
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:30,048
This ridiculous trial is…

841
00:50:31,216 --> 00:50:33,426
Please end it immediately, Your Honor.

842
00:50:35,971 --> 00:50:39,224
I started this trial
because I believe in my country.

843
00:50:39,307 --> 00:50:42,310
If you end this trial
before giving us a chance to fight,

844
00:50:42,394 --> 00:50:45,522
can I take that as you running away
because you're scared of me?

845
00:50:49,442 --> 00:50:52,112
Someone as yourself who served
in the almighty Marine Corps?

846
00:50:52,195 --> 00:50:53,655
Come on. No way.

847
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:58,076
What did you just say?

848
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,163
Come here. Come out from there!

849
00:51:06,668 --> 00:51:07,961
Are you okay?

850
00:51:08,044 --> 00:51:11,131
Judge Cho Gang-yeol is infamous
for being hot-tempered and stubborn.

851
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:13,800
He didn't kick you or anything, did he?

852
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:16,052
Gosh, I would appreciate that.

853
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:19,097
I'd throw myself on the floor,
sue the country for compensation,

854
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,807
and broadcast it live.

855
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:25,854
I'm glad the trial got a continuance,
but will it be okay?

856
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:30,567
Mentally, I agree 100% with you
in your argument.

857
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:32,444
-But legally…
-Of course…

858
00:51:34,154 --> 00:51:35,488
Of course, we'll lose.

859
00:51:35,572 --> 00:51:37,032
What? If you know that, then why…

860
00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:40,410
You said there are trials you have to do
despite knowing that you'll lose.

861
00:51:41,286 --> 00:51:44,414
You said that's the job
of a pro bono attorney.

862
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,126
Well…

863
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:52,005
After making precedents by fighting
in trials that are hard to win,

864
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:53,757
we can change the world one day.

865
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,342
That's what I meant.

866
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:56,509
Right now, Kaya needs--

867
00:51:56,593 --> 00:51:59,387
I'm not interested in changing the world.

868
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:03,600
-I'm only interested in winning my case.
-You said we'd lose.

869
00:52:03,683 --> 00:52:07,103
We'd lose the trial,
but we'll win the case.

870
00:52:08,146 --> 00:52:10,774
At the very least, time is on our side.

871
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:12,817
What do you mean?

872
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:16,196
It's in a month and a half.

873
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:18,114
World Refugee Day.

874
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:23,745
World Refugee Day.

875
00:52:23,828 --> 00:52:26,623
President Choi Yeong-seop
will deliver a historic speech

876
00:52:26,706 --> 00:52:27,791
at the UN General Assembly.

877
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,001
The president.

878
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:32,045
The UN speech!

879
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:34,631
I've contacted every reporter I know,

880
00:52:34,714 --> 00:52:36,925
so news should be flooding
the internet by now.

881
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:40,220
This will rock the Ministry of Justice,
which is the ministry in charge.

882
00:52:40,303 --> 00:52:42,931
The President is on course
to embarrass himself at the UN.

883
00:52:44,015 --> 00:52:45,475
They'll ask for a deal.

884
00:52:46,142 --> 00:52:50,313
The key to this trial
is to stir up the world,

885
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:52,065
so they can't ignore it.

886
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,902
You're quick, Ms. Park.

887
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:58,196
All right, everyone. Do you remember?

888
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:01,700
The last scene
of Ms. Park's favorite courtroom film?

889
00:53:02,283 --> 00:53:03,785
What? What is it?

890
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:11,710
Okay. I will now call out the names.

891
00:53:13,044 --> 00:53:14,254
Attorney Kang Da-wit.

892
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:18,591
Present. I'll get going first.

893
00:53:18,675 --> 00:53:19,676
What?

894
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:22,595
Attorney Jang Yeong-sil.

895
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:25,306
Present. I'll get going too.

896
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:28,309
Where on earth are you going?

897
00:53:28,393 --> 00:53:29,728
Attorney Hwang Jun-u.

898
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:32,480
What?

899
00:53:32,981 --> 00:53:34,315
Take good care of the office.

900
00:53:34,399 --> 00:53:36,693
Okay. Wait, no.

901
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:38,987
Gi-ppeum, where are you going?

902
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:41,072
What movie is it?

903
00:53:50,123 --> 00:53:51,332
You may be seated.

904
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:58,381
What is going on?

905
00:53:58,465 --> 00:54:02,218
Why are there so many attorneys here?

906
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:05,055
Attorney Han, what is going on?

907
00:54:05,138 --> 00:54:06,264
Your Honor.

908
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:09,976
We're attorneys from the public interest
and human rights foundation Donggam.

909
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:15,815
As we agree with the intent of this trial,
we have joined as co-counsels.

910
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:20,820
We're attorneys
from the nonprofit organization Neolli.

911
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:24,324
We would also like to join as co-counsels.

912
00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:27,494
We're attorneys from the foundation
Gyeongcheon, Your Honor.

913
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:32,373
The clients we have represented
are here in this courtroom today.

914
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:36,753
They are the victims of the country

915
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,214
that persecuted the plaintiff Kaya.

916
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,634
May I request a moment for them to speak?

917
00:54:46,096 --> 00:54:46,930
Go ahead.

918
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,398
I'm a victim of dating abuse.

919
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,152
I mustered the courage to report it,

920
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:06,533
but the police forced me to settle,
saying it was a matter between lovers.

921
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:12,455
I'm a victim
of workplace sexual harassment.

922
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,502
The assailant, who was my superior,
said he was drunk and avoided punishment.

923
00:55:17,585 --> 00:55:21,214
After raising the issue, only I was fired.

924
00:55:24,384 --> 00:55:25,218
I'm…

925
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,515
I am a victim of child sexual abuse.

926
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,061
That horrifying memory
is still vivid in my mind.

927
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:39,691
But that monster has already been released
and moved to a neighborhood nearby mine.

928
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:44,696
What kind of country is this?

929
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,076
In addition to these people,

930
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:55,540
numerous people have been victimized
like Kaya by this barbaric country.

931
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,338
Our group of attorneys feels the same way.

932
00:56:02,422 --> 00:56:06,092
No longer do we want to live in a country

933
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:08,845
that ignores victims

934
00:56:10,346 --> 00:56:11,806
and protects assailants.

935
00:56:16,144 --> 00:56:17,478
Your Honor,

936
00:56:18,396 --> 00:56:22,317
please accept our application
for asylum from everyone here.

937
00:56:23,401 --> 00:56:25,612
-Please accept it.
-Please accept it.

938
00:56:34,621 --> 00:56:37,373
The Pro Bono Avengers
are pretty incredible.

939
00:56:37,457 --> 00:56:39,542
They're all experienced fighters.

940
00:56:42,629 --> 00:56:44,547
All right, I understand.

941
00:56:44,631 --> 00:56:45,590
So please be seated.

942
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:48,426
Plaintiff's counsel, please continue.

943
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:49,761
Your Honor,

944
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:53,264
these people here aren't the only ones
who are applying for refugee status.

945
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:57,185
Please accept my application for asylum!

946
00:56:58,394 --> 00:57:02,106
WE SEEK ASYLUM
REFUGEES ARE PEOPLE TOO

947
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:08,863
-We seek asylum!
-We seek asylum!

948
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:12,700
Wait.

949
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:16,746
There are this many angry people
who are willing

950
00:57:17,413 --> 00:57:18,998
to make themselves refugees?

951
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:21,876
Your Honor, the plaintiff is trying
to hold a trial by media

952
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,128
by dragging in external forces.

953
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:27,715
They're making all this chaos
for just one foreign woman.

954
00:57:28,299 --> 00:57:31,761
This trial is an embarrassment to Korea
that harms national interest--

955
00:57:31,844 --> 00:57:33,304
One foreign woman?

956
00:57:33,388 --> 00:57:34,430
Am I wrong?

957
00:57:34,514 --> 00:57:37,141
Does defense counsel still think
this doesn't concern you?

958
00:57:38,476 --> 00:57:42,730
This can happen to anyone, not just Kaya.

959
00:57:42,814 --> 00:57:43,731
It's a case

960
00:57:43,815 --> 00:57:46,150
where universal women's rights
were violated.

961
00:57:47,902 --> 00:57:49,904
You said it harms national interest?

962
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,116
Look at the photos.

963
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:57,579
Foreign workers working in factories.

964
00:57:57,662 --> 00:58:00,164
Foreign daughters-in-law working on farms.

965
00:58:00,915 --> 00:58:04,294
These people came from far away

966
00:58:04,377 --> 00:58:07,630
to take care of the farms
that we abandoned.

967
00:58:12,552 --> 00:58:13,386
Your Honor,

968
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:17,348
we're living in a global world

969
00:58:17,432 --> 00:58:21,185
where it's meaningless
to talk about nationalities.

970
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:24,564
Goodness, today,

971
00:58:24,647 --> 00:58:28,735
we have attorneys
from big firms here en masse.

972
00:58:29,277 --> 00:58:30,236
Mr. Woo.

973
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,281
All of your children
are US citizens, aren't they?

974
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,824
Congratulations.

975
00:58:34,907 --> 00:58:38,620
Going to New York every time to give birth
must have been really tough.

976
00:58:40,288 --> 00:58:43,124
Mr. Jeong, I heard you earned
Dominican citizenship recently.

977
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:47,003
I heard they don't pay taxes there.

978
00:58:47,587 --> 00:58:49,797
Mr. Pyo and Mr. Ju.

979
00:58:49,881 --> 00:58:50,965
Your children have attended

980
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:52,634
international schools
since kindergarten

981
00:58:52,717 --> 00:58:53,593
and now study abroad.

982
00:58:53,676 --> 00:58:57,472
Both of you are preparing
to immigrate as well.

983
00:58:57,555 --> 00:58:59,682
What on earth are you doing, Mr. Kang?

984
00:58:59,766 --> 00:59:01,434
I'm really curious.

985
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:04,103
Black-haired foreigners

986
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:07,440
who were born in New York and LA
and briefly come to Korea

987
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:10,151
during vacations.

988
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:12,111
And Koreans from faraway places

989
00:59:12,195 --> 00:59:15,114
who take care of our farms,
fishing villages, and factories

990
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:17,283
as they work hard to learn Korean

991
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:19,869
while being ignored by our citizens.

992
00:59:20,495 --> 00:59:23,373
Between these two,
who are the real members of this country?

993
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:29,087
He said earlier this was
an embarrassment to Korea

994
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,214
and it harms national interest.

995
00:59:31,923 --> 00:59:35,385
In whose interest is that for?

996
00:59:39,305 --> 00:59:40,598
Your Honor,

997
00:59:40,682 --> 00:59:45,186
who lives in that Republic of Korea?

998
00:59:49,774 --> 00:59:50,775
Which country

999
00:59:52,568 --> 00:59:54,320
are we living in right now?

1000
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:01,619
Are you done with your arguments, Counsel?

1001
01:00:06,749 --> 01:00:08,918
Yes. I rest my case, Your Honor.

1002
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:12,630
The Court will close
the arguments of this case.

1003
01:00:12,714 --> 01:00:16,509
We will deliver the verdict in two weeks.

1004
01:00:21,597 --> 01:00:25,017
In whose interest is that for?

1005
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:39,157
Your Honor,

1006
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,326
who lives in that Republic of Korea?

1007
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,579
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT

1008
01:00:47,582 --> 01:00:50,418
SEOUL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

1009
01:00:50,501 --> 01:00:51,461
Please be seated.

1010
01:01:02,972 --> 01:01:06,476
I've had many thoughts
before arriving at a judgment.

1011
01:01:07,393 --> 01:01:11,564
To be honest, this was the first time
in my 35 years as a judge

1012
01:01:11,647 --> 01:01:16,027
to preside over a case
with such ridiculous legal arguments.

1013
01:01:16,736 --> 01:01:20,198
The plaintiff's counsel asked me

1014
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:23,409
which version of Korea was mine

1015
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:27,330
and which country's judiciary
I was a part of.

1016
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:30,958
This is a personal story,

1017
01:01:32,126 --> 01:01:35,630
so I'm sorry and embarrassed to say,

1018
01:01:35,713 --> 01:01:37,548
but even after passing national exams,

1019
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:41,844
I've been proud my entire life
that I voluntarily enlisted and worked

1020
01:01:41,928 --> 01:01:44,555
as an ordinary soldier
in the Marine Corps.

1021
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:48,434
My grandfather died in Manchuria

1022
01:01:48,518 --> 01:01:51,270
while fighting the Japanese
as a soldier in the independence army.

1023
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:55,316
My father died in the streets
during the April Revolution

1024
01:01:55,399 --> 01:01:58,236
while resisting the dictatorship.

1025
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,533
I have given it a lot of thought
throughout the trial.

1026
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:07,662
What kind of country is the Korea

1027
01:02:07,745 --> 01:02:11,082
that three generations of my family
have protected with their lives?

1028
01:02:12,834 --> 01:02:16,838
No matter how much I think about it,
one thing is clear.

1029
01:02:19,048 --> 01:02:20,675
The lousy country

1030
01:02:20,758 --> 01:02:24,095
that so cruelly and shamelessly
pushed away and persecuted

1031
01:02:24,637 --> 01:02:28,808
a young person who came all the way here

1032
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:30,268
to pursue her dreams…

1033
01:02:31,936 --> 01:02:33,855
That is not my Korea.

1034
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:39,277
Instead of a country of assailants,
their protectors, and bystanders,

1035
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,654
you said she seeks asylum

1036
01:02:41,737 --> 01:02:44,073
in the only legal government
in this territory,

1037
01:02:44,156 --> 01:02:46,409
the free and just Republic of Korea?

1038
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,328
No matter how much I think about it,

1039
01:02:50,204 --> 01:02:52,290
for the past 35 years,

1040
01:02:52,957 --> 01:02:55,209
I believe I've worked as a judge

1041
01:02:55,793 --> 01:02:59,046
in that free and just Republic of Korea.

1042
01:03:00,089 --> 01:03:02,633
-No way.
-Damn it.

1043
01:03:02,717 --> 01:03:04,719
The Court will deliver the verdict.

1044
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,099
This Court hereby rules

1045
01:03:11,017 --> 01:03:14,103
that the defendant's denial
of the plaintiff's refugee status

1046
01:03:14,186 --> 01:03:16,355
-is hereby annulled.
-Yes!

1047
01:03:16,439 --> 01:03:19,525
The defendant will bear
the cost of the lawsuit.

1048
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:21,903
Yeah!

1049
01:03:26,365 --> 01:03:28,034
Excuse me, Your Honor.

1050
01:03:28,117 --> 01:03:29,744
All rise.

1051
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:31,579
Your Honor!

1052
01:03:33,956 --> 01:03:34,790
Ms. Kaya.

1053
01:03:37,418 --> 01:03:38,544
Yes, Your Honor?

1054
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,172
It's been hard, hasn't it?

1055
01:03:42,506 --> 01:03:43,758
I'm sorry.

1056
01:03:46,218 --> 01:03:47,762
And thank you

1057
01:03:47,845 --> 01:03:49,597
for coming to Korea.

1058
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:26,968
With a historic UN speech
on World Refugee Day approaching,

1059
01:04:27,051 --> 01:04:29,220
the aftermath
of the so-called "asylum verdict"

1060
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:31,222
has put the Blue House in an awkward spot.

1061
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:32,306
As for now,

1062
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:36,811
I don't think it's a case
that we need to comment on.

1063
01:04:36,894 --> 01:04:39,522
The foreign press
has been questioning Korea's status

1064
01:04:39,605 --> 01:04:41,482
-in human rights.
-It's going viral.

1065
01:04:41,565 --> 01:04:44,652
The comment section in the article
about our trial is blowing up.

1066
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:49,198
Look at all these
"We seek asylum" hashtags.

1067
01:04:49,281 --> 01:04:51,826
Good. Things are going
according to plan.

1068
01:04:51,909 --> 01:04:54,286
The Ministry of Justice
must be going crazy right now.

1069
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:57,289
They'll appeal but will try
to make a deal behind the scenes.

1070
01:04:57,373 --> 01:04:59,375
Let's get it over with quick!

1071
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:01,460
Mr. Kang.

1072
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:04,171
What is it, Mr. Hwang?
Why are you so serious?

1073
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,592
I thought Kaya's Pikki Pikki dance
in working pants was so hilarious,

1074
01:05:08,676 --> 01:05:10,594
so I posted it on my social media page.

1075
01:05:11,512 --> 01:05:13,514
Gosh, you sure have unique taste.

1076
01:05:13,597 --> 01:05:14,432
So what about it?

1077
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:16,684
But do you know

1078
01:05:16,767 --> 01:05:20,146
who shared it on her social media page?

1079
01:05:20,229 --> 01:05:21,147
What?

1080
01:05:21,897 --> 01:05:24,567
Gosh, you're so frustrating. Who did what?

1081
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:26,152
-Uploaded it where?
-What's going on?

1082
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:30,489
BLACK… PINK's Jennie?

1083
01:05:33,284 --> 01:05:35,369
Jennie from BLACKPINK?

1084
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:37,830
What did he say?

1085
01:05:38,622 --> 01:05:39,457
Nan-hui!

1086
01:05:44,503 --> 01:05:45,838
Jennie.

1087
01:05:50,718 --> 01:05:52,094
Mr. Kang.

1088
01:05:52,178 --> 01:05:54,472
Please drop the refugee case.

1089
01:05:54,555 --> 01:05:56,432
It turned the Ministry of Justice
upside down.

1090
01:05:56,515 --> 01:05:59,351
What are you talking about?

1091
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:01,479
You're the one who should drop it.

1092
01:06:01,562 --> 01:06:02,938
Drop the appeal.

1093
01:06:04,815 --> 01:06:07,443
Haven't you seen this yet?

1094
01:06:07,526 --> 01:06:11,030
Nationalistic YouTube creators
are going crazy right now.

1095
01:06:11,113 --> 01:06:15,117
You should be giving us a medal
for promoting Korea all over the world,

1096
01:06:15,201 --> 01:06:17,495
but instead, you're appealing
the first trial's ruling?

1097
01:06:17,578 --> 01:06:19,955
What kind of job are you doing?

1098
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:23,709
If you drop the charge,
we will take care of Kaya's issue.

1099
01:06:27,505 --> 01:06:29,256
And how are you going to do that?

1100
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:32,843
We'll issue a work visa so she can stay
in Korea without any issues

1101
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:34,762
and give her financial support
to get settled.

1102
01:06:34,845 --> 01:06:37,264
If she wants, we can also find her a job--

1103
01:06:37,348 --> 01:06:38,182
She wants it.

1104
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:42,812
Then, can I leave
assuming that you'll drop the suit?

1105
01:06:44,605 --> 01:06:45,606
You can go.

1106
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:52,113
Now, shall we go
and fight the remaining battle?

1107
01:06:52,196 --> 01:06:54,949
The second hearing
for Kaya's father-in-law.

1108
01:06:55,032 --> 01:06:57,618
We have to send him back to jail
for a very long time.

1109
01:06:59,578 --> 01:07:01,664
You won't have to worry about it.

1110
01:07:02,373 --> 01:07:03,207
Why not?

1111
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:05,918
He met the Grim Reaper.

1112
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:09,004
-The Grim Reaper?
-Yes.

1113
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:14,176
I lost my mind for a moment
and made a mistake while drunk.

1114
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,886
I heard the criminals pray and say,

1115
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:18,931
"Please let me avoid
Judge Jung the Grim Reaper."

1116
01:07:19,014 --> 01:07:21,976
They shouldn't have done the crimes then.
Those brazen bastards.

1117
01:07:22,059 --> 01:07:23,561
I'd like to say

1118
01:07:23,644 --> 01:07:28,274
that the 200 hours of community service
ordered in the first trial was excessive.

1119
01:07:28,774 --> 01:07:29,859
And lastly…

1120
01:07:29,942 --> 01:07:31,193
DIE

1121
01:07:31,277 --> 01:07:35,781
I expect a wise judgment by Your Honor
within a range permitted by law…

1122
01:07:39,118 --> 01:07:40,911
SENIOR ADVISOR OH GYU-JANG

1123
01:07:54,717 --> 01:07:55,885
Hello, my daughter.

1124
01:07:55,968 --> 01:07:57,970
-Did you ask for me, Father?
-Yes.

1125
01:07:58,554 --> 01:07:59,555
Take a seat.

1126
01:08:00,139 --> 01:08:00,973
Okay.

1127
01:08:04,435 --> 01:08:06,854
Did you see this too?

1128
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:11,317
It's pretty fun.

1129
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:14,361
Ever since Judge Kang came,
we've had no time to be bored.

1130
01:08:15,946 --> 01:08:17,072
Father,

1131
01:08:17,156 --> 01:08:21,285
you should step back from work now
and find a hobby to enjoy.

1132
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:23,829
You can ride bikes,
just as you mentioned before.

1133
01:08:23,913 --> 01:08:26,040
You can play the electric guitar too.

1134
01:08:26,123 --> 01:08:26,999
Jung-in.

1135
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:31,879
Having power is my hobby.

1136
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:37,635
Riding bikes? Playing the guitar?

1137
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:41,305
Those things are for petty citizens.

1138
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:45,809
There's nothing in the world
more fun than power.

1139
01:08:46,685 --> 01:08:48,312
You should know as much

1140
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:49,980
now that you're a CEO.

1141
01:08:51,815 --> 01:08:53,275
I'm doing my best

1142
01:08:54,902 --> 01:08:56,654
to not ruin your reputation.

1143
01:08:57,321 --> 01:09:00,032
Doing your best isn't enough.
You have to excel.

1144
01:09:03,827 --> 01:09:05,621
Disband Team Pro Bono.

1145
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:07,498
What?

1146
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:10,709
Father.

1147
01:09:17,299 --> 01:09:18,133
Hello.

1148
01:09:18,842 --> 01:09:20,511
-Hey.
-Hi.

1149
01:09:20,594 --> 01:09:22,554
-Hello.
-Hi.

1150
01:09:23,222 --> 01:09:25,599
It feels like I'm getting healthier.

1151
01:09:26,934 --> 01:09:28,477
AWON GENERAL HOSPITAL

1152
01:09:29,311 --> 01:09:31,855
The medical checkups from last time.

1153
01:09:33,148 --> 01:09:36,527
Mr. Kang. I'm a man with no fear.

1154
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:41,323
But the only thing I'm afraid of
are syringe needles.

1155
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:43,409
When they inserted the needle that day…

1156
01:09:43,492 --> 01:09:44,410
See?

1157
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:47,162
My body doesn't respond

1158
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:51,292
to anesthesia…

1159
01:09:52,668 --> 01:09:54,920
Hey, hold on tight.

1160
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:57,381
Be careful.

1161
01:10:03,345 --> 01:10:04,930
-I got it!
-My goodness!

1162
01:10:05,014 --> 01:10:06,140
You scared me!

1163
01:10:06,223 --> 01:10:07,349
You got what?

1164
01:10:08,392 --> 01:10:09,226
You're innocent.

1165
01:10:10,227 --> 01:10:11,395
Of what?

1166
01:10:11,478 --> 01:10:13,731
You're innocent, Mr. Kang! Innocent!

1167
01:10:18,193 --> 01:10:19,486
What?

1168
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,769
I was fired after getting blackmailed
with a video of me taking a bribe.

1169
01:10:51,852 --> 01:10:52,936
Then, I came here.

1170
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,147
They're going to fire us all.
Starting with you.

1171
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:58,525
Baekseung Law Firm has been
close behind Oh & Partners in revenue.

1172
01:10:58,609 --> 01:11:00,778
What if we can take away their clients?

1173
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:03,280
We happen to have a meeting today,
so give it your best.

1174
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:06,867
-What is she doing here?
-You got crushed in the first meeting?

1175
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:09,328
-It wasn't that bad.
-It's at EK Entertainment this time.

1176
01:11:09,411 --> 01:11:11,121
You'll pitch against Baekseung.

1177
01:11:11,205 --> 01:11:13,582
We'll be protecting you, Elijah.

1178
01:11:13,665 --> 01:11:15,417
This video was uploaded.

1179
01:11:16,126 --> 01:11:17,086
What?

1180
01:11:17,169 --> 01:11:21,256
I guess not enough research
was done on the client's industry.

1181
01:11:27,513 --> 01:11:29,515
