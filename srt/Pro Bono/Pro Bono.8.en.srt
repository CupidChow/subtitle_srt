1
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:36,057
PRO BONO

2
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:39,394
There she comes.

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,855
It's her.

4
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:45,066
Ms. Cha Jin-hui.

5
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:47,402
Pick whichever one you need.

6
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:49,737
Elijah!

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,240
My goodness, congratulations!

8
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:58,621
-Congratulations!
-Elijah's mother tipped us off herself.

9
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:00,456
Do you know that?

10
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:05,670
I had been so angry
because of Ma Yeong-suk.

11
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:08,006
How did you make time?

12
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:11,968
Well, I just had to come, of course.
I heard the great news today.

13
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,887
It's pretty confusing, isn't it?

14
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:16,723
All right.

15
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:18,975
-Let's thank them.
-Shall we?

16
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:21,895
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

17
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:24,689
-Yes, you did a great job.
-It was nothing, ma'am.

18
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:27,192
Goodness, excuse me
if I'd been rude to you.

19
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,068
I apologize.

20
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:33,406
It's embarrassing,
but that's what it's like to be a mother.

21
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:37,160
When it involves your child,
you panic and get overwhelmed.

22
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,954
And you become blinded by rage.

23
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:41,873
That's how it is. I'm sorry.

24
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:44,042
No, I completely understand.

25
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:48,421
That's how it feels when you're a mother.

26
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:51,549
-Thank you.
-Mom.

27
00:01:52,383 --> 00:01:54,886
These pro bono attorneys
did an amazing job too.

28
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:57,347
Right. Goodness, thank you so much.

29
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,973
It was nothing at all.

30
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:00,850
Mr. Jang stayed up all night

31
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,061
to do the hardest part
of tracking IP addresses.

32
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:06,522
Really? All those… Thank you.

33
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:08,942
No need to thank me. It was nothing.

34
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:09,859
-Yeong-sil.
-Yeah?

35
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:13,321
You said Ji-hye was Elijah's avid fan.
Ask her for an autograph.

36
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:15,114
-I also want one.
-My autograph?

37
00:02:15,823 --> 00:02:18,159
There's a client
I've been advising recently,

38
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:19,786
and she's a big fan of yours.

39
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:24,040
She would be thrilled
if she could get your autograph.

40
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:27,710
If you're helping her,
she must be in a very difficult situation.

41
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:32,173
You should come with her sometime.
I'll give her an autograph in person.

42
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:34,801
-You would meet with her?
-Yes.

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,803
She's going to be ecstatic.

44
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:38,763
Thank you, Elijah.

45
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,268
We have a bit of a busy schedule.

46
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,353
-So, please excuse us.
-Of course.

47
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:48,439
You all are full of surprising charm.

48
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:51,025
We'll get going now.

49
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:52,277
Thank you!

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,987
-Have a good day.
-Goodbye!

51
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:57,115
Do you think it's true?

52
00:02:57,782 --> 00:03:00,410
"How could a mother do that?"

53
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:02,912
Is that what you mean?

54
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:06,124
What was that? What about a mother?

55
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,751
You have good ears.

56
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:13,631
That would be ridiculous.

57
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:15,675
Her mother tipped them off?

58
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:16,592
EPISODE 8

59
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:19,512
Right? She doesn't have any motives.

60
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:22,724
Before being a mom,
she's the CEO of her agency.

61
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,058
What would she get out of it?

62
00:03:24,142 --> 00:03:26,811
I have a feeling Gu Ji-hwan is right.

63
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:28,730
What? Why?

64
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:32,608
He's known for making a living
by doing a variety of dirty work

65
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,569
for clients
in the entertainment industry.

66
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:37,405
Ms. Cha might have asked him
to do something.

67
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,824
No way. But they're family.

68
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:42,452
How could a parent
do that to her child?

69
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:44,495
Family can be more cruel
than anyone else.

70
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:48,041
I'm surprised
to hear you sound so cynical.

71
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:48,958
What?

72
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:51,377
Well, it's just…

73
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:55,214
It's probably because of Ji-hye's case
that I've been working on.

74
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:57,925
In any case, we won today.

75
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:01,220
Nan-hui was the star today,
so it'll be her treat.

76
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:03,806
-Sounds good.
-What? Why would you…

77
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,185
It's on me! Because I'm not petty!

78
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:09,228
Eat and drink all you want! Cheers!

79
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:10,897
Cheers!

80
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:12,857
You know how petty I am.

81
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,614
What is it?

82
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:22,367
Isn't that Elijah's boyfriend?

83
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,284
Why? What is it?

84
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:24,619
ELIJAH'S MAN IS A CHEATER?

85
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:28,122
-Has this prick lost his mind?
-Hey, it's mine.

86
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,416
What a jerk!

87
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,627
-Who's a jerk?
-Mr. Kang.

88
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:36,214
-What?
-Let's meet with Ms. Cha right now.

89
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:37,298
What?

90
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:39,801
I think I know
what she asked Gu Ji-hwan to do.

91
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:49,185
Are you kidding me right now?

92
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:51,729
Why can't you understand?

93
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:54,690
You think the words just come right out
when I write songs?

94
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:58,569
It was just a mistake I made
while I was working!

95
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:00,488
Just let it go.

96
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,573
Shut up, you jerk!

97
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,831
Are you okay?

98
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,210
Yeah, I'm all right.

99
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,674
By the way, the attorneys
are in Ms. Cha's office right now.

100
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:21,092
What?

101
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,094
Why?

102
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:26,264
Please come and sit.

103
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:31,144
I'd like to say this first.

104
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:33,312
I don't know if you'll believe me,

105
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:35,314
but with issues
between a mother and her child,

106
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:36,816
I can't be objective.

107
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:39,235
I'm always on the mother's side.

108
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:43,781
Okay, and why do you say that?

109
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:50,413
Why did you do that?

110
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,124
What are you talking about?

111
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:56,210
You tipped them off
about Elijah's boyfriend, didn't you?

112
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:00,673
What are you basing that on?

113
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,717
I'm a bit confused.

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,887
The online site that released
the article on her cheating boyfriend

115
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,515
is run by Mr. Gu Ji-hwan
under a different name.

116
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:12,810
Ms. Cha, do you know
what kind of person he is?

117
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:16,606
He's an attorney, but he makes a living
using others' weaknesses to threaten them.

118
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:19,901
Someone like that doesn't care
about protecting their clients.

119
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:23,446
He came and ratted you out
as soon as he was cornered.

120
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:26,741
You're her mother.

121
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:29,035
How could you tell him
about your daughter's affairs?

122
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:32,830
Because I'm her mother.

123
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:34,498
Sorry?

124
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,295
I would do even worse things
if it was for my child.

125
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:45,218
-It was you?
-Let's talk outside.

126
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:46,260
Let's go out.

127
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:48,596
It's my privacy.

128
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,889
Did you really do that?

129
00:06:49,972 --> 00:06:52,141
Why on earth would you?

130
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,060
Did you want to destroy me?

131
00:06:54,143 --> 00:06:55,686
No!

132
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,730
Why would I want that?

133
00:06:57,813 --> 00:06:59,398
I just asked him

134
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,193
to get that awful jerk away from you.

135
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:05,238
Trust me. It was for your own good.

136
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:07,949
No, please.

137
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:11,118
I was worried
you'd go down the wrong path. Please.

138
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:14,372
They go around digging in others' privacy.

139
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:16,832
Don't you know
what kind of people they are?

140
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,793
After getting paid by you,

141
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:22,004
they tried to make more money
by revealing her boyfriend for clickbait.

142
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,133
I must have lost my mind.

143
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:31,514
To me, that guy wasn't the one for her,
but my Elijah kept insisting.

144
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:33,933
How can a mother

145
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:37,395
just sit by and watch
when her child is making a mistake?

146
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:38,312
How?

147
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,398
You're right.

148
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:42,191
He's garbage.

149
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:45,570
Yes. You know it now too, don't you?

150
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:49,323
But he was garbage that I chose.

151
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,033
Come on…

152
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:53,744
I should have been the one who dumped him.

153
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:56,998
Elijah.

154
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:00,126
It was for your own good.

155
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,254
I only did it for my precious daughter.

156
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,386
I'm sick of it now, Mom.

157
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,015
Elijah.

158
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:20,104
What am I going to do?

159
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:27,528
Elijah!

160
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:28,696
Gosh.

161
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:32,158
Calm down.

162
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:34,994
Calm down already.

163
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,669
Her boyfriend cheated on her,

164
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:47,882
and her mother leaked that information
to a garbage-tier YouTube channel.

165
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:52,386
Seriously, why are they
doing this to my Elijah?

166
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,346
I know.

167
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:56,223
How could he cheat on someone like Elijah?

168
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:57,600
There, there.

169
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:01,520
So many guys chased after her,

170
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:03,898
but they all ran away within six months.

171
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:07,193
This makes no sense.
What's there not to like about her?

172
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,312
MESSAGE

173
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:51,278
I'm really sorry.

174
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:53,114
It won't ever happen again.

175
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:55,991
I promise.

176
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,244
Please forgive me.

177
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:09,714
Can I really trust you this time?

178
00:10:14,844 --> 00:10:16,679
You haven't eaten anything today.

179
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:19,640
You'll get in trouble
if you keep doing this.

180
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,309
Let's go. You have to
eat something. Come on.

181
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:23,769
It's all right.

182
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:25,813
I'm only halfway through practice.

183
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,356
Don't be like that.

184
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:32,361
As you know, the fate of our agency
depends on my US debut.

185
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:33,988
We've invested so much in the album.

186
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:36,282
I can still take it.

187
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:37,992
Why are you always so worried?

188
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:43,581
We'll start again.

189
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:06,020
Let's not do this between colleagues.
I'm an attorney too.

190
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:08,397
Business has been bad,
so what choice do I have?

191
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,941
I have to prey on other attorneys
to make ends meet.

192
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:13,652
I'm gathering your victims

193
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:17,364
to pursue a class-action lawsuit
against you for damages.

194
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,451
It's nothing personal.

195
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:22,203
I feel terrible too.

196
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:24,121
Please help me out.

197
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:27,458
Don't do this, Judge Kang.

198
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,461
What is with you?
You know how things work.

199
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,588
Like I said, I feel bad.

200
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:34,548
I'll do anything…

201
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:38,302
I'll do anything
you want me to do. I will.

202
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,763
Just help me out this one time.

203
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:43,474
I don't need anything from you.

204
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:44,725
-But--
-However…

205
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,479
I do have a question.

206
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:52,149
Yes. Go ahead. Ask me anything.

207
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,401
Elijah's mother, Ms. Cha.

208
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,530
-Yes.
-Was this your first deal with her?

209
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:02,159
Well… We've been doing business
for a while now.

210
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:06,372
At first, I gathered inside information
on the entertainment industry.

211
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:09,542
What about after Elijah got into college?

212
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,086
I made sure
that losers stayed away from her.

213
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:16,423
Interesting. Did you go old school
and hire thugs to…

214
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:17,675
No.

215
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:19,593
-That's outdated.
-It is?

216
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:21,011
Yeah. So…

217
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:24,557
I simply hire a nice looking guy.

218
00:12:25,307 --> 00:12:26,183
A guy?

219
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,393
To guys chasing Elijah,

220
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:29,270
he comes and says,

221
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:33,023
"I'm seeing Elijah. Okay?"

222
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:35,568
"Go away. Stop hanging around her!"

223
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:38,779
Would they really believe what he says?

224
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:40,239
-They would.
-What?

225
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:44,660
They believe it when he shows
photos of Elijah sleeping in her pajamas.

226
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,289
Photos of Elijah in her pajamas?
Where would you get…

227
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:49,206
Ms. Cha.

228
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:53,586
She gave me the photos
and ordered me to do it.

229
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:57,506
Use these this time
to drive those losers away. Okay?

230
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,341
Isn't it crazy?

231
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:03,345
The parents of celebrities hate it
when their children date.

232
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,056
They want to hold on
and mooch off of them forever.

233
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,850
If some random person takes them away,

234
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:10,311
it's not fair.

235
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:13,022
Bastard.

236
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:14,523
What?

237
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:16,900
-What a bastard.
-Me?

238
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:21,864
-I've seen you somewhere though.
-What?

239
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,284
You're…

240
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,494
You're going to help me out, right?

241
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,413
How about this one?

242
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:31,040
It's so-so.

243
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:33,500
Bring me something striking.

244
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,544
Yes, Ms. Cha.

245
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:45,429
You're the newest one, aren't you?
You're good at your job.

246
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:46,347
Thank you, ma'am.

247
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:48,891
Please take your time, Ms. Cha.

248
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,352
You know what I like too.

249
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:56,482
Ms. Cha.

250
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:00,194
Okay. How about this one?

251
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,325
Let me help you--

252
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:09,536
No, not you. You do it.

253
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:11,538
Yes, Ms. Cha.

254
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,603
Hello, Mr. Kang.

255
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:36,647
Hello, this is Kang Da-wit.

256
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,732
I've given it some thought,

257
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,610
but I think I should tell you.

258
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:43,988
What is it?

259
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,283
Sorry?

260
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,291
I'm worried about Elijah.

261
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,004
I know. She must've been so shocked.

262
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:07,219
Hello.

263
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:08,637
Hi.

264
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:13,726
Wait. Elijah, what brings you here?

265
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:19,231
Your office is much bigger
and nicer than I thought.

266
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:27,448
Don't tell me…

267
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:37,624
The thing is, Mom…

268
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,585
What on earth were you doing?

269
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:43,172
You're the company director, but didn't
know she was gone? What were you doing?!

270
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:45,340
I heard you didn't even
show up to work today!

271
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,885
Actually, Mom,

272
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:52,598
I went to see the doctor
with So-yeon today.

273
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:54,016
You…

274
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:57,186
For goodness' sake. What do we do now?

275
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,855
Hurry and find her!

276
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:02,232
Did you run away from home?

277
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:06,111
My mom's house is right next to mine.

278
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:08,489
I can't go on like this anymore.

279
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,657
Where are you going to stay then?

280
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:15,579
For now, I'll stay in a hotel
until I find a new place.

281
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,165
But that's not what matters.

282
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:20,459
I don't know much about the law,

283
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:23,837
but this isn't a simple issue
between a mother and her daughter.

284
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:26,256
Am I right?

285
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:31,303
Yes, it's a case
between an artist and her company.

286
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:32,971
Yes.

287
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:35,516
The agency deceived its artist

288
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,559
and interfered in
and leaked her private matters.

289
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,978
It's an outrageous breach of contract.

290
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:44,775
Then…

291
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,613
I want to end the exclusive contract
with my company.

292
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,450
Please file a lawsuit.

293
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:01,792
EASTERN DISTRICT COURT

294
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:05,337
Gosh, look who's here.

295
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:11,009
Isn't it Mr. Woo, who lost his client
to someone without a college degree?

296
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:15,264
Gosh, look who's here.

297
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:17,808
Isn't it Mr. Kang,
the lawyer without a college degree

298
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:21,186
who stole someone's client
by using Elijah's fans?

299
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,731
I heard you couldn't let it go
and went to see Ms. Cha,

300
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:26,775
asking her to give you this case.

301
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,653
Do you want to lose to me that badly?

302
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:31,655
A little snot came out.

303
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:34,074
Think whatever you want.

304
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:35,617
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

305
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:38,203
And I'll think however I want too.

306
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:40,831
SUIT DISPUTING EXCLUSIVITY

307
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:42,833
Your Honor,
the plaintiff has already sent

308
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,586
a certified letter notifying
the termination of her contract.

309
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:47,171
We request that you confirm

310
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:50,966
the non-existence
of an exclusive contract between the two.

311
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,677
Which part of the contract
justifies the termination?

312
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,891
Your Honor, perhaps I still don't have
enough legal experience.

313
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:00,976
But I've never seen
a contract like this before.

314
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,438
The defendant, EK Entertainment,
is the dominant party.

315
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:07,733
The plaintiff, Elijah,
is the subordinate party.

316
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:11,862
As you can see, the subordinate party's
contractual obligations are…

317
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:13,822
One, two, three, four…

318
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:18,202
How many are there?
There are more than 20.

319
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:21,121
"Comply with the company orders
without question."

320
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:24,750
"No social media. Maintain a strict diet."

321
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,629
On the other hand, the dominant party
does not have any obligations.

322
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,380
Zero.

323
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,551
You indeed are the dominant party.

324
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,388
Didn't the plaintiff read
and sign the contract?

325
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:40,265
When your mom hands you
a contract to sign,

326
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:43,227
what child is going to
read it thoroughly line by line?

327
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,979
On top of that,
she had just finished high school.

328
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:49,983
As an adult, she should at least know
that she has to be responsible

329
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,819
for the contract she signed.

330
00:18:52,903 --> 00:18:56,073
But on what grounds

331
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:58,033
are you terminating
the exclusive contract?

332
00:18:58,116 --> 00:19:00,327
It's a breakdown of trust.

333
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:06,541
Which article and paragraph
of the contract is that mentioned in?

334
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,585
Whether it is stated
in the contract or not,

335
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:12,005
trust is essential given the nature
of an exclusive contract.

336
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:15,634
Precedent has shown
it can be terminated once trust is broken.

337
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:17,970
You must have forgotten
much of the Civil Act

338
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:20,138
after working so long as a prosecutor.

339
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:21,515
I understand.

340
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:23,809
Aren't you the one who's forgotten

341
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:27,521
about the relationship
between the plaintiff and the defendant?

342
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:30,107
-Is that a question?
-Does it sound like an answer?

343
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,609
I'll answer for you
since it seems you don't know.

344
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,028
They are mother and daughter.

345
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:36,989
-Gosh, I see.
-You didn't know.

346
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:40,450
The breakdown of trust
between a mother and daughter.

347
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:44,955
Are you trying to sever
the sacred bond between family?

348
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:47,249
What have I done that was so wrong?

349
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:50,043
I've only done my best for my daughter.

350
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:54,298
You have never once respected
the plaintiff's free will.

351
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:58,885
What, because I worried
my precious daughter would date a bad guy?

352
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:01,847
Because I pushed her
to dream big and not settle?

353
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,557
That was wrong?

354
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,143
Then, every parent
in this county is guilty!

355
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:10,856
Ms. Cha, you have demanded the plaintiff
undergo an abnormal level of dieting,

356
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:13,817
infringing on her physical
and mental health tremendously.

357
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,944
As it's a profession with high visibility,

358
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:19,823
she simply persuaded her daughter
she had to put in more effort than others.

359
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:23,827
How can she become better if she only does
the same as everyone else?

360
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,830
I am her mother.

361
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:30,625
What mother would hurt
her daughter deliberately?

362
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,127
Okay, all right.

363
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,296
Please calm down. Plaintiff.

364
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:36,214
Please continue with your argument.

365
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,176
It leaves us with no choice, Your Honor.

366
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:42,012
I request that you order the defendant
to disclose details

367
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:44,556
of income and expenditures
for the plaintiff's entire career,

368
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:48,018
and submit the related accounting ledgers.

369
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:49,353
What?!

370
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:50,312
Goodness.

371
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:52,689
Do you really want to
play this out to the end?

372
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:57,110
Plaintiff, please submit
the relevant grounds in writing.

373
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,577
Elijah, are you all right?

374
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,330
You didn't have to
come in person to court.

375
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:09,873
I'm not going to avoid it.

376
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,958
It's my business.

377
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:15,128
It'll only get uglier.
That's how trials are.

378
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:16,713
I'm ready for it.

379
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:22,928
Geez, I'm fine.

380
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:26,723
Anyway, after skipping practice
for the first time in eight years,

381
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,558
the day feels so long.

382
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:32,354
It feels so lonely
staying in the hotel all by myself.

383
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:35,982
Elijah.

384
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:39,069
We have a vacant room at my place.

385
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:41,696
-It's not fancy, but do you want to come?
-Really?

386
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,408
I'd love that.

387
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:47,661
-But will it be okay with you?
-Of course. Come with me.

388
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:48,745
Sure!

389
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:50,956
Ms. Park,

390
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,209
you're not going to make her
serve food at the bakery, are you?

391
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:56,878
To get rich by getting fans
from all over the world to visit?

392
00:21:56,962 --> 00:21:58,380
Mr. Kang!

393
00:21:58,463 --> 00:22:01,383
Don't always view the world
from your perspective.

394
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:08,348
I think you liked the idea.

395
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:14,062
Geez, EK Entertainment!

396
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:17,149
We asked for income and expenditure data,

397
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:19,484
and they sent a bunch
of useless stuff too!

398
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:24,531
So they're trying to mess with us?
My goodness!

399
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:27,617
It's not easy to win
an exclusive contract termination case.

400
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:29,119
As for the boyfriend issue,

401
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:32,080
they'll blur things
with mother-daughter relationship stuff,

402
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:34,624
so we have to dig into the payments issue.

403
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,586
If we find something here,
there's no way out for them.

404
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:40,547
What are you all doing?
Get ready to stay up.

405
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:42,257
Look at Mr. Jang.

406
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,678
It's cramped there,
so come here and work.

407
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,849
What a terrible working environment.

408
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:54,352
Being a pro bono attorney…

409
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:55,979
It's terrible.

410
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:57,314
We can do it!

411
00:22:57,397 --> 00:22:58,815
-Let's go!
-We can do it!

412
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:11,703
Over there. She's a famous singer.

413
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:16,833
Hello…

414
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:20,003
Hello.

415
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:21,421
Hello.

416
00:23:21,504 --> 00:23:23,965
I'll be staying here for a few days.

417
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:25,926
You know sign language?

418
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:29,137
In the past,

419
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,223
I learned it for a film shoot.

420
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:33,600
But I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

421
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:35,810
It's right. You're really good.

422
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:36,853
Thank you.

423
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:39,940
Just a moment.

424
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:44,694
It's all right.

425
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:51,701
It's because I'm bored.

426
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:53,203
Is it okay to help you?

427
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:57,791
Gi-ppeum will scold us
if we make you work.

428
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:03,588
I promise I won't tell her.

429
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:07,092
It's okay.

430
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:09,803
What do we do?

431
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:10,929
We might be in trouble.

432
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:17,727
The earnings from music sales
and performances are substantial.

433
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:20,438
Why take in more investment
when they were making good money?

434
00:24:20,522 --> 00:24:24,192
I wonder if they
even paid Elijah properly.

435
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:26,194
I doubt it.

436
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:27,779
Probably not.

437
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:32,367
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

438
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:34,953
Could you take a look at this?

439
00:24:35,578 --> 00:24:37,998
The money flowed
into these foreign companies.

440
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:40,667
-Okay.
-It's such a strange flow.

441
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,295
-It isn't normal.
-I smell something fishy.

442
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:45,588
Doesn't it smell like ramyeon?

443
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:49,134
Is he eating alone? How cheap.

444
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:52,971
Doesn't it smell like distrust?

445
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:56,099
Kang Da-wit is the best!

446
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:59,019
I was especially craving
ramyeon today for some reason.

447
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:01,688
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

448
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:03,148
Thank you.

449
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:04,232
Where are we?

450
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:07,610
Ms. Park just showed us something.

451
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:10,238
-You should take a look.
-Okay.

452
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:15,744
Mr. Kim, as company director
of EK Entertainment,

453
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:18,371
you are responsible
for finances and accounting. Correct?

454
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:19,581
Yes, I am.

455
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:23,043
Since last year, you've pushed to bring in
investments for Elijah's entrance

456
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:24,836
in the US market, correct?

457
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:25,879
Yes, that's right.

458
00:25:25,962 --> 00:25:31,384
Elijah must have made a lot of money
from music sales and performances.

459
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:35,013
You still needed
additional external funds?

460
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:39,142
-You don't know how this business works.
-I see.

461
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:42,729
It requires a fortune
to create a global artist.

462
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:47,192
The expenses for consulting and marketing
to enter the overseas market--

463
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:49,027
Is that so? Expenses like these?

464
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:55,700
Halford & Brown Company in LA
and JC Mackenzie in New York.

465
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:57,410
How did you…

466
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:00,205
But the thing is,

467
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:03,208
we found signs that showed
more than half of the funds

468
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:08,004
that were sent to these companies
was transferred to a third company.

469
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:10,882
After going through various steps
of money laundering,

470
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:13,134
the money ended up right there.

471
00:26:13,676 --> 00:26:16,513
A limited company located
in an offshore tax haven called

472
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:22,227
It's "hope," right?

473
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,896
I don't know.
What does that have to do with me?

474
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,483
You failed to attract investments
in the end. Why was that?

475
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:32,195
That was the investors' call.
Why would you ask me that?

476
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:35,240
Wasn't the failed investments
due to accounting fraud?

477
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:39,786
Your Honor, Mr. Kang is asking
leading questions based on speculation.

478
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:43,248
Do you have grounds, Counsel?

479
00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:45,625
We will submit them if needed.

480
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:49,879
This is the actual audit report
from an investor's accounting team.

481
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:53,716
"The balance sheet
of EK Entertainment cannot be trusted."

482
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,177
"Capital outflow has been confirmed."

483
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:59,639
You siphoned off the profits
that were to be paid to the plaintiff.

484
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:01,975
No! Those were all fabricated!

485
00:27:02,642 --> 00:27:04,519
-Busted.
-Let me ask you one more thing.

486
00:27:04,602 --> 00:27:07,730
In the truckload of documents
you submitted,

487
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:09,190
someone found this.

488
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:13,570
Mr. Kim, insurance fees
were part of your expenditures.

489
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:15,864
It was a substantial amount.

490
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:16,823
What was this for?

491
00:27:16,906 --> 00:27:19,200
How would I remember all the details?

492
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:21,244
I think you do remember all the details.

493
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:24,956
We tracked it down,
and it was a life insurance plan.

494
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,294
It was life insurance
for Elijah, your sister.

495
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,463
That's…

496
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:32,589
At the…

497
00:27:33,673 --> 00:27:35,383
At the company level,

498
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:36,843
for the artist--

499
00:27:36,926 --> 00:27:40,096
"For the artist."
Who is the beneficiary though?

500
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:45,518
The person who will get that money
if anything happens to Elijah.

501
00:27:45,602 --> 00:27:48,813
The sole shareholder of Hope,
where the money was sent.

502
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:51,274
They were the same person.

503
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,071
Seven-year-old Kim So-yeon.

504
00:27:57,697 --> 00:27:58,948
Your only daughter.

505
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:02,035
No! They're all lies…

506
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:03,161
SOLE SHAREHOLDER OF HOPE

507
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:04,120
This is a lie.

508
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:08,166
Your Honor, this is all
merely vague speculation.

509
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,586
You can borrow your family's name
to open an account.

510
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:15,215
Plaintiff's Counsel, you should file
a criminal suit for embezzlement instead.

511
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:19,177
Stop making malicious false accusations
based on unverified evidence.

512
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:21,387
Okay?

513
00:28:23,973 --> 00:28:25,517
We will submit the relevant evidence.

514
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,445
How dare you scam your mom?

515
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:38,780
You stupid prick!

516
00:28:38,863 --> 00:28:40,657
I told you not to get greedy!

517
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:44,285
You took much more than I did,
so why are you yelling at me?

518
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:46,538
You shouldn't have gotten caught then!

519
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:48,581
Who do you think you are to be so greedy?

520
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:52,752
What? I'm not allowed to be greedy?

521
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:54,462
What?

522
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:55,922
Grandma!

523
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,924
Why did you come out, So-yeon?

524
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,635
Hi, Grandma.

525
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,554
Play with me.

526
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:04,597
I need to talk to your dad,
so go back inside.

527
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:07,392
So-yeon, you'll get sick out here.
Let's hurry inside.

528
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:09,644
Grandma.

529
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:15,024
Just go. She's coughing!

530
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:18,903
That little prick…

531
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:22,907
I'll raise my daughter
to be way better than Elijah. Got it?

532
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:27,287
I'm going to give her anything she wants.
The best of everything!

533
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:37,964
-Hello.
-Ji-hye.

534
00:29:38,882 --> 00:29:39,966
Elijah.

535
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:42,302
This is Ji-hye.

536
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:44,846
Hello.

537
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:46,931
Elijah.

538
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:50,101
Are you really Elijah?

539
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:53,062
Yes. It's me, Ji-hye.

540
00:29:54,856 --> 00:29:56,482
You know my name?

541
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:59,569
I can't… I'm not dreaming, am I?

542
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:01,237
Of course not, Ji-hye.

543
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,907
I really love your music, big sis.

544
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:07,035
I can't wait for your next song.

545
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:11,748
Am I really your big sis?

546
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:14,667
-Yeah.
-They say the big sis is the cool one.

547
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:18,421
Okay, then.

548
00:30:18,504 --> 00:30:22,175
Should we take out the things
I prepared for Ji-hye?

549
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:25,428
Gifts!

550
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:30,016
Ta-da! It's my merchandise.
You know Ponies, right?

551
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:33,853
-Is it really okay for me to take this?
-Of course. Here.

552
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:38,191
This is a T-shirt with my face on it.

553
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:41,152
It's Elijah!

554
00:30:41,235 --> 00:30:42,987
Thank you.

555
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:45,949
There's a lot of stuff.

556
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,245
She gave so many gifts.

557
00:30:57,585 --> 00:30:59,253
Thank you, Elijah.

558
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:02,215
We'll get going.

559
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:09,347
Good night.

560
00:31:13,226 --> 00:31:17,480
Did you say Ji-hye's uncle took
her parents' death benefits?

561
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:20,650
Yes. According to Mr. Jang,

562
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:24,320
he might be abusing her too.

563
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:27,031
How could he do that to someone so nice?

564
00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:32,787
What even is family?

565
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:35,665
Elijah.

566
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:40,294
Did you really have no idea
that you weren't being paid correctly?

567
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:43,381
Mom always said

568
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,926
she would take care of the money,

569
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,846
so I could focus only on music
without worrying about it.

570
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:50,972
And you believed that?

571
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,018
She's my mother.

572
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:58,855
Someone who wishes the best for me.

573
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:02,608
Did you trust her?
Or did you want to trust her?

574
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:12,618
DEFENDANT

575
00:32:15,204 --> 00:32:16,497
Plaintiff's Counsel.

576
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,334
Plaintiff's Counsel!

577
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:22,503
Yes, Your Honor.

578
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,547
Your Honor.

579
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:29,093
To expose the defendant's non-payment
and embezzlement of music revenue,

580
00:32:29,177 --> 00:32:33,014
we will file a lawsuit
for embezzlement against Mr. Kim.

581
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:36,851
We request a tentative hearing date
until the investigation results come in.

582
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:38,311
Plaintiff's Counsel.

583
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:42,231
Since you studied it so long ago,
did you forget all about the Criminal Act?

584
00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:44,817
What do you mean?

585
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:48,196
Article 361

586
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,698
and Article 328, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act.

587
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:55,286
Exemption of Crimes by Family.

588
00:32:55,912 --> 00:32:59,665
These are fundamental basics.
And you were even a judge.

589
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,253
Property crimes committed
within family cannot be punished.

590
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:08,216
Did you forget
that a sibling can't be penalized

591
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:10,343
only if they live together?

592
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,387
If they live apart, they can be punished.

593
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:16,974
Does Mr. Kim live with the plaintiff?

594
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:18,976
Put it up.

595
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:23,773
This is a family photo
taken early last year.

596
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:26,526
The whole family lived together back then.

597
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:30,696
The plaintiff knew about it.
Did the plaintiff's counsel not know?

598
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:35,868
Your Honor, the capital outflow
that the plaintiff claims

599
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:39,622
mostly occurred
while she was living in this house,

600
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:41,833
so the Exemption of Crimes by Family
can be applied.

601
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:46,295
A lawsuit would be dismissed immediately.
Their claim is a waste of time.

602
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:52,718
If it happened while they lived together,

603
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:53,678
you'd be correct.

604
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,933
Right. The last incident occurred
after she moved out.

605
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:02,728
You can sue for that one if you'd like.
How much was it again?

606
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:05,439
-It's 820,000 won.
-It's for 820,000 won.

607
00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:09,819
Your Honor,

608
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:14,532
it is true this it occurred
while she was living in that house.

609
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:18,077
However, the defendant's attorney
is overlooking one aspect.

610
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:21,539
Kim So-yeon, Kim Ju-won's daughter,

611
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:24,792
has to avoid outside contact
as much as possible

612
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,503
due to severe atopy and allergy symptoms.

613
00:34:28,212 --> 00:34:31,924
Therefore, Mr. Kim installed
a separate door on the second floor

614
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:34,218
where his family lived,

615
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:38,389
and strictly prevented
other family members from entering.

616
00:34:38,472 --> 00:34:40,975
They used a separate restroom
and living room.

617
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:44,478
And, of course, living expenses
were spent separately too.

618
00:34:45,062 --> 00:34:50,902
Basically, he lived for free
on the second floor of his mother's house.

619
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:55,031
Can you actually say
that they lived together?

620
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:05,958
You are very well-prepared.

621
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:08,669
But…

622
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:09,962
Your Honor.

623
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:15,801
Ms. Cha would like to share a few words.

624
00:35:16,427 --> 00:35:18,262
Okay. Go ahead.

625
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:21,766
Thank you.

626
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:28,564
It is all my fault.

627
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,863
Mr. Kim Ju-won just did
what I, as CEO, told him to do.

628
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:38,616
Whether it's fraud or embezzlement,

629
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:41,202
just please sue me.

630
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:43,996
Elijah.

631
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:46,582
Is this what you wanted?

632
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:50,086
To sue your mother.

633
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:57,176
-Do you have a tissue?
-Tissue…

634
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:01,430
Right.

635
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,811
With mothers, it doesn't matter
if they lived together or not.

636
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:11,023
As she is a lineal blood relative,
she is exempt from punishment.

637
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:13,567
LINEAL BLOOD RELATIVES EXEMPT
FROM PROPERTY CRIME PUNISHMENT

638
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:14,986
Now, you won't waste your time.

639
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:19,740
Is it a lineal blood relative this time?

640
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:20,658
Yes.

641
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,669
So, you have to sue her mother?

642
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:34,130
Are you giving up on the bet,
Attorney Kang?

643
00:36:35,464 --> 00:36:36,924
What do you mean, sir?

644
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:41,304
We already took the case
from Baekseung and won. And--

645
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:42,680
You got it wrong.

646
00:36:42,763 --> 00:36:44,265
The bet you placed

647
00:36:45,057 --> 00:36:48,728
was to take clients from them,
not a single case.

648
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,941
The client who pays the legal fee
isn't that little girl, Elijah.

649
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,568
It's EK Entertainment.

650
00:36:56,193 --> 00:36:57,945
I heard that girl is penniless.

651
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:01,657
You're picking a fight
with the client you barely won over

652
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:02,616
for a penniless girl?

653
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:10,082
Why are you doing this now
instead of stopping me from the start?

654
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,959
-Do you think I'm that free?
-Sorry?

655
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,754
Why would I follow up
on such a trivial case?

656
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:19,675
Give up the bet.

657
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:23,346
Disband the team quietly as promised.

658
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:24,430
Do I have your word?

659
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:29,185
-You're dismissed.
-No, Dr. Oh--

660
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:45,576
Still,

661
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:48,913
it'll be very beneficial for us if we win.

662
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:50,831
We can take cases of other celebrities

663
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,666
who have been mistreated
by their agencies.

664
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:54,502
Okay.

665
00:37:54,585 --> 00:37:55,544
Is this

666
00:37:56,212 --> 00:38:00,049
the new Oh & Partners you wanted to make?

667
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,095
Korea's punching bag?
A law firm for filial impiety?

668
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:10,893
Or did you empathize too much?

669
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:15,439
Did you relate to the daughter
who wants to drive away her mother?

670
00:38:18,234 --> 00:38:19,568
I'm disappointed.

671
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:22,321
I thought you resembled me.

672
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:25,032
But I was wrong.

673
00:38:26,075 --> 00:38:28,494
Stop that lawsuit at once.

674
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:29,954
And break up the team.

675
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,961
Two number 4 desks.
One 4.5-foot desk.

676
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:38,087
-Sir.
-Yes?

677
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,922
What are you doing?

678
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,841
I was told to take out all the desks.

679
00:38:41,924 --> 00:38:43,092
-What?
-What?

680
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,802
Really?

681
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:46,178
Yes, really.

682
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:50,057
Mr. Kang.

683
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:54,645
Is our team really going to get disbanded
if we proceed with this lawsuit?

684
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:59,316
This darn firm won't let us
represent the weak.

685
00:39:03,654 --> 00:39:04,655
Well…

686
00:39:05,781 --> 00:39:08,826
It's been bothering me from the start.

687
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,494
This isn't right.

688
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:13,747
Honestly, this isn't a pro bono case.

689
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,916
Frankly, a celebrity isn't
socially underprivileged.

690
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,587
She's isolated and can't trust
her mother, brother, and company.

691
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,590
Didn't we become pro bono attorneys
to help someone like her?

692
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:25,593
If I get fired,
I'll become a dismissed worker too.

693
00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:31,265
Is wanting to keep my job a crime too?

694
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:36,812
Am I the only jerk here again?

695
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:39,899
I'm desperate too!

696
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:41,484
Jun-u.

697
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,165
What are you trying to do?

698
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,211
You really want to get disbanded
after this case?

699
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:01,712
If we quit,

700
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:04,590
we become the team
that ran away after coaxing

701
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:06,675
Korea's sweetheart to sue her mother.

702
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:08,344
The worst piece of trash team in Korea.

703
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:09,929
And you're their captain.

704
00:40:14,558 --> 00:40:16,769
What do you want to do, Captain?

705
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:24,985
Fuck.

706
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:37,331
Ji-hye.

707
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:39,291
Shall we go in, Ji-hye?

708
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,293
Be careful.

709
00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:44,838
Elijah.

710
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,008
She was constantly asking me
to come see you

711
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:51,178
because she was worried about you.

712
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:55,766
I bought your favorite, strawberries.

713
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:02,773
But you have it hard too.

714
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:06,193
Ji-hye!

715
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:07,987
Ji-hye?

716
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:11,949
Ji-hye, is something bothering you?

717
00:41:14,618 --> 00:41:16,370
Should we sit for a moment?

718
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:20,124
-Let me see.
-Okay.

719
00:41:23,586 --> 00:41:24,503
Ji-hye!

720
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:28,799
Ji-hye.

721
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,179
Who did this to you?

722
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:45,316
Yeong-sil!

723
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:54,783
How did it go?

724
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:03,334
Ji-hye's case didn't go well?

725
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,050
They can't punish Ji-hye's uncle either?

726
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:14,553
He'll only get a slap on the wrist
for the assault.

727
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:17,973
The charge of embezzling
the death benefits of Ji-hye's parents

728
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:20,809
was dismissed
without even an investigation.

729
00:42:20,893 --> 00:42:25,147
I had begged them to investigate it
because there's a civil suit too.

730
00:42:27,524 --> 00:42:28,525
What kind of law is this?

731
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:30,569
So it's okay to steal if you're family?

732
00:42:31,236 --> 00:42:34,615
That's why some people took their cases
to the Constitutional Court.

733
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:38,202
But it was ruled constitutional
about a decade ago.

734
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:45,584
Then, are we all out of options now?

735
00:42:45,668 --> 00:42:46,835
For both Ji-hye and me?

736
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:50,339
At a legal level, that's correct.

737
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:53,759
Is this right?

738
00:42:55,135 --> 00:42:56,929
You're attorneys.

739
00:42:57,513 --> 00:42:58,847
Is the law always correct?

740
00:42:58,931 --> 00:43:02,559
You can do anything you want
if you're family?

741
00:43:10,818 --> 00:43:12,194
No, you can't.

742
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:15,406
Elijah.

743
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:19,993
Actually, I ran away from home
before you ran from yours.

744
00:43:20,077 --> 00:43:23,497
I left my home when I was in high school.

745
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:27,042
Wait. You never mentioned that before.

746
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,502
It's not a pleasant story.

747
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:32,214
My father ran a big business.

748
00:43:32,297 --> 00:43:35,050
He had two wives.

749
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:35,968
The problem was

750
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,097
my mother was the second one.

751
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:43,767
Yeong-sil.

752
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:46,937
Father came home once a week.

753
00:43:48,647 --> 00:43:50,858
But he didn't like me at all.

754
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:52,776
I stuttered

755
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,611
every time I saw him

756
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:56,780
because I was so nervous.

757
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,701
I still stutter
when I get even a little nervous.

758
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:02,119
Like right now…

759
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,789
I stutter.

760
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:11,462
How can I be an attorney
when I'm like this?

761
00:44:12,755 --> 00:44:13,672
It's funny, isn't it?

762
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:18,719
Is that why you stayed quiet?

763
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:21,221
Whenever I stuttered,

764
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:24,641
Father would beat me so badly.

765
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:28,228
He said it was the only way to cure it.

766
00:44:28,854 --> 00:44:30,314
Up until high school,

767
00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:35,277
I was beaten every week.

768
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,071
Now, I'm certain of it.

769
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:38,989
That…

770
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:43,202
That was a crime.

771
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:46,371
We can't cover up crimes

772
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:49,208
in the name of family anymore.

773
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:52,169
Mr. Kang.

774
00:44:52,878 --> 00:44:55,881
We have to do something.

775
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:03,222
Mr. Jang.

776
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:09,645
This time, it's a totally different case.

777
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:12,981
The Exemption of Crimes by Family
has existed as a legal provision

778
00:45:13,065 --> 00:45:15,776
since the establishment
of the Constitution in 1953.

779
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:19,905
It was already ruled constitutional
in 2012 at the Constitutional Court.

780
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:22,824
It might also provoke public outrage.

781
00:45:22,908 --> 00:45:24,952
-And--
-Use me.

782
00:45:26,995 --> 00:45:27,871
Sorry?

783
00:45:27,955 --> 00:45:30,666
Think of how many people out there
are like Ji-hye.

784
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:34,836
I'm a celebrity who makes a living
off of people's attention.

785
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:40,759
Use me to show the world
that people like Ji-hye exist.

786
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:43,637
People are being oppressed
in the name of family,

787
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:47,057
and they're not protected by the law.

788
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,600
Elijah.

789
00:45:48,684 --> 00:45:50,936
What if we gather the victims
of family property crimes

790
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,563
and file a lawsuit together?

791
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:54,231
I'll pay for all of it.

792
00:45:55,357 --> 00:45:57,234
Including Ji-hye's too, of course.

793
00:46:02,739 --> 00:46:04,241
We appreciate it,

794
00:46:06,118 --> 00:46:07,035
but you can't.

795
00:46:07,786 --> 00:46:09,079
-What?
-Why not?

796
00:46:10,163 --> 00:46:11,248
Because…

797
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:16,670
that's a job
for us pro bono attorneys to do.

798
00:46:20,132 --> 00:46:21,425
Right, Mr. Kang?

799
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,347
The team is on the verge
of being disbanded.

800
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:29,308
You want to take on a fight

801
00:46:29,391 --> 00:46:33,520
where we have a low chance of winning
and a high chance of being denounced?

802
00:46:33,604 --> 00:46:35,230
Yes!

803
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:38,275
That's what pro bono attorneys do.

804
00:46:45,198 --> 00:46:47,284
Do you all really feel the same?

805
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:50,954
Really?

806
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:08,180
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

807
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:16,104
I have to keep my promise to you, Mom.

808
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:17,439
What should I do?

809
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:22,444
I've become entangled with clueless fools.

810
00:47:27,157 --> 00:47:29,701
You haven't dropped the lawsuit yet.

811
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:32,204
Are you disobeying me?

812
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:35,624
Are you saying,

813
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,293
"I'm still the CEO here"?

814
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:39,252
Is that it?

815
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:43,924
Call a partners' meeting

816
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,760
to discuss a replacement for CEO.

817
00:47:47,886 --> 00:47:49,179
Yes, Father.

818
00:47:53,308 --> 00:47:54,393
But before I do that,

819
00:47:55,143 --> 00:47:56,853
please take a look at this.

820
00:47:57,854 --> 00:47:59,022
What is this?

821
00:47:59,606 --> 00:48:02,192
It's a recording transcript
made by Ms. Seo, who you fired.

822
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:06,196
It's what you discussed on the phone
regarding the appeal case

823
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:07,531
of CEO Jang Hyeon-bae.

824
00:48:09,074 --> 00:48:10,450
With someone in the Supreme Court.

825
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:12,994
-What are you doing?
-What are you going to do?

826
00:48:13,078 --> 00:48:16,456
An alleged trial rigging
could be fatal to our firm.

827
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:20,711
If the senior attorneys
find out about this transcript,

828
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,922
there will be quite a disturbance.

829
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:27,801
Did you set a trap?

830
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:31,346
No way.

831
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,473
Ms. Seo came to me,

832
00:48:33,557 --> 00:48:35,475
crying and saying it was unfair.

833
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:38,812
You fired her mercilessly in front of me.

834
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:42,774
Don't be ridiculous.

835
00:48:43,442 --> 00:48:45,402
You probably bought her off in advance.

836
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,283
If I did,

837
00:48:52,117 --> 00:48:53,618
I must've learned it from you.

838
00:48:54,745 --> 00:48:57,497
"There is no one in the world
without a weakness."

839
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:00,625
"If such a person does exist,

840
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:04,629
plant a weakness."

841
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:15,098
I'm impressed.

842
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:18,643
Okay.

843
00:49:19,811 --> 00:49:23,273
I'll watch your childish game
a little longer.

844
00:49:39,164 --> 00:49:41,625
TRANSCRIPT

845
00:49:58,266 --> 00:49:59,518
Hey, Jung-in.

846
00:49:59,601 --> 00:50:00,560
Let's do it.

847
00:50:01,186 --> 00:50:03,355
Did you persuade Dr. Oh?

848
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:04,564
Persuade?

849
00:50:05,065 --> 00:50:08,235
If you lose, it'll be over
for both me and you.

850
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:26,920
Mr. Kang!

851
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,799
My motto has always been,

852
00:50:31,424 --> 00:50:34,594
"Don't start a fight you can't win."

853
00:50:37,138 --> 00:50:38,557
But I can't do that this time…

854
00:50:41,268 --> 00:50:42,811
because of some clueless fools.

855
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:44,896
Mr. Kang, then that means…

856
00:50:47,816 --> 00:50:48,650
Let's go.

857
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:51,403
-Really?
-To the Constitutional Court?

858
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:52,779
That would take forever.

859
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:54,364
Then, where do you want to go?

860
00:50:54,447 --> 00:50:56,575
I looked into the Constitutional Court,

861
00:50:56,658 --> 00:50:58,702
and another constitutional complaint
had been filed.

862
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:00,704
It's been a while,
but it hasn't gotten far.

863
00:51:01,413 --> 00:51:02,873
It hasn't been getting attention.

864
00:51:02,956 --> 00:51:07,043
Let's make it so we get all the attention.

865
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:08,211
Because we have

866
00:51:09,379 --> 00:51:10,505
a star.

867
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:12,090
No way!

868
00:51:12,173 --> 00:51:14,259
A street concert to urge
an unconstitutional ruling?

869
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:15,552
That's attention seeking.

870
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:17,888
-Then what?
-Change the law?

871
00:51:17,971 --> 00:51:20,181
The biggest stage would be…

872
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,434
Yeouido.

873
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:30,358
Let's go to the National Assembly

874
00:51:30,442 --> 00:51:32,569
to change an unjust law.

875
00:51:33,945 --> 00:51:34,905
Yes!

876
00:51:34,988 --> 00:51:35,989
Let's go!

877
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:44,205
You can sit this out if you want.
I'll talk to Oh Jung-in--

878
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:45,290
It's okay.

879
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:48,543
It's the majority's decision,

880
00:51:49,169 --> 00:51:50,337
so I should follow it.

881
00:51:52,172 --> 00:51:53,089
Jun-u.

882
00:51:53,173 --> 00:51:55,675
I'll do my job as a part of the team.

883
00:51:56,468 --> 00:51:58,345
Please do your job as well, Mr. Kang.

884
00:51:59,012 --> 00:51:59,930
Promise me

885
00:52:01,681 --> 00:52:02,641
you'll win it.

886
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,993
Popular singer Elijah

887
00:52:22,077 --> 00:52:24,704
was selected as a witness
for the Assembly's government audit,

888
00:52:24,788 --> 00:52:26,373
garnering significant attention.

889
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:28,124
All eyes are on Elijah to see

890
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:31,336
if she will testify before the Assembly
about allegations of embezzlement

891
00:52:31,419 --> 00:52:33,213
against her mother.

892
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:36,174
Elijah has already
sparked intense interest

893
00:52:36,257 --> 00:52:39,219
in property crimes among family
with her recent lawsuit

894
00:52:39,302 --> 00:52:41,763
against Cha Jin-hui,
her mother and the CEO of her agency,

895
00:52:41,846 --> 00:52:44,057
to terminate her exclusive contract.

896
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,102
Hey, all the Assembly members are excited.

897
00:52:47,185 --> 00:52:49,729
It's their chance to get a close-up
on network news.

898
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:50,730
Is that so?

899
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:52,941
All the beauty salons in Yeouido
are fully booked.

900
00:52:53,024 --> 00:52:56,069
I heard they unanimously
selected her as a witness.

901
00:52:56,152 --> 00:52:58,488
It's nice to be a celebrity
in times like this.

902
00:53:02,158 --> 00:53:04,577
CHA HOLDING PRESS CONFERENCE,
PREPARE TO RESPOND

903
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:06,413
-What on earth?
-What?

904
00:53:06,496 --> 00:53:07,831
Is there something going on?

905
00:53:08,456 --> 00:53:09,374
Hey.

906
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,335
-Take a look.
-What is it?

907
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:14,379
Breaking news.

908
00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:16,840
As top star Elijah's
expected attendance tomorrow

909
00:53:16,923 --> 00:53:19,300
at the National Assembly
draws attention across the country,

910
00:53:19,384 --> 00:53:21,720
her mother, CEO Cha Jin-hui,

911
00:53:21,803 --> 00:53:24,305
opened an emergency press conference
moments ago.

912
00:53:24,889 --> 00:53:26,891
Woo Myeong-hun, that prick.

913
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:31,688
Just blame me.

914
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:33,148
I'm a bad…

915
00:53:37,986 --> 00:53:39,154
I'm a bad mother.

916
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:44,951
Ms. Cha's deep maternal love,
as you can see,

917
00:53:45,035 --> 00:53:47,370
was the cause of everything.

918
00:53:48,455 --> 00:53:50,415
What do you mean by this?

919
00:53:57,505 --> 00:53:58,715
My daughter…

920
00:54:01,176 --> 00:54:05,180
left home and abandoned me
because of a guy.

921
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:10,685
And she filed a lawsuit
against me right away.

922
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:14,939
She's accusing her mother
of embezzlement and theft.

923
00:54:16,816 --> 00:54:20,653
This is just killing me.

924
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:24,699
Use this, Ms. Cha.

925
00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:30,121
These days, there's a term called "MOW."

926
00:54:30,205 --> 00:54:34,000
It means a "man-obsessed…"

927
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:37,212
Something like that.
To put it nicely,

928
00:54:37,295 --> 00:54:39,297
they've lost their minds over love.

929
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:41,883
Isn't it true Ms. Cha admitted

930
00:54:41,966 --> 00:54:44,719
to all embezzlement charges
in civil court,

931
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:47,305
but wasn't investigated
due to Exemption of Crimes by Family?

932
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:56,064
Ms. Cha, we have no choice.

933
00:54:56,147 --> 00:54:59,776
Please tell the truth about this matter.

934
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:01,402
Mr. Woo, you're so cruel.

935
00:55:01,486 --> 00:55:05,907
How could you ask me to say that myself?

936
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:13,540
I will say it on her behalf then.

937
00:55:13,623 --> 00:55:14,499
Ms. Cha…

938
00:55:14,582 --> 00:55:17,919
No, Cha Jin-hui,
who is a mother before being a CEO,

939
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:21,965
made a false confession
to take all the blame for the embezzlement

940
00:55:22,048 --> 00:55:23,842
that her son committed by himself

941
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:26,136
and said she did it all.

942
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:27,679
What are you talking about?

943
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,514
Mom.

944
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:31,808
You know that's not true.

945
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:40,775
Mom?

946
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:44,028
-Ms. Cha!
-Ms. Cha!

947
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,655
I have a question!

948
00:55:45,738 --> 00:55:46,656
What?

949
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:47,907
Did you see?

950
00:55:49,075 --> 00:55:50,535
This is what a mother is.

951
00:55:51,244 --> 00:55:53,705
Someone who embraces
all her children's faults as her own.

952
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:57,292
That's what mothers do. But…

953
00:55:57,876 --> 00:56:00,253
But Elijah,
the so-called "Korea's daughter,"

954
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:01,713
wants to send her mother to jail--

955
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:04,257
I'm shocked.
How can she do that to her mom?

956
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,885
But a mother can't dump
her adult daughter's boyfriend.

957
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:08,928
I'm afraid my daughter will do that.

958
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:11,890
She's not Korea's sweetheart.
She's Korea's unfilial girl.

959
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:24,944
-Elijah!
-Elijah!

960
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:27,822
Top star Elijah will arrive shortly
for the Assembly's…

961
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:29,157
Lies every time she speaks.

962
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,366
WE LOVE YOU, ELIJAH

963
00:56:30,992 --> 00:56:34,370
Her detractors and her fans have gathered
in front of the National Assembly.

964
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:39,167
And they have been aggressively
expressing their respective opinions.

965
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,752
What are we going to do with her?

966
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:42,378
Elijah is here!

967
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:43,504
Elijah!

968
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:51,512
-Elijah!
-Elijah!

969
00:56:53,556 --> 00:56:54,557
-We object!
-We object!

970
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:56,476
Are you okay?

971
00:56:57,352 --> 00:56:58,228
Are you all right?

972
00:56:58,311 --> 00:56:59,479
Let's just go.

973
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:07,695
GOVERNMENT AUDIT
FOR CRIMINAL ACT AND SYSTEM REFORM

974
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:11,783
After the press conference yesterday,

975
00:57:11,866 --> 00:57:14,953
we also chose Ms. Cha Jin-hui

976
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:17,413
as a witness for the sake of fairness.

977
00:57:17,914 --> 00:57:19,958
Are the counsels for both parties present?

978
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:22,210
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

979
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:25,213
Honorable Chairman, with your permission,

980
00:57:25,296 --> 00:57:28,007
would it be okay
if Ms. Cha Jin-hui could say a few words

981
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:31,761
before Elijah makes her witness statement?

982
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:34,931
Sure. Go ahead.

983
00:57:35,014 --> 00:57:35,932
Thank you.

984
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:38,268
Thank you.

985
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:40,186
To the honorable members of the Assembly,

986
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:46,359
this foolish mother
would like to ask a shameless favor.

987
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:49,320
My daughter was traumatized by her father

988
00:57:49,404 --> 00:57:51,281
who yelled and got angry
when she was young,

989
00:57:51,364 --> 00:57:54,867
so she gets severely upset
in similar situations.

990
00:57:55,451 --> 00:57:56,953
I know this is a serious setting,

991
00:57:57,036 --> 00:58:00,248
but I sincerely request
that you ask her questions

992
00:58:00,331 --> 00:58:02,584
in the softest way possible.

993
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:08,381
Even in a situation like this,
you still worry about your daughter.

994
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:11,467
Because I'm her mother.

995
00:58:12,135 --> 00:58:17,015
Even if she stabs me in the heart
and steals everything from me,

996
00:58:17,724 --> 00:58:21,603
a mother still hopes
her child does not trip

997
00:58:21,686 --> 00:58:23,229
on her way out.

998
00:58:25,231 --> 00:58:26,524
We'll keep that in mind.

999
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:30,028
I ask the Assembly members
to be extra careful.

1000
00:58:30,111 --> 00:58:34,824
Okay, then. Ms. Elijah,
please come stand at the witness podium.

1001
00:58:34,907 --> 00:58:36,200
Yes, sir.

1002
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:47,920
Ms. Elijah,
we will refer to you as Witness.

1003
00:58:48,004 --> 00:58:49,213
Yes, sir.

1004
00:58:49,297 --> 00:58:51,883
Did you see
the press conference yesterday?

1005
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:55,678
-Yes.
-Was what she said true?

1006
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:03,061
Some of it was true,
but some of it wasn't.

1007
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:05,313
Which part was true?

1008
00:59:12,362 --> 00:59:13,738
When I was young,

1009
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:17,700
my father did break stuff in the house

1010
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:21,496
without any reason whenever he was drunk.

1011
00:59:22,497 --> 00:59:23,998
Every time he did that,

1012
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:27,335
my mother hugged
and protected us with her whole body.

1013
00:59:28,628 --> 00:59:31,464
Then, she divorced our father for us

1014
00:59:32,256 --> 00:59:34,133
and struggled to make ends meet.

1015
00:59:34,717 --> 00:59:35,802
That's all true.

1016
00:59:38,346 --> 00:59:40,640
Honorable Assemblyman Kim Jun-pyo,

1017
00:59:40,723 --> 00:59:44,227
could you ask
the witness, Elijah, a question?

1018
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:48,189
-You can ask her yourself.
-Thank you.

1019
00:59:50,274 --> 00:59:51,234
Witness.

1020
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:53,319
Yes?

1021
00:59:53,403 --> 00:59:56,698
You know a constitutional complaint
on the Exemption of Crimes by Family

1022
00:59:56,781 --> 00:59:59,450
is in progress. Correct?

1023
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:01,035
Yes.

1024
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,080
Did you come here to form public opinion

1025
01:00:04,163 --> 01:00:08,292
to influence that constitutional trial?

1026
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:10,962
That is right.

1027
01:00:11,629 --> 01:00:13,256
So in the end,

1028
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:16,384
you're trying to change the law
so that your mother,

1029
01:00:16,467 --> 01:00:19,762
who struggled to raise you,
will be punished criminally.

1030
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:21,264
Correct?

1031
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,444
Yes, that is correct.

1032
01:00:37,947 --> 01:00:39,073
That is all.

1033
01:00:39,157 --> 01:00:40,199
Thank you, Assemblyman.

1034
01:00:41,784 --> 01:00:45,830
I think this actually shows why we need
the Exemption of Crimes by Family.

1035
01:00:45,913 --> 01:00:47,498
I think the witness has shown us proof

1036
01:00:47,582 --> 01:00:51,085
that a family can be maintained

1037
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:53,296
when there's a limit
preventing parents and children

1038
01:00:53,379 --> 01:00:56,090
from suing each other
over property issues.

1039
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:58,551
Isn't that so, Witness?

1040
01:01:01,512 --> 01:01:02,638
Witness?

1041
01:01:03,806 --> 01:01:04,932
Sir.

1042
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:08,853
I'm Witness Elijah's attorney,
Kang Da-wit.

1043
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:10,855
May I say a few words?

1044
01:01:10,938 --> 01:01:13,024
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

1045
01:01:19,781 --> 01:01:20,615
Ms. Cha.

1046
01:01:21,657 --> 01:01:25,870
You know how smart and brilliant
your daughter is, don't you?

1047
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:29,248
Don't you see why
such a smart person for all that time

1048
01:01:29,332 --> 01:01:31,834
did everything her mother told her to do,

1049
01:01:31,918 --> 01:01:34,337
signed every contract
her mother handed her,

1050
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,547
and didn't ask or complain

1051
01:01:36,631 --> 01:01:39,342
about whether she was being properly paid?

1052
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:44,096
-Don't you get it?
-What are you talking about right now?

1053
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:47,809
Did you think she really had no idea?

1054
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:55,817
Am I supposed to answer that?

1055
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,610
No, just answer what you can.

1056
01:01:58,694 --> 01:02:00,822
Do you really think she didn't know?

1057
01:02:05,952 --> 01:02:06,828
Ms. Elijah.

1058
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:13,167
You endured everything
despite knowing all along, didn't you?

1059
01:02:16,754 --> 01:02:18,589
You were grateful
for how she protected you

1060
01:02:18,673 --> 01:02:20,258
when you were young.

1061
01:02:21,008 --> 01:02:22,134
Despite knowing all along,

1062
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:25,137
you endured it.

1063
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:27,765
Correct?

1064
01:02:46,826 --> 01:02:51,581
No matter how hard you try to hide it,
the truth is bound to be revealed.

1065
01:02:51,664 --> 01:02:54,333
It's because there are people

1066
01:02:55,084 --> 01:02:56,878
who genuinely care about the witness.

1067
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:03,718
Even within EK Entertainment,

1068
01:03:03,801 --> 01:03:08,598
do you know many people
are truly worried about you, Ms. Cha?

1069
01:03:08,681 --> 01:03:12,310
And your love for luxury brands
and your extravagant taste?

1070
01:03:14,645 --> 01:03:17,231
What are you talking about?

1071
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:19,817
This is the hallowed National Assembly.

1072
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:22,069
On what grounds,
are you making these claims--

1073
01:03:22,153 --> 01:03:24,697
Under whose name
is the Seongsu-dong apartment you bought

1074
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,616
with the money you stole from Elijah?

1075
01:03:28,117 --> 01:03:29,368
Wait a minute.

1076
01:03:29,452 --> 01:03:31,329
Wait. What are you talking about?

1077
01:03:31,412 --> 01:03:34,206
Can he say whatever he likes
because he's an attorney?

1078
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,876
Ms. Cha, please calm down.

1079
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,629
Counselors, are you two here to fight?

1080
01:03:40,504 --> 01:03:43,090
This is a place
for explaining, listening, and asking.

1081
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:45,593
Please be careful.

1082
01:03:45,676 --> 01:03:47,386
Okay. Please continue, Counsel.

1083
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,848
Sir, we have one more key witness present.

1084
01:03:50,932 --> 01:03:51,974
May they come in?

1085
01:03:54,644 --> 01:03:56,270
I will allow it. Let them in.

1086
01:03:56,354 --> 01:03:58,314
-Thank you, sir. Mr. Hwang?
-Who's the witness?

1087
01:04:00,524 --> 01:04:03,611
-Can they do that?
-No. Usually, they can't.

1088
01:04:13,245 --> 01:04:15,331
Not you. You do it.

1089
01:04:19,835 --> 01:04:22,755
Chairman, may he come stand at the podium?

1090
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:24,298
Yes.

1091
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:26,550
Elijah.

1092
01:04:33,516 --> 01:04:34,558
Mr. Kang Min-ha.

1093
01:04:36,143 --> 01:04:39,063
You're a sales associate for VIPs

1094
01:04:39,146 --> 01:04:42,525
at a luxury brand store
in Cheongdam-dong. Correct?

1095
01:04:43,609 --> 01:04:44,485
Yes, that's correct.

1096
01:04:45,111 --> 01:04:49,615
Could you tell us who bought you
the apartment you are living in?

1097
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:55,413
Yes. It was Ms. Cha
who is sitting right here.

1098
01:05:05,548 --> 01:05:08,134
I'm sorry, but may I see
the company card you carry?

1099
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:09,677
Yes.

1100
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,180
Gosh, it's a black card!

1101
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:17,351
Goodness. Which company's card is this?

1102
01:05:17,435 --> 01:05:19,812
I heard this card
has a really high credit limit.

1103
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:22,314
It belongs to EK Entertainment's CEO.

1104
01:05:24,275 --> 01:05:27,278
My goodness. Oh, dear.

1105
01:05:27,361 --> 01:05:29,071
The Exemption of Crimes by Family

1106
01:05:29,155 --> 01:05:31,949
doesn't apply
to embezzlement of corporate funds.

1107
01:05:32,033 --> 01:05:35,244
It's not true. He's lying.

1108
01:05:35,327 --> 01:05:36,620
I don't remember that card.

1109
01:05:36,704 --> 01:05:38,372
And I don't even know who he is.

1110
01:05:38,456 --> 01:05:42,168
I see. I didn't know
you were generous enough

1111
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:45,713
to give this to a total stranger.

1112
01:05:45,796 --> 01:05:46,881
I understand.

1113
01:05:47,882 --> 01:05:51,260
Mr. Kang, why did Ms. Cha
offer these to you?

1114
01:05:57,558 --> 01:05:59,977
This is embarrassing to say,

1115
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:02,438
but she said she liked me.

1116
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:10,362
Okay, all right.

1117
01:06:16,118 --> 01:06:17,369
That ungrateful child.

1118
01:06:18,037 --> 01:06:20,414
I made her a star.

1119
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:24,168
She's a nobody who thinks she became
a success because she's special.

1120
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:37,223
I'm going to live for myself from now on…

1121
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:40,392
with you

1122
01:06:41,936 --> 01:06:42,812
while having fun.

1123
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:45,815
Chairman.

1124
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:49,318
These days, there's a term called "MOW."

1125
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:51,445
Pardon? MO…

1126
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:53,322
It's a "man-obsessed…"

1127
01:06:56,033 --> 01:06:59,954
Something like that. To put it nicely,
they've lost their minds over love.

1128
01:07:00,037 --> 01:07:01,372
Kang Da-wit, that crazy…

1129
01:07:02,373 --> 01:07:04,667
Mr. Kang, it must've been
a difficult decision

1130
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:08,170
to go against a big sugar mama… Sorry.

1131
01:07:08,254 --> 01:07:10,131
To go against someone
you're so grateful to.

1132
01:07:10,214 --> 01:07:14,009
What made you decide
to disclose the truth?

1133
01:07:14,093 --> 01:07:17,304
What? It's because you said

1134
01:07:17,388 --> 01:07:18,806
you'd try me as an accomplice…

1135
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,230
Isn't there another reason?

1136
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:30,109
Right. Well…

1137
01:07:30,693 --> 01:07:32,987
The apartment Ms. Cha gave me

1138
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:35,197
turned out to be pretty run-down.

1139
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:37,533
It's worthless with a full mortgage.

1140
01:07:37,616 --> 01:07:38,951
No, this is a fabrication!

1141
01:07:39,994 --> 01:07:40,870
Who on earth are you?

1142
01:07:40,953 --> 01:07:42,705
Witness, she says she doesn't know you.

1143
01:07:42,788 --> 01:07:46,959
-If you commit perjury, you'll be--
-Ms. Cha, I seriously trusted you.

1144
01:07:47,042 --> 01:07:51,005
But she gave the real deal
to a top host bar guy.

1145
01:07:51,088 --> 01:07:54,049
-How could you…
-This is slander, sir!

1146
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:57,553
-How can love change?
-Calm down!

1147
01:07:58,846 --> 01:08:00,848
Calm down. This is not a court.

1148
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,435
Both Counsels, that is enough.

1149
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:08,314
We'll resume after taking a short break.

1150
01:08:11,317 --> 01:08:13,485
Elijah, drink some water.

1151
01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:20,242
You did great, Mr. Kang.

1152
01:08:20,993 --> 01:08:24,079
Now, you can say
what you've really wanted to say.

1153
01:08:24,163 --> 01:08:25,164
Everything is set.

1154
01:08:26,832 --> 01:08:28,000
Okay.

1155
01:08:29,043 --> 01:08:30,336
Mr. Jang!

1156
01:08:30,419 --> 01:08:31,754
Elijah.

1157
01:08:31,837 --> 01:08:33,422
Hi, Elijah.

1158
01:08:33,505 --> 01:08:34,673
Hi, Ji-hye!

1159
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,555
-Thank you, Mr. Jang.
-It's nothing.

1160
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:44,141
-Good luck, Elijah!
-Good luck!

1161
01:08:47,645 --> 01:08:48,520
You can do it.

1162
01:08:52,858 --> 01:08:54,276
How did my mother and I…

1163
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,949
end up like this?

1164
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:04,536
She was such a good mother
when I was young.

1165
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,834
Was it the money?

1166
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:13,337
Maybe.

1167
01:09:15,381 --> 01:09:18,425
Our family had never
laid hands on that kind of money,

1168
01:09:18,509 --> 01:09:20,552
and when it started pouring in,

1169
01:09:21,136 --> 01:09:23,180
I think it all started then.

1170
01:09:25,182 --> 01:09:26,433
Honestly,

1171
01:09:26,517 --> 01:09:28,978
I didn't want to go this far
and fight with my mom.

1172
01:09:29,853 --> 01:09:30,729
Money?

1173
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:33,482
I didn't care if I gave it all to her.

1174
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:38,904
All I wanted

1175
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,448
was freedom.

1176
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:48,205
I didn't want to live my whole life
as her ATM machine.

1177
01:09:48,289 --> 01:09:50,791
If I could somehow
get the exclusive contract terminated,

1178
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:53,877
I was going to leave.

1179
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,131
But…

1180
01:10:02,303 --> 01:10:03,304
Elijah.

1181
01:10:10,144 --> 01:10:12,021
When I met Ji-hye over there,

1182
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:17,067
I realized it was not just about me.

1183
01:10:18,193 --> 01:10:20,195
Not only did Ji-hye's uncle and his wife

1184
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:22,781
embezzle their niece's disability pension,

1185
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:27,411
but they also still kicked her out
into the streets to beg to make money.

1186
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:30,789
If she didn't make enough money,
they'd beat her.

1187
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:34,418
It's sad, but sometimes,

1188
01:10:35,586 --> 01:10:39,089
family can be the assailant
who's the closest to you.

1189
01:10:41,425 --> 01:10:43,844
Is she talking about me as the assailant?

1190
01:10:44,595 --> 01:10:45,721
Just listen.

1191
01:10:48,974 --> 01:10:50,601
Could you stand for a moment?

1192
01:10:52,811 --> 01:10:53,854
Ji-hye.

1193
01:10:57,566 --> 01:11:02,279
They are the members of my fan club
and victims of family property crimes

1194
01:11:02,363 --> 01:11:04,865
who have gathered here,
thanks to pro bono attorneys.

1195
01:11:05,366 --> 01:11:09,078
An elderly man whose entire fortune
was stolen by his child.

1196
01:11:09,161 --> 01:11:12,289
A boy whose inheritance from his mom
was stolen by his stepdad.

1197
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:15,918
A person with a physical disability

1198
01:11:16,001 --> 01:11:19,088
who couldn't stop her brother
from taking her money.

1199
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,924
I'm embarrassed to say

1200
01:11:23,217 --> 01:11:25,219
I've received more love than I deserve,

1201
01:11:25,928 --> 01:11:28,347
but I haven't taken
full responsibility for it.

1202
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:33,769
I simply exist because you care
and show interest in me.

1203
01:11:34,353 --> 01:11:37,356
The only way to repay this love
is to become a tool

1204
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:39,149
to help tell the world

1205
01:11:39,233 --> 01:11:41,110
about the suffering people endure

1206
01:11:41,193 --> 01:11:43,862
that hasn't received attention
but needs to be known.

1207
01:11:45,864 --> 01:11:48,659
Please help them to ease their pain

1208
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:54,248
and the injustice they feel when the law
and their families don't protect them.

1209
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,750
Elijah.

1210
01:12:00,671 --> 01:12:04,341
The Exemption of Crimes by Family
has existed since ancient Rome.

1211
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:07,594
The famous saying goes, "The law stops
at the doorstep of the house."

1212
01:12:07,678 --> 01:12:10,097
It's a custom that's very old.

1213
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,265
And in Korea,

1214
01:12:11,348 --> 01:12:14,226
the law hasn't changed for over 70 years
since it was established.

1215
01:12:14,309 --> 01:12:18,647
Legal stability is a value
that is as important as,

1216
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:22,734
or even more important than,
specific validity.

1217
01:12:24,069 --> 01:12:25,154
Yes, you are right.

1218
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:29,700
Legal stability.
That's an important value.

1219
01:12:29,783 --> 01:12:34,705
But, sir, if it hasn't changed
for over 70 years,

1220
01:12:34,788 --> 01:12:37,416
couldn't that also mean

1221
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:42,754
some have been suffering
for over 70 years?

1222
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:47,134
If the law stops
at the doorstep of the house,

1223
01:12:47,217 --> 01:12:52,347
brutal, lawless chaos
unfolds behind that door.

1224
01:12:52,973 --> 01:12:55,225
Honorable members of the Assembly,

1225
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,898
the law should change
along with the changing times.

1226
01:13:01,607 --> 01:13:04,318
I believe it is the noble duty
of the National Assembly

1227
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:07,154
to breathe life into the law

1228
01:13:07,237 --> 01:13:10,032
so it becomes a standard
that lives and breathes with the times,

1229
01:13:10,532 --> 01:13:12,618
rather than a fossil trapped in the past.

1230
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,663
Members of the Assembly,

1231
01:13:17,998 --> 01:13:19,374
I humbly ask

1232
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:22,586
for your wise decision.

1233
01:13:48,904 --> 01:13:49,947
Mr. Woo.

1234
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,033
Mr. Woo.

1235
01:13:53,116 --> 01:13:55,035
Excuse me, Mr. Woo!

1236
01:13:57,663 --> 01:13:58,872
What do we do?

1237
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:02,876
-We should talk to a prosecutors' office--
-Why do you keep touching me?

1238
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,503
Are you going to say you like me too?

1239
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:07,631
-Mr. Woo!
-Never!

1240
01:14:07,714 --> 01:14:10,968
I never take on clients
who don't tell me everything.

1241
01:14:11,051 --> 01:14:12,678
Find another attorney.

1242
01:14:14,179 --> 01:14:15,389
Wait.

1243
01:14:15,472 --> 01:14:17,516
Wait, Mr. Woo.

1244
01:14:17,599 --> 01:14:19,226
Come on, Mr. Woo!

1245
01:14:19,309 --> 01:14:20,561
Wait!

1246
01:14:20,644 --> 01:14:21,812
Hey, you!

1247
01:14:26,608 --> 01:14:30,404
-For goodness' sake! What is it now?
-I really hate to admit it…

1248
01:14:34,157 --> 01:14:35,951
But you were pretty cool today, Mr. Kang.

1249
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:40,247
Come on, now. Please.

1250
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:42,207
That's old news.

1251
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:43,709
When was I ever not cool?

1252
01:14:44,543 --> 01:14:47,045
There you go bragging again. This was why…

1253
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:51,008
But how will it go?
Will we be able to win?

1254
01:14:52,926 --> 01:14:55,679
We don't know. We might lose.

1255
01:14:55,762 --> 01:14:56,805
But you know what?

1256
01:14:57,806 --> 01:15:00,726
Even if we lose today,
it will become a stepping stone

1257
01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:04,271
for the world to take
half a step forward tomorrow.

1258
01:15:04,354 --> 01:15:09,067
And next time, someone will be able
to start fresh from there.

1259
01:15:10,861 --> 01:15:12,279
Mr. Kang!

1260
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:16,491
I know I said it,

1261
01:15:16,575 --> 01:15:18,869
but it was pretty cool. Do you agree?

1262
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:21,496
Right, Jun-u?

1263
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,957
Of course.
You sounded unfamiliar for a moment,

1264
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,918
but now, you sound
just like the Mr. Kang I know.

1265
01:15:27,002 --> 01:15:28,712
-What?
-"Even if we lose,

1266
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:32,132
today's win will be a stepping…"

1267
01:15:32,215 --> 01:15:33,050
Forget it.

1268
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:34,635
-Ms. Yoo, call me big bro now.
-Why?

1269
01:15:34,718 --> 01:15:36,720
You're the big bro
if you're the cool one, right?

1270
01:15:36,803 --> 01:15:38,472
-Why would I?
-"Even if we lose…"

1271
01:15:38,555 --> 01:15:40,599
-That's what you said!
-I didn't!

1272
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,476
ONE MONTH LATER

1273
01:15:42,559 --> 01:15:45,771
The Exemption of Crimes
by Family provision in this case

1274
01:15:45,854 --> 01:15:48,982
uniformly exempts
a wide range of relatives

1275
01:15:49,608 --> 01:15:53,195
from punishment for property crimes

1276
01:15:53,904 --> 01:15:55,697
without considering their severity.

1277
01:15:56,281 --> 01:15:58,950
Therefore, there is a concern

1278
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:02,287
it will result
in allowing financial exploitation

1279
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:05,499
of family members
in vulnerable positions.

1280
01:16:05,582 --> 01:16:09,461
Therefore, the Constitutional Court,
in which all members agreed unanimously,

1281
01:16:09,544 --> 01:16:11,421
rules the following.

1282
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:13,715
The Court rules

1283
01:16:14,549 --> 01:16:18,387
Article 328, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act

1284
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:21,890
is hereby declared unconstitutional.

1285
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:41,243
Today, the Constitutional Court
issued a historic ruling

1286
01:16:41,326 --> 01:16:44,746
that deemed the Exemption of Crimes
by Family as unconstitutional.

1287
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,540
Now, a path has opened

1288
01:16:46,623 --> 01:16:48,834
to protect people from the legal loophole

1289
01:16:48,917 --> 01:16:51,837
of property crimes committed
by their family members.

1290
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,547
-I'm the CEO here!
-Don't resist.

1291
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:54,464
Oh, my gosh!

1292
01:16:54,548 --> 01:16:56,174
Elijah.

1293
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:57,551
Wait. I was wrong.

1294
01:16:57,634 --> 01:16:59,553
-Let's go.
-I was wrong.

1295
01:16:59,636 --> 01:17:01,471
It was all a misunderstanding.

1296
01:17:01,555 --> 01:17:02,556
Mom.

1297
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:05,892
Hold on. Yes, Elijah?

1298
01:17:10,564 --> 01:17:11,857
Thank you

1299
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,985
for bringing me into this world

1300
01:17:15,819 --> 01:17:16,737
and raising me.

1301
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,870
Yes. My kind little Elijah.

1302
01:17:24,953 --> 01:17:26,997
Okay, you can drop the charges now,

1303
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,165
and we can--

1304
01:17:28,248 --> 01:17:29,082
But, Mom…

1305
01:17:32,377 --> 01:17:33,587
you're fired.

1306
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:36,673
I want you out of my life.

1307
01:17:38,675 --> 01:17:40,218
-Let's go.
-Go.

1308
01:17:40,302 --> 01:17:41,928
You know how hard I worked to raise you?

1309
01:17:42,012 --> 01:17:43,388
-Stop.
-Hey, you!

1310
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:45,056
Damn you, bitch!

1311
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:48,727
I'm the one who made you a star!

1312
01:18:25,722 --> 01:18:26,848
Excuse me.

1313
01:18:28,517 --> 01:18:30,435
Is this Team Pro Bono?

1314
01:18:30,519 --> 01:18:33,104
Yes, it is. Who are you?

1315
01:18:34,981 --> 01:18:37,150
The Alliance of Judicial Victims
referred me to you.

1316
01:18:37,234 --> 01:18:39,361
They said you'd take my case.

1317
01:18:39,444 --> 01:18:41,071
Right. They told us about you.

1318
01:18:41,154 --> 01:18:43,615
You lost your father
due to a wrongful trial.

1319
01:18:45,158 --> 01:18:46,034
Yes.

1320
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,371
The presiding judge abused his power

1321
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:53,250
and killed my father
through a manipulated trial.

1322
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,877
What was the name of the presiding judge?

1323
01:19:01,132 --> 01:19:02,259
Kang Da-wit.

1324
01:19:13,812 --> 01:19:15,188
Ms. Park Gi-ppeum.

1325
01:19:43,466 --> 01:19:45,468
I've spent the past ten years
gathering these.

1326
01:19:45,552 --> 01:19:47,053
Trust the evidence.

1327
01:19:47,137 --> 01:19:48,513
I don't care if I go to hell

1328
01:19:48,597 --> 01:19:51,474
as long as I can expose
Kang Da-wit's hypocrisy.

1329
01:19:51,558 --> 01:19:53,518
We've had a long, bitter history.

1330
01:19:53,602 --> 01:19:56,104
About Yoo Jae-beom,
his father was the CEO.

1331
01:19:56,187 --> 01:19:58,940
The defendant was changed by Mr. Kang.

1332
01:19:59,024 --> 01:20:00,650
Go get Yoo Baek-man.

1333
01:20:00,734 --> 01:20:01,860
Otherwise, I cannot proceed.

1334
01:20:01,943 --> 01:20:03,194
It was a manipulated trial.

1335
01:20:03,278 --> 01:20:05,906
What is happening?
CEO Jang's case was also rigged?

1336
01:20:05,989 --> 01:20:07,365
Is Kang Da-wit out of his mind?

1337
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:08,700
I will take care of it.

1338
01:20:08,783 --> 01:20:09,910
Step down.

1339
01:20:10,493 --> 01:20:12,412
-Why don't you take the case?
-How could we…

1340
01:20:12,495 --> 01:20:16,249
Isn't it your job to help the victims
of abuse-of-power crimes?

1341
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,001
Are you really going to take my case?

1342
01:20:18,084 --> 01:20:19,085
They all want to?

1343
01:20:19,169 --> 01:20:20,712
Please tell us everything.

1344
01:20:28,845 --> 01:20:30,847
