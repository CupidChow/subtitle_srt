1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,952
PRO BONO

2
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,371
Byeol.

3
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,666
Byeol?

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,667
-Byeol?
-Byeol!

5
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,045
Hey, Byeol! Over here! Byeol!

6
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,129
Mr. Kang!

7
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,088
Byeol!

8
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,548
-Byeol!
-Are you okay?

9
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,258
Why did you fall down?

10
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,761
You must have feeble legs.
You should've been careful!

11
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,345
That hurts!

12
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,475
Gi-ppeum, you shouldn't mention
one's physical weakness like that.

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,061
It's okay. Having weak legs is fine.

14
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:05,774
Now's not the time to make a fuss
about someone else's legs.

15
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,858
Hey, you punk!

16
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,068
How dare you!

17
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,028
What are you doing to our client?

18
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,405
"Client"? How can this mutt be a client?

19
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,323
"Mutt"?

20
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,992
Take back that derogatory term
for animals at once.

21
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,292
Oh Jung-in!

22
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,589
Byeol.

23
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,008
-How scary it must have been!
-Goodness, Byeol!

24
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,009
We were so worried.

25
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,388
Hey, this isn't right!

26
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,350
How could you send me
to that kind of place without asking me?

27
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,976
What's "that kind of place"?

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,895
Can you explain so I can understand?

29
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,149
If you're a part of management,
give me a position that suits my career!

30
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,152
Do you know how many chaebols
and National Assemblymen I've handled?

31
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,530
Asking for one's opinion

32
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,534
is only needed when one has
the ability to choose.

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,203
Isn't it, Attorney Kang?

34
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,455
What?

35
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,416
If you're done, may I go now?

36
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,587
I have a meeting.
I'm a part of management, you know.

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,716
Is it raining outside?

38
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,094
It's sunny though.

39
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,771
Sorry, those tracksuit pants
are all I have here.

40
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,024
Gosh, you're soaked up here too.

41
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,943
Goodness gracious.

42
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,611
-It's okay.
-Sorry?

43
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,612
I'll do it.

44
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,907
Okay. Then, I'll quickly go
and get these to the dry cleaner.

45
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,951
You look good in those pants.

46
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,123
Let me assess the situation first.

47
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,041
There has to be a reason.

48
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,671
A reason why Oh & Partners,
Korea's most expensive law firm,

49
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,674
made a pro bono team
that doesn't make a single cent of profit.

50
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,842
Hey, Byeol.

51
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,177
Good girl.

52
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,638
And…

53
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,473
the reason why they sent me here.

54
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,316
So, this mutt…

55
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,322
So, on accusations
of stealing this client,

56
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,741
you're being sued?

57
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,786
Steal Byeol? That's ridiculous.

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,955
We adopted Byeol,
and she's part of our family.

59
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,252
So-yeon rescues abandoned dogs.

60
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,880
After finding Byeol
roaming around without a collar--

61
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,423
She couldn't find her guardian,

62
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:39,385
so she asked the owner of the dog cafe
she worked part-time at to adopt her.

63
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,305
But the former guardian showed up later.

64
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,349
It's been a year and a half.

65
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,393
How could they show up now
after not looking for her this whole time?

66
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,396
People are fickle.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,941
When dogs get sick, they abandon them.

68
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,610
And when they get better
under their new guardians' care,

69
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,697
some say, "It's mine,"
and insist on getting them back.

70
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,616
At this rate, the legal process

71
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,037
of rescuing and adopting stray dogs
will fall apart, Mr. Kang.

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,916
That's right.
This is a really important case.

73
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,460
We have to resolve it.

74
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,628
At any cost.

75
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,886
Right. Indeed, it's really important.

76
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,557
From chaebol CEO trials
to a case of a stolen mutt…

77
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,686
Our Byeol…

78
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,606
I won't let her go. Never!

79
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,984
Never again!

80
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,611
"Again"?

81
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,282
What was the dog's condition like
when you first found her?

82
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,367
Byeol…

83
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,370
Her tail was drooped.

84
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,580
It seemed she hadn't eaten
for a really long time.

85
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,458
She didn't even bark
when I approached her.

86
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,085
She looked really nervous

87
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,837
and was having a hard time.

88
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,131
Where did you find her?

89
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,340
At Seongbukcheon Stream.

90
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,592
When you found her,
she didn't have a collar

91
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,428
-or a microchip, right?
-That's right.

92
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,265
And since you rescue abandoned dogs,
you obviously followed proper procedure?

93
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,516
Yes, of course.

94
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,311
What is this procedure like?

95
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,731
Right, this field would be new for you.

96
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,065
When you find an abandoned dog,

97
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,234
according to Article 39
of the Animal Protection Act…

98
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,570
It's written up there.

99
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,863
You can read it as you listen.

100
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,533
When you report to the local government
or an animal protection center,

101
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,618
they issue an announcement
for at least a week.

102
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,122
If the guardian doesn't show up
after ten days, they find a new…

103
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,875
I want to tie those hands down.

104
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,127
Can't she talk without moving her hands?

105
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,129
…to obtain ownership legally.

106
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,470
You're an expert in this field.

107
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,015
They seem to be the new legal guardians.
What's the problem here?

108
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,559
Even if the former guardian
makes a fuss now,

109
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,102
there's no reason to be scared.

110
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,901
That's true.
But they're making quite a big fuss.

111
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,236
What on earth?

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,279
My goodness.

113
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:08,159
I'm sorry! Our Byeol is big in size,

114
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,037
but she scares easily
and never bites people.

115
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,705
Don't be afraid.

116
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,624
She likes you, Mr. Kang.

117
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,835
Dogs recognize good people right away.

118
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,504
Right. Of course.

119
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,797
I'm not much of a dog person--

120
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,881
-Why?
-Oh, my gosh!

121
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,299
-Byeol!
-Byeol!

122
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,052
Look at her chase him
while wagging her tail.

123
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,470
Why does she keep following him?

124
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,222
Byeol!

125
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,598
Look how happy she is.

126
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,565
First, I have to find a weak link

127
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,275
to extract information.

128
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,904
Mushrooms in a law firm?

129
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,826
Is this guy a carpenter?

130
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,579
-Don't let me interrupt.
-Okay.

131
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,005
A lunatic and a film nerd.

132
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,551
How did she even pass the bar?

133
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,640
OVERCOMING DISCRIMINATION
AND STRIVING TOWARDS EQUALITY

134
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,143
PATIENCE

135
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,398
Geez, that stare.

136
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,900
Anger's written all over her face.

137
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,447
YOU CAN DO IT, JUN-U
WHAT? WORK HARDER

138
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,240
HARD WORK WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN

139
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,783
Bingo.

140
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,079
-Let's grab some coffee.
-Sorry?

141
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,789
Coffee.

142
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,707
Sounds good.

143
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,298
You were the youngest
anti-corruption judge?

144
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,216
And with just a high school diploma?

145
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,722
-Sorry.
-Come on. Don't be sorry.

146
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,933
Academic backgrounds
and credentials don't matter.

147
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,518
All that matters is…

148
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,688
your hard work.

149
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,191
Exactly! I knew it.
Hard work never lets you down.

150
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,110
We've just met,
so I don't know if I should say this,

151
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,989
but I can already tell
you won't be satisfied with staying here.

152
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,075
You can see that?

153
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,327
Of course.

154
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,705
Why do you think Dr. Oh
sent me here to be the team leader?

155
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,584
It's to find undiscovered talent.

156
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,295
You're right. Please help me, Mr. Kang.

157
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,756
Instead of being tucked away
in a dark corner,

158
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,800
I want to work in an office like these

159
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,303
that are filled with sunlight
and overlook Seoul.

160
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,306
Yes, I'll look into that.

161
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,143
By the way,
when was Team Pro Bono formed?

162
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,478
This past March.

163
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:44,440
March? That wasn't too long ago.
Where is everyone from?

164
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,068
Nan-hui was a member
of a human rights club

165
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,653
and came after finishing law school.

166
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,029
As for Yeong-sil,

167
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,782
he worked at various public organizations
before coming here.

168
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,283
And I…

169
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,285
You might not know it,

170
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,830
but I worked at a law firm called Daebak.

171
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,374
He's from some lousy firm.

172
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,292
Ms. Park was the only internal applicant.

173
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,254
An internal applicant?
Then, she's from Oh & Partners?

174
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,755
Yes, she was part of the M&A team.

175
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,717
Gosh, that team is
only for the best lawyers.

176
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,345
Gi-ppeum is a pretty big nerd,

177
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,515
so she acts weird sometimes,
but she is very talented.

178
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,017
You'll be working mainly with her.

179
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,269
I see.

180
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,479
You said I'll be working

181
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,982
with Park Gi-ppeum?

182
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,986
Yeong-sil used to work with Ms. Park,
but he's with me and Nan-hui now.

183
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,904
The team was launched this past March.

184
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,407
So it was launched

185
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,367
right after the firm's founder Oh Gyu-jang

186
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,703
appointed Jung-in as CEO

187
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,329
to test his successor.

188
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,001
-What?
-Sorry?

189
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,294
Never mind.

190
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,170
-Thanks for the pants.
-Sure.

191
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,340
Mr. Kang, recently…

192
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,932
Hey.

193
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,476
You still don't know where your office is?

194
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,021
Well, I guess our firm is pretty big.

195
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,900
So this was why you made Team Pro Bono.

196
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,612
You've done your research.

197
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,947
I was amazed, Jung-in.

198
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,991
There actually was a reason why

199
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,119
Korea's top law firm
launched a team that doesn't make money.

200
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,955
"Any attorney-at-law must engage
in public interest activities

201
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,999
for at least a certain number
of hours per year."

202
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,711
And so, what's your point?

203
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,423
You slipped a clause in here that says,

204
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,178
"Hours spent on public interest activities
by pro bono attorneys

205
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,765
will be acknowledged
as hours spent by the entire law firm."

206
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,892
Gosh, this is like

207
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,228
a guy recruiting a team
to do his military reserve duties for him.

208
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,230
Your cynicism hasn't changed either.

209
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,400
Skipping public interest activities
isn't a big deal.

210
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,738
Not if you're the top law firm
and everyone views you with bias.

211
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,490
It's perfect fodder for criticism.

212
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,992
Anyway,

213
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,454
I guess you were nervous about that
and put me in that team.

214
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,123
I mean, Oh & Partners
still has a reputation to uphold.

215
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,459
If Team Pro Bono loses all the time,

216
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,588
the snakes in the grass
who are eyeing your position would strike.

217
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,632
Am I wrong?

218
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,093
So, what's your point?

219
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,011
-I'm busy.
-One year.

220
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,014
One year?

221
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,896
I'll take charge
of those pro bono losers for a year.

222
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,690
Their win rate was only around 20%.

223
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,692
I'll bring it up to 50%.

224
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,696
That's pretty much a miraculous rate
for a pro bono team.

225
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,407
This is so like you.

226
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,577
You want to make a deal?
What do you want in return?

227
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,706
Right. A sunny partner's office
facing southwest

228
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,292
that gets the afternoon sun?

229
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,004
No, it's somewhere a bit far from here.

230
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,882
Where? Seocho-dong?

231
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,884
Back to your old workplace?

232
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,180
No, a bit further away.

233
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:04,932
Don't tell me…

234
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,313
You know another justice position
will open up next year.

235
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,108
Send me there. That's my condition.

236
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,902
-You're crazy.
-With the power Oh & Partners has,

237
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,945
it's doable.

238
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,365
Make me a justice candidate
nominated by the bar association.

239
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,703
That's too much. You said it's a team
that doesn't make money.

240
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,663
No, not money.

241
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,749
But it might get praise.

242
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,087
It's something Oh & Partners
has never received before.

243
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,464
Praise from the people.

244
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,592
Instead of being criticized
for defending only the rich and powerful,

245
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,011
the new Oh & Partners
transforms into a firm

246
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,763
that helps the weak
and is socially responsible.

247
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,476
And the new leader
who spearheads this change

248
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,603
is Oh Jung-in. Isn't that…

249
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,689
the real reason why you made the team?

250
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,192
That's how I see it.

251
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,367
You may leave if you're done.

252
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,794
Seventy.

253
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,926
"Shady"?

254
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,513
Geez. I said 70%.

255
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,309
If the price for a justice position
is only a 50% win rate,

256
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,810
wouldn't that be too cheap?

257
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,063
If you want a deal,

258
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,732
make it like the winning percentage
of an elite sports team.

259
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,422
I heard the plaintiff
will appear in person today.

260
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,552
It seems like she's convinced she'll win.
Will you be okay?

261
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,596
No one knows who'll win in advance.

262
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,598
Still,

263
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,018
we'll just put our hearts into it--

264
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,896
Now that I, Kang Da-wit, am here,

265
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,773
I will not allow

266
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,192
that kind of weak attitude.

267
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,153
What are you doing?

268
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,156
-That's my desk.
-If you can't understand it, memorize it.

269
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,742
We will win no matter what.

270
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,077
I will make it so.

271
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,296
SEOUL BUKBU POLICE STATION

272
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,882
We don't even know why
we were called here.

273
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,509
-Well, they sued…
-Ji So-yeon.

274
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,970
Where are you?

275
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,389
Me?

276
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,809
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing?

277
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,978
-What's wrong with you?
-You damn thief.

278
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,607
How could a beggar like you
go after my precious dog?

279
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,483
Hey!

280
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,444
Do you know how much Chloe is worth?

281
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,571
You little…

282
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,990
Ma'am, please calm down.

283
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,074
Let go.

284
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,537
Isn't your dog cafe just a cover

285
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,998
to steal dogs and make money?

286
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,876
-What?
-You're crossing the line.

287
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,753
Have a seat.

288
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,506
And who are you?

289
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,425
I'm their attorney.

290
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,970
And I could represent them if they sue
for the assault that just happened.

291
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,389
What on earth are you talking about?

292
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,224
Are you threatening me?

293
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,935
Do you know who I am?

294
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,271
You can reflect about your self-identity
all you want at home.

295
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,565
Did you know you can be penalized

296
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,776
for making a false accusation
without evidence?

297
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,361
What?

298
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,864
Are you a judge?
Why are you so arrogant?

299
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,450
You have a keen eye though.

300
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,161
Hold on. Instead of provoking her--

301
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:58,791
My clients adopted a stray dog
that was abandoned without a collar.

302
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,628
If she were that precious,
why appear now after not looking

303
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,213
for a year and a half?

304
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,217
How would you know
if I looked for her or not?

305
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,179
If the real owner appears,
they should hand her over!

306
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,473
-Oh, my goodness.
-In the end,

307
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,266
the prosecution will either drop the case

308
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,560
or tell you to settle
and drop the charges.

309
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,355
Don't get yourself investigated
for a false accusation.

310
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,023
Hello, ma'am.

311
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,694
The prosecution?

312
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,988
I'm glad you mentioned that.

313
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,574
How about you get
a taste of Korean prosecution?

314
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,202
-What?
-It's been a while, Judge Kang.

315
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,582
Woo Myeong-hun?

316
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,169
Sorry. You're no longer a judge, are you?

317
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,423
I heard you're a pro bono attorney now.

318
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,717
Did something happen?

319
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,429
A former Central Investigation
Department prosecutor

320
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,640
from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
on a small case like this?

321
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,726
A small case?

322
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,522
Stealing a dog is like
kidnapping someone's child.

323
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,775
Can't you get with the times?

324
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,527
That's not like you.

325
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,163
Are you okay?

326
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,833
Is there a reason to be not okay?

327
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,046
By the way, is the plaintiff a daughter
of a high-ranking prosecutor?

328
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,716
Yes. She's the daughter of Assemblyman
and former Chief Prosecutor Lee Du-cheol.

329
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,261
No wonder.

330
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,722
That's why Myeong-hun was there.

331
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,723
Do you know him?

332
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,685
We trained at the JRTI together.
But we're not that close.

333
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,148
If Myeong-hun's on the case,
it won't end easily.

334
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,110
What? But they followed
all the proper legal procedures.

335
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,613
Do you know what Myeong-hun's good at?

336
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,530
What?

337
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,075
-Planting evidence.
-What?

338
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,202
Hey!

339
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,498
He paints a picture first

340
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,542
and then comes up
with evidence that matches it.

341
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,170
Thanks to that,
he was on the fast track to success

342
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,839
until he fell off
after I knocked him down a peg.

343
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,882
Wait.

344
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,469
Are you telling me
he even holds a grudge against you?

345
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,889
Are you sure we can win this case?

346
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,892
This is perfect.

347
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,645
What's perfect about this?

348
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,272
For my first case as an attorney,

349
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,191
I thought it was too weak.

350
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,068
You need a former SPO's prosecutor

351
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,403
and the daughter of an assemblyman

352
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,905
to make things look nice.

353
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,866
This is good.

354
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,870
-Excuse me, Mr. Kang.
-What is it?

355
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,706
What looks so nice about this?

356
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,125
Look forward. It's a red light.

357
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,425
SEOUL NORTHERN DISTRICT COURT
CRIMINAL COURT

358
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,760
What?

359
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,099
It's just a small case,
but there are two prosecutors here.

360
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,685
Because it involves the daughter
of a former chief prosecutor

361
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,396
who's a big shot of the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee.

362
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,732
But why is the judge late?
Did something happen?

363
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,068
Judge Oh Jae-seop of Criminal Division 1

364
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,987
is known for always being
five minutes late.

365
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,030
He'll be here in a minute.

366
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,451
Ms. Park.

367
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,036
-Yes?
-Why are you so nervous?

368
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,664
Don't tell me
it's your first time in the court.

369
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,959
It's not my first time,

370
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,378
but I've mainly done
just business consulting,

371
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,047
so this is my second time
in criminal court.

372
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,176
But you've seen many courtroom movies.
You're a film nerd.

373
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,387
Of course! I love Philadelphia.

374
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,973
-A Few Good Men is my all-time favorite.
-Never mind that.

375
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,184
Just do as they do in those films.

376
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,393
Be confident.

377
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,811
Don't be afraid. Be bold.

378
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,441
Okay.

379
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,403
Three, two, one.

380
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,198
All rise.

381
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,872
You may be seated.

382
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,342
Is all this even necessary for this case?

383
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,136
-Attorney Kang.
-Yes?

384
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,347
Let's settle the issue
amicably on both sides.

385
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,598
Give the dog back.

386
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,017
And have the plaintiff drop the charge.

387
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,060
Can't we do that?

388
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,145
Why make such a fuss about--

389
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:31,980
Your Honor!

390
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,611
For a year and a half,

391
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,405
the defendants have already raised
the dog involved in this case,

392
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,615
Byeol, with love--

393
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,699
Chloe!

394
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,953
-What a tacky name!
-Please remain silent!

395
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,332
They've gone through
the proper procedures to adopt the dog.

396
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,877
Simply saying to give Byeol back

397
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,255
shows prejudgment before the trial

398
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,464
-has even begun--
-Counsel.

399
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,968
I think you've seen
too many Hollywood movies.

400
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,804
-Sorry?
-This is Korea.

401
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,098
Please stop walking around.
It's distracting.

402
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,101
Go and speak at your table.
And get straight to the point.

403
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,478
Yes, Your Honor.

404
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,440
My apologies.

405
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,487
I thought it was okay.

406
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,868
Your Honor,

407
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,122
we have recently attained a credible tip.

408
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,416
For its submission,
we request a motion to reschedule--

409
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,584
It happened a year and…

410
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,296
a half ago.

411
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,214
How could they attain a tip just now?

412
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,841
Sit down!

413
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,553
That was good too.

414
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,058
Are you saying the Prosecutors of Korea
are fabricating evidence?

415
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,270
Prosecution, you may proceed with that.

416
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,606
Okay, the next hearing date will be--

417
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,899
Your Honor.

418
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,944
What is it?

419
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,031
I'm sorry,

420
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,867
but we have retained
an additional counsel.

421
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,452
He was late due to traffic.

422
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,329
Could you please allow him to appear?

423
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,834
Do pro bono attorneys nowadays
come late to trials?

424
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,294
My apologies.

425
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,463
-I won't allow it.
-Goodness.

426
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,715
My word.

427
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,513
Goodness.

428
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,390
I'm sorry I'm late.

429
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,728
Your additional counsel was Mr. Park.

430
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,400
What's happening? Who's that old man
and why is the judge intimidated by him?

431
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,652
That's what happened, Your Honor.

432
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,238
Geez, for an abandoned dog case,

433
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,824
first, it was an ex-SPO prosecutor
getting involved,

434
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,534
and now, it's a ex-chief of this court.

435
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,244
Well…

436
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,456
I'm sorry, Your Honor,

437
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,834
but since I was appointed recently…

438
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,086
Of course.

439
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,547
You didn't have the chance
to review the additional documents.

440
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,841
-I'll give you some time.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

441
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,970
Is this what people call
the power of a former judge?

442
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,640
Thank you, Your Honor.

443
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,945
If that's the card they're playing,

444
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,614
let's use an ex-judge as an attorney.

445
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,367
Sir? Isn't that you?

446
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,703
-No?
-I'm from Seoul Central District Court.

447
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,705
There are others more directly related.

448
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,249
Leave it to me.

449
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,168
You're using privileges former judges get
for a pro bono case?

450
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,086
Why not?

451
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,256
It's an institutional corruption
that should be gotten rid of.

452
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,799
You can't use that for pro bono--

453
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,051
Can't common folks
get some benefit from it?

454
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,220
Everyone who's rich
and powerful uses it.

455
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,639
-Still--
-In a public interest case,

456
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,474
defense is provided free of cost.

457
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,435
We can't pay such an attorney
in the first place.

458
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,980
Leave that to me.

459
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,570
Fore!

460
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,613
-Good gracious.
-You really sliced that ball.

461
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,531
Chief!

462
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,117
Goodness, Judge Kang.

463
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,618
What are you doing here?

464
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,622
You wouldn't answer my calls,
so I came all the way here, Chief.

465
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,707
Anyways,

466
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,167
you're still slicing the ball.

467
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,545
Relax your arms during the follow-through.

468
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,965
Why are you doing this to me, Judge Kang?

469
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,843
You don't need a former chief
for measly dog case!

470
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,136
You're right.

471
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,180
We should use such privileges

472
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,850
for cases involving conglomerate CEOs,
like when you did as a judge.

473
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:41,688
That way, the judge and those attorneys
can go play golf together, go to bars,

474
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,607
-and go overseas to play golf again--
-Wait.

475
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,651
What on earth
are you trying to say, Judge Kang?

476
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,737
Don't worry! It's all in the past.

477
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,030
It's all right.

478
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:54,576
I just happen to have an excellent memory

479
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,329
and have heard so many stories.

480
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,414
Geez, you're unbelievable.

481
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,166
Chief.

482
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,378
This is a specially crafted ball
that prevents slices.

483
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,088
-What?
-Try this one out.

484
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,048
Is that so?

485
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,926
Try it.

486
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,431
You're truly amazing, sir!

487
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,434
A former chief judge
joining a pro bono case is unheard of.

488
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,602
And he's doing it for free.

489
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,521
I guess the judge
will be less biased from now on.

490
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,441
No, of his own accord,

491
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,944
he'll recuse himself from the case.

492
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,612
-Sorry?
-Under Article 24

493
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,447
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

494
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,617
I shall recuse myself sua sponte
from this case.

495
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,953
Your Honor.

496
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,997
Your Honor!

497
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,426
Was it just because
they once worked at the same court?

498
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,263
That wouldn't be enough to recuse himself.

499
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,431
That's how Judge Oh is.

500
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,225
A safety-first guy with a faint heart.

501
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,895
-He didn't want to be stuck in the middle.
-What do you mean?

502
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,524
Judge Oh went to the same high school
that Woo Myeong-hun is from.

503
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:12,279
They've been taking baking class together
for two years or something as a hobby.

504
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,738
Isn't that ridiculous?

505
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:20,078
So that's why the judge
was so amicable toward the prosecution.

506
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,456
From the start, using an ex-judge
as an attorney wasn't your goal.

507
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,252
Pretty good, Ms. Park.

508
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,839
Your goal was to change the judge.

509
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,883
But…

510
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,011
Do you know?

511
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,307
Do you know the Criminal Division 2 judge
that the case will be reassigned to?

512
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,059
What? What's the next judge like?

513
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,644
Don't tell me it's the blunt one.

514
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:49,858
For three straight years, he was chosen
by the bar as the unfriendliest judge.

515
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,901
He's famous for his anger issues.

516
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,030
So who is it?
Why am I the only one who doesn't know?

517
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,531
Geez.

518
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,907
Hey, you little…

519
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,242
You punk!

520
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,328
They should take your limbs and tear…

521
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,704
Get lost!

522
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,206
Goodness. Yes, I know.

523
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,586
He wasn't promoted due to his temper
and works with those ten years his junior.

524
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,255
It's Chief Judge Choi Ho-jip.

525
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,966
Goodness. What do we do?
It's the blunt judge.

526
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,217
Are you close with him?

527
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,346
No way. I'm the type of judge

528
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,764
he hates the most.

529
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:25,143
A judge who's socially adept
and successful.

530
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,733
I was out of strength at the end.

531
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,692
And here's some food.

532
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,445
-No, I want the mung bean pancakes.
-Right, the pancakes.

533
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,864
You're too old to be picky with food!

534
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,200
Just eat what they give you, you fool!

535
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,242
What?

536
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,452
Act your age.

537
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:46,623
Then why did you have
the trial assigned to such a person?

538
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,335
Rather than a judge who's outwardly nice
but biased on the inside,

539
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,421
wouldn't a judge
who's equally blunt to everyone

540
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,049
be more favorable for us?

541
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,430
By the way, did the prosecution
submit the additional evidence?

542
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,515
Just a moment, sir.

543
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,475
Another moment?

544
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,311
They did submit it.

545
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,604
What is it?

546
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,855
WITNESS STATEMENT

547
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,357
It's a witness statement.

548
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,776
A witness?

549
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,820
CAFE PAWS & FLUFFS

550
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,363
Hello, So-yeon.

551
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,824
-Hello.
-Hello.

552
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,033
Hello.

553
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,576
Hey, stay away.

554
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,245
Stay away! You've met me!

555
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,664
-You've already met me!
-Byeol, over here.

556
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,750
Good. Sit.

557
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,294
-Why isn't it on a leash?
-Hello.

558
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,546
Hello, sir.

559
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,880
Hello.

560
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,341
I'll prepare something to drink.

561
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,927
It's okay, sir.

562
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,140
You were a bit surprised, weren't you?

563
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,599
I'll go wash my hands quickly.

564
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,101
-So-yeon.
-Yes?

565
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,186
Today is the day, isn't it?

566
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,066
-Yes.
-What's today?

567
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,945
-Well…
-So-yeon.

568
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,530
Could you take a seat for a bit?

569
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,448
Just me?

570
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,705
The prosecution

571
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,250
suddenly submitted
some additional evidence.

572
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,252
Okay. What is it?

573
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,757
You were clear that Byeol didn't have
a collar when you found her, right?

574
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,009
Yes.

575
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,636
But a witness has suddenly appeared.

576
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,016
They said they saw you
secretly throw away Byeol's collar.

577
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,768
What?

578
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,730
That's nonsense.

579
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,482
Where would I even throw it away?

580
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,360
They saw you throw it away
in the Hangang River.

581
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,156
Seriously.

582
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,367
That's nonsense. It's a total lie.
Who said that?

583
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,287
Exactly. When the plaintiff's attorney
used to be a prosecutor,

584
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,289
he was good at manipulating evidence.

585
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,458
I doubted it, but it was true.

586
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,001
Is there something going on?

587
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,837
No, ma'am.

588
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,923
-It's nothing to worry about.
-That's not true.

589
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,718
It is something to worry about.

590
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,386
What are you talking about?

591
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,432
It wasn't the Hangang River.
Where did you throw it away?

592
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:13,937
Come on.

593
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,773
What are you talking about?

594
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,818
If it wasn't the Hangang River,
where did you throw away the collar?

595
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,821
What kind of person do you think I am?

596
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,322
I'm not a bad person.

597
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,699
Whether you're a good person or not

598
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,159
is not what I'm interested in.

599
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,786
Just answer my question.

600
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,412
Where did you throw it away?

601
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,958
Where did she find the dog? Seongbukcheon?

602
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,630
I'm right. It's Seongbukcheon Stream.

603
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,259
-You threw it away in there?
-Mr. Kang.

604
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,427
On what grounds
are you speaking so conclusively?

605
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,638
You didn't do that. Right, So-yeon?

606
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,390
You wouldn't have done that.

607
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,016
You didn't, right?

608
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:58,982
Seriously.

609
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,984
Ma'am.

610
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,945
-It's not that…
-Perjury or a false statement

611
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,488
will only make it bad for her.

612
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:08,992
Oh, no.

613
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,870
Oh, my gosh.

614
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,622
Oh, no. I'm sorry!

615
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,791
I'm sorry.

616
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,091
Did you really throw it away?

617
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,977
Then, the witness statement wasn't forged.

618
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,022
No, it was forged.

619
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,691
Myeong-hun must have contacted
a lowly ex-convict

620
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,444
that he retained
from his years as a prosecutor

621
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,654
to make a statement.

622
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,656
Just do it one more time.

623
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,033
Sir.

624
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,785
Please let me go now.

625
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,250
Memorize the statement
you'll tell the prosecutor.

626
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,586
Don't get the date wrong
like last time.

627
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,547
Look at the photo of the dog closely too.

628
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,841
Then, there was no witness,

629
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,887
but So-yeon did throw the collar away.

630
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,430
This makes me so sad.

631
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,265
How did you find this out?

632
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,017
The first reaction.

633
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,936
The first reaction?

634
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,564
When one is suddenly asked
about the thing they want to hide,

635
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,360
they react defensively first
like a conditioned response.

636
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,070
"Where?"

637
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,781
That's nonsense.
Where would I even throw it away?

638
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,616
If it never happened,

639
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,160
she would've denied it
without any unnecessary comments.

640
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,580
"I'm not a bad person."
"Who do you think I am?" Blah, blah.

641
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,167
Making such unnecessary comments

642
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,172
is derived from the instinctive
defensive mechanism of humans.

643
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,050
Yes, you're right.

644
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,761
When she asked
about where it was thrown away

645
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,514
and heard it was the Hangang River,

646
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,560
her face lit up momentarily.

647
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,604
They saw you throw it away
in the Hangang River.

648
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,774
Seriously.

649
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,527
That's nonsense. It's a total lie.
Who said that?

650
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,112
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

651
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,530
You truly are amazing.

652
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,323
Seriously.

653
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,411
When you wear the gown
and sit at the bench long enough,

654
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,079
you come to see everything.

655
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,505
Now, please tell us.

656
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,298
Why did you lie?

657
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,386
That collar.

658
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,142
It was because of that collar.

659
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,186
What? The collar?

660
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,319
Hi.

661
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,579
Hi.

662
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,582
Hey.

663
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,461
Hi. Hi there.

664
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,130
What are you doing here all by yourself?

665
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,634
You must've been scared,
but you didn't even bark.

666
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,719
Right?

667
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,014
Don't worry.

668
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,433
I'll find your home.

669
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,686
What's this?

670
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,647
What's this here?

671
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,025
CHLOE

672
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,695
An anti-bark collar?

673
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,281
Yes. Whenever a dog barks,

674
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,700
it gives an electric shock.

675
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,872
Unbelievable.
How can you use that on your pet dog?

676
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,125
It's not illegal in Korea.

677
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,295
Still, you can't take
someone else's dog like that.

678
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,048
Voltage for a pet item
wouldn't be that high.

679
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,596
What?

680
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,766
Do you want to try it yourself?

681
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,227
Try what?

682
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,647
There's a sample our group bought.

683
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,065
Wait just a moment.

684
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,861
Well, she didn't have to…

685
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,988
Come on.

686
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,783
It looks like a children's toy.

687
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,743
So you want me to try this on?

688
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,828
Yes.

689
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,247
See for yourself.

690
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,170
Well, why not?

691
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,381
Do I wear it like this?

692
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,260
It is a bit uncomfortable.

693
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,178
Now what?

694
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,097
Do I need to bark?

695
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,232
Hold on, sir!

696
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,443
Here.

697
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:59,657
They put things like that
around dogs' necks?

698
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,616
So,

699
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,245
is that why you didn't bark?

700
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,122
Poor Byeol.

701
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,207
Honey.

702
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,336
The one Byeol was wearing
had a higher voltage,

703
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,838
so it's banned from being imported.

704
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,506
And top of that,

705
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,468
they deliberately unlocked
the limit on the highest voltage level.

706
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,432
Those horrible people!

707
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,351
You found evidence of abuse.

708
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,813
Why didn't you report it right away?

709
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,939
Report?

710
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,485
What's the point?

711
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,945
What do you mean?

712
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,573
You have to report it
so it's investigated as animal abuse.

713
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,285
I understand why you didn't report it.

714
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,956
Even if you report it,
you'd have to send her back to the abuser.

715
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,919
According to the law,
a dog is still the owner's property.

716
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,046
Was that the reason?

717
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,048
Yes.

718
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:03,930
I really didn't want
to send Byeol back to such people.

719
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,806
That's why I threw…

720
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,856
I'm sorry, ma'am.

721
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,442
You were having such a hard time then

722
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,654
and I asked you to adopt her.

723
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,448
It's all my fault.

724
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,075
Of course, it's your fault.

725
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,495
No matter how much you explain,
they're just motives for the crime.

726
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,457
You took her when you clearly knew
she had a guardian.

727
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,168
That's a crime.

728
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,464
I see. So that's what happened.

729
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,894
Would you like to stick around today?

730
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,854
Today is

731
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,649
the day I feed Byeol a nice, big meal.

732
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,443
Let's feed Byeol

733
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,613
and share the food together.

734
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,698
What…

735
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,993
What food are we sharing?

736
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,914
Okay, let's sit.

737
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,645
My Han-byeol.

738
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,065
Happy birthday.

739
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,822
I said no!

740
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,783
Seriously, it'll be fine.

741
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,077
I'm going with my friends.

742
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,871
Don't worry about it.

743
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,205
No!

744
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,124
There will be so many people.

745
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,793
What if you get hurt by any chance?

746
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,213
Grandma!

747
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,341
Will you talk to him, please?

748
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,011
I really want to go
to the street festival.

749
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,139
I'm sure things will be fine.

750
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,641
She's going with a bunch of her friends.

751
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,934
Aren't you worried at all?

752
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,811
Don't you remember her parents?

753
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,440
Why would you bring that up now?

754
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,483
Grandma.

755
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,651
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,111
They left Han-byeol here

757
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,114
and just had go on a trip
during that crowded vacation season.

758
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,283
They had the accident
while driving in the rain.

759
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,619
You call me foolish, but I can't help it.

760
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,747
Grandpa, I'll be really careful.

761
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,207
Okay? I promise.

762
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,250
Honey, come on!

763
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,420
What could possibly go wrong?

764
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,506
I'd like to go there too.

765
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,508
Should I put on a uniform and join you?

766
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,636
That'll be awesome! I'll lend you mine.

767
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,764
Gosh, our beautiful Byeol.

768
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,518
You look so pretty today.
Should we take a photo?

769
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,852
Okay.

770
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,940
One, two, three.

771
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,694
Han-byeol.

772
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,244
My beautiful child.

773
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,209
Byeol.

774
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,794
BAEK HAN-BYEOL

775
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,338
A STAR IN THE SKY
OCTOBER 29, 2022

776
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,721
Ma'am, please.

777
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,684
If I don't find a new guardian in a week,

778
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,645
they'll put her to sleep.

779
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,898
But my place doesn't allow pets.

780
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,192
So isn't there any way?

781
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,821
I don't want to form

782
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,241
any kind of relationship again.

783
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,620
I'm going to close this cafe soon too.

784
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,999
Honestly, I don't have
the will to live anymore.

785
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,168
So,

786
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,380
-just take her back.
-Ma'am, just one night!

787
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,508
Can't you let her stay here

788
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,886
just for tonight?

789
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,345
I have the night shift.

790
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,515
I'll make sure
to pick her up tomorrow. Okay?

791
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,082
Grandma.

792
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,126
Grandma.

793
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,092
Grandma.

794
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,538
Han-byeol.

795
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,209
Han-byeol, my beautiful child.

796
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,752
My little puppy.

797
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,300
Stop crying, Grandma.

798
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,428
I'm in a really good place now,

799
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,013
living happily every day.

800
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,642
So stop crying, Grandma.

801
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,269
Okay?

802
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,770
Don't you ever

803
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,231
think of those terrible thoughts.

804
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,485
You have to live a long life
before you come to me. Okay?

805
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,200
Han-byeol.

806
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,541
I pray out of gratitude every day.

807
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,087
I'm so glad
you didn't come with me that day.

808
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,924
That was a close one.

809
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,260
What a relief, right?

810
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,806
Byeol.

811
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,437
Byeol.

812
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,233
Byeol.

813
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,750
Byeol.

814
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,842
Isn't there any way?

815
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,845
They'll be punished,

816
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,765
and Byeol will have to
go back to those abusers.

817
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,060
How can the law be like this?

818
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,521
The provisions of the law
are always beautiful,

819
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,191
but the reality is the gutter.

820
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,028
You all know that very well.

821
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:18,947
Let's go.

822
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,618
I don't know.

823
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,918
In this gutter-like reality,
I still don't know

824
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,753
how to win.

825
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,340
You could teach me since I don't know.

826
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,717
You could give me a chance.

827
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,427
Wait.

828
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,638
I'll do anything too.

829
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,849
I'm not as talented
as Gi-ppeum in legal matters

830
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,643
or multi-talented like Yeong-sil,

831
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,396
but I'm really good at doing legwork.

832
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,441
What's with those faces?

833
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,737
Did you think I, Kang Da-wit,
was going to lose

834
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,447
his first case as an attorney?

835
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,118
Right?
You must have a way to win, don't you?

836
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,077
Mr. Kang!

837
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,996
Since we're here at Seongbukcheon,

838
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,291
let's eat outside. It's on me.

839
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,252
Okay. Sure!

840
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,838
By the way, Ms. Park.

841
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,466
I think I've heard that line
in a drama before.

842
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,135
-What line?
-"You could teach me

843
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,803
since I don't know."

844
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,140
"You could give me a chance."
I think I've heard this before.

845
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,059
You must be imagining things.

846
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,145
Let's hurry.

847
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,938
-What am I imagining?
-Let's go.

848
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,357
-Hurry.
-Have you heard it before too, Mr. Hwang?

849
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,567
What do you mean?

850
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,696
Counsel.

851
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,490
-Yes, Your Honor?
-You submitted the document?

852
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,869
You admit to throwing the collar away,

853
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,287
so you're pleading guilty?

854
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,789
No, Your Honor.

855
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:54,418
Then, what is it? What do you want to do?

856
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,711
Is there something else to do?

857
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:56,670
Your Honor,

858
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,756
please end this trial early--

859
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,843
We request a jury trial.

860
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,516
What?

861
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,560
We plead not guilty

862
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,730
and hope for a jury trial
so our defendants

863
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,065
may receive a fair trial.

864
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,194
"A fair trial"?

865
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:25,782
Are you saying that you don't trust
a trial I preside over will be fair?

866
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,994
Your Honor, asking for a jury trial
for a case like this

867
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,746
is a typical trick to delay a trial.

868
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,039
Don't fall for this--

869
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,081
Be quiet!

870
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,626
-Sorry?
-I'm the one who decides

871
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,127
how the trial will proceed.

872
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,795
Don't tell me what to do.

873
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,506
But Your Honor,

874
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,674
we have the right to state our view--

875
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,676
You be a judge, then!

876
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,179
Be a judge.

877
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,892
Okay, all right.

878
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,435
Let's do that.

879
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,063
If you want that so badly…

880
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,982
All right. A jury trial?

881
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,026
Yeah? And a fair trial?

882
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,111
Sure. Let's do that.

883
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,863
Let's take this as far as we can.

884
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,117
Thank you, Your Honor.

885
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,874
What trick is he pulling now?

886
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,921
Okay! Let's prepare
our weapon for battle now.

887
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,090
Ms. Park will prepare the legal argument.

888
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,258
-Okay.
-Mr. Jang.

889
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,135
Continue what you're doing.

890
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,346
-Mr. Hwang.
-I'll do anything, sir.

891
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,847
Should I search for precedents?

892
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,392
You said you're good
with legwork, right? Here.

893
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,561
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

894
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,729
Though it's not your case,
you said you'd help?

895
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,939
I did.

896
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,900
Don't you often hear
that you look young or like a baby?

897
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:42,985
Hold on.

898
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,988
Commenting on your colleague's looks
can be sexual harassment--

899
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,657
-Are you up for an undercover job?
-Undercover?

900
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,785
Not you, film nerd.
I was talking to this one with IED.

901
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,870
IED? Intermittent explosive disorder?

902
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,124
That term fosters prejudice
against disabilities…

903
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,711
Hello, ma'am.

904
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,628
Hi.

905
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,297
-Are you So-mi?
-Yes.

906
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,631
Come on in.

907
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:10,012
I heard you were really good
at teaching the recorder.

908
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,140
A-reum's test is in a week,
so I'm worried.

909
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,309
You must have faith in me, ma'am.

910
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,227
Playing the recorder
is all about breathing.

911
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,855
I'll start with teaching her
a new way to breathe.

912
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,278
Okay. I'll put my faith in you.

913
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,990
But are you really a high school student?

914
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,660
Why?

915
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,038
Do I not look like one?

916
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:39,082
I'm so sad. Crying face.

917
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,836
All right. But something about you
seems older…

918
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,463
I have an old face.

919
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,506
I see.

920
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,429
What am I doing right now?

921
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,890
-Where is it?
-Mom.

922
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,184
What is that man doing?

923
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,146
Let's not look.
And don't make eye contact.

924
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,273
My back!

925
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,109
Still,

926
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,570
isn't this too much legwork?

927
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,286
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

928
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,290
The Pomeranian abuse case
at Pyeongtaek Station 15 years ago…

929
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,458
Do you have the precedent?

930
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,170
-I printed it out.
-Thank you.

931
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,972
OH & PARTNERS
ATTORNEY YOO NAN-HUI

932
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,059
LEE DU-CHEOL

933
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,740
Got you!

934
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,867
Ma'am!

935
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,578
-Do you know how much that cost?
-Got you!

936
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,580
It's expensive!
How are you going to pay for it?

937
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,583
There's a snake there!

938
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,587
This is a toy snake!

939
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,299
I see.

940
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,552
I'm sorry, ma'am.

941
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,762
This isn't even the first time.

942
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,639
Ma'am,

943
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,016
don't bother coming next week.

944
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,518
Sorry? But ma'am.

945
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:25,188
I'll deduct the price of the bowl
from your salary. Got it?

946
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,733
Are you okay, A-reum?

947
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,734
Wait, ma'am.

948
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,236
You can't kick me out like this.

949
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,904
Ma'am!

950
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,742
Should we wrap up today's meeting now?

951
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,748
Actually, I was at the Ministry of Justice
for a meeting,

952
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:43,832
and everyone was talking.

953
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,668
"What's going on at Oh & Partners?"

954
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,213
"Why are you handling
a stray dog case?"

955
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,008
Do you think it'll help our firm's revenue

956
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,801
if we become enemies with the prosecution?

957
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,053
Tell them to drop the case now.

958
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,222
I almost forgot.

959
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,641
Now that you mention revenue…

960
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,107
Here's the revenue you brought in
during the past six months.

961
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,819
Time can be brutal.

962
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,820
Don't you think?

963
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:18,200
In the past, you two used to earn
the most revenue for our firm.

964
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,914
If you look at the bottom,
there's a list detailing

965
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,459
the salaries of your secretaries
and drivers and your company card usage.

966
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,710
Please take note of this.

967
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:31,713
Ms. Oh.

968
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,714
Yes, Mr. Cha?

969
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,969
If you have nothing to say,
I'll get going.

970
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,312
-How did it go?
-What?

971
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,272
They want to stop
the abandoned dog case.

972
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:53,527
Korea's top law firm can't pull out
after making a scene. It's embarrassing.

973
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:58,406
-Isn't that what you wanted?
-I'm just doing my best.

974
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,867
I don't need your best. I need results.

975
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,704
She can't lose her granddaughter twice.

976
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,166
Jung-in.

977
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,921
I was also there at that street festival

978
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:14,965
on that day.

979
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,761
You have to win the case.

980
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,523
He comes in.

981
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,444
Your Honor,

982
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,655
and ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

983
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,784
we will make an argument
based on the testimony you just heard.

984
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,912
It was a right of necessity,

985
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,790
also known as a justified act…

986
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,083
Ladies and gentlemen,

987
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,169
what would you do if it were you?

988
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,630
ATTORNEY, YOO NAN-HUI

989
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,925
Ma'am, you would help save a life.

990
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,719
I wouldn't make a difference.

991
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,179
I've never been to such a place.
I'm too scared of them.

992
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,650
Counsel.

993
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,568
JURY TRIAL

994
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,570
-You may examine the witness.
-Yes, Your Honor.

995
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,363
Ma'am,

996
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,324
you've been working as a maid

997
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,743
at the plaintiff's house
for three years now. Correct?

998
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,660
Yes.

999
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,954
And you know
the abandoned dog in this case?

1000
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,122
Yes.

1001
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:32,292
Their daughter made a fuss
because she wanted a big dog,

1002
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,960
so Ms. Lee bought one.

1003
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,630
But since the child
changes her mind often,

1004
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,340
she soon got sick of it.

1005
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,467
I see.

1006
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,511
I assume the way the dog was treated
changed after that.

1007
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:47,682
Of course.
It was thought of as a nuisance.

1008
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,560
"Dog food costs too much.
Just give it half the amount."

1009
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,187
"Its barking annoys me."

1010
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,229
Ma'am!

1011
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,690
And then,

1012
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,984
they bought some kind of collar
from somewhere.

1013
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,237
After that, the dog wouldn't bark at all.

1014
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,990
Did the collar
look like this by any chance?

1015
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,117
Yes, I'm wearing it now.

1016
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,412
I'll make some noise now.

1017
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,833
It doesn't give you a shock right away.

1018
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,044
Instead, a warning alarm goes off.

1019
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,546
I'll try it again.

1020
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:26,346
Your Honor,
this question is irrelevant to the case.

1021
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,139
It is relevant! Do you know how much it…

1022
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,766
That's abuse.

1023
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,146
The question is a premise
to our argument, Your Honor.

1024
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:36,898
Okay.

1025
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:38,984
You may continue.

1026
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:44,239
Ms. Kim, was the collar
similar to the one we just saw?

1027
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,573
Yes, it was.

1028
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,742
Whenever she barked, she'd choke.

1029
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,411
And she was so much in pain.

1030
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,581
It's only an animal, but I felt so bad.

1031
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,209
You can't wear sunglasses in court.

1032
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,169
I'm on an undercover mission.

1033
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:02,632
But why would they suddenly look
for the dog after a year and a half?

1034
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,176
It's because of the fickle child.

1035
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,555
She went to a dog cafe
with her friends and saw the dog.

1036
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,433
"Why is my dog at someone else's house?"

1037
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,809
"Bring her back now!"

1038
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,437
-She cried and made such a fuss.
-Objection!

1039
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,357
What happened after the theft
is irrelevant to the case.

1040
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,567
-Sustained--
-Yes, sustained.

1041
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,693
I'll withdraw my question.

1042
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,194
Just disregard that question

1043
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,238
-and answer you just heard.
-Counsel!

1044
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,322
Yes, Your Honor?

1045
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,782
What you just said…

1046
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,827
I decide and say that myself
as a judge. Understood?

1047
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,414
It's a habit ingrained in me
from my former job, so…

1048
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,832
Okay. Go back.

1049
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,751
I'll be careful, Your Honor.

1050
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,221
Your Honor.

1051
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,475
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

1052
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:56,478
As you just saw,
the abandoned dog in this case

1053
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,189
suffered from electric shocks all day

1054
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:02,567
and was in a state of serious starvation.

1055
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:07,030
The defendant Ji So-yeon thought
if she sent the dog back to the abuser,

1056
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:10,283
something worse would happen.

1057
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:14,162
So, she cut the collar off
and found a new caregiver.

1058
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:20,418
It was a right of necessity,
also known as a justified act,

1059
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,420
so she's not guilty.

1060
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,047
That's a ridiculous argument.

1061
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,802
A right of necessity is established
only when a person faces an urgent crisis.

1062
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,388
A right of necessity for a dog,
which is the owner's property?

1063
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,016
It's an argument without any knowledge
of a basic criminal law.

1064
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:35,934
Yes, that's right.

1065
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,854
Under the law,
animals are thought of as merely property.

1066
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,023
Although I don't know anything
about criminal law,

1067
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,192
let me ask you something then.

1068
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:47,028
If animals are only property,

1069
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,656
then why do we punish people

1070
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,408
for animal abuse
when they abuse their own property?

1071
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,327
-That's--
-Let me ask another question.

1072
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,830
Your colleagues and predecessors

1073
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,916
worked hard at the Ministry of Justice
to research and create

1074
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:04,254
Article 98-2, Paragraph 1
of the Civil Code Amendment.

1075
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,631
Do you know what it is?

1076
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:12,095
"Animals are not objects."

1077
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,890
They are living things,
not objects, Prosecutor.

1078
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,603
The defendant only wanted
to protect a life.

1079
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,525
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're all sensible citizens of Korea.

1080
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,820
What would you do if it were you?

1081
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,867
You have no choice but to send the dog
back to a habitually abusive owner.

1082
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,077
If you can't find a new guardian in time,

1083
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,329
she has to be euthanized.

1084
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,623
Do you truly believe

1085
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,919
what the defendant did was a crime?

1086
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,883
-Nothing further, Your Honor.
-Okay, thank you.

1087
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,678
That was pretty good.

1088
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,723
It sounded a bit like The Attorney,
but it might have worked.

1089
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,974
Your Honor.

1090
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:02,479
If only that prick wasn't here.

1091
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,691
As counsel for the plaintiff,
I'd like to say something.

1092
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,901
Okay, then…

1093
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:12,071
-Come on out, so everyone can hear you.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

1094
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:18,536
The defense is following
a well-prepared script

1095
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,498
to maliciously frame the plaintiff.

1096
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,293
May I request
to ask the witness just one thing?

1097
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,337
Go ahead.

1098
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:33,760
Please ask the witness
if she has ever stolen

1099
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,470
-the plaintiff's necklace.
-Objection.

1100
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:39,390
-This question is irrelevant to the case.
-No, it is relevant.

1101
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:43,937
It's a question that concerns
the credibility of the defense's witness.

1102
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,857
Ms. Kim, did you hear the question?

1103
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,817
-Please answer.
-Sorry?

1104
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,987
No.

1105
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,240
I'm not that kind of a person.

1106
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:58,117
Why would I lay hands
on someone else's stuff?

1107
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,370
The plaintiff always keeps
a camera installed

1108
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,164
in the room
where she stores her valuables.

1109
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,876
I hereby submit a video recording
of the crime scene as evidence.

1110
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,837
Wait…

1111
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,298
I…

1112
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,467
No, it's not that.

1113
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,556
My unpaid salary
due to all sorts of excuses

1114
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,266
exceeded ten million won.

1115
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:24,227
But she fired me all of a sudden.

1116
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:29,399
I just thought I should get
what I should have been paid.

1117
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,692
So that's why?

1118
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:35,321
What you've heard so far
was a testimony from a thief

1119
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,699
who stole from her boss out of spite.

1120
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,785
Abuse against her dog?
That's a ridiculous false accusation.

1121
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,371
After having her dog,
who she adored like her own child,

1122
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,415
stolen by shameless people,

1123
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,793
the plaintiff has been suffering
immense mental anguish.

1124
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,879
Objection, Your Honor.
Do not insult the defendants.

1125
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:55,466
Also, the defense hasn't been able
to provide any concrete evidence

1126
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:59,137
other than the false testimony
they have prepared.

1127
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,722
A electric shock collar?

1128
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:03,891
If there is such a thing,
submit it as evidence.

1129
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,476
Wouldn't that be the case, Counsel?

1130
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,522
Also, Ms. Park.

1131
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,858
I enjoyed that touching speech of yours.

1132
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,945
But about that amendment
saying "animals are not objects."

1133
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,698
It was passed
by the National Assembly, right?

1134
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,453
Not yet.

1135
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,288
Not yet?

1136
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:31,294
I thought it'd already been passed
since you sounded so confident.

1137
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,588
The members of the jury
aren't experts on this,

1138
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,632
so they would've been mistaken too.

1139
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:39,844
If that was your intention,
I'm even more impressed.

1140
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,930
She's a very promising attorney.

1141
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,642
I was only trying to show
how the social norms are changing--

1142
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,644
That is all, Your Honor.

1143
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,312
Thank you.

1144
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,480
Please return to your seat.

1145
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:57,070
If there are no further questions,
we will conclude the witness examination.

1146
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,823
We'll take a short recess
before the closing arguments.

1147
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,036
I'm sorry.

1148
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,331
I should have looked more deeply into it.

1149
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,874
No. It's all right, Nan-hui.

1150
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:13,211
How could you have seen that coming?

1151
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,132
But what do we do now?

1152
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,970
We need that collar to prove the abuse.

1153
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:24,972
He should be here by now.

1154
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:26,432
Sorry?

1155
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,142
-Mr. Kang!
-There he is.

1156
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:29,811
Jun-u?

1157
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,066
Where is it?

1158
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,943
I'm sorry. I thought I'd finally found it.

1159
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,199
But it wasn't it.

1160
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,368
It was just junk brought in
by heavy rain last time.

1161
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,873
Was it too impossible to try?

1162
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,125
I'm sorry.

1163
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,585
What now, Mr. Kang?

1164
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,087
Are we at a dead end?

1165
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,048
Let me use the restroom.

1166
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,802
Staying clean is his concern
at a time like this?

1167
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,431
JURY BOX

1168
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,348
What's with him?

1169
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:08,891
Counsel?

1170
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,518
Counsel!

1171
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,146
Yes, an animal is an object.

1172
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,734
The prosecution's arguments
are all valid from a legal standpoint.

1173
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:23,114
Under the current law,
pets are their owners' property.

1174
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:26,200
The right of necessity
or the justifiable act to save an object.

1175
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,286
The court won't accept it.

1176
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:29,954
I know that very well.

1177
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,498
How could a society
that can't take care of humans

1178
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,083
take care of the lives of animals?

1179
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,961
You're asking for too much.

1180
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,755
Are you crazy, Mr. Kang?

1181
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,548
Your Honor, I'd like to check

1182
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,051
just one thing with the plaintiff.

1183
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,264
I request permission
to examine the plaintiff as a witness.

1184
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,518
Then, Counsel,

1185
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,480
be short and quick.

1186
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:56,981
Yes, Your Honor.

1187
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,024
The plaintiff!

1188
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,651
Please come to the witness stand.

1189
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:01,903
What?

1190
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:02,987
Come on out!

1191
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:04,989
Yes, Your Honor.

1192
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,120
Your Honor.

1193
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,498
I have an object to show the plaintiff.

1194
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:18,044
I request permission
for Exhibit 12 to enter the courtroom.

1195
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,964
Counsel, Exhibit 12 is…

1196
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,550
-Come on. That's…
-Yes.

1197
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,344
It's evidence, after all.

1198
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:29,764
It's an object, so I can submit it
to the court, can't I?

1199
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:30,973
What should we do?

1200
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,725
Do we allow it or not?

1201
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,520
My goodness.

1202
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,440
Sure. Okay.

1203
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,650
Thank you, Your Honor.

1204
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,611
Sir?

1205
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,199
Oh, my gosh!

1206
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,337
Byeol!

1207
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,886
Byeol!

1208
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:13,266
Byeol.

1209
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,869
That's what pets do.

1210
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,621
Even if the owner hated hearing her bark

1211
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,291
and put an electric shock collar on
that burned her throat…

1212
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,629
Even if the owner tried starving her
because abandoning her was a hassle…

1213
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,465
she saw the owner
for the first time in a while

1214
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,136
and couldn't help but lick
the back of their owner's hand.

1215
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:56,267
They exist solely to love humans.

1216
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,394
That's what a pet is.

1217
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,065
We got it.
Look at the faces of the jury.

1218
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,109
We have circumstantial
but no physical evidence.

1219
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,569
How do we prove the abuse?

1220
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:08,529
Who made them this way?

1221
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,448
It was us humans.

1222
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:14,285
We captured wild animals as we pleased,
and tamed and bred them

1223
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:17,204
to make them love humans instinctively.

1224
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,791
Yes. Since we made them
out of our necessity,

1225
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,294
we can just toss them out
if we don't need them anymore.

1226
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:28,257
Our claim of right of necessity
and a justifiable act for such objects.

1227
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,720
We'll withdraw it. Your Honor.

1228
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,514
But just for the last time,

1229
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:39,644
I want to reconfirm one basic fact

1230
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,145
before closing my argument.

1231
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,563
Sure.

1232
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,398
Ms. Lee.

1233
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:47,318
Take a good look at the dog.

1234
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,291
Look closely.

1235
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:03,960
Stay.

1236
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,007
Did you really think
she threw the collar away?

1237
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,432
You just need to answer
one simple question.

1238
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:20,643
This dog right here…

1239
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,396
Is this…

1240
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,356
your dog?

1241
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:30,945
-What?
-What?

1242
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,739
What is he doing?

1243
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,158
Why on earth are you asking that now?

1244
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,160
In a criminal trial,

1245
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,831
we should leave no room
for any reasonable doubt.

1246
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:45,543
Even if there's a 1% chance of error,

1247
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,336
until the very end

1248
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,504
of the trial…

1249
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:51,382
we have to keep questioning it.

1250
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,634
When you think about it,

1251
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,679
there are many dogs
of the same breed and size.

1252
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,056
Ms. Lee.

1253
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,519
Take a good look.

1254
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,522
Is she really

1255
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,525
the dog that you lost?

1256
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,284
You seem flustered.

1257
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,829
Take a sip of water.

1258
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,298
What's with her?

1259
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,682
Excuse me.

1260
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,850
Your Honor!

1261
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:44,268
Yes, go ahead.

1262
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,980
I'm not feeling well right now.

1263
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,815
Can we take…

1264
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:52,735
a five-minute break?

1265
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,821
Well, in that case,

1266
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,741
we'll take a ten-minute recess.

1267
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:04,747
What are you doing, Mr. Kang?

1268
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:06,665
What?

1269
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,752
The dog belonged to plaintiff. It's Byeol.

1270
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:16,926
Are you all right?

1271
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,095
Yes, I am.

1272
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,431
It's hard to think straight
with Kang Da-wit making a fuss, isn't it?

1273
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,642
Don't let him get to you.

1274
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,310
Let's end this quickly.

1275
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,354
Right.

1276
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,943
Ten minutes are long.

1277
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,237
So,

1278
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,323
do you feel better, Ms. Lee?

1279
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:40,241
Yes.

1280
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:42,910
That's good.

1281
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:45,913
I'm just checking
since I just can't understand.

1282
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,456
Right?

1283
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,251
You're the daughter
of a former chief prosecutor

1284
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:53,337
and assemblyman
who's been elected three times.

1285
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:59,343
You're a sophisticated person raised
by a family that upholds law and order.

1286
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:02,012
Would such a person
put an illegal electric shock collar

1287
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,013
on their dog?

1288
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,893
Or starve and neglect her
so she would die?

1289
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,480
Would such a person
do such horrible things?

1290
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,275
But if that's the case by any chance,

1291
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,194
if any concrete evidence shows up…

1292
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,320
My goodness!

1293
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,614
This would make headlines!

1294
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,242
It'd be on the news,
in newspapers, and on social media.

1295
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,994
Come on. There's no way.

1296
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:28,122
Your Honor, Counsel keeps making arguments

1297
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:30,499
-without any proof--
-Excuse me. Sit down.

1298
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,253
-Ms. Lee.
-What's going on?

1299
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,839
This is your last chance.

1300
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,390
Look at her again

1301
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,977
very closely.

1302
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,063
This poor abandoned dog

1303
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:55,691
was brutally abused and thrown out.

1304
01:09:56,525 --> 01:10:00,279
Is she really the dog you lost?

1305
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:04,909
I see.

1306
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,369
Since we can't prove the abuse,

1307
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:11,457
we have to make the plaintiff
change her words and say it's not her dog.

1308
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,836
But is that possible
when there is no evidence?

1309
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:27,806
No.

1310
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,434
Sorry, what did you say?

1311
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,811
It's hard to hear,
so could you say it louder, please?

1312
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,146
No!

1313
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,731
No, it's not mine.

1314
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:38,984
That dog does look a lot like our Chloe,

1315
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,861
but after seeing her up close,
it's not her.

1316
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,906
My Chloe was different
from that mixed-breed dog.

1317
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,075
I'll drop the charges!

1318
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,952
-Oh, my gosh!
-I'm sorry.

1319
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,245
-My goodness.
-I was…

1320
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,080
I was…

1321
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,500
I was mistaken!

1322
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:59,630
That dog isn't mine!

1323
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:00,631
Hold on!

1324
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:03,133
What are you doing, Ms. Lee?

1325
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,637
After all this, why are you saying that?

1326
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:11,976
Yes.

1327
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:15,020
You can bark all you want now.

1328
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,605
My Byeol.

1329
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,983
You're not Chloe.

1330
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,443
Counsel,

1331
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,362
are you done with your examination?

1332
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,281
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1333
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,366
If the examination is over,

1334
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:28,367
please take her away.

1335
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:32,955
Byeol!

1336
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,133
You seem flustered.

1337
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,761
Take a sip of water.

1338
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,561
Call your dad right now.

1339
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,940
-Dad?
-Hey.

1340
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,609
-Are you out of your mind?
-Dad, what is it?

1341
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,111
Judge Kang, that fool.

1342
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,904
He just called and threatened me.

1343
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,325
He said you abused an animal.

1344
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,535
He said he has evidence too. Is this true?

1345
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,495
No, Dad. It's not what--

1346
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,539
If it's true,

1347
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:18,042
my official nomination
for general elections will be gone.

1348
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:20,627
Do you know how many people
with pets there are in my district?

1349
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,005
If my political career ends
because of you,

1350
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:25,382
don't even dream
of asking me for anything.

1351
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,301
There won't be
any studying abroad for A-reum!

1352
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:29,553
-You got that?
-Dad!

1353
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:30,512
That's not the…

1354
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:34,224
Dad!

1355
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:37,561
CALL YOUR DAD RIGHT NOW

1356
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:39,480
Wait. What…

1357
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:44,068
What on earth happened?
What was that thing around Byeol's neck?

1358
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:45,486
I didn't find the collar.

1359
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,406
I don't know. I have no idea either.

1360
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,867
We can't buy it on the market.

1361
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,911
Our multi-talented Mr. Jang,

1362
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:55,496
do you have any good ideas?

1363
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,041
For the leather part,

1364
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,543
I can simply get it
from the Cheonggyecheon area.

1365
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,170
For the metal buckle,

1366
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,006
I can weld together some similar material

1367
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,633
to make it look pretty similar.

1368
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,010
Just give me two days.

1369
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,346
You'll be able to fool the eyes
for a moment.

1370
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,393
Then that means we won, right?

1371
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,061
The jurors' faces said it all.

1372
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:23,774
I guess they were pretending not to know.
The plaintiff said it wasn't her dog.

1373
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:24,691
-Right.
-Yeah.

1374
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,151
But you never know.

1375
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,946
Even if the jury wishes to acquit,

1376
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,615
the judge can say
it's an obvious error and overrule it.

1377
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:32,699
That's possible,

1378
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:33,700
but…

1379
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,620
Judge Choi won't do that.

1380
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:39,873
Why not?
You said he was as stubborn as a mule.

1381
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,044
What's your name?

1382
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,129
Your name.

1383
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:47,381
Paw.

1384
01:13:47,464 --> 01:13:52,428
Judge Choi's nickname is Dog Dad.
Maybe it's because he doesn't have kids.

1385
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:55,264
He's raising three abandoned dogs
after adopting them.

1386
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,600
I heard he couldn't be kinder to them.

1387
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,482
Then, it wasn't just about avoiding
Criminal Division 1.

1388
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:08,527
You planned on handing the trial
to Judge Choi from the get-go?

1389
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:16,994
He's so awesome.

1390
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:18,412
Gosh, I hate him.

1391
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,621
I can hear you!

1392
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,458
Okay.

1393
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,128
I will now deliver the verdict.

1394
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,921
Defendants, please rise.

1395
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:34,470
Respecting the jury's unanimous opinion,

1396
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:40,350
the Court hereby finds the defendants

1397
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,269
not guilty.

1398
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,109
Of course, not guilty.

1399
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,445
I'm so relieved.

1400
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,031
All rise.

1401
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,118
Plaintiff!

1402
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,288
Chloe is your dog!
What do you mean you were mistaken?

1403
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:04,082
What a hearty character.

1404
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:10,881
Thank you.

1405
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:12,633
Thank you so much.

1406
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,130
It's been a while,

1407
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:53,757
Mr. Yoo Jae-beom.

1408
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:58,512
Yes, it has been a while, Ms. Oh.

1409
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,890
Sir, please drive safely.

1410
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:17,739
STAY TUNED TO WATCH THE EPILOGUE

1411
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,638
Why did you come to Team Pro Bono?

1412
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,265
Who are you suing again?

1413
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:44,474
God.

1414
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,892
I want compensation for damages.

1415
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,311
I said no.

1416
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:49,646
My very existence
in this world itself is damaging.

1417
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,565
Even if we might not win…

1418
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:54,568
Is a trial a live charity show
to help the needy?

1419
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:57,321
Making money is
the most pro bono thing we can do.

1420
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:59,531
I can't listen to this anymore!

1421
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,074
You stupid boomer!

1422
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:04,494
If the defendant is God,
I don't know what His mailing address is.

1423
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:07,664
It's 101 Dogok-ro.

1424
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:09,916
That's where I'm sending
the complaint for damages.

1425
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,293
He lives in Gangnam?

1426
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:12,919
This might be a ridiculous thought,

1427
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,881
but what if there was
some kind of intent behind all of this?

1428
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,884
It's probably runaway teenagers.

1429
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:19,801
Like So-min.

1430
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,722
I would like to sue Choi Woong-san,
the CEO of Woongsan Group,

1431
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,766
and have him stand trial.

1432
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,397
Mom!

1433
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,274
It hurts so much.

1434
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:37,152
Gosh, you should be glad it isn't worse.

1435
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:38,987
You could've been really hurt,
Da-wit.

1436
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,823
That stupid dog.

1437
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,992
If I ever see him again,

1438
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:47,037
I'll break his legs and--

1439
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,790
That won't happen.

1440
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,334
-Why not?
-When a dog bites someone,

1441
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,002
that becomes a habit.

1442
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:58,256
The owner said
he's going to sell the dog tonight.

1443
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,217
Really?

1444
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,719
What can you do? It's his decision.

1445
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,306
Okay. Let me see.

1446
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:07,849
Da-wit!

1447
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,851
-This is the dog.
-No!

1448
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:12,771
-Da-wit!
-You can't, sir!

1449
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,189
Hey, move!

1450
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:15,565
-You can't!
-You'll get hurt!

1451
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:17,567
You can't, sir!

1452
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:19,152
Don't send Jang-gun away.

1453
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:22,781
Once a dog bites a person,
it becomes a habit. You can't raise it.

1454
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,491
Move already!

1455
01:18:24,574 --> 01:18:27,077
It was because I kept touching
and teasing him.

1456
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,705
So don't send him away!

1457
01:18:30,288 --> 01:18:32,290
For crying out loud, this boy.

1458
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:41,091
