PRO BONO

2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,936
The presiding judge abused his power

3
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:42,730
and killed my father
through a manipulated trial.

4
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:46,192
-What was the name of the presiding judge?
-Kang Da-wit.

5
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:49,696
Trust the evidence. Everything is in here.

6
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:54,075
He brought evidence.

7
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:57,704
Yoo Baek-man is the father of the person
who came to me, Yoo Jae-beom.

8
00:00:57,787 --> 00:00:59,080
He was a businessman

9
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:02,458
who ran a paper mill
called Woongcheon Paper in Woongcheon.

10
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:05,879
A tragic fire broke out in the factory.

11
00:01:05,962 --> 00:01:07,630
PREVIOUSLY

12
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:10,425
The factory burned down,
and a person died as well.

13
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:15,096
The factory manager,
who was in charge of on-site safety,

14
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,056
was arrested and charged.

15
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,977
The CEO, not the factory manager.

16
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:23,479
Go get Yoo Baek-man.

17
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:26,065
Otherwise, I cannot proceed.

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,026
What is this?

19
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:30,987
The one who died was a trainee
from a technical high school.

20
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,615
That came out of his backpack.

21
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:37,201
Mr. Kang leaked it, didn't he?

22
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:40,330
After initially refusing to act,
the prosecution charged the owner Yoo.

23
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:41,289
Detective!

24
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:44,334
Those involved, including
the factory manager, changed their stories

25
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,794
and started testifying
against Yoo Baek-man.

26
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:47,921
In the end…

27
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:49,964
The Court rules

28
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:54,636
the defendant is sentenced
to seven years in prison.

29
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:57,305
Your Honor!

30
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:58,348
Your Honor!

31
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:00,183
Mr. Kang really went that far?

32
00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:04,395
There's no statement that says
he brought the cup noodles.

33
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,773
What on earth is this…

34
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:10,526
What is this photo, Mr. Kang?

35
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:13,404
I'll tell it myself.

36
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:16,199
Yoo Baek-man…

37
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:18,701
We've had…

38
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:21,788
a long, bitter history.

39
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,376
If you had trouble in the past
with the defendant Yoo Baek-man,

40
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,420
shouldn't you have recused yourself?

41
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,632
For a fair trial?

42
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:36,135
Jun-u's right.

43
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:38,721
Ms. Park…

44
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,556
Do you remember, Mr. Kang?

45
00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:44,686
When I first brought up
Yoo Baek-man's name…

46
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,480
Who is that? I don't know him.

47
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:50,400
-It's a name you wouldn't forget.
-Well, that's…

48
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:54,028
The painful story you shared with us.

49
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:58,658
In the end, that's a strong motive.

50
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,661
Is it not?

51
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:18,261
I've taught you well.

52
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:20,346
What?

53
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:25,810
Yes.

54
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,938
-I did it.
-Mr. Kang!

55
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:31,441
Did you really rig the trial?

56
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:32,984
Seriously?

57
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:35,111
Now that we're not on the same side,

58
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:37,363
I better exercise
my right to remain silent.

59
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,954
See you in court, everyone.

00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:09,645

CRIMINAL COURT

65
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,823
Abuse of authority
and unlawful arrest and confinement.

66
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:23,618
Is the defendant Kang Da-wit present?

67
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:28,664
Yes. Present, Your Honor.

68
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:31,042
The victim Yoo Jae-beom?

69
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,171
-Present.
-And the victim's representatives?

70
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:36,964
Are you all present?

71
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:38,383
-Yes.
-Yes.

72
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:01,030
Mr. Kang?

73
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:07,286
Right, Your Honor.
It's my first time being a defendant, so…

74
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:11,165
You've come alone.
Do you have an attorney?

75
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,250
Yes, Your Honor.

76
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:16,587
I'll be representing myself.

77
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,297
I see.

78
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:21,300
The victim's attorneys may be seated.

79
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,596
Will you be okay with doing the trial
without another attorney?

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,265
Of course, Your Honor.

81
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:28,474
Well…

82
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:30,518
Counsels for the victim.

83
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:31,602
Yes, Your Honor?

84
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:33,855
Before commencing this trial,

85
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:37,567
-one issue needs to be addressed.
-Yes, Your Honor.

86
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,779
The defendant is the team leader
you work with, is he not?

87
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,823
Will there be any conflict of interest?

88
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:48,202
-Your Honor, that is--
-There will be no problem, Your Honor.

89
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:50,663
Those people have nothing to do with me.

90
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:52,582
I've already resigned before this trial.

91
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:53,624
Is that so?

92
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,168
They're below my standard.

93
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,962
They took on
such a ridiculous case like this.

94
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:01,132
I am too good to be on that team.

95
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,135
You know this well too, Your Honor.

96
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:08,514
It's such a burden for a captain
when his teammates are incompetent.

97
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:11,267
Well, that is true.

98
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:21,861
EPISODE 10

99
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,530
God, it's so annoying!

100
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:27,533
We're below his standard?
His teammates are incompetent?

101
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:31,370
It must've been so hard working
with people not on his level like us!

102
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:34,290
He might be deliberately
trying to rattle us.

103
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,167
-What?
-Mr. Kang.

104
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,961
He doesn't do anything
that's unnecessary in court.

105
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,173
Every move has intention.
He's trying to rattle us from the start.

106
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,425
-That's right.
-So, don't get caught up in it.

107
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,553
Let's execute the strategies
we've prepared…

108
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:52,475
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Well…

109
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,728
You don't sound like the Jun-u I know.

110
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,105
What are you talking about?

111
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,733
How do you know so much these days?

112
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:04,445
I guess I just get lucky
every now and then.

113
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,075
What's with that annoyingly humble
and relaxed attitude?

114
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:09,992
It's so strange.

115
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:11,577
By the way,

116
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:15,456
I didn't know it when we were
on the same team, but as an adversary,

117
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,251
Mr. Kang really gets on your nerve.

118
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:23,089
Even when we were on the same team,
I knew that very well.

119
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:29,011
Anyway, as expected,
I have a bad feeling about this.

120
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:30,263
Is it the presiding judge?

121
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:33,808
Yeah, he looked at us differently.

122
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:38,771
He looked at Mr. Kang with such concern,
while he looked at us so coldly.

123
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,232
Yeah. Nan-hui.

124
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:44,193
Thank goodness you went undercover!

00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:52,243

127
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:55,121
Goodness, thank you.

128
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:57,456
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

129
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,585
Please tell me more
about your story from before.

130
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:01,502
Right.

131
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:04,547
Chief Judge Kang saved Judge Gong's life.

132
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,841
-Didn't you know that?
-Pardon?

133
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:08,092
-Right?
-Yeah.

134
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:11,178
Judge Gong has pretty bad habits
when he gets drunk.

135
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:13,222
During a work dinner, he blacked out

136
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,933
and slapped Chief Shin Jung-seok
across the face.

137
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:17,143
Hey!

138
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:19,687
You can't hit him!
Why aren't you stopping him?

139
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,689
-Please calm down.
-Seok-ho, you bastard!

140
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:23,482
-I want you to quit right now!
-Chief!

141
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:26,152
-Let go of me, you moron!
-This is a disgrace to our country!

142
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:28,154
My goodness! Really?

143
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:30,948
He was furious and said
he'd demand Gong's resignation.

144
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,701
But Chief Judge Kang acted a step faster.

145
00:08:33,784 --> 00:08:34,952
Hey, Mr. Yoon! It's me!

146
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,871
Could you write
a flattering article for me?

147
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:40,124
In return, I'll give you
a big exclusive scoop later.

148
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,251
No way.

149
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:45,338
They're all crazy lunatics. Seriously!

150
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:48,049
They put out a flattering article
in The Law Times.

151
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:52,678
"The court chief is a living Buddha
who laughs off getting slapped."

152
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:55,806
"Someone like him deserves
to be a Supreme Court justice…"

153
00:08:57,308 --> 00:08:59,560
That is so like him. Geez.

154
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:01,812
-What?
-Sorry?

155
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,731
It's a well-known story.

156
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,651
-Who are you?
-Sorry?

157
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:08,527
Are you a transfer? A new hire?

158
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:11,697
Gosh, look at the time!

159
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:13,908
I'll get going now!

160
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:16,035
Excuse me. Wait…

161
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,123
But Mr. Jang, were you really able
to get him to come?

162
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:24,960
Yes. He should be on his way.

163
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,214
Okay, let me ask the prosecution.

164
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:29,340
Yes, Your Honor?

165
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:31,842
These charges filed were

166
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:35,846
based heavily on the evidence
the plaintiff had gathered. Correct?

167
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,847
Yes, Your Honor.

168
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:41,143
But isn't the plaintiff
a wanted serial con artist?

169
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:43,813
Yes, Your Honor.

170
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,940
This is not just any case.

171
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:49,985
It claims a judge
abused his authority during a trial.

172
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:52,196
Have you thoroughly verified

173
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,282
the credibility of the plaintiff's claim?

174
00:09:56,659 --> 00:10:00,204
Yes, we have concluded
the claims are credible, so--

175
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:02,373
-Your Honor?
-Please go ahead.

176
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:05,376
My apologies, but we have retained
an additional counsel.

177
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,169
He will soon arrive in court.

178
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,715
What?

179
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:14,593
Wait, why…
Why would the victim need another…

180
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:15,928
Mr. Jang!

181
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:23,811
Who is that?

182
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:29,650
Father?

183
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:30,776
Is that my son-in-law?

184
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,069
His father-in-law?

185
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,161
So, this was the reason.

186
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:51,380
WILD MUSHROOM CLUB
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY

187
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:52,715
Goodness.

188
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:54,341
A FEW DAYS AGO
SONG GI-SEOP'S OFFICE

189
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:55,259
You shouldn't have.

190
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,137
These are the real deal.

191
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,222
Wild lion's mane mushrooms!

192
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,850
How did you know
I was searching for them?

193
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:05,144
It's well-known in the mushroom world

194
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:07,396
how much you love lion's manes.

195
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,440
How much would they cost?

196
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:12,443
I should give you a good offer.

197
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:16,530
But I don't have many cases these days,
so my wallet's a bit light.

198
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,867
Don't worry. I'm an attorney too.

199
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,952
It'd be weird to receive money from you.

200
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:24,413
Right? Yeah.

201
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:26,373
As fellow attorneys,
money would be ridiculous.

202
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:31,629
Could you just come to court for me once?

203
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:33,672
What? What court?

204
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:36,842
I'm Song Gi-seop,

205
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:40,930
and I've been retained
as an additional counsel, Your Honor.

206
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,264
Right. I see.

207
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:45,100
Hold on. Then…

208
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:46,018
So…

209
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,439
We will reschedule the date of this trial
due to the Court's circumstances

210
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:51,440
at a later time.

211
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:54,485
All rise.

212
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,117
I'll call you, sir!

213
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:09,250
NEXT HEARING

214
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,960
-Really?
-You taught us well.

215
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:13,629
Look, Ms. Park.

216
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:14,547
Just a moment.

217
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,798
What?

218
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:18,092
-Five, four…
-What?

219
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:20,177
-Three, two…
-What?

220
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,972
-All rise.
-One.

221
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:32,439
Please be seated.

222
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:37,027
Judge Oh Jae-seop of Criminal Division 1

223
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,904
is known for always being
five minutes late.

224
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:41,782
Three, two, one.

225
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:44,785
Judge Oh went to the same high school
that Woo Myeong-hun is from.

226
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:49,748
They've been taking baking class together
for two years or something as a hobby.

227
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:51,041
Isn't that ridiculous?

228
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,043
-And so we meet here again.
-Right?

229
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:56,964
-Thank you for your hard work, Your Honor.
-Gosh, why did it have to be this judge?

230
00:12:57,464 --> 00:13:00,259
Mr. Kang's good luck is coming to an end.

231
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:03,137
I'm sure he'll do whatever he can
to have the judge changed again.

232
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,263
A hundred percent.

233
00:13:04,346 --> 00:13:06,599
The interest in this case
is high, isn't it?

234
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:09,143
As it involves a former judge,

235
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,020
we'll strive to be even more fair.

236
00:13:11,103 --> 00:13:15,733
The Court will treat him
just like any other defendant.

237
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,776
Your Honor.

238
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:21,030
What is it? Do you want to motion
to recuse the Court again?

239
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:23,032
Of course not.

240
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:27,161
I respectfully ask to be judged

241
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:28,537
just like any other defendant.

242
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:30,414
What?

243
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,666
What is he up to?

244
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,464
Okay, next trial is case number…

245
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:54,271
Mr. Kang, what are you doing?

246
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,190
I'm heading to my seat.

247
00:13:56,273 --> 00:14:00,319
Your Honor, I was suddenly falsely accused

248
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:02,780
and betrayed by my teammates.

249
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:04,531
It'd be weird
to not get sick from anger.

250
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,409
I hereby submit a doctor's note.

251
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:10,829
My doctor told me
to not sit for long periods.

252
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,626
-Could you please postpone the trial?
-You're suddenly seriously ill?

253
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,380
DOCTOR'S NOTE

254
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:22,257
This right here…

255
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:24,343
Are you asking me to believe this?

256
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:27,012
You've had no problem believing so far!

257
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:28,138
He stood…

258
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:31,350
You were fine
when conglomerate CEOs were on trial.

259
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,603
-JU Group CEO Ju Il-do.
-Hey!

260
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:37,398
When NJ Group Vice Chairman
Min Yong-jun came in a wheelchair,

261
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,317
you gladly accepted
their motions to postpone.

262
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:42,152
As I said before,

263
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:47,366
I respectfully ask to be judged
just like any other defendant.

264
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:59,586
Strike that from the record. Erase that.

265
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:01,588
Did you erase it?

266
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:04,967
For goodness' sake!
So this is how he's going to play?

267
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,469
He's the best in the world
at making others mad.

268
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:11,056
-Geez, what are we supposed to do?
-Let's break his arm!

269
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,057
Coming through!

270
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:15,728
Goodness.
Take care of your health, everyone.

271
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:17,896
You're doomed without a healthy body.

272
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,981
Stay healthy!

273
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:20,566
-Geez!
-Oh, my gosh.

274
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,736
Gosh, my arms hurt so much.

275
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:26,905
Did Gang-hun lend me a broken one?

276
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:30,034
-He's so childish!
-Listen.

277
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,578
Don't get swept up in his delay tactics.

278
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,621
We have to wrap up this case cleanly

279
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:37,374
-to gain a firm footing in the firm--
-Footing?

280
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:40,919
Are we doing this case for footing?

281
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,718
I mean we'll gain a firm footing
as pro bono attorneys.

282
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,345
Let me give it a try in the next hearing.

283
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:55,184
-What?
-I've done some research.

284
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:02,024
Victim's counsels,
I heard you had something to say.

285
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,784
This case isn't a trial, Your Honor.
It's personal vendetta.

286
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:14,495
Mr. Kang held a deep resentment

287
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:17,164
toward the plaintiff's father,
Yoo Baek-man.

288
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:20,918
Since becoming a judge,
he prepared his revenge for a long time.

289
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:29,343
Is that so? Could you
please step forward and speak?

290
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:31,345
Yes, Your Honor.

291
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:34,848
Twelve years ago,

292
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:36,809
during an organizational reshuffling…

293
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,811
WORK LOCATION PREFERENCE

294
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:41,438
…Mr. Kang wanted to be near his home
in Eastern District Court.

295
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:45,067
Then suddenly, he changed his preference
to Seoul Southern District Court

296
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,530
even though it was unpopular
due to its heavy workload.

297
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:51,698
I see.

298
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:53,742
Please proceed.

299
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,494
But just before that,

300
00:16:55,577 --> 00:16:57,746
Yoo Baek-man's Woongcheon Paper
happened to move

301
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,166
to Jangwol Industrial Complex,
which was under the jurisdiction

302
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,836
of Seoul Southern District Court.

303
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,504
WOONGCHEON PAPER

304
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:10,008
Is that so?

305
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:16,181
-That is pretty odd.
-Yes, Your Honor.

306
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:20,185
When he was first appointed, he wanted
to work at Woongcheon District Court…

307
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,982
despite having good enough scores…

308
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,820
to be appointed in Seoul.

309
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:34,616
Since the beginning,
Mr. Kang had kept wanting to work

310
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,952
where Woongcheon Paper was located.

311
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:40,873
When assigned the trial of the person
he held a deep grudge towards,

312
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:43,000
he did not decide to recuse himself.

313
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,877
And as soon as the trial began,

314
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:49,006
he accurately pointed out
the personnel structure

315
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:53,010
and operational status of Woongcheon Paper
that investigators didn't even know about

316
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:56,430
and proceeded with the trial
as if it were an investigation.

317
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:59,474
It was as if he were presenting a project
he had long been preparing.

318
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:01,727
That is all, Your Honor.

319
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:04,897
Your Honor.

320
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,773
Mr. Kang, do you have something to say?

321
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:10,068
Rather than vague speculation
on a person's intentions,

322
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:14,364
please ask him
if he has any concrete evidence.

323
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,419
Your Honor, we would like to call
Attorney Choi Dong-geun,

324
00:18:27,502 --> 00:18:30,088
who was the fire case's
investigating prosecutor, as a witness.

325
00:18:30,797 --> 00:18:31,715
What is the purpose?

326
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:33,175
It's to show

327
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:37,512
that the defendant conducted
an unusually biased trial.

328
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,406
Okay. We have him rattled.

329
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,743
Let's throw a counterpunch at him
in the next hearing. Bam!

330
00:18:59,826 --> 00:19:00,661
Jun-u.

331
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:05,082
How did you get
that work location preference form?

332
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,792
What?

333
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,711
That's an internal court file.
It's not for everyone to see.

334
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,548
Come on. Is that important?

335
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:21,306
Just know that there are
honest people within the court too.

336
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,559
-Let's go! Lunch is on me.
-What?

337
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:40,033
Not everyone has
what it takes to be CEO.

338
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,952
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir.

339
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:45,580
This would be a great opportunity
for you to give me a big push.

340
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,042
Come in.

341
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:12,107
Hey, Attorney Oh!

342
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,319
Even though you're not CEO anymore,
you're still working hard.

343
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:18,864
That's just how you'd expect
Dr. Oh's daughter to act.

344
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,493
It's not too overwhelming
as the new CEO?

345
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:24,745
Not at all.

346
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:26,246
If it's too much, tell me anytime.

347
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,124
-It's okay.
-I'll help you, Attorney Bae.

348
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,168
"Attorney Bae"?

349
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:32,711
Gosh!

350
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:35,172
Whatever. Fine.

351
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:36,798
Anyway,

352
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,718
just know that all approvals
on Team Pro Bono

353
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,094
will go through me from now on.

354
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:43,347
What?

355
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,725
I'll take care of Da-wit's trial myself.

356
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:49,394
I heard you'd just let the team
handle the cases.

357
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:53,899
I guess someone
has been reporting to you regularly

358
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:55,650
about Team Pro Bono.

359
00:20:57,194 --> 00:20:59,071
Anyway, it's no longer your team now.

360
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:01,490
I'll personally manage them

361
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:04,117
by the firm's rules, so keep that in mind.

362
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:07,621
Talking back to your CEO…

363
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:08,705
Geez!

364
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:22,594
Hey.

365
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:24,262
This is a surprise.

366
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:28,558
Aren't we…

367
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:32,521
enemies now?

368
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:36,566
-Enemies?
-Am I wrong?

369
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,860
Right now, I'm fighting
against Team Pro Bono.

370
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,655
And you're their captain.

371
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:43,573
I'm not.

372
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:46,034
Team Pro Bono was taken away from me.

373
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,247
-Bae Yong-hun didn't take it, did he?
-He did.

374
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:53,834
How can he handle pro bono cases

375
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,252
when all he cares about is money?

376
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,294
Ridiculous.

377
00:21:57,087 --> 00:22:01,174
Does Dr. Oh not trust
his only daughter that much?

378
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,095
Father draws a clear line
between friends and enemies.

379
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:06,596
It seems like

380
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,474
I fall into the latter category now.

381
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:11,393
It was then, wasn't it?

382
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,270
The Elijah case.

383
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:14,646
Hey, Jung-in.

384
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:15,939
Let's do it.

385
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:17,524
Did you persuade Dr. Oh?

386
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:19,151
Persuade?

387
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,654
If you lose, it'll be over
for both me and you.

388
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:27,868
What did you do to Dr. Oh back then?

389
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:35,667
It's already been done,
so it doesn't matter.

390
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:44,634
What matters more

391
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:46,761
is whether you can win or not.

392
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:48,805
Tell me, Da-wit.

393
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:51,141
Can you win this trial?

394
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:56,271
If you lose here,

395
00:22:56,354 --> 00:22:59,482
you'll also lose Jang Hyeon-bae's retrial.

396
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:04,404
You'll become a criminal judge
who abused his power regularly.

397
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:06,489
And as someone who has supported you,

398
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,910
I'll have no place in this field.

399
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:14,080
I saw you were playing around
with Team Pro Bono.

400
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:17,000
Are you sure you can win?

401
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,344
You're not asking me about it.

402
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:29,137
About what?

403
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:31,264
What the truth is.

404
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:35,518
If I really rigged the trial
to get revenge or not.

405
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,364
Does it not matter?

406
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,450
I guess I just need to win.

407
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:56,373
Yeah, we just need to win.

408
00:24:02,295 --> 00:24:03,838
Geez.

409
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,804
Hello, Dr. Oh!

410
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,266
When you're peeing, just focus on that.

411
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:17,227
If you splash,
you'll make it hard on the janitors.

412
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,020
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

413
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:23,066
I submitted the evidence
I got through Mr. Bae.

414
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:25,193
To conclude that trial
as fast as possible,

415
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:28,780
I, hardworking attorney Hwang Jun-u,
will do my best.

416
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:32,450
Come now.
I told you to just focus on peeing.

417
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:35,412
-Please move your feet.
-Gosh.

418
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:38,331
Gosh, you work so hard. Thank you, ma'am.

419
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:41,459
-Goodness, it's so dirty here.
-Ma'am, what are you doing?

420
00:24:41,543 --> 00:24:43,545
-Let's make it nice and clean.
-What is with her?

421
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:46,172
Dr. Oh, hold on!
I'll take care of things and let you know!

422
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:51,011
I knew it was you, Jun-u.

423
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:59,394
What brings you here?
You didn't even tell me before.

424
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:03,857
What? Do I need an appointment
to come to see my dad?

425
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:06,901
You're right. You don't.

426
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:10,864
So, what is it?

427
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:13,742
Team Pro Bono.

428
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:17,078
You handed the team to Attorney Bae.

429
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:22,334
You had worked hard as a CEO.
Why don't you take some rest?

430
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:23,668
Find a hobby to enjoy.

431
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:28,089
You're still the same.

432
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:31,885
You'd lock me in storage
when I wouldn't listen to you…

433
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,262
since I was 4 years old.

434
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:38,308
Daddy, don't go!

435
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:42,020
Daddy!

436
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:46,566
You remember?

437
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:48,485
My goodness.

438
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:53,865
The storage is still there and intact.

439
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:56,785
If you miss the old days, tell me anytime.

440
00:25:57,994 --> 00:26:01,790
You forced Team Pro Bono
to take Da-wit's case.

441
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:03,625
Was that also my punishment

442
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,503
for daring to go against you?

443
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:07,879
Why was that wrong?

444
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:11,299
Didn't you make the team
to handle such cases?

445
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,219
It's for the public good.
How nice is that?

446
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:19,140
Father.

447
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:21,851
Bae is an expert
at corporate restructuring.

448
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:23,978
Under someone like him,

449
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:26,439
Team Pro Bono can't do anything.

450
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:29,484
If they can't do anything,

451
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,528
what else can I do?

452
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:32,904
I'll have to lay them off.

453
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:46,251
What? Does it feel
like I took away your toy?

454
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:50,880
Okay, I understand.

455
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:02,225
I came here today to give you this.

456
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:03,810
What?

457
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:05,854
RESIGNATION LETTER

458
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:08,982
-A resignation letter?
-I'm not a 4-year-old girl anymore.

459
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:13,736
No more sitting and crying in the storage?

460
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,113
So what you came up with

461
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:17,824
is to run away from home at the age of 40?

462
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,661
I'm going to come back, no matter what.

463
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:40,722
COURT

464
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:42,182
The defendant…

465
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:43,266
ATTORNEY CHOI DONG-GEUN

466
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:46,728
…pressured me when I was
an investigating prosecutor at the time

467
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:48,980
to file additional charges
against Yoo Baek-man.

468
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:52,650
He did this while granting bail
to the factory manager with his authority.

469
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:56,738
This photo was everywhere
in the media back then.

470
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,782
Yes. It was leaked by the defendant.

471
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:01,201
And in that photo,

472
00:28:01,284 --> 00:28:03,203
the item didn't even belong
to the late student.

473
00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:05,788
But the photo caused an uproar.

474
00:28:05,872 --> 00:28:07,832
They said it was
a poor, biased investigation.

475
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:12,879
Mr. Kang called me
and even openly pressured me.

476
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:16,549
"If you don't bring Yoo Baek-man to court,
I won't conduct the trial."

477
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:20,470
Your Honor, how can a judge do that?

478
00:28:20,553 --> 00:28:23,556
This was a clear overreach
and abuse of authority.

479
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:25,433
That is all.

480
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:29,604
The witness may step down.

481
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:36,653
Mr. Yoo.

482
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:38,905
Do you have something to say?

483
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:42,283
Yes, Your Honor.

484
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,869
If I may, could I say a few words?

485
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:47,163
Go ahead.

486
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:51,626
Thank you, Your Honor.

487
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:53,628
Honestly,

488
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:55,964
my father was not that great of a person.

489
00:29:02,428 --> 00:29:04,264
Order in the court.

490
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:08,726
Mr. Yoo, it's hard to hear you,

491
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,062
so will you step forward
and speak over here?

492
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:12,480
Yes, Your Honor.

493
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:22,156
My father…

494
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,662
All he talked about was money.

495
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:30,081
He was cheap and not generous.

496
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:35,795
Although my father
may not have been a good person,

497
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:39,507
he was a diligent family man.

498
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,677
As a self-made man from the countryside,

499
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,429
he did not want his family

500
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,849
to struggle like he did

501
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,518
and had no capacity
to be generous to others.

502
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,980
Still, that isn't a crime.

503
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:55,690
But the defendant treated him,

504
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:59,402
an ordinary head of a household,

505
00:30:00,653 --> 00:30:02,155
like a murderer.

506
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:06,284
Yes. It was a tragic accident.

507
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:07,911
And a person died.

508
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:09,203
However,

509
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:12,874
because of that incident,
our family also lost everything.

510
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:17,086
My father did not start
the fire on purpose.

511
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:22,967
The factory did not have enough
fire-proof facilities or escape routes.

512
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:26,137
He didn't fulfill his duty
to ensure safety. Sure!

513
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:30,516
That is right.

514
00:30:34,938 --> 00:30:36,314
Our factory likely did not have

515
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:40,443
safety facilities like those found
in cutting-edge semiconductor factories.

516
00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:43,738
It was a small paper mill, Your Honor.

517
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:47,367
How good did those facilities
need to have been?

518
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:52,205
The defendant had his revenge

519
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:56,042
in the name of a trial.

520
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:00,380
The murderer

521
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:02,757
was not my father.

522
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:05,385
It was Kang Da-wit.

523
00:31:07,804 --> 00:31:09,347
That man right here.

524
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:16,896
All right.

525
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:25,530
Your Honor.

526
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:29,575
Go ahead, Mr. Kang.

527
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:34,497
Could you continue the trial
for one more day?

528
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:37,667
I'll retain counsel.

529
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:57,437
The more this trial progresses,
the more uncomfortable it gets.

530
00:31:59,022 --> 00:32:01,524
I know that a judge shouldn't do that.

531
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:06,529
But I can understand why he applied
for the Woongcheon branch when he started.

532
00:32:11,993 --> 00:32:15,246
Aren't judges humans too?
I mean, it was his mom.

533
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:16,372
The CEO of the factory

534
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:19,042
overworked his mom until late
and she severed her hand.

535
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,919
And then, a young student
died in that factory the next time.

536
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:24,714
If it were me,
I'd want to punish him too

537
00:32:24,797 --> 00:32:26,674
by any means.

538
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:28,885
Nan-hui.

539
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:32,805
Do you know why justice
has to be carried out fairly?

540
00:32:33,973 --> 00:32:37,101
-What?
-If justice is achieved unfairly,

541
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:39,687
the opposition won't accept the loss.

542
00:32:40,354 --> 00:32:44,317
Then, the opposition
would do something else unfair.

543
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,401
It would never end.

544
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:51,866
Sorry. I'm stating the obvious.

545
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:54,285
But I…

546
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:56,621
I'm not sure either.

547
00:32:57,246 --> 00:32:58,998
If the world is already

548
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:01,417
operating unfairly,

549
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:05,046
what can we do about it?

550
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:07,465
Mr. Jang.

551
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:13,012
Come on, now. Why…

552
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:15,098
What's with you all?

553
00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:16,891
We're doing great.

554
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:19,894
Yeong-sil, didn't you see
the look on his face?

555
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:24,315
He's going to hire an attorney.
We've got him cornered!

556
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:25,483
Let's drink.

557
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:28,444
Come on, let's drink!

558
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:29,695
Happy?

559
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,366
-What?
-Are you happy?

560
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:35,952
Why are you so excited?

561
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:40,540
I'm not excited.

562
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,209
What did I do?

563
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:46,754
Are you thrilled about the thought
of being complimented by Mr. Bae?

564
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:51,050
Hey, what do you… What?
What are you talking about?

565
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:52,343
Nan-hui?

566
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:56,139
The internal court document
you submitted last time.

567
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:58,558
Mr. Bae gave it to you, didn't he?

568
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:01,435
The judge didn't even ask
where you got it from.

569
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,189
Has Oh & Partners made a deal
with the judge as well?

570
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:09,819
Jun-u, is this true?

571
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:11,904
What on earth have you been doing?

572
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:14,365
What?

573
00:34:17,118 --> 00:34:19,495
We work for Oh & Partners.

574
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,414
You all know that, right?

575
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:24,167
Is it weird for an attorney
to follow the firm's order?

576
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,669
-Jun-u!
-Da-wit, that guy…

577
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:31,757
He fooled us
while pretending to be admirable.

578
00:34:31,841 --> 00:34:34,343
I was the one who trusted
and followed him the most.

579
00:34:35,303 --> 00:34:37,638
That kind of hypocrite
doesn't deserve my loyalty.

580
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:40,641
If the opportunity arises this time,

581
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:42,185
I'm taking it.

582
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:45,479
If you want to blame me, go ahead.

583
00:34:59,243 --> 00:35:04,040
Why are you dragging out
this darn trial so much?

584
00:35:04,123 --> 00:35:07,668
Park Gi-ppeum isn't cooking up
another weird plan, is she?

585
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:09,212
No, sir.

586
00:35:09,295 --> 00:35:10,588
She's been doing great.

587
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:13,716
-She's taking each step meticulously--
-Yeah, at each step,

588
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:15,927
you have to update me
on the situation immediately.

589
00:35:16,886 --> 00:35:18,346
If something's off, you know, right?

590
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:20,181
-Pardon?
-What?

591
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:23,601
Yes, Mr. Bae!

592
00:35:25,686 --> 00:35:26,729
-All right.
-Stop.

593
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:30,650
I don't think you get what I'm saying.

594
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:32,109
Do you?

595
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:37,448
If this goes wrong,

596
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:40,201
you'll be the first to go,

597
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:43,537
Attorney Hwang.

598
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,334
I understand, sir.

599
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:07,937
What's going on?
He said he'd retain an attorney.

600
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,105
I know.

601
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:11,565
Jun-u's late too.

602
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:14,277
Who cares?

603
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:16,821
Mr. Kang.

604
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,949
-Yes, Your Honor?
-Is your attorney not here?

605
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:23,160
Just a moment, please.
They will be here shortly.

606
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:36,215
Ms. Oh? Wait, what's going on?

607
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:39,093
My apologies for being late, Your Honor.

608
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:41,804
I'm Oh Jung-in,
attorney for defendant Kang Da-wit.

609
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,764
What…

610
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:45,725
What's going on?

611
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,854
Ms. Oh is his…

612
00:36:57,611 --> 00:37:01,991
-Ms. Oh, please be on time.
-Yes, Your Honor.

613
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,289
Mr. Jang, what's going on?

614
00:37:08,372 --> 00:37:10,499
Wait, hold on!

615
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:14,003
She's stepped down as CEO,
but she's still an attorney in our firm.

616
00:37:14,086 --> 00:37:15,212
How can she defend…

617
00:37:15,296 --> 00:37:18,382
She handed in her resignation letter
and resigned yesterday.

618
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:21,761
What? But her dad founded the firm.
Why all of a sudden?

619
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:25,264
Maybe there was a problem
between Dr. Oh and Ms. Oh.

620
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:29,310
I heard the partners gossiping about it
before at their meeting.

621
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:30,311
What?

622
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:38,652
At the last hearing, you said,

623
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:41,113
"He pressured me when I was
an investigating prosecutor

624
00:37:41,197 --> 00:37:44,283
to file additional charges
against Yoo Baek-man."

625
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,118
-Yes.
-I am curious.

626
00:37:46,202 --> 00:37:50,247
How can a judge
put pressure on a prosecutor?

627
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:53,834
Did you always follow the judges' orders
when you were a prosecutor?

628
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:55,669
I've already testified about this.

629
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:59,048
The reports from the media
got the public riled up and--

630
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:00,299
That's strange.

631
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:03,677
I thought you were put on the fast track

632
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:07,056
by pushing a slum clearance case
while ignoring public opinion.

633
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:13,813
-That's a baseless accusation--
-You must have forgotten.

634
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:16,524
To get into major firms
after quitting as a prosecutor,

635
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:18,484
you went around repeatedly saying

636
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:20,861
you could handle
redevelopment cases like no one else.

637
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,449
And I was curious about something.

638
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:27,243
The investigation report shows

639
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:30,746
you did not summon Yoo Baek-man
for questioning even once.

640
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,664
Not even in writing.

641
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:35,835
It was because our staff's investigation
was enough to--

642
00:38:35,918 --> 00:38:36,752
By any chance,

643
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:42,133
does it have anything to do
with playing golf with Yoo Baek-man?

644
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:46,512
Geez.

645
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:54,812
Well, if a well-informed judge
with great connections

646
00:38:54,895 --> 00:38:56,814
knew about that,

647
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:01,402
you must have felt the pressure
like a criminal on the run.

648
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:05,156
Goodness, my apologies. I went too far.

649
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,700
I will retract what I just said.

650
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:10,578
No matter the reason,
pressuring a prosecutor

651
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:13,122
-directly or indirectly is--
-An overreach and abuse of power.

652
00:39:13,205 --> 00:39:17,126
Is that what you were about to say?
But I wonder again…

653
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:21,046
Does a judge have the authority
to direct an investigation?

654
00:39:21,672 --> 00:39:23,340
-Pardon?
-Abuse of authority refers

655
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:26,051
to misusing authority one already has.

656
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:31,056
If they interfere in matters they had
no authority over, no crime is committed.

657
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,350
Isn't this the court's stance?

658
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:36,562
When high-ranking judges
would interfere in cases,

659
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:38,230
that was how the court would rule.

660
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:41,484
"They never had the authority
to intervene in the trial,

661
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:43,944
so it does not constitute
abuse of authority."

662
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:45,488
"Not guilty."

663
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:48,699
Still, the photo of the cup noodles--

664
00:39:48,782 --> 00:39:53,245
Do you have evidence to prove
it did not belong to the late student?

665
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:54,455
Pardon?

666
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:59,919
It was a massive fire
that took a week to clean up.

667
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:04,131
The investigative authority selected
only a few items as evidence.

668
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:05,132
Their reasoning?

669
00:40:05,674 --> 00:40:07,426
Probably their own judgment.

670
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:10,095
-Am I wrong, Prosecutor?
-Look, that's because…

671
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:13,015
Okay, what do we have left then?

672
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:16,685
"Since long ago, the defendant
had wanted to work in the area

673
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,479
where Woongcheon Paper was located."

674
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:20,189
For his revenge?

675
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:26,529
Proof of guilt has to be established
based strictly on objective evidence.

676
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:29,448
But the plaintiff's side
is making a rash conclusion

677
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:32,159
about the defendant's intentions
based on unverified stories.

678
00:40:32,868 --> 00:40:36,789
Are a person's intentions that simple?

679
00:40:38,415 --> 00:40:40,834
Is it okay for the others
to judge them so rashly?

680
00:40:57,351 --> 00:41:00,145
She definitely is the former CEO
of Korea's top law firm.

681
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:03,440
She was no joke. What do we do?

682
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:07,861
They're trying to get at acquittal
by arguing a lack of evidence.

683
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:12,157
They're trying to hide the truth
and shift focus from the main issue.

684
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,788
Excuse me, Mr. Hwang?

685
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:19,873
What?

686
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:22,376
Since you're going solo,
why don't you prepare on your own?

687
00:41:24,086 --> 00:41:26,338
Stop butting into our team meeting.

688
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:36,557
Hey, Jun-u.

689
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:40,185
Nan-hui, don't be too hard on him.

690
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:45,524
You think I can help it?

691
00:41:48,444 --> 00:41:51,363
It hasn't been fun to work these days.

692
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:53,282
Our team has fallen apart.

693
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,168
I'm home.

694
00:42:16,847 --> 00:42:17,890
I forgot.

695
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:28,275
FINAL JUDGEMENT

696
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,903
CREDITOR
JC CAPITAL, FINAL

697
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,364
It's here. We got exempt back then.

698
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:34,490
Definitely.

699
00:42:34,573 --> 00:42:35,908
I'm so relieved.

700
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:45,417
JUDGE KANG DA-WIT

701
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:49,088
JUDGE KANG DA-WIT

702
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,800
The Court rules…

703
00:42:52,883 --> 00:42:54,551
Wingardium Leviosa.

704
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:57,471
…that the debtor is exempt from liability.

705
00:42:58,347 --> 00:43:02,768
The applicant's remaining obligations
as a joint guarantor

706
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:05,229
are hereby fully extinguished.

707
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:07,231
Congratulations.

708
00:43:07,314 --> 00:43:08,357
You won.

709
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:20,244
It was him.

710
00:43:22,996 --> 00:43:24,331
How…

711
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,252
But how…

712
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:44,309
JUDGE KANG DA-WIT

713
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,825
JS GROUP'S BIASED WORK ALLOCATION

714
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:06,623
KANG SENTENCES JANG TO 10 YEARS,
70 BILLION WON FINE

715
00:44:17,426 --> 00:44:18,677
ATTORNEY KANG DA-WIT

716
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,361
You're early.

717
00:44:38,238 --> 00:44:39,239
Hello.

718
00:44:40,032 --> 00:44:41,116
This is unexpected.

719
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,119
The plaintiff's attorney
called the defendant.

720
00:44:45,037 --> 00:44:46,538
Are you trying to settle

721
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,416
because you don't think you can win?
Is that it?

722
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:52,503
Why? You all have been
doing great without me.

723
00:44:53,128 --> 00:44:56,715
How did you get Judge Gong's
father-in-law to come?

724
00:44:56,798 --> 00:44:58,926
I was so shocked then.

725
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:02,721
You're going to joke around
when this is your trial?

726
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:06,475
Do you even have any sense of sincerity?

727
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,770
Or are you hiding your true feelings
because it's your trial?

728
00:45:11,146 --> 00:45:12,898
Is that why you hired Ms. Oh too?

729
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:14,733
So you can stay silent?

730
00:45:14,816 --> 00:45:16,818
-Ms. Park.
-Did you know?

731
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:20,072
You were my role model.

732
00:45:20,155 --> 00:45:22,115
Come on, that's nonsense.

733
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:27,079
A materialistic guy who only cares
about success like me is your role model?

734
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:28,705
Not just anyone can do that.

735
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:31,416
You don't have what it takes.

736
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:37,005
You were at Seoul Central's
bankruptcy court 15 years ago, right?

737
00:45:37,089 --> 00:45:38,465
How can I remember--

738
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,301
Do you remember?

739
00:45:42,386 --> 00:45:44,930
Among the bankrupt,
there was a family of deaf people,

740
00:45:46,223 --> 00:45:47,641
so you explained in sign language.

741
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:51,687
I did that a couple of times.

742
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,064
No way.

743
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:01,154
I was so touched back then.

744
00:46:04,783 --> 00:46:07,578
"Such amazing people
do exist in this world."

745
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:11,290
"I want to become someone like him."

746
00:46:12,374 --> 00:46:14,543
Wait. Oh, my gosh.

747
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:17,838
I dreamed of becoming
a legal professional because of you.

748
00:46:27,723 --> 00:46:28,932
But…

749
00:46:32,394 --> 00:46:36,189
It's so hard
now that we're in this situation.

750
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:41,987
Please, I'm begging you.

751
00:46:44,656 --> 00:46:46,199
Please tell me the truth.

752
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:49,536
It's not to win the case.

753
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,747
I can even resign from this case.

754
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:58,253
I want to believe you.

755
00:46:59,963 --> 00:47:04,509
You gave our family hope
that this world was still worth living in.

756
00:47:04,593 --> 00:47:06,094
You may appear to complain,

757
00:47:06,178 --> 00:47:09,348
but you fight harder
than anyone else for those in need.

758
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:11,767
I want to trust that person.

759
00:47:14,561 --> 00:47:15,562
Ms. Park.

760
00:47:23,904 --> 00:47:25,072
You've gotten so much better!

761
00:47:25,155 --> 00:47:27,115
Goodness. Seriously.

762
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:29,618
You almost had me.

763
00:47:29,701 --> 00:47:31,203
-Mr. Kang!
-That's right.

764
00:47:31,286 --> 00:47:34,331
That's how you win over
the other party. With sincerity.

765
00:47:34,414 --> 00:47:36,833
If people saw your eyes,
they all would've fallen for it.

766
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,544
God…

767
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:40,837
Please.

768
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:42,130
The truth?

769
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:44,966
There's no such thing.

770
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,594
Everyone just has their side of the story.

771
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:51,098
The winner's side of the story
after fighting in court.

772
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:56,186
That's the only truth
the world acknowledges.

773
00:48:00,232 --> 00:48:01,650
Do you want to know the truth?

774
00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:07,280
Then, defeat me.

775
00:48:14,121 --> 00:48:15,122
Okay.

776
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:18,792
I'll defeat you.

777
00:48:23,755 --> 00:48:24,881
See you in court.

778
00:48:59,499 --> 00:49:00,876
Justice Shin.

779
00:49:00,959 --> 00:49:02,127
Yes, sir?

780
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,920
It must be hectic
handling state affairs.

781
00:49:04,004 --> 00:49:07,174
But why did you insist
on seeing me so urgently?

782
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:08,675
I'm sorry, Dr. Oh.

783
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,844
This time,

784
00:49:11,386 --> 00:49:14,514
I thought talking
to Mr. Bae wouldn't be enough.

785
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:24,316
I heard Ms. Oh

786
00:49:25,317 --> 00:49:28,111
is representing Kang Da-wit.

787
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:30,113
So?

788
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:32,616
I'm very confused

789
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:35,285
about what's happening.

790
00:49:36,077 --> 00:49:37,746
I handed the file to Bae

791
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:40,540
and I barely managed
to assign the case to a judge

792
00:49:40,624 --> 00:49:42,167
who listens well to me.

793
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:47,798
How can your daughter,
of all people, represent Kang Da-wit?

794
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:48,882
Dr. Oh.

795
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:51,885
What on earth are you thinking?

796
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:55,806
-Justice Shin.
-Yes?

797
00:49:56,598 --> 00:50:01,311
Just as each of these cups and plates
serves a different purpose,

798
00:50:01,394 --> 00:50:04,356
each person has their own role.

799
00:50:04,439 --> 00:50:06,024
You're a Supreme Court Justice.

800
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:10,278
You just have to stay in your position
righteously and firmly.

801
00:50:11,613 --> 00:50:15,408
In sensitive times like this,
if you call out an old man like me,

802
00:50:15,492 --> 00:50:17,494
who's quietly doing
all the hard work in the back,

803
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:20,705
I'll have to reconsider things.

804
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:23,834
"Did I pick the wrong plate?"

805
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:28,463
My apologies, Dr. Oh.

806
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:42,227
Let's eat.

807
00:50:42,894 --> 00:50:43,812
Yes, sir.

808
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:50,068
He'll be sent to jail.

809
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:52,028
That fellow, Kang Da-wit.

810
00:50:53,738 --> 00:50:54,573
Pardon?

811
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:01,746
COURT

812
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,998
Thank you, Your Honor.

813
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:08,628
During the last hearing,

814
00:51:08,712 --> 00:51:10,672
the defendant's attorney said,

815
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:15,760
"Proof of guilt has to be established
based strictly on objective evidence."

816
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:19,681
"Why are you judging a person's intentions
when they're unverified?"

817
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:21,933
It's unavoidable in this case,

818
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,395
because Mr. Kang was a judge.

819
00:51:27,355 --> 00:51:30,609
You were right. A judge does not have
the authority to direct an investigation.

820
00:51:30,692 --> 00:51:33,653
So, abuse of authority
against a prosecutor wouldn't apply.

821
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:36,239
But a judge's own trial is another story.

822
00:51:36,323 --> 00:51:39,242
If a judge conducts a trial
with some other intention…

823
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:44,164
that is a crime.

824
00:51:50,295 --> 00:51:54,215
One's intention is indeed a crucial factor
in determining abuse of authority.

825
00:51:55,842 --> 00:51:57,469
If a personal motive,

826
00:51:57,552 --> 00:52:01,473
rather than law and ethics,
influenced a judge's trial,

827
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,225
it would be an unforgivable crime.

828
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:06,770
Both parties should focus on this issue.

829
00:52:07,354 --> 00:52:11,608
Can't one's intentions
only be proven by their actions?

830
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:14,861
Mr. Kang issued a sentence
within the scope defined by law.

831
00:52:14,945 --> 00:52:16,821
The higher courts rendered
the same sentence.

832
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:19,324
What did Mr. Kang do wrong?

833
00:52:19,407 --> 00:52:20,492
I'd like to ask that…

834
00:52:22,535 --> 00:52:24,371
to the defendant himself.

835
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:29,042
Prosecutor.

836
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,210
Your Honor,

837
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:33,254
I request to examine the defendant.

838
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:41,972
Okay. Request granted.

839
00:52:52,273 --> 00:52:53,733
COURT IN SESSION

840
00:52:53,817 --> 00:52:55,443
ABUSE OF AUTHORITY
KANG

841
00:52:56,111 --> 00:52:57,070
Mr. Kang.

842
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:01,658
Yes, Ms. Park?

843
00:53:01,741 --> 00:53:04,953
You sentenced Mr. Yoo
to seven years in prison.

844
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:06,287
For an industrial accident,

845
00:53:06,371 --> 00:53:10,583
this kind of severe sentence given
to a business owner was unprecedented.

846
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:11,501
Correct?

847
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,587
Yes, you are correct.

848
00:53:15,797 --> 00:53:18,258
Violating the Occupational Safety
and Health Act…

849
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,470
PUNISHED FOR UP TO 7 YEARS IN PRISON

850
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:24,639
…is not a murder.

851
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:28,476
Do you believe it was just to sentence him
to a penalty as severe as one

852
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,395
for intentional murder?

853
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:35,483
I only issued a sentence within the bounds

854
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:37,485
set by the law.

855
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:39,904
Okay.

856
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,615
"A person who causes death of an employee

857
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:45,076
by violating safety obligations
shall be punished

858
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,788
for up to seven years in prison
or a fine of up to 100 million won."

859
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:50,623
You are right.

860
00:53:51,374 --> 00:53:54,461
But the law provides
a broad range of penalties.

861
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:57,547
The law grants a judge broad discretion

862
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,842
not to exercise their authority at will,

863
00:54:00,925 --> 00:54:03,428
but to choose the most appropriate penalty

864
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:06,014
after thoroughly examining each case.

865
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:07,932
Is this right?

866
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:09,642
Yes, that's right.

867
00:54:10,477 --> 00:54:13,813
Then, why did you impose a penalty

868
00:54:14,856 --> 00:54:16,775
that was as severe as one for murder?

869
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:22,489
Was it because the victim…

870
00:54:25,325 --> 00:54:28,244
was a 17-year-old high school trainee?

871
00:54:30,371 --> 00:54:31,498
It breaks my heart too.

872
00:54:32,582 --> 00:54:35,001
But at its core, it was still an accident.

873
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:38,671
If the sentence varies
based on the victim, isn't that unfair?

874
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:42,967
A fair process is just as important
as the result of a trial.

875
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:44,761
But throughout the trial,

876
00:54:44,844 --> 00:54:46,513
you carried out an evidence investigation

877
00:54:46,596 --> 00:54:49,307
on your own authority
that seemed to target Yoo.

878
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:50,225
Witness.

879
00:54:50,308 --> 00:54:51,810
10 YEARS AGO, SEOUL SOUTHERN DC

880
00:54:51,893 --> 00:54:54,020
The defendant obsessively emphasized

881
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:57,190
cost reduction to you,
the factory manager. Correct?

882
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:05,990
Who are you trying
not to displease right now?

883
00:55:08,076 --> 00:55:10,203
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

884
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:11,371
Answer the question.

885
00:55:11,454 --> 00:55:13,248
Yes, he emphasized it.

886
00:55:13,331 --> 00:55:15,750
The defendant
toured the factory every day,

887
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:18,545
checking all equipment
and inventory. Correct?

888
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:21,506
-Yes, Your Honor.
-He said equipment kept going missing,

889
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:25,802
so he even installed
a security screening area at the doors.

890
00:55:25,885 --> 00:55:26,928
Yes, Your Honor.

891
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:30,306
He hired technical high school students
as trainees, like Oh Min-seok,

892
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,975
to reduce costs. Correct?

893
00:55:34,394 --> 00:55:35,311
Yes, Your Honor.

894
00:55:35,395 --> 00:55:38,106
But that wasn't the only reason--

895
00:55:38,189 --> 00:55:42,152
If you lie in court,
you will be punished for perjury.

896
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:44,279
Your Honor!

897
00:55:44,362 --> 00:55:47,240
That witness examination
was covered in articles

898
00:55:47,323 --> 00:55:50,118
by journalists you invited to the court.

899
00:55:50,201 --> 00:55:53,538
And public criticism
of Yoo Baek-man continued to grow.

900
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:56,332
Correct?

901
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,001
Yes.

902
00:55:58,084 --> 00:56:01,462
In particular, you summoned
the factory manager three times

903
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:03,923
and asked the same question repetitively,

904
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:07,719
as if there was an answer

905
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:09,888
you were looking for.

906
00:56:11,389 --> 00:56:15,059
Why wasn't Oh Min-seok
able to escape the fire?

907
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,187
I told you, Your Honor.

908
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,688
He was unlucky.

909
00:56:21,441 --> 00:56:24,485
Unfortunately, the fire was too intense

910
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:27,780
between his workstation
and the emergency exit,

911
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:29,157
so he couldn't make it through.

912
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,910
Was it due to the lack
of emergency evacuation facilities?

913
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:33,119
No, Your Honor.

914
00:56:33,203 --> 00:56:36,581
We had everything
required by the law installed.

915
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:40,627
The defendant fussed over every sheet
of paper and pressured you to cut costs.

916
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:43,963
With proper facilities,
couldn't the accident have been prevented?

917
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:45,256
Your Honor!

918
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,883
It is not true.

919
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:51,262
It was unavoidable. Doesn't it say so
in the fire inspection report?

920
00:56:51,346 --> 00:56:53,056
Let me ask you again, Witness.

921
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,100
Was there really nothing
you were instructed to do

922
00:56:57,685 --> 00:56:59,229
by the defendant?

923
00:56:59,312 --> 00:57:02,899
You ended the trial
only after getting the answer you wanted.

924
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,777
Then, you sentenced Yoo Baek-man

925
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,821
to the maximum penalty
and put him in custody immediately.

926
00:57:09,447 --> 00:57:13,368
But the statement you finally received
was still abstract.

927
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:17,622
"If only we had enough budget,
we might've been able to fully equip

928
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:20,500
every corner of the factory
with evacuation facilities."

929
00:57:23,378 --> 00:57:24,212
Mr. Kang.

930
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:28,716
I'm sorry,
but I'd like to ask you a question.

931
00:57:30,677 --> 00:57:31,511
Go ahead.

932
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,223
While conducting the trial,
did you ever think about…

933
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,812
your mother's tragic accident?

934
00:57:43,815 --> 00:57:45,316
Excuse me. Your Honor?

935
00:57:45,942 --> 00:57:47,151
Please proceed.

936
00:57:47,777 --> 00:57:50,446
The factory enforced late-night
cutting operations for several days

937
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,616
in their desire to meet
an urgent order quota.

938
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:57,161
I heard your mother momentarily dozed off,

939
00:57:57,245 --> 00:58:00,665
and her hand was accidentally severed
by a cutting machine.

940
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:02,584
Is that true?

941
00:58:04,544 --> 00:58:05,962
Mom, what happened to your hand?

942
00:58:10,466 --> 00:58:11,634
I want to hear

943
00:58:13,636 --> 00:58:15,305
the truth from you.

944
00:58:17,682 --> 00:58:22,437
Wasn't it the desire for revenge
against Yoo Baek-man…

945
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,857
that was on your mind?

946
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:33,656
For some damn pennies?

947
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,699
Damn it!

948
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:41,706
Objection, Your Honor.
That is a leading question.

949
00:58:48,504 --> 00:58:51,090
-Yes, sustained--
-Yes, you're right.

950
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:59,349
Yes, it was my desire for revenge.

951
00:58:59,932 --> 00:59:01,434
That…

952
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:04,354
Yes.

953
00:59:04,937 --> 00:59:07,565
I have never forgotten, even for a moment,

954
00:59:07,649 --> 00:59:09,901
the face of my mother who died tragically,

955
00:59:09,984 --> 00:59:11,778
nor the face of Yoo Baek-man

956
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:14,322
who looked down on my family
and refused to apologize.

957
00:59:14,405 --> 00:59:15,406
Yes.

958
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,450
I wanted to get revenge.

959
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:19,619
I searched for news on him every day.

960
00:59:19,702 --> 00:59:20,787
YOO BAEK-MAN

961
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:28,211
I applied several times to work
in the area where Woongcheon Paper was.

962
00:59:31,923 --> 00:59:35,093
When that case was assigned to me,
I thought it was God's will.

963
00:59:35,176 --> 00:59:36,719
What? You son of a…

964
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:45,019
That's right.

965
00:59:47,939 --> 00:59:49,899
I don't deserve to be a judge.

966
00:59:54,862 --> 00:59:55,863
I am…

967
00:59:57,824 --> 00:59:58,950
guilty.

968
01:00:24,016 --> 01:00:27,645
PRO BONO

969
