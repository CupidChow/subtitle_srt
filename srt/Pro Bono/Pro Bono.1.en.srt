1
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,961
PRO BONO

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,964
Arrest the sexual predator
Jang Hyeon-bae!

3
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,008
-Arrest him!
-Arrest him!

4
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,595
Bring sexual predator
Jang Hyeon-bae to justice!

5
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,930
-Bring him to justice!
-Bring him to justice!

6
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,309
Despite allegations
of massive tax evasion and embezzlement,

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,853
JS Group CEO Jang Hyeon-bae's
arrest warrant was dismissed,

8
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,938
sparking controversy
about preferential treatment.

9
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,566
All eyes will be on Judge Kang Da-wit

10
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,818
as he delivers the verdict today.

11
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,613
Meanwhile, Mr. Jang's legal team

12
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,073
-claims his innocence--
-He's here!

13
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,324
It's Judge Kang Da-wit!

14
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,201
-Here he comes!
-He's here!

15
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,410
ONE HUNDRED YEARS
OF SOLITUDE

16
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,586
Judge Kang,

17
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,714
are you going to rule
on Mr. Jang's case as planned today?

18
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,091
Judge Kang,

19
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,511
Jang's legal team
expressed confidence after recruiting

20
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,304
a former justice of the Supreme Court.

21
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,682
Justice Byeon was the chief judge
when you were first appointed.

22
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,518
Have you been to Tongin Sundae-guk?

23
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,894
Sundae?

24
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,729
I know you like
blood sausage soup, Mr. Kim.

25
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:49,025
Of the four major spots,
I think Tongin tastes the best.

26
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,985
I'll treat you to it sometime. Wait.

27
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,403
Ms. Park likes sundae too, right?

28
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,364
You can come too.

29
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,699
-Pardon?
-Judge Kang…

30
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,826
Give us a few words!

31
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,786
He sure is good at getting away.

32
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,371
What's that in his hand?

33
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,415
One Hundred Years of Solitude.
It's a Nobel Prize-winning novel.

34
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,334
I know it's a novel. But…

35
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,587
On a big day like this,
why did he bring a novel…

36
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,297
"Hundred Years?"

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,967
Is he going to sentence him
to 100 years in prison?

38
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,803
Come on, Do-hun!

39
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,304
-What?
-Ridiculous.

40
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,724
Seoul Central District Court,

41
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,102
the biggest court in Korea,

42
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:28,106
handles 70%
of Seoul's civil and criminal cases.

43
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,023
Hello, sir.

44
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,987
Hey, Judge Kang. I'll see you later.

45
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,246
COURT

46
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,790
This is my castle,

47
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,376
and not just anyone can come in.

48
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,466
The Criminal Division
for Corruption Cases tries

49
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,677
the most powerful people in the country.

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,178
I've made it to this castle

51
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,180
faster than anyone has.

52
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,600
Hello.

53
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,228
Captain! Hello, Judge Kang.

54
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,146
Hello, sir!

55
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,230
EPISODE 1

56
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,857
How is your knee doing?

57
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,067
It's no big deal.
It's just a mild sprain.

58
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,778
Come on. You always say that.

59
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,948
Teolbo's Butcher Shop is nearby.
Make sure to stop by later.

60
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,450
Why?

61
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,745
Why? I've bought some ox knee
and leg bones for you.

62
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,497
Simmer them long and slow
for some nice soup.

63
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,083
Sir.

64
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,044
Just make sure to heal up quickly.

65
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,129
Without our star center back,

66
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,006
our defense has been a mess these days.

67
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,175
It's so wide open,
a truck could drive through it.

68
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,178
I'll keep that in mind, Captain.

69
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,597
Okay!

70
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,643
-And as always…
-I'll lean a bit forward.

71
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,355
Today's work selfie!

72
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,106
127K FOLLOWERS

73
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,484
Good morning, sir.

74
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,736
Did your grandmother get a hospital room?

75
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,530
No, not yet. They're all full.

76
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,742
Mention me to Sejin University Hospital's
chief administrator.

77
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,202
They'll get you a VIP room.

78
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,745
Sir!

79
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,081
You said your grandmother raised you.

80
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,626
She'll get better, so don't worry.
I'll leave him a text right now.

81
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,419
Thank you so much, sir.

82
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,091
Right.

83
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,218
-Don't worry about the fee.
-Sir?

84
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,928
You'll see.

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,265
Thank you!

86
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,267
CHIEF JUDGE
KANG DA-WIT

87
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,978
Come in.

88
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,523
Shall we get going, sir?

89
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,984
Let's go.

90
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,161
Chaebols, or family-run conglomerates,
former presidents,

91
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,997
government ministers,
and assembly members.

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,542
The authorities
who aren't afraid of anything

93
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,793
still tremble with fear

94
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,587
when they lie on an operating table
or stand before the court.

95
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,090
-Justice Byeon.
-Yes, Mr. Jang?

96
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,509
Are you sure everything will be all right?

97
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,469
Don't worry about it, sir.

98
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,221
It's already been settled.

99
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,307
Yes.

100
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,935
This is that kind of place.

101
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,313
All rise.

102
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,648
And I…

103
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,280
am the king…

104
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,949
of this place.

105
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,164
Please be seated.

106
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,126
Your Honor,

107
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:40,006
we've filed a motion
to postpone sentencing.

108
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,508
Yes. I've read through it thoroughly.

109
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,012
You need more time again
to reach an agreement?

110
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,014
Yes. As you already know,

111
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,184
the entire embezzled amount
has been returned to the company.

112
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,977
And the outstanding taxes
have been repaid.

113
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,522
But some parts of the agreement
are still in progress,

114
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,690
so we need more time.

115
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,942
Do those parts in progress involve

116
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,529
the verbal and physical abuse
against his young secretaries…

117
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,534
and the sexual assault
against his housekeepers?

118
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,787
DEFENDANT

119
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,080
Regarding those matters,

120
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,166
they were largely misunderstandings.

121
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,503
But for the greater good,

122
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,089
I've acknowledged them as my shortcomings

123
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,133
and we've agreed to a settlement,
Your Honor.

124
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,802
A settlement?

125
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,512
That's important.

126
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,307
Well then, how much more time do you need?

127
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,393
We're almost done settling
with the employees.

128
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,231
And we have the two housekeepers left,

129
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,108
so if you could grant us three more weeks…

130
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,526
Three weeks?

131
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,693
I mean…

132
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,614
Three weeks? Really?

133
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,241
Will that be enough?

134
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,076
Pardon? Well…

135
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,786
It's only two people.

136
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,497
Gosh, you're so funny as well.

137
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,375
How many victims were there?
Please put it up on the monitor.

138
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,754
The defendant allocated projects
mainly to his family

139
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,424
and pocketed the company's money
to buy a building in Manhattan

140
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,926
and a winery in Napa Valley.

141
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,471
You've been busy
looking for land to purchase.

142
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,473
Meanwhile, 800 employees were laid off

143
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,725
under the pretext of voluntary retirement.

144
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,437
If you count their family members,
that's 2,500.

145
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,354
Your Honor--

146
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,399
After trusting numbers fabricated
by fraudulent accounting

147
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,234
and investing in the company,

148
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,279
small retail investors
saw their lives ruined

149
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,322
as stock prices plummeted,

150
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,909
and their number alone makes up 24,000!

151
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,995
-Your Honor.
-Please sit down.

152
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,330
I'm not done yet.

153
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,460
After evading
tens of billions of won in tax,

154
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,880
you've dragged this trial on
with all sorts of lobbying

155
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,799
and haven't coughed up
even a penny in tax for five years

156
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,178
while there are tens of millions
of salary workers out there

157
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,222
being levied income tax every month!

158
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,515
If that wasn't enough,

159
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,019
you've verbally and physically abused
your employees habitually.

160
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,979
And you sexually assaulted
your housekeepers

161
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,607
who are trying to make ends meet
and raise their children.

162
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,359
After watching this on the news every day,

163
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,819
the number of Korean citizens

164
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:11,657
who are enraged and hate living here
makes up 50 million!

165
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,342
How are you going
to settle the compensation

166
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,969
for all of their mental suffering?

167
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,475
Three weeks? Will that really be enough?

168
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,482
The Court dismisses the defendant's motion
to postpone sentencing.

169
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,153
The Court hereby renders
the following judgment.

170
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:54,242
The defendant is sentenced
to ten years in prison

171
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,453
and a fine of 70 billion won.

172
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,671
Order in the court.

173
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,130
Due to a risk of flight,

174
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,716
the defendant will hereby
be taken into custody.

175
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,344
Shall the Court
notify your spouse about this?

176
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,345
Right.

177
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,181
Which one should we notify?

178
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,183
Your legal spouse? Or…

179
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,894
the one you live with?

180
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,897
Well…

181
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,276
Anyone will do.

182
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,986
All right, then.

183
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,697
Please take him away.

184
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,948
You bastard!

185
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:34,991
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,075
I'm sorry, sir.

187
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,914
Do you think I'll take this lying down?

188
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,884
The first anti-corruption judge
with only a high school degree,

189
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,470
Chief Judge Kang Da-wit
of the Seoul Central District Court,

190
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,639
-levied a harsher sentence…
-Over 310,000.

191
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,434
than anyone anticipated
on JS Group CEO Jang Hyeon-bae

192
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,103
and has instantly become
the people's judge.

193
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,064
The book he was holding
on his way to court,

194
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,649
One Hundred Years of Solitude,

195
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,903
has raised a lot of speculation
regarding its significance.

196
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,489
But the meaning
might be in the title itself.

197
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,285
It symbolizes his solitary resolve
to stick to his principles

198
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,204
and deliver a sentence without giving in
to any external pressure.

199
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,373
That is the prevailing view.

200
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,543
Meanwhile, the victims
that have long suffered…

201
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,341
I'm your entertainer

202
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,969
-I'm your…
-I'm your…

203
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,096
People's judge!

204
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,274
Sir.

205
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,904
Who's playing such loud music
in the courthouse?

206
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,447
Yes, Ms. Yoon?

207
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,199
How did it go with your grandmother?

208
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,911
We got her a hospital room.

209
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,288
-Good.
-It's all thanks to you, sir.

210
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,123
Thank you so much.

211
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,333
Gosh, no need to thank me.

212
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,586
Who's going to help
the members of my team if I don't?

213
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,134
-Also, sir…
-Yes?

214
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,969
You were awesome today!

215
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,680
Court employees
from all over the country called me,

216
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,475
and they went on and on
about how cool you were!

217
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,645
Geez, it was just another case.

218
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:32,358
A judge just does his job quietly
according to law and principle.

219
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,901
What's so special about that?

220
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,529
Come on.

221
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,491
Your modesty makes you even cooler.

222
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,369
-Sir.
-Yes?

223
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,745
Actually, I'm a member

224
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,747
of Seoul's Justice Nomination Committee

225
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,041
in the Court Employees' Union.

226
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,002
Really? My goodness.

227
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,297
I had absolutely no idea.
That's so surprising.

228
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,842
I'm going to vote
to nominate you as our candidate

229
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,760
-for Supreme Court Justice.
-Gosh.

230
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,721
Everyone says you'll help
the younger generation be heard

231
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,724
and improve the working environment
at the Supreme Court.

232
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,519
Even your good looks
would be a benefit to employees!

233
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,646
Goodness, I'm still too young.

234
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,690
And I lack the competence and experience.

235
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,860
It's not like I work as a judge
just to be successful either.

236
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,237
Well, I knew you'd turn it down

237
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,448
since you are so modest.

238
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,408
Do you need my resident registration?

239
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,869
You'll need to attach it
to the letter of recommendation.

240
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,537
What's this?

241
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,539
I happened to have a copy of it.

242
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,957
Okay.

243
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,960
I'll submit it. Thank you.

244
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,920
Have a good day.

245
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,510
That was the first step.

246
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,430
Anyone can recommend
a Supreme Court Justice candidate.

247
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,640
After a screening process,

248
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:51,020
the committee nominates three times
as many people to the Chief Justice.

249
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,523
The Chief Justice chooses one among them
and recommends them to the President.

250
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,818
Step one is to get nominated
by the Court Employees' Union.

251
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,320
Not bad.

252
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,491
I've worked my way up from the bottom,
which makes for a good story.

253
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,870
During a presidential election
in the past,

254
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,206
some believed a candidate
in their forties was needed.

255
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,334
I think it's about time for the court

256
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:18,714
to have a young and bright justice
instead of an elderly one.

257
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,425
He's from outside of Seoul
and only has a high school diploma.

258
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,677
He understands the common people.

259
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,973
If we don't support someone like him,
who else would we support, my friends?

260
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,391
-Right.
-Yeah.

261
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,601
By the way, sir.

262
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,104
Something's been simmering
back there for a while now.

263
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,189
You're right.

264
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,442
It smells good.
What have you been cooking?

265
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,569
This? It's nothing.

266
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,988
It's ox knee and leg bone soup.

267
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,115
I have a pretty bad knee.

268
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,954
What an honor!

269
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,456
I get to pour a drink

270
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,749
for the people's judge.

271
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,875
My goodness.

272
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,003
Please forgive me, sir.

273
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,338
SENIOR CHIEF JUDGE, CRIMINAL

274
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,550
-My apologies for causing trouble.
-Come on, don't say that.

275
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,344
You can't be sorry
if the court panel ruled

276
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,638
based on its own conviction.

277
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,850
Some might mistake us
for interfering with the trial.

278
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,103
-Judge Kang.
-Yes, sir?

279
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,980
I thought you were
easy-going and sensible.

280
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,398
SENIOR CHIEF JUDGE, CIVIL AFFAIRS

281
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,942
But I guess you had
lots of pent-up things inside.

282
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,318
Not at all, sir.

283
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,820
Stop. It was because he's young.

284
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,114
SHIN JUNG-SEOK
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT CHIEF

285
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,700
A young judge
should be passionate like him.

286
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,452
Also, it was only the first hearing.

287
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,163
It'll go to the appellate court.

288
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,960
The business world is going nuts
because the media made such a fuss.

289
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,754
I'm worried about
how the Blue House will respond.

290
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:45,134
Mr. Shin, this is why I said
the Division for Corruption Cases

291
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,386
should be handled by someone we can trust

292
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,971
from National Court Administration.

293
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,058
Even though the recent trend
is to break hierarchies--

294
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,518
Then, are you saying…

295
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,146
I appointed the wrong person?

296
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,774
My apologies.

297
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,860
No, I didn't mean that.

298
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,737
No, sir!

299
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,489
It's my fault.
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

300
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,325
Everyone, I apologize!

301
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,951
Please tell me.

302
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,872
They're the most elite aristocrats
in the legal world.

303
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,332
-No, sir.
-What do you mean "No"?

304
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,083
But since they're only bookworms,

305
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,629
they don't understand
that politics is a living organism.

306
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,465
It's tough serving the country, isn't it?

307
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,800
These are herbal tonics. Take them.

308
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,596
Serving the country?
I'm a mere aide to a National Assemblyman.

309
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,766
Your boss is a political big shot though.

310
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,725
It must be tough.

311
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,314
It's been so rough these days.

312
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,109
Incidents keep happening,
so the approval rating has cratered.

313
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,446
We need something
to change the atmosphere.

314
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,992
In any administration,
when the approval rating drops,

315
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,162
they try to turn things around
by cracking down on chaebols.

316
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,665
The whole country hates
Chairman Jang Hyeon-bae

317
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,209
for habitually beating his staff.

318
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,587
So what if the young judge
who got rid of Chairman Jang

319
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,255
is also a justice candidate?

320
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,883
He'd be a good card to play.

321
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,178
A shocking appointment
who understands the minds of the youth.

322
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,515
Judge Kang, what are you waiting for?
Hurry up and do it.

323
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,849
Yes, sir.

324
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,935
I am at your service.

325
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,021
I pledge my loyalty!

326
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,275
That's what I'm talking about.

327
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,821
Yes!

328
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,407
You normally behave so well.

329
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,118
Why did you suddenly go overboard?

330
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,995
Hey, stop it already.

331
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:36,954
Judge Kang is…

332
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,332
Is your forehead all right?

333
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,336
Gochujang!

334
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,381
It's red chili paste.

335
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,466
To dip snacks in.

336
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,301
It's salty.

337
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,761
Geez, this guy!

338
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,056
You're not like other judges.

339
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,267
You're young, yet you try so hard.

340
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,978
But don't try too hard.

341
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,522
It's a bit uncomfortable

342
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,191
when someone is too tenacious.

343
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,860
-Come on.
-I'm kidding!

344
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,445
Yes, sir.

345
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,738
Let's drink to that.

346
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,864
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

347
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,282
Cheers.

348
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,995
"Don't try too hard"?

349
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,538
How ridiculous.

350
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,624
Those who have worked as hard as I have
can look down on me.

351
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,002
But you guys can't.

352
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,713
Never.

353
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,385
It's Judge Kang!

354
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,765
Judge Kang!

355
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,851
-Sir, a few words!
-Please give us a few words!

356
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,938
Judge Kang, give us a few words.
Was there external pressure?

357
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,778
Sir, what do you think of your nickname,
"The People's Judge"?

358
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,154
Right.

359
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,989
I'm sorry. As you can see,

360
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,991
I have so many cases to catch up on.

361
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,951
Hello, Ms. Park.

362
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,250
Sorry!

363
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,760
-Kang Da-wit, the people's judge.
-Geez.

364
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,053
Mr. Kim.

365
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,889
They say you'll be
the next justice candidate.

366
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,391
Come on. I'm still too young.

367
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,559
Right?

368
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,187
A justice in his forties
is a bit irrational--

369
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,981
Emmanuel Macron,
President of France, age 39.

370
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,067
Rishi Sunak,
Prime Minister of England, age 42.

371
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,194
Former Korean Justice Go Jae-ho, age 41.

372
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,781
These are the ages
of when they were appointed.

373
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:40,285
Kang Da-wit, born in 1981.

374
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,626
You're well-prepared, Judge Kang.

375
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,587
Good morning.

376
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,713
Good morning, sir.

377
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,221
Why do you keep carrying around
old documents we're going to shred?

378
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,806
What?

379
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,350
To work out.

380
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,006
For goodness' sake!

381
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,300
Seriously? Damn it.

382
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,634
Geez.

383
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,971
NOMINATE A FUTURE JUSTICE

384
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,099
Oh, dear! What are we going to do?

385
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,227
It must have taken so long
to get these ready.

386
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,604
Are you all right?

387
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,522
Yes. Thank you.

388
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,733
Goodness. You must be new.

389
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,902
Your senior colleagues
make you copy a lot of stuff?

390
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,862
What? No, that's not it.

391
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,947
I know. You don't have to explain.

392
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,450
Goodness, there's a lot.

393
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,410
You can't copy all these alone.

394
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,455
-Gosh.
-No, it's okay!

395
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,664
I'll do it.

396
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,374
-I feel so bad.
-Don't be.

397
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,543
Your job is my job.

398
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,129
We're all one big family here,
aren't we?

399
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:15,923
"Family"?

400
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,468
Yes. Sure.

401
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,386
Thank you.

402
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,728
I'm sorry, but by any chance,

403
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,939
could you take these papers down for me?

404
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,484
Papers?

405
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,862
They weren't kidding
about Gen Z being something else.

406
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,157
A bottom-tier newbie
asking a chief judge for papers?

407
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,826
Once I become a justice, I'm going to--

408
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,119
Of course, I can!

409
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,996
All right. So…

410
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,624
It's hard to take them down at first.

411
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,251
You could hurt your back too.

412
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,299
That badge. Are you an attorney?

413
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,051
Yes.

414
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,637
Come on.

415
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,473
You should've told me that right away.

416
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,770
I thought you were a court employee here

417
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,397
who had a vote.

418
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,523
Sorry?

419
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,066
A vote?

420
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,526
What are you talking about?

421
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,194
They should have sent an employee.

422
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,031
Why is an attorney making copies here?
How confusing.

423
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,244
I can't believe that old man.

424
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,000
-"Old man"?
-Yes. You're not an old lady, are you?

425
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,334
-What?
-What?

426
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,544
-You--
-What?

427
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:38,839
Yes.

428
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,842
I'm a public interest attorney
without any assistants,

429
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,512
so I do everything myself.

430
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,805
Was asking you

431
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,517
to take down those papers for me
that much of a terrible thing to do?

432
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,352
What did you say?

433
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,146
You said you're an attorney.

434
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,982
Don't you know who you're talking to?

435
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,027
Why do I have to know who you are?

436
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,739
Don't you own a TV or watch the news?

437
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,658
You must have no interest
in what goes on in the world.

438
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,330
-This old man must be a narcissist.
-What?

439
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,749
You can go back on your way.

440
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,126
Are you that important?

441
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,836
I can't believe her. Yes.

442
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,379
-I am a big deal--
-Judge Kang.

443
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,589
Have you eaten yet?

444
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,258
Okay. I think we're good now.

445
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,219
This machine's old,

446
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,098
so sometimes, you have to
give it a smack for it to work.

447
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,267
Goodbye, then.

448
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,020
-Did you go to Tongin Sundae-guk?
-We did.

449
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,105
He's so sweet.

450
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,321
A public interest attorney, my foot.

451
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,948
Her job doesn't even make money,
so why is she so arrogant?

452
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,742
Who knows if she can even afford a living?

453
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,347
TEXT MESSAGE

454
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,191
The Court Employees' Union
has nominated you

455
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,235
as their justice candidate.

456
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,460
Hello, sir.

457
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,088
We heard you were nominated
as a justice candidate.

458
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,257
Are you going to accept
the screening process?

459
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,384
-Well…
-Sir, could we have a quick interview?

460
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,552
How do you feel?

461
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,553
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

462
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,971
Do you like chocolates?

463
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,889
Sorry? Why do you suddenly ask?

464
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,977
There's a famous quote
from a movie I like, Forrest Gump.

465
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,312
"My momma always said…"

466
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,028
Right. But what does that mean?

467
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,283
I don't know either.

468
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,450
What does that mean?

469
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,412
-Sorry?
-Gosh, what a difficult line.

470
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,582
Sir, so are you consenting
to the screening process?

471
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,918
-Please tell us.
-Are you consenting?

472
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,837
What was that?

473
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,966
Why did he speak
in bad English like a politician?

474
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,427
Maybe he meant, "Nobody knows the future"?

475
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,347
"Get…" He must have gotten it.

476
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,519
He must have the spot.
He must've agreed to the process.

477
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,437
I see.

478
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,593
I'm almost there, Mom.

479
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,703
Da-wit!

480
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,331
Mom!

481
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,917
Mom, was working
at the factory tough today?

482
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,044
Nope, it wasn't.

483
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,547
-How's your lower back?
-It's fine.

484
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,548
Here.

485
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,343
It's a gift.

486
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,014
Gosh, this…

487
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,558
It's my favorite gift.

488
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,358
It's so sour.

489
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,946
Why do you like it so much
when it's so sour?

490
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,325
Life can be pretty sour and bitter

491
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,495
instead of being sweet.

492
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,957
You'll understand once you grow up.

493
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,085
What should we make for dinner?

494
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,004
-I don't know.
-What do you want?

495
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,298
-Spicy stir-fried pork.
-Really?

496
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,382
-Yeah.
-Okay.

497
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,635
LATE SUMMER OF 1998

498
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,390
-Have a good day.
-Hello.

499
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,309
Gosh, Da-wit's here.

500
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,144
Dorm life is tough, isn't it?

501
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,272
Studying's not so bad.
Mom has it tougher.

502
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,152
-Do you have any apricots?
-Apricots?

503
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,696
The season for them is in June.
It's too late now.

504
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,906
Persimmons are sweet and tasty these days.

505
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,244
But I want apricots instead.
I want the sour ones, not the sweet ones.

506
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,788
Mom, I'm home.

507
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,543
Mom?

508
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,379
Mom?

509
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,220
Mom?

510
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,515
Mom.

511
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:23,975
Mom!

512
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,352
Mom!

513
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,771
Mom, look at me.

514
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,147
Mom, what's wrong?

515
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,607
Mom!

516
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,152
Mom!

517
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,668
Man, it's sweet.

518
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,463
These expensive department store apricots…

519
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,050
aren't sour or bitter, Mom.

520
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:02,931
They're sweet.

521
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:04,974
Very sweet.

522
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,771
COURT

523
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,730
Good morning!

524
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,691
Sir, have you agreed
to the screening process?

525
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,568
It's an honor just to be nominated,

526
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,736
but I have no ambitions.

527
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,364
What? Please have some!

528
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,283
Everything's great about you,
but your lack of ambition's a flaw.

529
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,327
At the Supreme Court,

530
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,789
I won't get to work with you anymore.
That's sad.

531
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,207
You can take me with you.

532
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,835
Please promote me
to be a justice's secretary.

533
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,297
Ms. Yoon.
You're ambitious. That's charming.

534
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,424
I believe in you, sir.

535
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:41,511
Right. Your classmate
from elementary school called.

536
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,724
"Kim Ju-seop"? Who's that?

537
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,309
He said "Juvenile" would ring a bell.

538
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,396
Juvenile? Kim… Juvenile?

539
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,108
Right. Kim Juvenile.

540
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,943
Why did that prick…

541
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,739
What did he suddenly call?

542
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,283
Last time I saw him
was in elementary school.

543
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,412
What?

544
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,416
Hey, Juvenile!
Running an orchard must be tough.

545
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,544
Look how tanned you are.

546
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,380
Hey, when I was young,

547
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,509
I thought your family
was the richest in the world.

548
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,721
Come on. My orchard isn't even that big.

549
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,432
-You're the amazing one.
-Come on.

550
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,059
Hey, let's cut the chitchat.

551
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,898
-Just sign 100 autographs for me.
-Gosh, will you stop?

552
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,859
I'm here to get your autograph
on behalf of our hometown.

553
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,446
Who signs an autograph for a friend?
Come on. It's embarrassing.

554
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,365
-Stop complaining and do it.
-No.

555
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,075
No?

556
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,830
For autographs,
this brush pen works the best.

557
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,502
You carry around brush pens too?

558
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,132
-Da-wit.
-Yeah?

559
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,133
THE PEOPLE'S JUDGE

560
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,636
You really are something else.

561
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,430
You had such a hard life
growing up in the countryside.

562
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,140
Now, you've become so successful.

563
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,935
-I don't know my place, do I?
-What?

564
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,437
Come on. Don't be ridiculous!

565
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,772
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

566
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,940
Forget it.

567
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,525
-Anyways…
-Yeah.

568
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,403
Do you remember Ji-min?

569
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,321
Ji-min?

570
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,699
Do you mean Bang Ji-min?

571
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,785
Yeah, your first love.

572
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,662
Get out of here, you punk.

573
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,455
She had a crush on me, but I didn't.

574
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,958
-No, I wasn't into her.
-Is that so?

575
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:39,337
You begged me to lend you 30,000 won
to buy her a birthday gift,

576
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,923
and you still haven't paid me back.

577
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,467
Gosh, I did?

578
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,972
-What? You want it now?
-No, forget it!

579
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,684
No, I want to send my friend off first.

580
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,477
No, my designated driver is almost here.

581
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,687
-Go on ahead.
-No, you go.

582
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,105
-Go.
-You go first.

583
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,859
-Hey, you go first.
-I told you to go first, you punk.

584
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,069
Hey, what's that?

585
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,320
-What?
-My goodness!

586
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,613
Hey!

587
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,282
Okay.

588
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,324
Geez.

589
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,494
Keep in touch.

590
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,997
Yeah, let's keep in touch
from now on. Okay?

591
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,667
Don't ignore your old friends
just because you're successful now.

592
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,794
All right, already.

593
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,754
Yeah. The people's judge!

594
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,672
Good luck!

595
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:26,467
Gosh, you're so juvenile. Geez.

596
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,386
-I'll get going.
-All right.

597
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,637
See you later.

598
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,642
Sir, please drive safely.

599
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,284
COURT

600
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,876
Geez, Mr. Kim.

601
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,211
Why are you out here so early?

602
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,838
Judge Kang,

603
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,299
it's about your sentencing last week

604
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,259
of Jungbu Pharmaceuticals' Chairman Yoo.

605
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,969
-Could you say--
-I have nothing to say.

606
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,890
A judge only speaks through his rulings.

607
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,684
Just answer one question for us.

608
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,895
Right now, you're doing more interviews

609
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,271
than anyone else in Korea.

610
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,023
What is this?

611
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,067
What? Is there something in your trunk?

612
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,194
-Right!
-What?

613
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,487
My underwear!

614
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,907
I forgot to wash my underwear
after playing soccer this morning.

615
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,326
-Where's the--
-No, it stinks!

616
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,912
It stinks so bad…

617
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,457
It smells like a dead body.
I should run to the laundromat!

618
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,794
I'm going to the laundromat.
I better go.

619
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,004
-The laundromat--
-I need to go to the laundromat!

620
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,007
Please say something about the case.

621
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,760
It can be short! Come on!

622
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,390
He can be pretty strange sometimes.

623
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,684
Why is he going to the laundromat?

624
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,192
Was I mistaken?

625
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,403
No, this can't be true.

626
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,781
Is this a habit from work?
I can guess the amount from the box size.

627
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,783
When filled with new 50,000-won bills,

628
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,118
a briefcase is 300 million.

629
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,787
A ramyeon box is 600 million.
An apple box is 1.2 billion.

630
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,289
No, it can't be…

631
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,291
Get a hold of yourself.

632
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,133
At this crucial moment,
when I'm about to become a justice,

633
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:33,094
there's 1.2 billion won
in cash in my trunk?

634
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,015
There's no way.

635
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,058
No way.

636
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,834
Kang Da-wit.

637
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:06,919
Who's that?

638
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,048
You…

639
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,924
are fucked.

640
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,721
No!

641
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,894
Why isn't he picking up?

642
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,355
Think. Come on, think.

643
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,649
They say clear minds
can help you survive even a bear.

644
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,194
Or was it a tiger?

645
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,404
No, that's not what's important right now.

646
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,365
Hey, people's judge.

647
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,409
I'm on my way back home now.

648
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,496
Okay, at a time like this,

649
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,706
I should check the facts first.

650
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,628
Did you get back safely last night?

651
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,924
Come on. You think this hillbilly
couldn't find his hotel?

652
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,760
I was worried about you, dude.

653
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,261
By the way,

654
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,389
did you leave something in my car?

655
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,267
What? What are you talking about?

656
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,561
You and I left at the same time
after drinking.

657
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,230
Right.

658
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,107
Right? I know that.

659
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,859
Hey, don't get me wrong,

660
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,822
but you didn't have a favor to ask of me

661
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,116
or anything like that, right?

662
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,326
A favor?

663
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,037
Of course, I have one.

664
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,122
What is it?

665
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,582
Well…

666
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,084
Another 100 autographs.

667
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,878
I'll use them to brag.

668
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,880
"I'm Judge Kang's best friend."

669
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,133
"I'm a big deal."

670
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,762
Right. My autographs.

671
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,683
Well, sure. That's no problem at all.

672
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,103
Okay, then. Get home safe.
I'll see you next time.

673
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,231
Right.

674
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,358
As if he would've had 1.2 billion won.

675
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,157
The designated driver also said
nothing happened.

676
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,325
The barbecue place's parking lot
doesn't have CCTV.

677
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,203
My car was parked here.

678
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,204
Then…

679
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,665
It's facing this way.

680
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,338
I should call the police
and have them investigate…

681
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,049
But…

682
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:22,305
An apple box filled with 1.2 billion won
in the car of an anti-corruption judge.

683
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,392
That doesn't look good at all.

684
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,397
It'll look like I've changed my mind
out of fear after accepting the money.

685
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,777
The crime of bribery is established
the moment you accept it.

686
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,989
But if it's a bribe,
there has to be someone who gave it!

687
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,450
The money came first with nobody around…

688
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,288
That means it wasn't a bribe.
It was a trap.

689
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,374
It's bait.

690
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,793
Bait to reel me.

691
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,671
Is that true?

692
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,423
Yes, sir.

693
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:01,219
Nobody gave all that money,
but it was in a judge's car?

694
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,762
Who's going to buy that?

695
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,223
Still, I think I should tell
the police first.

696
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,476
Their chief respects you so much.

697
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,144
No.

698
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,312
Right now, Chief Park

699
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,398
is desperate to become
commissioner general.

700
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:19,028
Cracking down on judges and prosecutors
is their biggest deal. Why?

701
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,571
Because it'll be on the news.

702
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,950
You're saying they'll make
a bigger deal out of it?

703
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,496
This isn't just about you.

704
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,040
You're famous across the country
as the people's judge.

705
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,875
If this news spreads, it'll affect you,

706
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,669
it'll affect me for appointing you…

707
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,628
You're right.

708
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,047
It'd be trouble for you too,

709
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,550
especially during this sensitive period
before a justice appointment.

710
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,097
Damn it.

711
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:52,019
Is there any way
to deal with this quietly?

712
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,356
Sir, this is bait

713
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,150
intended to trap us.

714
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,821
At a time like this,
instead of hiding in fear,

715
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,447
we have to strike back.

716
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,573
Strike back?

717
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,248
This message was in the box.

718
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,166
Let's do what they want.

719
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,295
"Use it for a good cause."

720
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,505
Yes. Since that's what they wrote,

721
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,798
let's do that.

722
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,717
What can they do?

723
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,885
"No, it was actually a bribe."

724
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,346
"I secretly put it
in Kang Da-wit's car trunk to screw him."

725
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,641
Will they be able to say that?

726
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,356
Will it really be okay?

727
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,945
A HUGE ANONYMOUS DONATION
TO SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

728
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,989
It's just right.

729
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,450
A moving story that's not too big.

730
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,454
And Mr. Shin was able to
promote himself in the meantime.

731
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,621
USE IT FOR A GOOD CAUSE

732
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:01,130
Okay. What are you going to do now,
you coward?

733
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,718
You accidentally donated 1.2 billion won
while trying to screw me.

734
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,803
I bet you'll go to heaven, you prick!

735
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,056
Good for you, moron!

736
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,435
Sir, Mr. Shin needs to see you right now.

737
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,561
What?

738
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,695
Did you see the article, sir?

739
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,489
What's your intent, you bastard?

740
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,657
Sorry? What do you mean, sir?

741
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,960
Mr. Shin.

742
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,754
I trusted and guided you

743
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,215
when you were a nobody
without a college degree.

744
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,676
How could you betray me like this,
you snake?

745
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,971
Sir, what on earth are you talking about?

746
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,191
Go ahead.

747
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,444
This is…

748
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,117
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

749
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,535
Hey.

750
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,959
It's so heavy.

751
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,882
Thanks.

752
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,260
I hope you enjoy.

753
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,894
That's not…

754
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,229
That's not me.

755
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,314
I never did that.

756
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,566
This is fake.

757
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,609
Some lunatic is using an altered video

758
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,153
-to mess with--
-You bastard!

759
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,155
I can't believe how brazen you are.

760
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,323
You're still trying to con me
after seeing that?

761
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,324
What's your intent?

762
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,119
Why did you drag me into this
after taking that bribe?

763
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,912
Why?

764
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,206
"An anonymous benefactor?"
"Use it for a good cause?"

765
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,875
You son of a…

766
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,335
You purposely did this
to screw me, didn't you?

767
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,379
Okay. I'll try to understand.

768
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,964
Just tell me why.

769
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,757
-What was your intent?
-No, sir!

770
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,927
This guy is Kim Ju-seop,
and he owns a countryside orchard.

771
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,220
What? Kim Ju-seop?

772
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,014
-A countryside orchard?
-Yes!

773
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,307
Don't you know who he is?

774
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,814
He's my friend from elementary school.

775
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,153
That bastard…

776
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,949
is Yoo Jae-beom, who I tried
for being a serial con artist.

777
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:38,245
He's wanted right now for committing fraud
and fleeing after his release!

778
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:46,921
There's no way.

779
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:53,511
CRIMINAL AND INVESTIGATION RECORDS CHECK

780
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,512
ARREST WARRANT

781
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,600
This can't be right.

782
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,651
This can't…

783
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,534
There's no way.

784
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,624
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

785
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,960
KIM JUVENILE

786
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,002
No way.

787
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,089
-The number you have dialed…
-No!

788
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,131
No.

789
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,550
-The number you have dialed…
-No.

790
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,302
-No.
-…is not in service.

791
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,433
Damn it.

792
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,606
BAE JEONG-HWAN, CLASSMATE

793
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,365
Hey, Jeong-hwan.
It's me, Da-wit. It's been a while.

794
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,283
Hey, Da-wit.

795
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,159
What's with the sudden call?
It's been years.

796
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,203
Sorry to call so suddenly like this,

797
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,080
but I'm in a bit of a hurry.

798
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:07,418
Do you remember Kim Ju-seop
from our elementary school?

799
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,296
I was wondering if you knew his number.

800
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,463
Kim Ju-seop?

801
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,758
Well, I saw him recently,

802
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,719
but I don't have his number.

803
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,555
Are you talking about Juvenile?

804
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,598
Yes, Kim Juvenile!

805
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:21,932
Yeah, that's right.

806
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,019
What are you talking about, man?
He died ten years ago.

807
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,230
What?

808
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:32,776
He passed away at a young age
from a brain aneurysm.

809
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,153
It ran in his family.

810
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,990
But what do you mean you saw him recently?

811
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,164
Actually…

812
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,917
I must have been mistaken.
Sorry to bother you.

813
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,253
I'll call you next time.

814
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,548

818
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,348
To me,

819
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,975
life hasn't been
a box of sweet chocolates.

820
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,645
It's been a box of poisonous apples,

821
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,566
no matter how hard I tried.

822
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,156
You think I'm Snow White or something?

823
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,910
Did you think I'd die
after eating those poisonous apple?

824
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,290
Do you know
what I went through to get here?

825
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,753
Geez, how much is that?

826
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,006
Hey. I was right, wasn't I?

827
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,341
It's a deepfake.

828
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,551
I never did that. I remember clearly.

829
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,011
-Judge Kang.
-Yeah?

830
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,182
Current deepfake technology
can't look this natural yet.

831
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,435
How did they fake this?
Why does it look so real?

832
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,020
I'm really sorry,

833
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,692
but I looked at it frame by frame.

834
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:59,530
I also checked the sources,
but this video is real.

835
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,993
Then, they must have hired someone
who looks just like me--

836
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,161
Sir.

837
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,087
You don't have a twin brother, do you? No.

838
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,714
Be honest.

839
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,508
Did you take the money or not?

840
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,303
Stop snapping.

841
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,558
This is driving me crazy.

842
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,685
Did I really lose my mind?

843
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,228
If this wasn't altered,

844
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,813
you're saying that really is me?

845
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,358
That's really me?

846
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,321
COURT

847
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,872
Please give me some time, sir.

848
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,999
I'll pull all the strings I have

849
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,792
and get to the bottom of--

850
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,210
Make a choice.

851
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,714
Sir? What choice?

852
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,926
Are you going to quietly quit
before word gets out?

853
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,762
Or will you face a police investigation
for taking a big bribe

854
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,140
from a serial con artist?

855
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,975
No!

856
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,227
This was a trap!

857
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,522
-It wasn't me! No!
-The people's judge!

858
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,691
I trusted you so much!

859
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,818
No, I didn't do it!

860
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,452
Sir.

861
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:31,997
It seems I have your answer.

862
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,666
Submit your resignation letter
right away.

863
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,669
By the way, even if you quit,

864
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:42,132
you won't be able to open
a law office for a while.

865
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,260
What do you mean?

866
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,514
Dr. Oh Gyu-jang
pulled some strings,

867
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,432
so we were just able
to quietly cover this up.

868
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,768
But as the chair
of the bar association,

869
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,313
he can't allow a corrupt judge like you…

870
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,941
to become an attorney.

871
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,072
A corrupt judge? Sir, I'm so--

872
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,036
After personally receiving that bribe,

873
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,996
you're still being this shameless?

874
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,709
You should thank me for letting you quit

875
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,337
without telling anyone.

876
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,757
Whether you be a law firm office manager
in the country or do manual labor,

877
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,218
just live quietly.

878
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,637
And don't come anywhere near us
in Seocho-dong.

One step.

882
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,202
It was only the first step.

883
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,123
I was so close.

884
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,002
Da-wit.

885
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,921
Just promise me…

886
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,632
two things.

887
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,342
Cremate me

888
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,637
and spread my ash over a river…

889
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,850
so that you won't have to

890
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,729
come to see me every year.

891
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,689
Okay?

892
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:24,985
Mom.

893
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,571
Don't look back.

894
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,116
Keep moving forward.

895
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,452
Just keep moving forward…

896
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,496
without stopping.

897
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,085
You must…

898
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,838
become successful.

899
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,635
You have to succeed

900
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,387
so people won't look down on you.

901
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,976
Go as far…

902
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,562
as you can,

903
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,230
my son.

904
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,400
Got it?

905
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,737
Mom.

906
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,454
Mom.

907
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,144
Hello?

908
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,521
It's me.

909
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,857
Who is this?

910
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:50,028
Unbelievable. Da-wit, it's me.

911
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:51,905
Don't you remember me?

912
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,448
Oh Jung-in?

913
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,372
Da-wit.

914
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,462
You remembered my voice after all.

915
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,050
How could I forget?

916
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,678
It's your voice.

917
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,681
You haven't changed a bit.

918
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,392
You're still so cringe.

919
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,602
You haven't changed either.

920
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,563
You talk casually to me
whenever you please.

921
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,191
What's the occasion?

922
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,110
We haven't been in touch
since our training.

923
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,111
Never mind that.

924
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,030
Come join my law firm.

925
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,827
Your firm? Oh & Partners?

926
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,665
I heard all about what happened to you.

927
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,127
What do you mean?

928
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,714
Don't ask me how I found out.

929
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,347
Jung-in, I--

930
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,724
The attorney registration?

931
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,019
Don't worry. I've already persuaded Dad.

932
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,605
You persuaded Dr. Oh?

933
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,148
Yeah.

934
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,194
Why? Why would you
go through all the hassle…

935
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,153
To help you?

936
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:15,697
No.

937
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,619
I want you to help me.

938
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,128
COURT

939
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,963
CHIEF JUDGE KANG DA-WIT

940
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,965
CRIMINAL DIVISION, CORRUPTION
CHIEF JUDGES' ROOM

941
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,260
You can't do this, sir.

942
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,514
You didn't even give us a heads up.

943
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,682
I'm sorry.

944
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,643
It wasn't a choice
I could consult with others.

945
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,645
Sir, what's going on?

946
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,272
It's not hiring season,
so why are you resigning?

947
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,067
The justice position
was right in front of you. So why…

948
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,321
I'm pretty exhausted.

949
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,574
I'll get some rest
and talk to you about it later.

950
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,369
Sir.

951
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,248
Don't worry. I'll be back.

952
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,294
No matter what.

953
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,814
Founded by Dr. Oh Gyu-jang,
the giant who controls

954
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,357
the legal world from the shadows,

955
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:37,779
Oh & Partners is Korea's top law firm
with its finest attorneys.

956
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,537
Yes. It's a place that suits me perfectly.

957
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,876
Using this as a stepping stone,
I will go back

958
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,420
to the place I belong.

959
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,720
Jung-in?

960
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,430
Welcome.

961
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,808
It's pretty bright in here.

962
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,101
Hold on.

963
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:13,940
But you know what?

964
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,401
This place is pretty nice.

965
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:20,572
The managing partner's office
in Korea's top law firm.

966
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,824
It's spacious, isn't it?

967
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,702
But doesn't it feel a bit empty?

968
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:30,707
No. The empty space
is supposed to help with your creativity.

969
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:31,750
Really?

970
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,295
By the way, the windows
must be facing southeast.

971
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,880
They get plenty of sun.

972
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,507
I personally like it
when they face southwest.

973
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,927
I tend to enjoy the afternoon sun.

974
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,303
Is that so?

975
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,347
The decor isn't bad either.

976
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,557
All the partner offices
are pretty similar, right?

977
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,061
Well, yeah. They're basically the same.

978
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,604
I see.

979
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,320
Jung-in, I want to thank you.

980
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,947
I won't forget your kindness.

981
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,199
I will build Oh & Partners

982
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,493
into a global law firm.

983
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,536
You know I'm a man of my word.

984
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,833
That passion of yours never wanes.

985
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,587
Was that why I fell for you?

986
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,301
It was because of my passion?

987
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,763
I thought it was because of my good looks.

988
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,517
And you still have that confidence.

989
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,353
Follow me. I'll show you your spot.

990
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,355
But I just sat down.

991
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,315
Let's go.

992
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,484
I'd love to see my office.

993
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,487
I like the offices on this side too.

994
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,072
Is this my office?

995
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,408
No, it's this way.
We just need to go down the stairs.

996
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,202
The stairs? But what about the elevators?

997
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,620
What? You don't like stairs?

998
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,373
No, I love stairs. It's a good workout.

999
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,960
-That's good news, then.
-What do you mean?

1000
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,004
You'll see once you get there.

1001
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,340
There's an atrium too.

1002
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,261
-The firm's grown a lot.
-We have a lot of attorneys now.

1003
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:09,055
We've launched a Pro Bono Team too.

1004
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,516
Pro bono? Free representation?

1005
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,227
Don't call it free.

1006
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,855
Pro bono publico.

1007
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,481
It's a team for public interest cases.

1008
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,650
Right, a free lawsuit team.

1009
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,609
Wait.

1010
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,904
A firm like Oh & Partners
that charges a million won per hour

1011
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,740
has a team
that doesn't make money?

1012
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,450
Why?

1013
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,953
Law firms also have
social responsibilities.

1014
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,705
Haven't you heard of ESG?

1015
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,540
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE

1016
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,333
We're almost there. Come this way.

1017
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,011
Wait. I hear dogs barking.

1018
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,596
Why would dogs be…

1019
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,683
Hey!

1020
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,895
-Why did you put this up here?
-You can't let them go here.

1021
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,480
-What is this place?
-This is crazy.

1022
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,689
-No!
-Everyone!

1023
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,066
Team Pro Bono!

1024
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,487
Attorney Kang Da-wit is here.

1025
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,654
-Hello!
-Welcome, sir!

1026
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,413
Ddol-i, no!

1027
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,374
Hey, this can't be…

1028
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,460
This is where you'll be working now.

1029
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,716
It's a team for public interest cases,
not free cases.

1030
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,637
-One moment.
-I need a moment too.

1031
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,222
-Jung-in. Hey.
-Hello?

1032
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,725
Why is it so dark in here?

1033
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,185
-It's shady, isn't it?
-What?

1034
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,646
That's why mushrooms grow well in here.

1035
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,606
This is shiitake mushroom tea.

1036
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,317
Shiitake mushroom…

1037
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:45,902
Sorry.

1038
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:49,030
We're handling a case involving those
who rescue abandoned dogs.

1039
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:53,201
We have to look after the dogs
while they're being investigated.

1040
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,119
Ddol-i!

1041
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,703
There you are. Come here, Ddol-i.

1042
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,913
You have to go inside now.

1043
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,165
I heard you were a prominent judge.

1044
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,043
Please teach me your ways!

1045
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,255
I'm Hwang Jun-u, a young attorney
who's always eager to learn.

1046
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,132
Let me say hi too. Good boy.

1047
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,633
-Just a minute.
-Sorry.

1048
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,885
Hello, I'm Attorney Yoo Nan-hui!

1049
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:15,223
I'm interested in women's rights,
child welfare, and animal rights.

1050
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,021
-Why do they keep giving me stuff?
-Which areas are you interested in, sir?

1051
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:23,857
Well…

1052
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,609
Anything that concerns public interest.

1053
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,736
Really? I knew it.

1054
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,904
Attorney Jang.

1055
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,031
Right, yes.

1056
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,909
Just wait here for a bit.

1057
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,369
I'm…

1058
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,289
I'm Jang Yeong-sil.

1059
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,416
It's a strange name, isn't it?

1060
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,334
It's nice. It sounds
like an inventor's name.

1061
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:44,878
Right.

1062
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,006
Attorney Jang has more experience
as a PA than anyone else here,

1063
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,716
-which is eight years.
-A PA?

1064
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,176
-It's--
-You don't know?

1065
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,512
Attorneys specializing
in public interest cases are called PAs.

1066
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,724
-And we're AA members as well.
-Yes.

1067
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,142
What are AAs?

1068
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,019
-AAs are--
-A group of attorneys who protect

1069
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,729
the rights of non-human animals.

1070
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,441
And what are non-human animals?

1071
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,276
-Non--
-Humans always think

1072
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,737
they're special and not like animals.

1073
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,240
To stay away from such human-centric,
species-discriminating views,

1074
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:18,453
we've started using terms
like human animals and non-human animals.

1075
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,454
That's right.

1076
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,374
You've got to be kidding me.

1077
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,877
PAs and AAs.

1078
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,088
I'm a CA. An attorney who's going crazy.

1079
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,342
A team for public interest cases
in charge of free lawsuits.

1080
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,887
She put me in this shady place
with freeloaders

1081
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,140
who don't contribute any revenue,
and thus, have no voice in the company.

1082
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,560
What about my stepping stone?

1083
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,895
And my return?

1084
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,148
And my success?

1085
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,776
Hello! You're the new attorney,
aren't you?

1086
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,028
I'm Park Gi-ppeum. Welcome to Team Pro…

1087
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,655
Bono.

1088
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,450
You're him.

1089
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,994
That prick from that one time…

1090
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,330
who pretended to help me.

1091
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,375
Hey, what are you doing here?

1092
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,418
It's not easy to get into this law firm.

1093
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,756
You really are something else.

1094
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,091
You did all that bragging

1095
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,801
about how important you were.

1096
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,137
You never know where life will take you.

1097
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,432
We'll be making copies together now.

1098
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,517
-Copies?
-How wonderful.

1099
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,727
We were so short-handed

1100
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,063
that we were about to find
some cats to help us.

1101
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,774
We're so lucky!

1102
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,569
-Welcome to the team!
-Welcome to the team!

1103
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,695
-Really.
-Welcome!

1104
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,321
-Welcome.
-We should celebrate.

1105
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,240
-Let's have dinner tonight.
-What do you like?

1106
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,491
-What do you like?
-Me?

1107
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,706
Why am I here?

1108
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,710
What am I going to do

1109
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,461
with those people?

1110
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,174
My glorious road to success.

1111
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:59,887
I was walking down the path to success
adorned with wealth and fame.

1112
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,933
Why do I have to handle
all these miscellaneous cases

1113
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,603
with those weird pro bono losers

1114
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,647
in the corner without any sunlight? Why?

1115
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:14,902
Why?

1116
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,159
This darn bread!

1117
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,529
You ******* dog!

1118
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:05,453
I want to go back!

1119
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,606
How could you send me
to that kind of place without asking me?

1120
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,733
What are you doing to our client?

1121
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,319
From chaebol CEO trials
to a case of a stolen mutt…

1122
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,196
I heard you're a pro bono attorney now.

1123
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,489
Did something happen?

1124
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,242
If Myeong-hun's on this case,
it won't end easily.

1125
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,703
-Do you know how much Chloe is worth?
-Oh, my gosh!

1126
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,996
Our Byeol… I won't let her go.

1127
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,164
Chloe!

1128
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,791
-We have to resolve it.
-At any cost.

1129
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,835
I think you've seen
too many Hollywood movies.

1130
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,002
I thought it was okay.

1131
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:58,131
-It's the blunt judge!
-Your goal was to change the judge.

1132
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,549
Hey, you little… You punk!

1133
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,843
-But is that possible?
-You have to win the case.

1134
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:03,511
You could teach me since I don't know.

1135
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,054
-The first reaction.
-"Where?"

1136
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,599
I'll take charge
of those pro bono losers for a year.

1137
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,935
-You want to make a deal?
-Make me a justice candidate.

1138
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,354
That's my condition.

1139
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,070
