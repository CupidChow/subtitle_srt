PREVIOUSLY

00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:42,313
The defendant is sentenced to ten years
in prison and a fine of 70 billion won.

4
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:44,607
Chief Judge Kang Da-wit
levied a harsher sentence

5
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:47,402
than anyone anticipated
on JS Group CEO Jang Hyeon-bae

6
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:49,863
and has instantly become
the people's judge.

7
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:52,156
Your classmate
from elementary school called.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,449
-"Kim Ju-seop"?
-My goodness!

9
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:54,742
The people's judge!

10
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:55,660
Good luck!

11
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:59,956
An apple box filled with 1.2 billion won
in the car of an anti-corruption judge.

12
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,749
I trusted and guided you

13
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,544
when you were a nobody
without a college degree.

14
00:01:04,627 --> 00:01:06,713
How could you betray me like this,
you snake?

15
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:08,089
That bastard…

16
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:10,633
is Yoo Jae-beom, who I tried
for being a serial con artist.

17
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:12,719
He's wanted right now!

18
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:14,888
Submit your resignation letter
right away.

19
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,014
Come join my law firm.

20
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:17,390
I've already persuaded Dad.

21
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:19,184
You persuaded Dr. Oh?

22
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:21,644
I want you to help me.

23
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:23,730
-I'll take charge…
-Welcome to the team!

24
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:25,356
…of those pro bono losers for a year.

25
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:27,108
You want to make a deal?

26
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:30,361
You haven't asked me once
about what made me quit as a judge.

27
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:32,697
Have you seen the video, by any chance?

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,366
It's been a while, Mr. Yoo Jae-beom.

29
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,037
Yes, it has been a while, Ms. Oh.

30
00:01:41,122 --> 00:01:42,498
Don't let Da-wit fool you.

31
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:44,626
He's a criminal who took a huge bribe.

32
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,419
And he's a brutal murderer who pushed

33
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:48,129
-a good businessman to death.
-Ms. Park?

34
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:53,092
No matter how I look at it, it was you.
And there's no trace of manipulation.

35
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:54,677
That's your number, right?

36
00:01:55,303 --> 00:01:56,721
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:58,223
I've never called…

38
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,390
Good morning!

39
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:01,517
Remember how you asked me
to keep tabs on Ms. Yoon

40
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,478
-and find out who she meets?
-Right.

41
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:06,814
The chief of Seoul Central District Court,
your former workplace.

42
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:09,525
-What?
-…recommended Shin Jung-seok,

43
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:12,946
Chief of Seoul Central District Court,
to the president as a new justice.

44
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:16,199
It's a recording transcript
made by Ms. Seo, who you fired.

45
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:19,202
It's what you discussed on the phone
regarding the appeal case

46
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:21,996
of CEO Jang Hyeon-bae
with someone in the Supreme Court.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,916
That's how I looked

48
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,752
-under anesthesia?
-Yes.

49
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,504
It's retrograde amnesia.

50
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:34,133
Instead of being drunk from alcohol,
I was drunk from sleep?

51
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:36,052
They said you'd take my case.

52
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,429
The presiding judge abused his power

53
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:41,224
and killed my father
through a manipulated trial.

54
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:43,393
What was the name of the presiding judge?

55
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:44,727
Kang Da-wit.

56
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:02,537
PRO BONO

00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:07,583
EPISODE 9

58
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:11,546
-Let's step outside and talk.
-Sure.

59
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:27,645
You sure made
a lot of noise during that trial.

60
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,522
I'll take it as a compliment, sir.

61
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:37,697
Since they took it
to the National Assembly and won,

62
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,407
please reconsider disbanding the team.

63
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:43,202
"Disbanding"?

64
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:47,165
He won over a client and admirably
fulfilled the terms of the bet.

65
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:48,666
But what are you talking about?

66
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:54,088
You said our client wasn't Elijah,
but EK Entertainment…

67
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:57,425
The CEO of EK Entertainment
was arrested.

68
00:03:57,508 --> 00:04:00,261
And their assets have been frozen,
so it's an empty shell.

69
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:03,264
You don't want a penniless client, do you?

70
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:06,768
That girl, Elijah.

71
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:10,021
She'll establish
her own agency now, won't she?

72
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:13,316
Of course, Oh & Partners
will sign them to a contract

73
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:16,194
to provide full legal consultation.

74
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:18,821
Right, Attorney Kang?

75
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:20,990
Good job.

76
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:36,005
I was nervous about coming
to Oh & Partners,

77
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:39,967
but that office
is nice and unique, Ms. Park.

78
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:42,595
-It was you, wasn't it?
-About what?

79
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:49,727
DON'T LET DA-WIT FOOL YOU

80
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,314
You let me down, Ms. Park.

81
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:56,401
Aren't you a pro bono attorney
who helps the powerless?

82
00:04:56,484 --> 00:05:00,321
Why have you been sitting on
this tip for public interest?

83
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,825
I guess legal professionals
are all the same.

84
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,202
But I'm not surprised.

85
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,204
People look out for their own kind.

86
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,748
It's so upsetting for those without power.

87
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,209
I have nothing to say to a con artist.

88
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:19,173
You used an anesthetic substance,
didn't you?

89
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:28,141
Goodness, I'm honored.

90
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:31,394
To receive a compliment
from a giant in the legal world as you,

91
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:33,020
that's no ordinary feat.

92
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:35,565
But I've pulled that feat off.

93
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:39,026
You mean a monster, not a giant.

94
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,530
Who would say such a thing?

95
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:45,616
No, the legal world
has always admired you as a role model--

96
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,576
It's okay.

97
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,829
I prefer being a monster.

98
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:52,874
It's means people are afraid of me.

99
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,837
However,

100
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,175
I've overindulged my only daughter so much

101
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:05,386
that she's turned into a spoiled brat.

102
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,096
I'm very worried.

103
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:18,441
Nonsense. I'm a good daughter
who always listens to you

104
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:20,860
and cares only about you.

105
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:44,675
It must have been some kind of benzo.

106
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,469
Using his short-term memory loss,

107
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:49,096
you made him hold an apple box
while he was disoriented

108
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,474
and framed him
as if he were taking a box of cash.

109
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:56,020
Yes, that's right.

110
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:59,023
I'm impressed, Ms. Park.

111
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:02,818
-Are you admitting it?
-Yes, I am.

112
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,947
It was just as you said,
but with a little more detail.

113
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,994
Now, you need to ask me about my motive.

114
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,289
-Your motive?
-Yes.

115
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:18,584
Why did I have to do such a thing
to Kang Da-wit,

116
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:20,586
a justice candidate
and "the people's judge"?

117
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:22,797
Why did I voluntarily come to you

118
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,259
when I'm on the run for fraud?

119
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:28,386
Shouldn't you ask me those things?

120
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:31,556
"When Mr. Kang was a judge,

121
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,433
he killed my father
through a manipulated trial."

122
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:37,770
Why on earth would he do that?

123
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:40,064
You should ask that yourself to that scum…

124
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:47,863
To Kang Da-wit.

125
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,952
I assume you've been through a lot,

126
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:55,663
but you expect me to trust those words?

127
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,958
From someone who's framing
my colleague with a fake video?

128
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,502
No, don't trust my words.

129
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,257
Trust the evidence.

130
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:10,595
Everything is in here.

131
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:14,015
I've spent the past ten years
gathering these.

132
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:25,818
I'll take a look,

133
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:28,029
but don't expect me to believe you.

134
00:08:29,697 --> 00:08:32,199
And you'll have to take responsibility
for using a fake video

135
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:33,784
to falsely accuse Mr. Kang.

136
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:36,162
You're going to report me?

137
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:38,664
-Yes, I have to.
-No, you won't be able to.

138
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:39,999
Why can't I…

139
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:52,470
You just said you'd review my case.

140
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:54,972
"Attorneys must not divulge
confidential information

141
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,557
learned from the client."

142
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:59,727
You're obligated
to maintain confidentiality. Oh, no.

143
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,729
Even in the consultation stage.

144
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:09,362
Okay.

145
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:12,448
Please read through them carefully.

146
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,408
And come visit me.

147
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,577
Visit you?

148
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:20,081
Yes.

149
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:23,376
I'm a serial con artist
on the run, aren't I?

150
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:26,045
I'm going to turn myself in
to the police.

151
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:32,468
Ms. Park, look.

152
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,720
I've put everything on the line.

153
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:35,763
The thing about me is…

154
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:40,351
I don't care if I go to hell…

155
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:45,022
as long as I can expose
Kang Da-wit's hypocrisy.

156
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:55,449
I'm surprised. I thought he'd be furious.

157
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,076
Father did something.

158
00:09:57,702 --> 00:10:00,246
-What?
-There's something going on.

159
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,500
Be careful. Both you and Team Pro Bono.

160
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,087
About what?

161
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,716
Hey, why…

162
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:17,388
Being nosy isn't my thing.

163
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,016
Find out who Dr. Oh has been meeting
inside and outside the firm.

164
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:22,768
Wait.

165
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:24,687
Get me the firm's visitor log too.

166
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:28,816
Ms. Park.

167
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:31,694
-Yes?
-Is there something going on?

168
00:10:31,777 --> 00:10:34,572
It seemed like you were familiar
with that guy from before.

169
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:36,031
It's nothing.

170
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:38,325
It's…

171
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:40,953
An external organization
introduced him to us.

172
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:44,623
I'll review the case first
and let you know.

173
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,752
Okay, I got it.

174
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:51,380
If you need to talk about it,
let me know anytime.

175
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:54,341
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Jang.

176
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:55,760
No problem.

177
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:02,683
Mr. Kang!

178
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:06,353
What's with that expression?
Are we really being disbanded?

179
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:09,440
-What?
-Didn't you just meet with Dr. Oh?

180
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:11,108
I did.

181
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:15,029
I heard he was furious
because we sued our client.

182
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:17,364
Are we really going to be
thrown out into the street?

183
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:21,785
Why are you making such a fuss?
We did our job as attorneys. That's all.

184
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,704
Hey, you were so worried all morning,

185
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:25,831
you read the same file a hundred times!

186
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:28,125
-Why pretend to be cool?
-What? When did I ever?

187
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:30,169
Nan-hui, you scared?

188
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,837
What?

189
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:35,007
He complimented us

190
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,551
for bringing in a star client like Elijah.

191
00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:39,845
Oh, my gosh!

192
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:43,599
Didn't you just say I was making a fuss?

193
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,434
Get back to work. It's no big deal.

194
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,770
Geez, look at Nan-hui changing her tune.

195
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:49,563
Ms. Park, what's with the long face?

196
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:53,817
Didn't you hear me?
Our team won't be disbanded.

197
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:56,403
Right.

198
00:11:57,404 --> 00:11:58,239
I'm so happy.

199
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:00,407
You did a great job.

200
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:03,035
You did a wonderful job, Mr. Kang.

201
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:07,206
Dr. Oh doesn't usually
take back what he says.

202
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,542
Good job, everyone.

203
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:12,878
Is there something going on?

204
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:15,047
No, nothing's going on.

205
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:19,343
All right, since we're feeling good,
let's have an early lunch.

206
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,970
Ox knee soup and boiled beef?

207
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:21,929
Sounds good.

208
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:23,847
Ms. Park, you like ox knee soup.

209
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:25,015
Yes, sounds good.

210
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:27,142
Well, well!

211
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:29,186
This is totally ox-hilarating!

212
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,116
-Wasn't that awful?
-I thought it was funny.

213
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,660
-What was funny about it?
-It wasn't funny?

214
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,461

00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:13,374
What's that?

224
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:15,250
Nothing.
You're going to work early today.

225
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:21,882
I'll get going.

CREDITOR JC CAPITAL

227
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:40,776
I mean, 7:30 a.m.? Come on.

228
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:47,366
What's going on?
Why did you call a meeting this early?

229
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:49,618
Gi-ppeum, pro bono attorneys
are laborers too.

230
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:51,870
Sleeping in is our basic right.

231
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:55,290
Is this about Mr. Kang?

232
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:57,251
What? What do you mean?

233
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,712
He's the only one who's absent.

234
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:02,339
And yesterday, you met with someone

235
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:06,260
who was sent by The Alliance
of Judicial Victims, right?

236
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:08,637
A judicial victim?

237
00:15:09,513 --> 00:15:12,349
Is it someone who was tried
by Mr. Kang when he was a judge?

238
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:15,019
Yes.

239
00:15:15,102 --> 00:15:17,813
Geez, that's all?

240
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:23,485
Then what? Are you saying
Mr. Kang manipulated a trial or something?

241
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:24,611
Yeah.

242
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:26,822
That's exactly it.

243
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:27,948
-What?
-What?

244
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:35,080
Wait, I've seen some of the cases
that alliance has sent before.

245
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:37,166
Most of them were baseless claims.

246
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:40,836
Yeah, when they think they lost unfairly,
they question the judge first.

247
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,754
Yeah.

248
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,758
But…

249
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,973
He brought evidence.
That's why I called this meeting.

250
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:01,607
INVESTIGATION REPORT ON FIRE

251
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:05,694
DEFENDANT YOO BAEK-MAN

252
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:09,698
Yoo Baek-man is the father of the person
who came to me, Yoo Jae-beom.

253
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:11,158
He was a businessman

254
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,411
who ran a paper mill
called Woongcheon Paper in Woongcheon.

255
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,538
We've now moved
to Jangwol Industrial Complex.

256
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,540
As his business expanded,

257
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:21,418
he moved it to Jangwol Industrial Complex
in the capital city.

258
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:23,462
But ten years ago,

259
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:26,256
a tragic fire broke out in the factory.

260
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:33,180
Fire!

261
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:42,773
The factory burned down,
and a person died as well.

262
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,110
Oh, my gosh.

263
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:49,988
They found out that the old
electrical system had short circuited.

264
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:52,074
They didn't have
enough fire escape routes either.

265
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:54,993
The factory manager,
who was in charge of on-site safety,

266
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:57,371
was arrested and charged.

267
00:16:57,454 --> 00:17:00,249
The judge presiding over the case was…

268
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:02,626
It was Mr. Kang.

269
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,086
Yes.

270
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:06,213
Wait.

271
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:07,923
About Yoo Jae-beom,

272
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:10,968
you said his father was the CEO,
not the factory manager.

273
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:11,885
That's right.

274
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:13,428
Then why…

275
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:14,596
The defendant…

276
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:17,141
was changed by Mr. Kang.

277
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:18,809
FACTORY MANAGER, CEO YOO BAEK-MAN

278
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:19,768
What?

279
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:21,812
10 YEARS AGO
SEOUL SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT

280
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,022
By authority,
the Court grants bail to the defendant.

281
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:28,527
Your Honor, the trial has just begun.
What do you mean?

282
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,780
The CEO, not the factory manager.

283
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:34,783
Go get Yoo Baek-man.

284
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:38,704
Otherwise, I cannot proceed…

285
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:41,415
with this trial.

286
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:43,167
A judge granted bail

287
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,587
to the factory manager
with his authority at the first hearing?

288
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:48,672
That's rare, isn't it?

289
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:51,717
That's pretty much
an open display of his presumptions.

290
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,219
And he took control
of the prosecutor's investigation

291
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:56,054
to change the defendant to the CEO.

292
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:59,057
Gosh, even when Mr. Kang was a judge,

293
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,727
-he wasn't any ordinary person.
-Jun-u.

294
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,478
This isn't something to be amazed about.

295
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:05,898
A judge can't cross the line.

296
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:07,774
Exactly. And after that,

297
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:10,736
he started doing the things
he's known for.

298
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:12,946
What? If they're things
he's known for, then…

299
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:14,698
He called them.

300
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:16,575
The journalists.

301
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:19,661
10 YEARS AGO
AFTER WOONGCHEON PAPER FIRE

302
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:22,497
The editorial desk has been hounding us
to find a juicy story.

303
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:25,000
They chewed us out last time
for being a step behind

304
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,253
on reporting the LNG explosion. Geez.

305
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:30,547
Don't even get me started.

306
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:32,049
Here.

307
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:36,720
-What is this?
-This looks like cup noodles.

308
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:41,350
You know about the fire
at the Woongcheon Paper factory, right?

309
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:42,309
Sorry?

310
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:45,437
The one where someone died?

311
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,980
This is from that site?

312
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:49,775
The one who died was a trainee
from a technical high school.

313
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,361
He was 17 years old.

314
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,780
Goodness.

315
00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:57,991
That came out of his backpack.

316
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:01,036
I guess he was going to eat that
and work late.

317
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,371
My goodness.

318
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:05,666
So?

319
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,378
Come on. Tell us in detail, Judge Kang.

320
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:14,341
No, let's not make a toast.

321
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:15,259
Come closer.

322
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,016
Hey, I know that cup noodle picture.
It was on the news for a while.

323
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,852
Mr. Kang leaked it, didn't he?

324
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:31,275
That is exactly something
Mr. Kang would do.

325
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:35,362
Then, things started to happen
as if by magic.

326
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:41,076
IT WASN'T AN INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT

327
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,496
This led to protests and media coverage.

328
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:48,125
The protesters argue
this tragedy wasn't an accident.

329
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,628
After initially refusing to act,
the prosecution charged the owner Yoo.

330
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:55,299
Those involved, including
the factory manager, changed their stories

331
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:57,759
and started testifying
against Yoo Baek-man.

332
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,303
In the end…

333
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:01,596
10 YEARS AGO
SEOUL SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT

334
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,514
Mr. Yoo.

335
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:03,682
Yes, Your Honor?

336
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:06,018
There's something
I've been meaning to ask.

337
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:07,311
Sorry?

338
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,228
Yes, go ahead.

339
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:11,231
Has it ever crossed your mind

340
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:15,819
that the workers at your factory
have loving families too?

341
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:17,279
Pardon?

342
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:20,157
Well, of course.

343
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,617
They're not machines that make you money.

344
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,953
They are people of flesh and blood.

345
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:27,331
Do you know that?

346
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:30,125
Excuse me, Your Honor.

347
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:31,793
I…

348
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:33,795
My company…

349
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:37,591
The Court rules

350
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:42,220
the defendant is sentenced
to seven years in prison.

351
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:45,849
Your Honor!

352
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:48,393
-The defendant will be taken into custody.
-Your Honor!

353
00:20:48,477 --> 00:20:49,519
-Please take him away.
-No!

354
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:50,937
Your Honor!

355
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:52,397
Your Honor, let me explain…

356
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,775
Your Honor! This isn't fair, Your Honor!

357
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,151
-That's enough!
-Your Honor!

358
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:57,736
-Wait, hold on!
-Your Honor!

359
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:03,325
Wasn't that before the Serious Accidents
Punishment Act was enacted?

360
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:05,452
Seven years in prison would be

361
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:08,163
the maximum under the Occupational
Safety and Health Act.

362
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:11,458
For the individual business owner?
How was it upheld by higher courts?

363
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:15,045
If it was ten years ago, it'd be
right after the sinking of MV Sewol.

364
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:18,423
That's right.

365
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:22,886
Backlash after public tragedies
must've been intense then.

366
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:26,056
A flood of articles praised Mr. Kang
as a brave, young judge.

367
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,475
He started gaining popularity then.

368
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:33,480
This sounds exactly
like something Mr. Kang would do.

369
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:39,528
Is that wrong?

370
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,198
-What?
-Honestly,

371
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:46,410
I didn't like him at first.

372
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,286
That was obvious.

373
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:51,665
But after working with him for a while,

374
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:53,917
I wonder if it's bad
to have someone like him around.

375
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:58,463
The law is on the side
of the powerful anyway.

376
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:01,425
If we can win once in a while like this…

377
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,594
If we can give people hope
that they can win,

378
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:09,516
how great would it be
for those who always lose?

379
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:12,561
-Ms. Yoo…
-This case isn't any different.

380
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:16,690
Mr. Kang can be attention-seeking
and materialistic,

381
00:22:16,773 --> 00:22:19,234
but he wouldn't make something up
out of thin air.

382
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:22,696
That CEO must've done something bad
that he was responsible for.

383
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:25,157
But playing by the book didn't work.

384
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,244
So, Mr. Kang used all possible means
to hold him accountable!

385
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,705
Am I wrong? Don't you all think so?

386
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:32,622
Nan-hui.

387
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:34,916
Yoo Baek-man died in jail…

388
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,003
-from pent-up anger.
-What?

389
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:39,004
What?

390
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,383
This is the statement Yoo Jae-beom got
from the factory manager.

391
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,261
It says Judge Kang
blatantly placed the blame

392
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:49,139
on Mr. Yoo Baek-man during the trial,

393
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:51,558
and he said he could only play along.

394
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:53,643
Mr. Kang really went that far?

395
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:55,645
It's a manipulated…

396
00:22:56,688 --> 00:22:58,315
It was a manipulated trial.

397
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:00,233
If that's true,

398
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:03,778
Mr. Kang is a criminal.

399
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:10,202
Yes.

400
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,371
Wait…

401
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:17,250
Still, we can't take this case.

402
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:18,835
Am I wrong?

403
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:26,593
He's our team leader.

404
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:28,345
He's our colleague!

405
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:33,433
Also, if our team leader
gets in trouble for this,

406
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:36,811
that'll be the final nail
in the coffin for our team.

407
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:38,813
We barely survived
by winning the last case.

408
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:41,233
We worked so hard to win that.

409
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,194
Yeong-sil.

410
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:11,388
Good morning!

411
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:13,056
Gosh, everyone's here early today.

412
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:14,599
Come on.

413
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,060
Why do you feel so down?

414
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:19,938
What's going on? Say something

415
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,773
The mood is so cold

416
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,985
Hey, Mr. Jang!

417
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:28,238
Get rid of that broken one,
and let's use this one now.

418
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:31,283
The team Dr. Oh complimented
deserves something like this.

419
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:33,368
Right, Ms. Yoo? You love coffee.

420
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,913
The mood is so cold

421
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:40,000
I need to go to the archives.

422
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,126
Let's go together.

423
00:24:43,503 --> 00:24:46,673
-The archives are here. Where are you…
-Mr. Kang.

424
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:50,260
-Yes?
-Can I have a word with you?

425
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:56,808
About what?

426
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:01,688
That lowlife Yoo Jae-beom came here?

427
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:03,648
-Yes.
-Why didn't you tell me?

428
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:05,358
Where is that jerk?

429
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:07,736
-Mr. Kang.
-Why on earth didn't you call me?

430
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:09,863
We don't have time for this.

431
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:11,865
Geez!

432
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:15,452
Detective Woo, it's me.
That punk Yoo Jae-beom is…

433
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:17,162
He turned himself in.

434
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:21,916
I'll call you back.

435
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,296
He turned himself in?

436
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:29,049
-Yes, he's in jail right now.
-Then,

437
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:31,593
did he admit to framing me?

438
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:34,721
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you that.

439
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:37,557
Why not? Why can't you tell me?

440
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,434
He came looking for me.

441
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:42,062
I heard his story as an attorney.

442
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:45,482
Wait, don't tell me
you've decided to represent that jerk--

443
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:47,150
Are you out of your mind, Ms. Park?

444
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:49,903
-No, I haven't made up my mind yet.
-Then why?

445
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:52,697
I have to keep confidentiality
even in the consultation stage.

446
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:54,199
You know this.

447
00:25:54,282 --> 00:25:56,701
That punk, Yoo Jae-beom.

448
00:25:56,785 --> 00:25:59,287
First, he sent you the apple box video.

449
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:02,957
Now, he came and asked you to defend him?
With a case that's framing me?

450
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,210
What a damn despicable…

451
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:07,670
That's not it.

452
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:11,674
Then, is it the fraud case
he'd been running from?

453
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:15,136
-Mr. Kang.
-What is it then?

454
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,721
Do you know Mr. Yoo Baek-man?

455
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:19,557
Who is that? I don't know him.

456
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:22,102
He's Jae-beom's father.

457
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:30,110
Ma'am, this is the visitor log
from the past week.

458
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:32,278
Good work.

459
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:35,031
OH & PARTNERS VISITOR LOG

460
00:26:37,617 --> 00:26:39,494
Wait, this person was here?

461
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:41,538
Who is that, ma'am?

462
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:47,585
Who did he meet with?

463
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,296
ATTORNEY PARK GI-PPEUM

464
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,549
Attorney Park Gi-ppeum
from Team Pro Bono.

465
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:02,058
Yoo Jae-beom is that man's son?

466
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,437
Wait, how…

467
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:09,524
Then…

468
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:12,485
Do you remember now

469
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:15,113
who Mr. Yoo Baek-man is?

470
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,074
Yes.

471
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:19,826
I remember him now.

472
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:21,744
It's someone I tried in the past.

473
00:27:21,828 --> 00:27:23,955
I had no idea Yoo Jae-beom was his son.

474
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:25,373
Yoo Jae-beom believes

475
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:28,835
that you rigged the trial.

476
00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:31,379
That's ridiculous!

477
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:35,884
Do you think I'd do such a thing?
A rigged trial? What do you take me for?

478
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:39,304
-You didn't, right?
-Of course…

479
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:42,849
Of course, I didn't.

480
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:45,727
I only followed the law.

481
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:48,438
So then,

482
00:27:49,522 --> 00:27:51,941
did he say he set a trap for me
because of his grudge?

483
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:56,613
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

484
00:27:58,072 --> 00:27:59,407
Yoo Jae-beom came to me

485
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:03,328
with evidence he had gathered
to prove you rigged the trial.

486
00:28:03,411 --> 00:28:07,790
He asked Team Pro Bono
to sue you on his behalf.

487
00:28:11,794 --> 00:28:13,296
What evidence did he bring?

488
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,672
I can't tell you. Sorry.

489
00:28:14,756 --> 00:28:17,300
Geez! For crying out loud!

490
00:28:27,602 --> 00:28:30,396
So, are you going to
file a suit against me?

491
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,857
I wanted to hear
what you had to say first.

492
00:28:33,483 --> 00:28:36,611
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

493
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:39,322
I only did what I had to do.

494
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:42,158
Okay. So, tell me everything.

495
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:45,578
-What happened during the trial?
-Yes, I'll tell you.

496
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:49,207
But…

497
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,584
there's someone I need to see first.

498
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,977
These mint candies.

499
00:29:10,061 --> 00:29:13,815
After establishing this firm,

500
00:29:13,898 --> 00:29:16,109
I'd eat these every time
I stayed up all night.

501
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:21,197
Back then, we only had three attorneys.

502
00:29:22,198 --> 00:29:24,242
You've told me this story, Father.

503
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:25,785
When they discontinued the candies,

504
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,121
you bought the factory
so they'd make them again.

505
00:29:28,204 --> 00:29:29,080
I told you that?

506
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,959
Geez, am I getting dementia already?

507
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:34,752
Hold on.

508
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:37,005
What time was it today?

509
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:39,549
Why did you do that?

510
00:29:40,925 --> 00:29:41,759
Do what?

511
00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:44,596
You know what I mean.

512
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:46,055
Yoo Jae-beom.

513
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:52,061
I don't know. I have no idea
why you're asking me about that.

514
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:57,859
You've played a very risky card.

515
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:01,029
This will endanger the firm as a whole.

516
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:02,697
Well…

517
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,034
I don't know if someone

518
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:09,913
who threatened her own father
with a phone transcript can say that.

519
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:13,416
It's a recording transcript
made by Ms. Seo, who you fired.

520
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:16,669
It's what you discussed on the phone
regarding the appeal case

521
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:18,546
of CEO Jang Hyeon-bae.

522
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,465
With someone in the Supreme Court.

523
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:29,223
Even though I'm an old man
who keeps forgetting stuff,

524
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:30,850
you acted too rashly, Jung-in.

525
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,727
You should've waited a little more.

526
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:36,105
You should've remained
a daughter who listens to her dad.

527
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,528
Your father still has
gas left in the tank.

528
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:50,370
Why don't you step back
from this headache-causing work

529
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:52,497
and find a hobby to enjoy?

530
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:55,583
I'll pass.

531
00:30:56,668 --> 00:31:00,129
I'm still busy
protecting this firm you founded

532
00:31:00,713 --> 00:31:02,465
from you.

533
00:31:05,218 --> 00:31:06,052
No,

534
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:08,179
you'll end up getting some rest.

535
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:12,350
Isn't today a perfectly beautiful day too?

536
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:15,144
It'll be a gift.

537
00:31:15,228 --> 00:31:17,939
-What does that mean?
-Right.

538
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:21,025
It's at 2:00 p.m. today.

539
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:24,779
This just in.

540
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:28,032
JS Group CEO Jang Hyeon-bae
had been held in custody

541
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:31,828
after being sentenced to ten years
in prison by former judge Kang Da-wit.

542
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:35,331
But the Supreme Court has just reversed
this decision and found him innocent.

543
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:38,626
Jang has been accusing former judge Kang

544
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,755
of driving the trial on trumped-up charges
to a fixed conclusion.

545
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,340
With today's Supreme Court ruling,

546
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:47,593
Jang's claims have been given more weight.

547
00:31:47,677 --> 00:31:49,679
-The case has been returned…
-Oh, my God.

548
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:51,389
…to the High Court for a new trial.

549
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:53,891
-All eyes will be on…
-Yeong-sil, what's wrong?

550
00:31:53,975 --> 00:31:55,184
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

551
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,562
The Supreme Court's decision…

552
00:31:57,645 --> 00:32:00,481
But what is this? What is happening?

553
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:04,027
-Chairman Jang's case was also rigged?
-No, that's not possible.

554
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,279
Gi-ppeum, where's Mr. Kang right now?

555
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:07,238
What?

556
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:09,365
He said he had to go meet someone.

557
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:12,744
Who on earth is he meeting
in the middle of this chaos?

558
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:24,172
The people's judge, Kang Da-wit!

559
00:32:24,797 --> 00:32:28,259
Da-wit, it's been a while.
It's me, Juvenile.

560
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:33,806
You're laughing?

561
00:32:34,974 --> 00:32:37,560
Thanks for putting yourself in there.

562
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:43,232
Who is it? Who did you cook this up with?

563
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:46,652
"Who"? Is that what you want to know?

564
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:49,739
You didn't ask me about "why."

565
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,077
Well, you clearly know why now.

566
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,415
Then, did you hear
about how my father passed?

567
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:03,920
You thought you'd be all right

568
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:07,715
after pulling this stunt
on a sitting chief judge?

569
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,300
No.

570
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,261
You're not a sitting judge anymore.

571
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:14,472
You…

572
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:19,102
You'll pay dearly
for all these tricks you've pulled.

573
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:20,436
Really?

574
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,981
How?

575
00:33:25,108 --> 00:33:26,609
Catching you was the difficult part.

576
00:33:26,692 --> 00:33:29,278
Revealing what you've done
won't be a problem.

577
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:30,905
Is that so?

578
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:32,740
In the end, it was nothing special.

579
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:37,203
You tampered with my drink
when I went to the restroom. Am I wrong?

580
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,127
I want to send my friend off first.

581
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,087
-All right. I'll get going.
-Okay.

582
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,088
Please drive safely.

583
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:49,549
-That driver was your accomplice.
-Okay.

584
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:54,220
When I fell asleep from the drugs,
you woke me up to move the apple box.

585
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:57,056
"I brought some apples
from my orchard. Take some."

586
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,433
Hey.

587
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:01,519
-It's so heavy. Gosh.
-Hey.

588
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:03,938
And when I got in the car again
and fell asleep,

589
00:34:04,021 --> 00:34:07,984
you replaced that box with a box of cash
since they differ in weight.

590
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:11,612
That's interesting.
You've done a lot of research.

591
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,659
I didn't need to research.

592
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:21,747
You damn frauds aren't that creative.

593
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,418
You've written a nice story.

594
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:27,795
But you know, don't you? In the end…

595
00:34:38,514 --> 00:34:40,641
You won't be able to prove anything.

596
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,611
Genes are pretty scary.

597
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,905
I guess it must…

598
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,866
run in your family.

599
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:01,204
Shamelessness.

600
00:35:03,456 --> 00:35:05,374
Pretending to be the victim.
Things like that.

601
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:12,215
You dug into my past,
so you know about my mother's case.

602
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:16,052
Do you know what shocked me the most
during your father's trial?

603
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:18,930
He didn't remember me at all.

604
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:26,562
He couldn't care less about the son
of a worker whose hand was cut off.

605
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,608
That's the kind of people you are.

606
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:36,322
You cause others…

607
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:39,617
so much pain…

608
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:44,205
and you ignore them.

609
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:53,297
Do you know what shocked me the most?

610
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:59,303
You mercilessly dragged my father
to jail right in front of me…

611
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:03,349
but you couldn't remember me at all.

612
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,896
-The defendant will be taken into custody.
-Your Honor!

613
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,022
Please take him away.

614
00:36:10,106 --> 00:36:11,107
-Your Honor!
-All rise.

615
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,191
Father.

616
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:14,151
Hold on. Father!

617
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:15,403
Your Honor!

618
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:17,488
Father! Wait!

619
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:18,781
Your Honor!

620
00:36:23,202 --> 00:36:24,245
Your Honor!

621
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:32,086
You think you're any better?

622
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:34,422
Do you?

623
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:40,970
RISK MANAGEMENT

624
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:43,055
JS GROUP CEO JANG HYEON-BAE ACQUITTED

625
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:44,473
How will you take responsibility?

626
00:36:44,557 --> 00:36:48,019
With Chairman Jang's acquittal,
the business world's been in an uproar.

627
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:50,688
Putting one of the five biggest CEOs
of the business world

628
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:52,690
into court custody without evidence?

629
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:54,567
Is Kang Da-wit out of his mind?

630
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,988
I will take care of it, no matter what.

631
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:01,574
How? How are you going to do that?

632
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:06,245
You are the one who hired such a person.

633
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:09,332
What client would entrust us
with their cases now?

634
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:12,335
Even though the Supreme Court
has acquitted him,

635
00:37:12,418 --> 00:37:14,420
there's still the retrial--

636
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:15,629
Step down.

637
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,674
All right?

638
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:21,761
Attorney Oh.

639
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:23,137
Mr. Kim.

640
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,266
Are you going to shut down
the firm your father built?

641
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:36,150
It's the will
of the entire management group.

642
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:40,738
Please step down from your position
as CEO, Attorney Oh Jung-in.

643
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:57,880
JOURNALIST KIM DO-HUN

644
00:37:59,382 --> 00:38:00,674
Hey, Mr. Kim. What is it?

645
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:03,386
You know the Supreme Court reversed
Jang Hyeon-bae's case, right?

646
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:06,389
-What are you talking about?
-Jang's attorneys…

647
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:08,557
They're talking to the press right now.

648
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:12,561
Former judge Kang Da-wit presided
the first trial with a predetermined…

649
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:14,814
They're all attacking you.

650
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:16,482
Would you like to comment on this?

651
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:19,318
Who was the presiding justice
that made the ruling?

652
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:21,028
Justice Shin Jung-seok.

653
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:23,531
He was chief of the court
you used to work at.

654
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:25,950
-Give us a few words.
-Hang up for a second.

655
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:37,503
I knew it.

656
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,435
Dr. Oh!

657
00:38:52,518 --> 00:38:53,352
Hello, sir!

658
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:57,440
You can sit. Don't let me interrupt.

659
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:00,818
Hello, sir. I'm Park Gi-ppeum.

660
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:02,611
I'm Yoo Nan-hui.

661
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:07,283
Right. I'm Jang… Jang Yeong-sil.

662
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:09,994
Hello, Dr. Oh!

663
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:14,582
I'm Hwang Jun-u, a young attorney
who always does his best!

664
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:17,960
What brings you here
to our humble office?

665
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:20,629
Humble?

666
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:23,466
These are the files of trials

667
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:26,135
that I would study all night
when I was about your age.

668
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,888
This is a place that feels like home.

669
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:32,266
-Please take a seat, sir.
-Right.

670
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:33,767
-No, it's okay.
-Yes, sir.

671
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:37,354
Team Pro Bono.

672
00:39:37,438 --> 00:39:40,608
You've done so well so far.

673
00:39:41,775 --> 00:39:43,694
I didn't pay enough attention to you.

674
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:47,198
I should have called you up
and given you some encouragement.

675
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:48,991
It's okay, sir.

676
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:53,537
We're just grateful that you allowed
our team to stay in this firm.

677
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:58,876
It seems there's a hidden meaning
in what you just said.

678
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,253
No, sir. She…

679
00:40:01,337 --> 00:40:03,088
What Ms. Park meant was…

680
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:04,423
Attorney Park.

681
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:08,552
I heard you got a client
asking you to sue Attorney Kang.

682
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:15,267
Yes, sir.

683
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:17,895
-Why don't you take it?
-Pardon?

684
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:19,813
Sir, how could we…

685
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,192
Aren't you pro bono attorneys?

686
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,656
Isn't it your job to help the victims
of abuse-of-power crimes?

687
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:31,909
Or was I mistaken?

688
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:36,497
Dr. Oh,

689
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:39,917
what you said was correct,

690
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:43,671
but he's our team leader.

691
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:48,717
Rather than take the case ourselves,
we should find other pro bono attorneys…

692
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:52,304
If there's anyone
who doesn't want to follow my orders,

693
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:55,516
tell me now.

694
00:41:01,313 --> 00:41:02,481
No one?

695
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,858
Then, good luck.

696
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:06,819
Dr. Oh.

697
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,077
We're pro bono attorneys.

698
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,121
To see if it's of public interest,

699
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:20,416
we should at least hear Mr. Kang's story
before making a decision.

700
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,670
Hearing both sides is a basic requirement
for any attorney, isn't it?

701
00:41:27,715 --> 00:41:30,050
Did you learn that from Da-wit?

702
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:34,013
Talking about basic requirements
in front of me?

703
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:34,930
Sir?

704
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:36,807
Okay.

705
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:39,518
Good luck with the basics.

706
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:41,645
Do it like pro bono attorneys.

707
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:48,110
Have a good day, sir!

708
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,867
Why did you do that?

709
00:41:58,203 --> 00:42:00,581
SUPREME COURT

710
00:42:00,664 --> 00:42:02,041
JUSTICE SHIN JUNG-SEOK

711
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:07,963
Come in.

712
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:13,218
Judge Kang, it's been a while.

713
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:14,470
Take a seat over there.

714
00:42:14,553 --> 00:42:17,348
It's been a long time, Justice Shin.

715
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:20,142
Come.

716
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:24,772
Sit.

717
00:42:28,108 --> 00:42:29,860
This is pu'er tea.

718
00:42:33,864 --> 00:42:35,741
You have more gray hairs now.

719
00:42:35,824 --> 00:42:36,825
Don't even mention it.

720
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:39,453
You're happy
for only two days as a justice.

721
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:41,872
The day you're appointed
and the day you retire.

722
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:43,916
I have so much to do

723
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,626
that I'm drowning in work.

724
00:42:47,169 --> 00:42:49,713
I thought you'd refuse to see me,
so I've come empty-handed.

725
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:53,092
What? Why would I refuse to see you?

726
00:42:55,803 --> 00:42:58,347
By any chance, is this about
Chairman Jang Hyeon-bae's case?

727
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:02,142
Come on. You just make rulings
based on your own convictions.

728
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:03,602
Right.

729
00:43:03,686 --> 00:43:06,980
Judge Kang, did you come to see me
because you were upset about that?

730
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:08,941
Of course not.

731
00:43:10,943 --> 00:43:14,780
Actually, I feel so terrible
whenever I think about you.

732
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:18,075
But you seem to be doing
even better out there.

733
00:43:18,158 --> 00:43:19,702
You took a lot of fun cases too.

734
00:43:19,785 --> 00:43:21,328
You think so?

735
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:22,746
I just met with Yoo Jae-beom.

736
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:28,544
-What?
-Why did you do that?

737
00:43:31,714 --> 00:43:33,132
What do you mean?

738
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:37,010
After meeting that punk,
I know for certain now.

739
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:40,222
The person he trusted
that let him make such a video.

740
00:43:42,057 --> 00:43:43,767
What are you talking about?

741
00:43:51,483 --> 00:43:52,401
Mr. Shin.

742
00:43:52,985 --> 00:43:54,278
I really liked you.

743
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:57,698
You believed in me
when I had no connections or supporters.

744
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:01,577
You entrusted me
with the Division for Corruption Cases.

745
00:44:02,578 --> 00:44:05,748
If it wasn't for you, I…

746
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:10,836
I wouldn't have been fooled
by such a sloppy video.

747
00:44:12,337 --> 00:44:13,964
Someone I'd always trusted and followed.

748
00:44:14,047 --> 00:44:18,385
The first person I'd report to
after discovering a box of cash.

749
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:21,054
Is that true?

750
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,806
Yes, sir.

751
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,477
Nobody gave all that money,
but it was in a judge's car?

752
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,895
Who's going to buy that?

753
00:44:27,978 --> 00:44:30,731
Are you going to quietly quit
before word gets out?

754
00:44:30,814 --> 00:44:33,609
Or will you face a police investigation
for taking a big bribe

755
00:44:34,401 --> 00:44:36,445
from a serial con artist?

756
00:44:36,528 --> 00:44:38,906
Someone who I'd have
no choice but to follow

757
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:42,576
because they'd cover things up
if I quietly resigned.

758
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:44,244
Since that person was the accomplice,

759
00:44:46,038 --> 00:44:47,498
all of it was possible.

760
00:44:50,709 --> 00:44:53,295
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

761
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,137
Making Yoo Jae-beom turn himself in
was a fatal mistake.

762
00:45:04,973 --> 00:45:08,810
A Supreme Court justice
who is a serial con artist's accomplice.

763
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,481
Once Yoo Jae-beom starts talking,

764
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:14,983
Korea's going to be in an uproar.

765
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:32,709
I understand you're upset
because I couldn't protect you.

766
00:45:32,793 --> 00:45:33,710
But my goodness.

767
00:45:34,378 --> 00:45:36,296
You have a deep emotional wound.

768
00:45:37,798 --> 00:45:40,092
You should see a therapist.

769
00:45:43,345 --> 00:45:44,763
How sad.

770
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:47,015
You used to be so brilliant.

771
00:45:47,683 --> 00:45:49,226
My goodness.

772
00:45:59,361 --> 00:46:00,195
Judge Kang.

773
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:02,364
I just met Shin Jung-seok
and brought it up,

774
00:46:02,447 --> 00:46:05,242
but he didn't know
Yoo Jae-beom had turned himself in.

775
00:46:05,325 --> 00:46:07,035
Is that true?

776
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,621
He pretended to be cool,
but he was flustered.

777
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:10,539
I'm certain of it.

778
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:13,750
Then, did Yoo Jae-beom
turn himself in on his own?

779
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:15,627
We don't know that. Or…

780
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:18,922
there could be someone else.

781
00:46:20,674 --> 00:46:23,176
Anyway, I scared him stiff,

782
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,720
so he'll definitely make a move.

783
00:46:24,803 --> 00:46:26,263
I see.

784
00:46:26,346 --> 00:46:28,015
You want me to tail him, right?

785
00:46:30,142 --> 00:46:33,145
But are you going to give me
hazard pay now, Judge Kang?

786
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:34,521
-This is--
-Good luck.

787
00:46:42,946 --> 00:46:43,864
Hey, Jung-in.

788
00:46:46,575 --> 00:46:47,618
Now?

789
00:46:49,244 --> 00:46:51,622
You stepped down as CEO? Why?

790
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:57,127
It's because of me, isn't it?

791
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:00,213
No.

792
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:04,009
It was my decision to bring you here.

793
00:47:04,092 --> 00:47:05,802
I'll find a way to take care of this.

794
00:47:05,886 --> 00:47:08,096
-First--
-Let's think about that tomorrow.

795
00:47:09,514 --> 00:47:11,058
Today, let's just drink.

796
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:12,476
Here.

797
00:47:24,363 --> 00:47:26,239
-Da-wit.
-Yeah?

798
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:29,785
You were really hurt
back in the JRTI, weren't you?

799
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:32,204
What? When you dumped me?

800
00:47:32,287 --> 00:47:34,831
Why are you talking about the past?
That's not like you.

801
00:47:38,877 --> 00:47:39,920
I'm sorry.

802
00:47:40,629 --> 00:47:41,880
My father

803
00:47:41,963 --> 00:47:44,257
was actually once a girl dad.

804
00:47:44,841 --> 00:47:46,051
And I was a daughter

805
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,762
who wouldn't dare to disobey him.

806
00:47:50,347 --> 00:47:52,224
If I were him, I would've split us up too.

807
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:55,769
The princess of Oh & Partners
and a nobody without a college degree.

808
00:47:56,353 --> 00:47:58,730
I totally understand.

809
00:48:03,652 --> 00:48:04,778
But do you remember?

810
00:48:06,905 --> 00:48:10,283
The promise we made
while drinking the day we broke up.

811
00:48:15,205 --> 00:48:16,123
You've forgotten.

812
00:48:17,165 --> 00:48:18,625
I told you back then

813
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:22,838
that if we were still single
by the time I was 40,

814
00:48:22,921 --> 00:48:24,756
we'd get back together and get married.

815
00:48:32,055 --> 00:48:33,306
I turned 40 today.

816
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:38,061
What a birthday, isn't it?

817
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:45,944
Drinks are on me today
since it's my birthday.

818
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:03,503
CUP NOODLE ISN'T ANYWHERE ON LIST
FABRICATED EVIDENCE

819
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:09,050
JUDGE KANG EXPOSES
GAPS IN INDUSTRIAL SAFETY

820
00:49:18,685 --> 00:49:22,731
JOIE DE VIVRE

821
00:49:29,362 --> 00:49:30,572
Could you take a look at this?

822
00:49:31,364 --> 00:49:32,491
"Notice of debt collection"?

823
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,367
What is this?

824
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,745
"JC Capital."

825
00:49:38,663 --> 00:49:40,624
Mom, we were made exempt
from liability back then.

826
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:42,667
I don't know.

827
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:44,503
They said we were missing

828
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:47,297
from the creditor's list,
so we're not exempt.

829
00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:52,093
That can't be right.
I'll check it after work.

830
00:49:53,178 --> 00:49:54,888
Don't worry about it, okay?

831
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:57,516
Okay. Get going.

832
00:50:02,437 --> 00:50:04,147
ATTORNEY KANG DA-WIT

833
00:50:16,868 --> 00:50:18,453
Why did you call me on my way to work?

834
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,497
You weren't even at the office.

835
00:50:21,456 --> 00:50:25,168
It'll only be uncomfortable.
They've all started avoiding me.

836
00:50:25,794 --> 00:50:27,879
Because it's hard on them.

837
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,215
Because they all like you.

838
00:50:30,298 --> 00:50:31,591
If you all like me,

839
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:34,010
then why are you letting
a con artist fool you?

840
00:50:34,094 --> 00:50:35,387
A manipulated trial?

841
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:38,223
Why would I do that?
What benefit would I get from it?

842
00:50:38,306 --> 00:50:40,475
That case made you famous.

843
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,394
You did a lot of interviews too.

844
00:50:42,477 --> 00:50:44,688
You think I rigged the trial
to become popular?

845
00:50:45,939 --> 00:50:48,775
You still see me as a scumbag
who's obsessed with success,

846
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:51,486
while you all are
admirable pro bono attorneys.

847
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:00,954
What is this?

848
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,957
DON'T LET DA-WIT FOOL YOU

849
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:06,501
What is this?

850
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:09,629
It's the text Yoo Jae-beom sent me
with the video.

851
00:51:09,713 --> 00:51:13,425
-You never told me about this text.
-Because I trusted you!

852
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:15,844
What?

853
00:51:15,927 --> 00:51:17,804
While handling Byeol and Gang-hun's cases,

854
00:51:17,888 --> 00:51:19,514
I started seeing you differently.

855
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:23,685
You pretended to be indifferent,
but you were always sincere.

856
00:51:24,227 --> 00:51:27,731
"Someone like him wouldn't do that."
I believed you from the start.

857
00:51:27,814 --> 00:51:30,692
So I ignored this ridiculous text.
And that apple box!

858
00:51:30,775 --> 00:51:33,278
Do you know how many times
I watched that video?

859
00:51:33,862 --> 00:51:35,697
"It clearly must've been altered!"

860
00:51:36,865 --> 00:51:40,035
To find evidence of that, I…

861
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:51,963
Ms. Park.

862
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:54,633
Are you really going to take my case?

863
00:51:57,093 --> 00:51:59,846
-They all want to?
-Of course, they don't want to take it!

864
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,351
But we have no choice.

865
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:08,939
Also, Dr. Oh ordered us directly
to take the case.

866
00:52:11,483 --> 00:52:13,652
-Dr. Oh?
-So,

867
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:15,946
please tell us everything.

868
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,367
We've all decided
to hear your story first.

869
00:52:22,077 --> 00:52:22,911
Okay?

870
00:52:37,676 --> 00:52:39,260
Where is he going in such a hurry?

871
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:40,553
Hey, Jun-u.

872
00:52:43,223 --> 00:52:44,766
Wait, that's…

873
00:52:48,895 --> 00:52:50,605
Why is he going in there?

874
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:55,443
Hey, Gi-ppeum.

875
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:58,279
Okay, I'll tell everyone to come.

876
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,490
OH GYU-JANG
SENIOR ADVISOR

877
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:10,417
This is quite disappointing.

878
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:13,378
We're having a meeting

879
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:15,171
about a case involving me.

880
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:17,590
We don't want to believe

881
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:21,261
that you manipulated a trial.

882
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:23,596
Then, all you have to do
is not believe it.

883
00:53:24,222 --> 00:53:26,808
You all believe what that fraud says?

884
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,269
There are some things
we have investigated.

885
00:53:29,352 --> 00:53:30,353
What do you mean?

886
00:53:30,437 --> 00:53:33,314
It happened ten years ago.
What could you have investigated?

887
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:44,743
This is…

888
00:53:44,826 --> 00:53:47,120
Yes, it's the photo

889
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:49,497
that shifted public opinion on the case.

890
00:53:49,581 --> 00:53:53,126
You gave this to the journalists.

891
00:53:53,835 --> 00:53:55,128
What about it?

892
00:53:55,795 --> 00:54:00,258
We reviewed all trial records from then,

893
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:01,801
and this photo…

894
00:54:02,802 --> 00:54:04,345
is nowhere to be found.

895
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:07,724
The student who passed away…

896
00:54:08,308 --> 00:54:11,478
There's no statement that says
he brought the cup noodles.

897
00:54:11,561 --> 00:54:14,022
What on earth is this…

898
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,525
What is this photo, Mr. Kang?

899
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:26,159
How does this relate
to the main issue of the case?

900
00:54:29,746 --> 00:54:33,124
We don't want
to think this way either, Mr. Kang.

901
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:34,375
However,

902
00:54:35,043 --> 00:54:39,214
this was the first case
that got you national attention.

903
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:42,967
Then, you were put on the fast track,
taking key positions.

904
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:47,639
Mr. Kang, please tell us now.

905
00:54:57,315 --> 00:54:58,566
I guess it can't be helped.

906
00:54:59,734 --> 00:55:02,737
You all see me as a lunatic
obsessed with success.

907
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:04,114
Mr. Kang…

908
00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:10,912
You'll all end up finding out
from Yoo Jae-beom anyway,

909
00:55:10,995 --> 00:55:13,164
so I'll tell it myself.

910
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,167
Yoo Baek-man…

911
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,336
We've had…

912
00:55:20,046 --> 00:55:21,548
a long, bitter history.

913
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:23,925
What?

914
00:55:29,681 --> 00:55:31,808
1998, WOONGCHEON PAPER MILL,
WOONGCHEON CITY

915
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:53,037
Mom, I'm home.

916
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:57,792
Mom?

917
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:00,670
Mom?

918
00:56:07,677 --> 00:56:08,511
Mom?

919
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:11,806
Mom.

920
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,809
Mom!

921
00:56:16,603 --> 00:56:18,271
Da-wit, you're home.

922
00:56:19,397 --> 00:56:22,275
I'm sorry I couldn't come to the door.

923
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:24,444
That's not what's important here.

924
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:29,574
You have a fever. Why didn't you tell…

925
00:56:31,951 --> 00:56:32,785
It's all right.

926
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,787
It's okay.

927
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:40,710
I'm all right. It's nothing.

928
00:56:49,093 --> 00:56:50,887
Mom, what happened to your hand?

929
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:57,101
Mom, your hand.

930
00:56:59,020 --> 00:56:59,854
Mom.

931
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:02,398
Your hand.

932
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,070
Mom. Tell me!

933
00:57:07,612 --> 00:57:09,822
Mom!

934
00:57:09,906 --> 00:57:11,991
Get a hold of yourselves, okay?

935
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:13,785
-Don't get soft.
-Let go!

936
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:16,329
Who are you?

937
00:57:17,789 --> 00:57:19,707
-What the hell? Who is this punk?
-Come here!

938
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:21,709
You said there were
sudden additional orders

939
00:57:21,793 --> 00:57:23,378
and made my mom work overtime for days.

940
00:57:23,461 --> 00:57:25,421
For some damn pennies?

941
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:26,464
Damn it!

942
00:57:27,423 --> 00:57:28,258
Get him out now!

943
00:57:28,341 --> 00:57:29,801
Where did that punk come from?

944
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:32,011
-Let go of me!
-Are you all right, sir?

945
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:33,221
Get rid of him!

946
00:57:33,304 --> 00:57:35,223
Get out of here, kid.

947
00:57:35,306 --> 00:57:36,933
All right? Hey!

948
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:38,810
-Let go!
-Leave already! Stop!

949
00:57:39,394 --> 00:57:40,478
-Hey, kid!
-Move.

950
00:57:40,562 --> 00:57:41,604
Sir, please don't.

951
00:57:41,688 --> 00:57:43,523
You rude little brat.

952
00:57:44,148 --> 00:57:45,984
How dare you act like a thug?

953
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:48,444
Hey, stop making a scene like an idiot.

954
00:57:48,528 --> 00:57:50,321
And go do it the legal way.

955
00:57:50,405 --> 00:57:52,949
I can tell he was raised
without a father. That damn…

956
00:57:57,495 --> 00:57:59,956
HOW TO FILE CRIMINAL COMPLAINTS
HOW TO SUE ON MY OWN

957
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:02,834
With our situation,
we can't afford to sue.

958
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:05,211
We don't have money for an attorney.

959
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:08,006
I'll do it.

960
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,135
I'll handle everything,
so just focus on getting better.

961
00:58:12,218 --> 00:58:14,971
You don't know how the world works yet.

962
00:58:18,558 --> 00:58:22,103
There's no one who will help
a family like us, Da-wit.

963
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:24,522
So,

964
00:58:25,106 --> 00:58:27,692
-go to college and--
-I said I'd do it, Mom.

965
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:32,822
Okay.

966
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:46,127
Goodness. Hello, Chief.

967
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,714
Come on. I retired long ago.
No need to call me "Chief."

968
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:51,716
My apologies for being late, Your Honor.

969
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:52,967
It's all right.

970
00:58:53,551 --> 00:58:54,427
Please go ahead.

971
00:58:58,097 --> 00:59:00,433
Actually, I am very sorry about this,

972
00:59:01,142 --> 00:59:04,228
but since the plaintiff has requested
so many documents,

973
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:07,899
we'd be very grateful if you could
grant us enough time to prepare.

974
00:59:09,734 --> 00:59:12,612
Your Honor, this is already
their third time motioning to postpone!

975
00:59:13,237 --> 00:59:14,781
Order. Lower your voice.

976
00:59:14,864 --> 00:59:16,949
-This is a court of law.
-Da-wit.

977
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:18,576
Sit down.

978
00:59:20,244 --> 00:59:22,288
Today, we will move
to change the hearing date.

979
00:59:22,372 --> 00:59:26,042
The next hearing date
will be decided upon later.

980
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:27,585
All rise.

981
00:59:27,669 --> 00:59:30,380
Your Honor!

982
00:59:30,922 --> 00:59:31,756
Da-wit.

983
00:59:32,298 --> 00:59:33,383
Hey, Da-wit.

984
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,180
The ones with money and power

985
00:59:39,263 --> 00:59:42,642
knew how to protect themselves very well.

986
00:59:42,725 --> 00:59:45,645
They dragged out the trial
for a year and a half.

987
00:59:45,728 --> 00:59:47,647
I gave up on college
and tried to keep it going,

988
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:48,981
but in the end…

989
00:59:49,065 --> 00:59:51,067
The evidence the plaintiff has submitted

990
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,653
is not enough
to prove the defendant's negligence.

991
00:59:53,736 --> 00:59:56,072
The Court finds no basis
for the claim for damages.

992
00:59:56,155 --> 00:59:57,907
Therefore, this case is dismissed.

993
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:00,159
-All rise.
-Your Honor.

994
01:00:00,243 --> 01:00:03,663
Your Honor, the evidence is right here!

995
01:00:03,746 --> 01:00:05,832
-Your Honor!
-Da-wit.

996
01:00:11,045 --> 01:00:11,921
Mom.

997
01:00:13,005 --> 01:00:14,215
Mom!

998
01:00:14,298 --> 01:00:17,176
Mom, are you all right? Mom!

999
01:00:22,682 --> 01:00:24,058
Just promise me…

1000
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,436
two things.

1001
01:00:27,937 --> 01:00:29,105
Cremate me

1002
01:00:30,189 --> 01:00:32,775
and spread my ash over a river…

1003
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:36,863
so that you won't have to

1004
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,742
come to see me every year.

1005
01:00:41,826 --> 01:00:42,702
Okay?

1006
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,123
Mom.

1007
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,625
Don't look back.

1008
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:53,212
Keep moving forward.

1009
01:00:54,464 --> 01:00:55,590
Just keep moving forward…

1010
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:58,468
without stopping.

1011
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:04,182
Da-wit, you must…

1012
01:01:05,016 --> 01:01:06,934
become successful.

1013
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:11,731
You have to succeed

1014
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:14,484
so people won't look down on you.

1015
01:01:18,279 --> 01:01:19,947
Go as far…

1016
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:24,410
as you can, my son.

1017
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:27,663
Got it?

1018
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,043
Mom.

1019
01:01:32,627 --> 01:01:35,254
Mom…

1020
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:38,883
Mom.

1021
01:01:45,014 --> 01:01:47,350
Mom, no.

1022
01:01:48,017 --> 01:01:49,727
Mom!

1023
01:01:50,686 --> 01:01:53,147
No, Mom.

1024
01:01:57,151 --> 01:01:59,737
And that was how my mother passed away.

1025
01:02:00,488 --> 01:02:01,614
Only then

1026
01:02:02,198 --> 01:02:05,576
did Yoo give a small sum for compensation.

1027
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,994
Mom.

1028
01:02:09,038 --> 01:02:10,206
Even though…

1029
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:14,919
I couldn't keep my promise
to spread your ashes over a river,

1030
01:02:16,128 --> 01:02:18,422
I'll keep my promise to make it

1031
01:02:20,216 --> 01:02:21,551
as high as I can.

1032
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:39,402
I'll ease your sorrow, Mom.

1033
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:46,617
Mr. Kang…

1034
01:02:48,953 --> 01:02:50,872
That's why I chose a career in law.

1035
01:02:53,624 --> 01:02:54,876
I'm just like all of you.

1036
01:02:55,918 --> 01:02:59,672
I wanted to become a judge
who applied the law fairly to everyone

1037
01:02:59,755 --> 01:03:02,884
so that no one would feel
as if they were treated unjustly

1038
01:03:02,967 --> 01:03:05,219
like my mother was.

1039
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:06,137
You see,

1040
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:09,223
I'd never do anything
to embarrass my mother.

1041
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:12,018
I have many faults as a human being.

1042
01:03:12,101 --> 01:03:13,311
But as a judge,

1043
01:03:15,479 --> 01:03:17,273
I've never crossed the line.

1044
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,236
I'm sorry.

1045
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:26,949
I didn't know what you went through.

1046
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,077
I've been so mean to you.

1047
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:33,247
I just thought you were
some despicable guy

1048
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:35,541
who'd always been privileged
and on the fast track.

1049
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,753
I understand.

1050
01:03:38,836 --> 01:03:42,673
I do look especially elegant.

1051
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:45,092
I was right about the despicable part.

1052
01:03:46,928 --> 01:03:47,845
Mr. Kang.

1053
01:03:49,513 --> 01:03:51,974
I had no idea either.

1054
01:03:53,476 --> 01:03:55,311
It must have been so tough

1055
01:03:56,145 --> 01:03:58,189
-at such a young age.
-It's all right.

1056
01:03:58,272 --> 01:04:01,317
I'm not the only one
who's been through tough times.

1057
01:04:05,237 --> 01:04:06,739
What are you thinking so hard about?

1058
01:04:07,865 --> 01:04:09,033
At the very least,

1059
01:04:09,617 --> 01:04:11,243
you didn't recuse yourself.

1060
01:04:13,162 --> 01:04:13,996
What?

1061
01:04:15,957 --> 01:04:19,085
If you had trouble in the past
with the defendant Yoo Baek-man,

1062
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:22,171
shouldn't you have recused yourself?

1063
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,425
For a fair trial?

1064
01:04:26,509 --> 01:04:28,052
-Jun-u…
-What?

1065
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:30,179
Am I wrong?

1066
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:36,394
Jun-u's right.

1067
01:04:38,062 --> 01:04:38,980
Ms. Park…

1068
01:04:39,063 --> 01:04:40,940
Do you remember, Mr. Kang?

1069
01:04:42,817 --> 01:04:44,944
When I first brought up
Yoo Baek-man's name…

1070
01:04:45,027 --> 01:04:46,654
Do you know Mr. Yoo Baek-man?

1071
01:04:47,196 --> 01:04:49,615
Who is that? I don't know him.

1072
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:51,283
You said you didn't know him.

1073
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,579
-It's a name you wouldn't forget.
-Well, that's…

1074
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,790
I was briefly mistaken
to suddenly hear…

1075
01:04:57,873 --> 01:05:01,085
When I suddenly mentioned
trial manipulation, how did you respond?

1076
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:02,920
Yoo Jae-beom believes

1077
01:05:03,004 --> 01:05:05,172
that you rigged the trial.

1078
01:05:05,256 --> 01:05:06,966
That's ridiculous!

1079
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:11,387
Do you think I'd do such a thing?
A rigged trial? What do you take me for?

1080
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:14,640
You taught us about the instinctive
defensive mechanism of humans.

1081
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:17,143
If it never happened,

1082
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:19,645
she would've denied it
without any unnecessary comments.

1083
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:23,566
"I'm not a bad person."
"Who do you think I am?" Blah, blah.

1084
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:25,735
Making such unnecessary comments

1085
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:29,488
is derived from the instinctive
defensive mechanism of humans.

1086
01:05:30,072 --> 01:05:30,948
That's right.

1087
01:05:32,533 --> 01:05:34,493
That long story you just told us was also…

1088
01:05:36,746 --> 01:05:40,166
You taught us back then
when we knew nothing.

1089
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:41,917
Of course, it's your fault.

1090
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:45,254
No matter how much you explain,
they're just motives for the crime.

1091
01:05:47,548 --> 01:05:48,674
Ms. Park.

1092
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:52,636
The painful story you shared with us.

1093
01:05:53,554 --> 01:05:56,265
In the end, that's a strong motive.

1094
01:05:57,266 --> 01:05:58,142
Is it not?

1095
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:28,964
I've taught you well.

1096
01:06:35,054 --> 01:06:35,888
Yes.

1097
01:06:36,597 --> 01:06:39,016
-I did it.
-Mr. Kang!

1098
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,477
Did you really rig the trial?

1099
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,020
Seriously?

1100
01:06:43,604 --> 01:06:45,189
Now that we're not on the same side,

1101
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:47,441
I better exercise
my right to remain silent.

1102
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,032
See you in court, everyone.

1103
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:29,942
PRO BONO

1104
01:07:52,047 --> 01:07:54,300
-Do you have an attorney?
-I'll be representing myself.

1105
01:07:54,383 --> 01:07:56,135
Those people have nothing to do with me.

1106
01:07:56,218 --> 01:07:57,678
They're below my standard.

1107
01:07:58,929 --> 01:08:00,723
-Father?
-His father-in-law?

1108
01:08:00,806 --> 01:08:02,641
Thank goodness you went undercover!

1109
01:08:02,725 --> 01:08:03,559
You taught us well.

1110
01:08:03,642 --> 01:08:05,519
Just know that all approvals
on Team Pro Bono

1111
01:08:05,603 --> 01:08:07,354
will go through me from now on.

1112
01:08:07,438 --> 01:08:08,647
Under someone like him,

1113
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:10,024
Team Pro Bono can't do anything.

1114
01:08:10,107 --> 01:08:11,442
If they can't do anything,

1115
01:08:11,525 --> 01:08:12,902
I'll have to lay them off.

1116
01:08:12,985 --> 01:08:15,404
Is it weird for an attorney
to follow the firm's order?

1117
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,447
I'll retain counsel.

1118
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,741
I'm Oh Jung-in,
attorney for defendant Kang Da-wit.

1119
01:08:18,824 --> 01:08:21,869
Are a person's intentions that simple?

1120
01:08:21,952 --> 01:08:23,954
Is it okay for the others
to judge them so rashly?

1121
01:08:24,038 --> 01:08:27,708
If they interfere in matters they had
no authority over, no crime is committed.

1122
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:28,792
"Not guilty."

1123
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:31,045
I want to hear the truth from you.

1124
01:08:31,128 --> 01:08:33,339
The desire for revenge
against Yoo Baek-man.

1125
01:08:33,422 --> 01:08:36,008
Did that influence your trial?

1126
01:08:43,182 --> 01:08:45,184
