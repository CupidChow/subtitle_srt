00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,950
It's been a while,

3
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:55,535
Mr. Yoo Jae-beom.

4
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:00,165
Yes, it has been a while, Ms. Oh.

5
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,543
Sir, please drive safely.

6
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,515
All right, Detective Woo.

7
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,893
There are tons
of pork rind places in Mapo-dong,

8
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:21,769
but this place is the most legit.

9
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:22,729
Okay?

10
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:23,938
Here.

11
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,025
Here. Have a piece.

12
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:29,402
Right here!

13
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:34,782
This was right where I was scammed.

14
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:37,619
How could a judge like you get scammed?

15
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:41,080
He pretended to be a hometown buddy
and ran after borrowing money from you?

16
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:45,126
I was never going to come back here but…

17
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,130
So, where is that rotten Yoo Jae-beom
right now?

18
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:51,090
He was hiding in Cambodia.

19
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:53,843
Then, he entered Korea a year ago
with a forged passport.

20
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:56,221
-His whereabouts are unknown after that.
-Really?

21
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:01,017
And then, he approached me.

22
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,020
He even knew about my first crush.

23
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:06,147
How in the world
did he find out about my history?

24
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,776
Actually,

25
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,362
I have a question to ask you.

26
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:14,197
Me? What is it?

27
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:18,660
When Yoo Jae-beom
entered Korea at Incheon Airport,

28
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:21,204
he got a burner phone
with his forged passport.

29
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:23,164
-I looked through the call history.
-And?

30
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:26,334
And one number popped up frequently.

31
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:39,097
-This number…
-Yes.

32
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:41,891
Located in Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul,

33
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:44,519
at Seoul Central District Court's
Criminal Division,

34
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,938
it's Chief Judge Kang Da-wit's office.

35
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,107
That's your number, right?

36
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,733
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:54,404
Why would I talk on the phone
with that punk? I've never called…

38
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:58,366
Your classmate
from elementary school called.

39
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,287
"Kim Ju-seop"? Who's that?

40
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,873
-He said "Juvenile" would ring a bell.
-Juvenile?

41
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,002
Right. Kim Juvenile.

42
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:14,090
What? Did you remember something?

43
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:19,804
Good morning!

44
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:23,349
Sir, have you agreed
to the screening process?

45
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,434
No way.

46
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,401
PRO BONO

00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:34,986
COURT IN SESSION

48
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:39,115
-Byeol!
-Byeol!

49
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:43,369
Thank you so much, Mr. Kang.

50
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:45,788
We can't thank you enough.

51
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:47,373
Honestly. Thank you, everyone.

52
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,209
Byeol!

53
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,879
I thought we would never see her again.

54
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:55,506
Thank you.

55
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:59,344
But is it really all over now?

56
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:02,638
What if they appeal and harass us again?

57
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:04,807
Don't worry. They can't appeal.

58
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:06,768
Just trust me.

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,644
I'll protect you.

60
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:20,573
Let's go.

61
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:27,663
Ms. Park.

62
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,708
Why are you blushing?

63
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,127
-What?
-Do you have a fever?

64
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:38,424
No, it's all right.
I don't have a fever. I'm fine.

65
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:42,136
What was that reaction?

66
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:46,182
All right. If you're fine, then good.

67
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:47,266
Geez.

68
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,267
Let's go, then.

69
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,644
Let's go.

70
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:54,232
The reason why they can't appeal is

71
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:57,151
they changed their words,
so their accusation doesn't stand.

72
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:01,197
-Byeol did a good job too.
-This isn't good.

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,117
My heart is acting up again.

74
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:06,744
The heart of a nerd.

75
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:10,206
Wingardium Leviosa!

76
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:12,708
Wingardium Leviosa!

77
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:15,253
Lumos!

78
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,090
Wingardium Leviosa!

79
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:23,886
Wingardium Leviosa!

80
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,268
When I went to court
for the first time in my life,

81
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,187
it was nothing but a scary place.

82
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,399
Wingardium Leviosa.

83
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:38,192
The Court rules…

84
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:43,698
Mom!

85
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,578
The spell cast by the judge in that moment

86
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,873
was more incredible than any other spell

87
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:54,500
from Harry Potter.

88
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,505
CRIMINAL LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS

89
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:04,594
"Guardians must raise their children
according to their developmental stages

90
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:07,680
in a safe and healthy manner in the home."

91
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:10,057
Article 99 of the Civil Code defines

92
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:12,143
movable and immovable assets.

93
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:13,686
Then, in that case,

94
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:17,440
is Howl's Moving Castle
a movable asset or an immovable asset?

95
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,776
Howl's Moving…

96
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,861
And my second question.

97
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:24,197
Park Gi-ppeum.

98
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,489
Yes, Professor?

99
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:28,034
-You did great on the interview.
-Thank you, sir.

100
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:30,786
Now that the interview is over,
let's talk freely.

101
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:32,997
Why do you want to practice law?

102
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,916
This is an industry in decline now.

103
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:38,419
As I said earlier,
I want to protect basic human rights

104
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:41,214
-and social justice--
-Come on. The interview's over.

105
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:43,007
Not that stuff. The real reason.

106
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:48,429
-That's the real reason.
-Okay, then.

107
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:51,015
But being a nerd and reality
were two different things.

108
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:53,309
After that,
nothing had made my heart pound

109
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,645
for a very long time.

110
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:59,065
-But…
-This poor abandoned dog

111
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:01,192
was brutally abused and thrown out.

112
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:05,988
Is she really the dog you lost?

113
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,032
No! No, it's not mine.

114
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,534
My heart raced in that moment…

115
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:12,536
for a split second.

116
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:16,123
Geez.

117
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,000
Forget about it,

118
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:19,710
and just trust me.

119
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:22,213
I mean, what's there to worry about?

120
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:24,298
Kang Da-wit, the people's judge, is here.

121
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:27,510
Of course, your skills are incredible.

122
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:30,179
-I admire you. I really do.
-Then, what's the problem?

123
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:33,975
Doing this international patent case
worth trillions

124
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,937
that's between conglomerates
doesn't seem right.

125
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,982
We're a pro bono team, after all.

126
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:43,818
Geez. This is so frustrating.

127
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:46,654
What's public interest?

128
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:49,240
We're one team now,

129
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:51,993
so let's speak honestly.

130
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:54,370
If we win and make a lot of money,

131
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,622
where does that money go?

132
00:07:56,706 --> 00:08:00,626
The money circulates, so the common folk
and disadvantaged will benefit from it.

133
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:04,922
Making money is
the most pro bono thing we can do.

134
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,882
Day and night, we do these.

135
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:09,594
These cases don't even make money.

136
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,220
We expend energy for nothing.

137
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:13,514
Why on earth do we do these?

138
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:15,224
What's this? A refugee case?

139
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:17,935
Young people are livid
that they can't find jobs these days.

140
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,980
Who'd be happy
about foreigners coming in?

141
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:24,525
What else? Human rights for people
with disabilities? It sounds wonderful.

142
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:26,819
Right? But whenever people
with disabilities protest,

143
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:29,822
do you know how angry people get
when they can't properly commute?

144
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:33,409
God, instead of stuff like this,

145
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:34,952
let's do something classy--

146
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:38,080
I can't listen to this anymore!

147
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:43,628
Do I have to keep listening to him deny
the very existence of pro bono cases?

148
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:45,004
What? You have nothing to say?

149
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:47,506
Am I the only one who's uncomfortable?

150
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:49,508
Come on, Ms. Yoo.

151
00:08:49,592 --> 00:08:52,094
Why does everything
make you so uncomfortable?

152
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:55,014
If you're uncomfortable,
go and sit somewhere comfortable.

153
00:09:00,603 --> 00:09:02,188
You stupid boomer!

154
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:04,690
What?

155
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:06,108
"Stupid boomer"?

156
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:07,902
Unbelievable.

157
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:09,111
What? "Boomer"?

158
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:11,113
I've never been called that before.

159
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:13,574
Hey, Ms. Yoo. What did you say? "Boomer"?

160
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:14,492
What?

161
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:17,912
Back in my day, you wouldn't dare
speak that way to senior colleagues!

162
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:20,373
-My heart of a nerd…
-"Boomer?" Man, things have changed.

163
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:22,249
It must have been a false alarm.

164
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,877
No wonder they say
face reading was a science.

165
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,505
He didn't seem right from the start.

166
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:28,839
Excuse me, Mr. Kang.

167
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:30,883
Which graduating class
are you from, Ms. Yoo?

168
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:32,635
-Mr. Kang.
-Ms. Yoo--

169
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:37,807
What now, Ms. Park?

170
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,851
Why did you come to Team Pro Bono?

171
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:46,524
Why are you suddenly asking?

172
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:49,193
You said it yourself.

173
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:52,113
You used to handle only the classy cases.

174
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:55,533
Why did you quit being a judge

175
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:56,992
and come here?

176
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:00,246
Did you know, Mr. Kang?

177
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,416
If there are people in this world
who always win,

178
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:06,377
there are people who always lose as well.

179
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,047
No matter how hard they try,
they're too weak to fight the world.

180
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:13,008
Pro bono attorneys exist
to help people like them,

181
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:17,680
not to handle classy cases
or cases they always win.

182
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,145
Why do you think I wouldn't know

183
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,273
about the ones who always lose?

184
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:31,152
The ones too weak to fight the world,
no matter how hard they try.

185
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,321
You think I don't know?

186
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,371
But do you know what it's like, Ms. Park?

187
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,957
Have you even tried
to earn your own tuition yourself?

188
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:47,418
You're crossing the line, Mr. Kang.

189
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:49,545
Right. This is an uncomfortable question.

190
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:52,006
You must've been offended.
Sorry. Excuse me.

191
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,884
No. Thanks to my parents,

192
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,386
I grew up comfortably
and was raised by a loving family.

193
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,554
Yes, I can surely tell.

194
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,347
And what about it?

195
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:02,183
Is that a problem?

196
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,267
No, who says it is?

197
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,061
That's great. Gosh, how amazing.

198
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:09,440
Someone raised with love
is worrying about the people in need.

199
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:11,901
How honorable.
Any thoughts of becoming a politician?

200
00:11:11,984 --> 00:11:14,028
I'll help you.
I have a lot of connections.

201
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,280
Oh, my gosh!

202
00:11:17,072 --> 00:11:17,907
Ms. Park.

203
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,288
2025 SEOUL QUEER FESTIVAL

204
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,336
Follow me.
You have to come to see me, sister.

205
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,005
I wish we could get married.

206
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:37,259
We're just a tiny bit different.
That's all.

207
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,053
Please try to understand.

208
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:41,138
We'll walk you down the aisle!

209
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,306
We're with you.

210
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:43,891
Please give us a hug!

211
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:47,144
We as attorneys support LGBTQIA+ rights.

212
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:48,687

00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,272

Free T-shirt. Your signature.

220
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:06,789
Geez, we're attorneys.
What are we doing here?

221
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:10,626
One of the main jobs of pro bono attorneys
is supporting human rights groups.

222
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:12,545
We're with you.

223
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,673
Come get a T-shirt!

224
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:20,886
Damn. This isn't working.

225
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,805
-It's not working, is it?
-No, this won't do.

226
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:25,766
-We shouldn't act like attorneys here.
-You're right.

227
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,184
Yes. Let's get going.

228
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:29,061
What?

229
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:30,896
What is it?

230
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:33,274
Follow us!

231
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:34,817
Geez!

232
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,236
-What is it?
-Nan-hui!

233
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,989
GET A T-SHIRT BY DONATING
AND TAKING OUR SURVEY

234
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:42,825
-Okay, come on out.
-Hey!

235
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:48,455
I'm a public figure.
What if someone recognizes--

236
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:51,250
If you're at a festival,
you should dress for the occasion.

237
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,044
Occasion, my foot. You really think
people would come for this?

238
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:55,671
Could we take a photo with you?

239
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:57,172
Please, just one!

240
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:58,257
-They came.
-I'll take it.

241
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,884
-Thank you!
-Okay. One, two, three.

242
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:02,970
You look so pretty!

243
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,972
You're so beautiful.

244
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:08,225
No, I'm a real manly man.

245
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:09,560
Why am I speaking like this?

246
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:11,353
-We'll root you. Good luck.
-Good luck.

247
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,939
Excuse me, could you come over here
and sign your names?

248
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:15,608
-Okay.
-Thank you.

249
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:17,610
Sign here and take your T-shirts.

250
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:18,861
Ms. Yoo, give me my pants.

251
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:19,945
We want a photo too!

252
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:21,405
Please take a photo with us!

253
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:24,033
-Could you take it for us?
-Should I take it? Okay.

254
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:25,784
Here we go. One, two, three.

255
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,621
-Thank you. Now, stop.
-One, two, three. Great!

256
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:29,997
-Ms. Yoo.
-Smile!

257
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,666
-Can't we take a few more, please?
-My goodness.

258
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:34,960
One, two, three.

259
00:13:35,044 --> 00:13:37,171
That's enough, Ms. Yoo. Thank you.

260
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:39,214
Let's take it together!

261
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:40,424
Together!

262
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:42,301
Okay. That's enough, Ms. Yoo!

263
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,306
Great. We'll all take one together.

264
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:49,391
-Okay, one, two, three!
-Me too!

265
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:50,434
Let me join you!

266
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:52,061
-Here we go.
-How many are we taking?

267
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:54,396
I'll take it now. Everyone, smile!

268
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,818
Listen, Ms. Park.

269
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:02,529
Do you intend to drag me along
to these random places all day?

270
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,449
-You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?
-My gosh.

271
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:08,410
What do you mean? This is the daily life
of a pro bono attorney.

272
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:12,206
When there's a question on legal issues,
we have to answer them.

273
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,501
Of course,

274
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:19,171
that is if there is a question.

275
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:24,468
-Sorry.
-It's empty.

276
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:27,471
I worked really hard
to prepare a press release too.

277
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:29,431
It's all right.

278
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:30,349
Attorney Kang!

279
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,728
Are you okay?

280
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,731
I'm okay. How was the festival?

281
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,067
Wait, what's going on?

282
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,819
Hold on. Let's go.

283
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,571
Wait, what is it?

284
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:46,198
Hello.

285
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:47,908
How have you been?

286
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:51,203
Mr. Jang must have brought
a reporter he knows again.

287
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:52,746
He did this last time too.

288
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:57,084
"Mushrooms" has more connections
than I thought.

289
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,378
-Let's go!
-He knows everyone here.

290
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,755
In this field, Mr. Jang

291
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:03,799
-is a legend.
-What?

292
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:07,094
Back in college,
he fought against hired thugs

293
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,138
at the site of an illegal slum clearance,

294
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:12,516
and he was such a menace
that even the thugs were scared.

295
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,101
-Attorney Jang?
-Yes.

296
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:16,687
No way. That's nonsense.

297
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,480
But that suit…

298
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,441
Though it looks worn out,

299
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:24,737
it's similar to the Italian luxury brand
that I saw at a Cheongdam-dong boutique.

300
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,488
Is it a knockoff?

301
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:28,907
Could I ask you a question?

302
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,534
Yes, go ahead.

303
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:31,910
Okay.

304
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:33,245
Nice to meet you.

305
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:35,706
I'm journalist Ko Il-ju
of Stepping Forward Together.

306
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:39,126
Geez, the only one person
who came is a journalist

307
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,045
from a labor movement organization.

308
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:44,006
They're basically peas in a pod.

309
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:50,763
Hey, Jung-in. I was going to call you.
I'm trying to cooperate as you told me to,

310
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:52,139
but do I really have to--

311
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:53,724
You want us to come back?

312
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:58,604
Ms. Park. She wants us to come back.
Hurry up. Let's go!

313
00:15:58,687 --> 00:15:59,730
Where are you going?

314
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:04,735
The jury trial of the abandoned dog case

315
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:06,987
has become the talk of the town.

316
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:10,032
The fact that Oh & Partners,
Korea's top major law firm,

317
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:13,911
defended the case for free
has grabbed people's attention.

318
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:16,497
To be honest, for the common folk,

319
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,749
they think of Oh & Partners
as being so high up there

320
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:21,043
that you can't even be reached.

321
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,880
Yes. People have thought of us that way.

322
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:25,798
We admit it.

323
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:29,051
But the world has changed now, hasn't it?

324
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:34,014
So we must change as well.
It'd be no fun for us to miss out

325
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:36,934
on social responsibility
and the changing times.

326
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:40,479
We hope you look forward
to the new Oh & Partners.

327
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,732
Isn't the fact
that a young female attorney

328
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:47,861
has become CEO
a shocking change in itself?

329
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:56,036
I'm going to create a world
where my age and gender

330
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:59,164
doesn't become a news topic.

331
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,624
I see.

332
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,709
That's amazing.

333
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:05,879
Also, Attorney Kang Da-wit,
who's known as "the people's judge,"

334
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:07,131
took on the case.

335
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:09,424
I heard you two trained
at the JRTI together.

336
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:12,553
Could you tell me a bit
about how you were able to recruit him?

337
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:15,889
Well, you can ask him that for yourself.

338
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:18,767
Should we take a break?

339
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:21,812
My goodness.

340
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:24,314
You're good at your job, Ms. Oh.

341
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:26,483
You were pretty good
at answering questions too.

342
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:29,403
You still have the vibes
of "the people's judge."

343
00:17:29,987 --> 00:17:31,697
There's something I'm curious about.

344
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,948
What is it?

345
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,200
Why haven't you asked me?

346
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:36,618
About what?

347
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:44,334
You haven't asked me once
about what made me quit as a judge.

348
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,214
Have you seen the video, by any chance?

349
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:57,890
Do I have to know about it?

350
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,934
What?

351
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:03,979
You still don't get it.

352
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:08,192
Do you know how many people work here?

353
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:10,944
We have more than 1,000 attorneys.

354
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:15,324
Including paralegals, secretaries,
and other staff, how many does that make?

355
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,327
Do you know how many of them
are former justices,

356
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:23,207
chief prosecutors, government ministers,
tax commissioners, and bank CEOs?

357
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,252
The politicians who fought us
in the name of democracy

358
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,338
and so-called moral compass journalists.

359
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:32,966
We make them advisors, and they diligently
come to work and get paid.

360
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:39,932
Oh & Partners is basically Korea.
Do you understand?

361
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:50,484
Sorry, Da-wit.

362
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:55,697
I don't have enough free time
to worry about each employee's situation.

363
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:59,284
Well, have a good day.

364
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:14,508
Hello, Mr. Kang.

365
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:17,344
-Hi. Where are the others?
-They're out on business.

366
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:19,638
-You were great on the news yesterday.
-Thank you.

367
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:22,557
By the way, someone saw the interview
and came looking for you.

368
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,434
He insisted on meeting you.

369
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:25,352
What?

370
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,528
Who are you suing again?

371
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:35,654
God.

372
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:38,115
I just told you.

373
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:40,826
Are you a Christian? Catholic?

374
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:41,827
Neither.

375
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:44,371
You can't trust anyone in this world.

376
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:45,831
I don't believe in anything.

377
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:47,749
Then why?

378
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,960
I want compensation for damages.

379
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:51,628
A huge sum.

380
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:55,132
Damages?
That's a civil case, not a criminal one.

381
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:58,010
Okay, then. What did God do wrong to you?

382
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:01,847
He brought me into this world.

383
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,058
-What?
-I never asked

384
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,644
to be born this way.

385
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,022
No one wanted me…

386
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,025
to be born at all,

387
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:14,484
including my mom

388
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,695
and my dad, who I've never met.

389
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:20,282
So, please represent me for free.

390
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:23,660
You said you'd do it.

391
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:24,578
I did?

392
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:27,539
I left the court that I'd devoted
my entire life to

393
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:29,041
because I just humbly

394
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,129
want to be there
for people who are in pain.

395
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,506
When those who are without help

396
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,258
and who are vulnerable come to me,

397
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:42,429
I'll help them
with legal knowledge and experience

398
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:44,097
I've gained throughout my life.

399
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:49,811
Well, I don't think you understand
because you're young.

400
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:51,855
But a trial can only happen
when it makes sense

401
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:54,232
and when there's a chance to win.

402
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:57,778
Isn't it your job as an attorney
to make sense out of it?

403
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,529
Are you an attorney? Why are you arguing?

404
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:02,407
Whatever.
Just take on my case for damages.

405
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,326
So what is it?

406
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,330
Are your hospital bills the loss
that God needs to compensate?

407
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:12,084
I can't be cured anyways.

408
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,169
I was…

409
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:19,841
born paralyzed from the waist down.

410
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,263
Okay, so what damages--

411
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:27,933
I already told you.
The fact that I was born.

412
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:31,937
My very existence
in this world itself is damaging.

413
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:35,857
It would've been much better

414
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:38,402
if I'd never been born at all.

415
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:54,584
-Did you send him away?
-I finally did. What a stubborn kid.

416
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:57,337
I don't know how he got here
when he lives in Bucheon.

417
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,214
Bucheon? You sent him off alone?

418
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,757
I grabbed him a large cab.

419
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:03,468
I paid the driver generously
with my own money.

420
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:05,137
Yeah? Good job.

421
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:07,639
-Sir.
-What is it?

422
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:10,308
He was a guest who came for you.

423
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:12,644
Guest, my foot. So?

424
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:18,275
I paid a generous amount to take him
all the way to Bucheon, which is…

425
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:19,901
Okay. Good job.

426
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:23,029
-Right.
-Do you have something to say?

427
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:25,657
No, sir.

428
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:29,244
Let's go and grab some soju.

429
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:30,829
What? Okay!

430
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:45,927
I already told you.
The fact that I was born.

431
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:49,890
My very existence
in this world itself is damaging.

432
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:53,476
Gosh, what an awful thing
for a child to say.

433
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:56,605
You feel bad for him, don't you?

434
00:22:57,439 --> 00:23:00,650
These pro bono cases tend to be…

435
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:04,404
Of course, these cases must be new to you,

436
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:06,198
-so it must be--
-They're not my first.

437
00:23:06,781 --> 00:23:07,866
Sorry?

438
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:11,036
When I was first appointed,
I was at a small court and did everything.

439
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,621
When I was an associate judge,

440
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:15,373
I oversaw rehabilitation
and bankruptcy cases too.

441
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:17,876
But gosh, I couldn't bear them.

442
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,045
Because there were too many cases?

443
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:22,130
Well, that was part of it.

444
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:24,883
But every day, people would go bankrupt,

445
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:26,760
get sick, or commit suicide.

446
00:23:26,843 --> 00:23:28,720
That was all I saw every day,

447
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:30,513
so it was tough.

448
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,725
Even if you manage to put out the fires,

449
00:23:33,808 --> 00:23:35,310
they're bound to keep happening.

450
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:36,436
You're right.

451
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:40,357
That's why I want cases
that involve people with money and power.

452
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,692
That might be easier on my mind.

453
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:44,945
And…

454
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:46,780
I'd make more money too.

455
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:50,242
Geez. Here.

456
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:52,661
Thank you, sir.

457
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:07,300
-Wait, let's grab a beer…
-Beer, my foot.

458
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:09,803
Hey, this is for the taxi.

459
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:16,518
-It only costs me 20,000 won to get home.
-Yeah, bring back the change tomorrow.

460
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,064
Thank you, Da-wit!

461
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:22,440
Get home safely!

462
00:24:22,524 --> 00:24:24,067
I'll see you tomorrow!

463
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:27,279
Geez. What an exhausting guy.

464
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:35,036
Hey, how did it go?

465
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,830
I followed her after work.

466
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:39,457
She went to a VIP room
in Sejin University Hospital.

467
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:41,668
She's coming out now.

468
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:44,337
She probably went to see her grandmother.

469
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:46,131
Did she need more money for the hospital?

470
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:49,384
-Should I keep following her?
-Yeah, keep tabs on her for now.

471
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:51,720
Find out who she's meeting with.

472
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:53,930
There must be someone else.

473
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:56,516
Judge Kang.

474
00:24:57,058 --> 00:24:59,436
I'm grateful you sent me to jail
to knock sense into me

475
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,772
and for finding me a job later on.

476
00:25:03,481 --> 00:25:06,234
But aren't you making me work
too much right now?

477
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:10,864
-You're going to pay me well, right?
-Cut it out. Bye.

478
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:16,202
Geez.

479
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:18,747
Taxi!

480
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:20,248
Hello.

481
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,043
Sadang-dong, please.

482
00:25:24,627 --> 00:25:25,462
Sir, could you…

483
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:32,052
THIS IS A DEAF TAXI DRIVER

484
00:25:32,135 --> 00:25:33,011
I see.

485
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:36,348
Sadang Station, Exit 2.

486
00:25:37,724 --> 00:25:39,642
The ride has begun.

487
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:43,063
Please wear your seatbelt for your safety.

488
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,445
DRIVER'S MESSAGE
TAP ARM TO PULL OVER

489
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:04,584
Please take all your belongings
before you leave.

490
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,173
Sir.

491
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:12,801
Thank you very much.

492
00:27:22,412 --> 00:27:23,997
I said no.

493
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,915
-You said you'd do it.
-When did I ever?

494
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:28,585
-Should I play the video again?
-That was just for TV.

495
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:31,379
Are judges allowed to go on TV and lie?

496
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:34,466
When did I ever lie?
Also, I'm not a judge. I'm an attorney.

497
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,593
Then, I'll go on TV too.

498
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:40,805
I'll go and ask if it's all right
for an attorney to lie on TV.

499
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:43,016
Are you an attorney?
Why do you keep arguing with me?

500
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:44,058
Come here.

501
00:27:44,142 --> 00:27:45,602
-Goodness.
-He's fast.

502
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:49,189
Come here. Let's send you home…

503
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:50,440
Who's the real attorney here?

504
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:51,649
-That kid is.
-Hey.

505
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,319
Geez!

506
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:56,070
Good morning, sir.

507
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:58,448
It's not a good morning.

508
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,247
Occupied.

509
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:09,459
It's occupied.

510
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:10,376
I know.

511
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,129
You little…

512
00:28:14,964 --> 00:28:16,591
Here you go.

513
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:24,516
I grabbed all the desserts I could find
around here.

514
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:26,976
-Do you like this one the most?
-Yes.

515
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:30,438
Oh, my gosh.

516
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:31,439
May I help you?

517
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:33,483
-Kim Gang-hun.
-Ms. Jung.

518
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:34,484
Why are you here?

519
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:38,780
What's going on?

520
00:28:38,863 --> 00:28:42,575
Do you want to see me dead?
I've been looking everywhere for you!

521
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,786
Why can't you just stay put at home?

522
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:47,455
-Ma'am, we can sit and talk calmly--
-Move!

523
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:48,790
Hey…

524
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:50,708
Let go!

525
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:53,503
Let go of me!

526
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:55,713
I'll call the police for child abuse.

527
00:28:55,797 --> 00:28:58,424
Let go!

528
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:00,468
Don't.

529
00:29:02,136 --> 00:29:04,472
I have nowhere else to go anyway.

530
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:09,060
Don't do it. It's pointless.

531
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:22,073
She isn't like that all the time.

532
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:26,244
She takes antidepressants,
but I guess she can't control it well.

533
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:29,956
-Yes, ma'am. I just found my son…
-She's like that sometimes.

534
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:33,084
I think your mom
should seek professional help--

535
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:36,254
I don't want to be put into care. No way.

536
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:40,717
-Gang-hun, your mom--
-My mom told me.

537
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:45,054
She was abandoned by her parents
when she was nine.

538
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:47,849
After running away from the orphanage
because she hated it,

539
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:51,936
she lived in a place
where runaway kids stayed together.

540
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:56,232
But then, she got pregnant with me
when she was 16.

541
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,736
Gang-hun.

542
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:05,783
If God does exist,
I really want to ask Him.

543
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:09,662
What on earth was He thinking?

544
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:14,542
Why did He…

545
00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:19,631
To someone like me…

546
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:23,217
Gang-hun.

547
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,222
I guess you have to go now.

548
00:30:34,938 --> 00:30:36,356
Get home safely, ma'am.

549
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,415
MIN'S STREET BAR

550
00:30:57,877 --> 00:30:59,462
Did you say we should take on the case?

551
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:02,840
-Yes.
-You actually think there's a case here?

552
00:31:02,924 --> 00:31:04,968
Even if we might not win,

553
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:07,011
some might take interest in this.

554
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:10,181
Is a trial a live charity show
to help the needy?

555
00:31:10,264 --> 00:31:12,475
It could be a meaningful case.

556
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:15,853
It can raise the issue
that the marginalized and disabled--

557
00:31:15,937 --> 00:31:17,230
Gosh, you sound entitled.

558
00:31:17,313 --> 00:31:18,982
-Mr. Kang.
-What?

559
00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:21,067
Did I say something uncomfortable again?

560
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,610
If so, then instead…

561
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:26,948
Let's ask Mr. Jang.

562
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:28,282
Mr. Jang, what do you think?

563
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:34,372
Stop picking out
and eating just the mushrooms!

564
00:31:34,914 --> 00:31:37,375
Well, it won't be easy.

565
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,502
It's not an easy task

566
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:42,005
to stand before the court.

567
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:44,632
Gang-hun could get hurt too.

568
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:48,219
I also think it won't be easy.

569
00:31:48,302 --> 00:31:50,304
It's obvious the case would be dismissed.

570
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:52,807
First of all, if the defendant is God,

571
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:56,352
I don't know what His mailing address is.

572
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:57,770
-Geez.
-What?

573
00:31:57,854 --> 00:32:01,691
I'll make it so it'll make sense legally,
no matter what.

574
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:02,608
And then--

575
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:06,738
Do you know how painful false hope is?

576
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:10,783
Geez.

577
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:14,579
-I'm a stupid boomer.
-Oh, my gosh.

578
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:16,080
So I'll say one more thing.

579
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:19,542
What Ms. Park is saying right now
are the typical thoughts of a person

580
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,128
who was raised delicately,
like a flower in a greenhouse.

581
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:23,963
-Mr. Kang.
-You said you grew up comfortably

582
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:25,423
and was raised by a loving family.

583
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:29,552
People like that
don't know what real struggle is.

584
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:32,263
Raise a societal issue?

585
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:34,223
It could be meaningful
even though we'd lose?

586
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:37,268
What kind of help would that give the kid?

587
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:39,395
But a pro bono case is--

588
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:44,067
You came to this firm to make money too.

589
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,071
After entering the top law firm in Korea
with good grades,

590
00:32:48,154 --> 00:32:52,450
I don't know and don't want to know
what could've possibly changed your mind.

591
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:56,704
But let's not say things
that are totally unrealistic.

592
00:32:58,831 --> 00:33:00,249
You want to do something good?

593
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:05,338
Just donate to charity instead.
You can pay for this too.

594
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:08,674
For crying out loud.

595
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:11,177
Mr. Kang…

596
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,362
It could be meaningful
even though we'd lose?

597
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:32,240
What kind of help would that give the kid?

598
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:34,450
Maybe he's right.

599
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:38,996
There is a risk of social criticism,

600
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,791
so a legal countermeasure
should also be carried out.

601
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:43,000
Thank you.

602
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,753
Gosh. You're indeed excellent, Gi-ppeum.

603
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:48,840
You compared the pros and cons
of each plan very well.

604
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:50,341
Thank you.

605
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,136
Okay, everyone. We'll go with Plan C then.

606
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:54,679
-Yes, sir.
-What? Sir.

607
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:58,808
Plan C, as I mentioned in the report--

608
00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:01,435
Through a loophole
in the Labor Standards Act,

609
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,814
it'd be a way for companies
to lay off a massive number of employees.

610
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:05,773
Yeah, that was good.

611
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:08,067
Yes, so instead of Plan C,
Plan A should be…

612
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:11,195
It's a legal circumvention,
so it's not illegal.

613
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:14,949
It reduces legal risks
and a large amount of labor cost.

614
00:34:15,032 --> 00:34:17,743
-There's no reason not to go with it.
-Yes.

615
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:19,203
Well…

616
00:34:20,454 --> 00:34:21,414
Still…

617
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:22,331
Ms. Park.

618
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:26,419
Don't you have enough experience
to not be that naive anymore?

619
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,047
Stop thinking about useless things
and focus on the numbers.

620
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:32,425
Revenue, costs, profits.

621
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,094
Right, everyone?

622
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:36,220
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

623
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,517
Hello.

624
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:44,478
LAUNCHING TEAM PRO BONO

625
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,692
OUR PLEDGE TO PUBLIC INTEREST STARTS NOW

626
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:52,570
IN-HOUSE TEAM FOR PUBLIC INTEREST CASES

627
00:34:57,158 --> 00:34:59,410
Listen, Gi-ppeum.

628
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:02,163
Do you know how hard it is
to get into our team?

629
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:05,708
But you want to leave our team
and join the pro bono team?

630
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:09,545
-It's because I like that work.
-Come on. Stop it.

631
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:11,214
Will you tell me the real reason?

632
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:13,925
Do you want to be a politician?
Is it to build a political career?

633
00:35:14,508 --> 00:35:15,426
No.

634
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:18,596
It's what I really want to do, sir.

635
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,806
Or is it this?
"I want to change the world!"

636
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,016
Something like that?

637
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:24,518
I don't know anything
about such grand ideas.

638
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:27,563
I just want to deal with people
rather than numbers.

639
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:30,441
I want to do work
that helps people in need.

640
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,197
I had no idea
you were such a noble person.

641
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:38,950
Okay. I get it.

642
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:40,868
Let's be honest.

643
00:35:40,952 --> 00:35:43,037
What's the real reason?

644
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,750
Is it that weird

645
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:51,379
for wanting to live life
by doing good things

646
00:35:51,462 --> 00:35:52,838
without any other motives?

647
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:56,133
Why does everyone not believe me?

648
00:35:57,635 --> 00:35:59,470
Why do we have to prove good will

649
00:35:59,553 --> 00:36:01,806
and assume selfishness?

650
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:21,617
All right, Gi-ppeum.

651
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,744
Don't be intimidated.

652
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:27,039
Go home and eat something tasty.

653
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:29,667
Let's do it.

654
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:34,380
Let's go.

655
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:43,055
Hello, everyone.

656
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:45,641
Hello.

657
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:47,143
Hello, Mr. Jang.

658
00:36:51,272 --> 00:36:52,898
Are these also mushrooms?

659
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:55,026
They're so pretty.

660
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:02,658
Did you put them here, Mr. Jang?

661
00:37:03,326 --> 00:37:05,619
They're called
the half-dyed slender Caesar.

662
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:07,621
They grow in greenhouses.

663
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:12,126
But they grow well outside too.
Strong and well.

664
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:16,922
Mr. Jang.

665
00:37:18,341 --> 00:37:19,175
You can do it.

666
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:21,802
I can do it.

667
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:24,805
I have to go to the archive room.

668
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:26,557
Geez.

669
00:37:28,642 --> 00:37:30,436
-Geez, these keep falling--
-Here.

670
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:33,022
Thank you.

671
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:57,463
"The standard…" Hold on.

672
00:38:00,174 --> 00:38:02,134
Violation of the doctor's obligation
to explain…

673
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,768
"Those who receive surgery
for varicose vein malformations…"

674
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:17,191
-Welcome.
-Hello.

675
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:21,195
Is Jung So-min here?

676
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:23,072
-Go on. Later…
-Wait.

677
00:38:24,532 --> 00:38:27,326
Please tell me a little more.

678
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:29,328
Isn't this wrong?

679
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,341
If that's true, So-min,
we do have a chance.

680
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:51,142
ABORTION ANALYSIS

681
00:38:57,857 --> 00:38:59,150
WHY GIVE BIRTH?

682
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,067
Why?

683
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:03,195
We've already talked about it last time.

684
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:05,448
Are you going to deliver
the complaint to God?

685
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:06,699
What's His address?

686
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:09,577
It's 101 Dogok-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

687
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,744
He lives in Gangnam?

688
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:12,830
What's godlike to pregnant women?

689
00:39:13,706 --> 00:39:16,917
-What?
-101 Dogok-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

690
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:19,712
Woongsan General Hospital,
a subsidiary of Woongsan Group.

691
00:39:22,923 --> 00:39:25,551
That's where I'm sending
the complaint for damages.

692
00:39:34,643 --> 00:39:36,770
CAPERNAUM

693
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:38,814
DEMAND FOR PAYMENT

694
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,900
Gang-hun.

695
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,659
You're home early. Didn't you go to work?

696
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:51,994
Yeah.

697
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:53,746
I'm sick.

698
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:55,831
I have a headache too.

699
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,875
Maybe it's a cold.
I have a sore throat too.

700
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:02,588
You promised you wouldn't drink.

701
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:06,383
I drank because I was sick!

702
00:40:07,384 --> 00:40:08,511
Fine.

703
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:52,846
Why is it so hard to live?

704
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:56,350
I'm probably getting punished

705
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:58,394
for living so recklessly

706
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:01,480
and thoughtlessly.

707
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,277
Am I your punishment then?

708
00:41:10,447 --> 00:41:14,952
-What?
-But what am I getting punished for?

709
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:28,424
Jung So-min became pregnant with Gang-hun

710
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,342
when she was living
with other runaway kids.

711
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:32,636
The Woongsan Welfare Foundation

712
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,015
introduced her to Woongsan General
Hospital, so she was treated there.

713
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:39,268
Actually, So-min never wanted
to give birth in the first place.

714
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:43,731
It was an unwanted pregnancy.
And she was too young to deal with it.

715
00:41:44,523 --> 00:41:48,569
But the hospital ignored
So-min's opinion multiple times,

716
00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:50,446
and kept persuading her to give birth.

717
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:51,822
What? Why did they do that?

718
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:53,699
Exactly. And on top of that,

719
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:56,702
the hospital couldn't have been
any more careless.

720
00:41:56,785 --> 00:41:58,412
They knew very well
the expectant mother

721
00:41:58,495 --> 00:42:01,832
was drinking soju and eating junk food
instead of real meals every day.

722
00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:04,752
But they didn't carry out
a single proper exam.

723
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:06,795
I heard it was a chaebol hospital.

724
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:08,255
Were they too busy treating VIPs?

725
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,757
Gang-hun's lower limb paralysis

726
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,718
was caused by a malformation
from an underdeveloped brain

727
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:13,844
during the fetal stage.

728
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:18,682
It's not certain,
but her alcohol addiction and malnutrition

729
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:20,517
might have affected this.

730
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:24,647
If she had received
a timely, proper ultrasound,

731
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,191
it would've shown
the brain malformation of the fetus.

732
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:30,277
-Isn't that right, Mr. Kang?
-What?

733
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:32,821
Mr. Kang, did you already…

734
00:42:33,322 --> 00:42:36,700
The one who took the lower limb paralysis
lawsuit files from the archive room

735
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:39,495
was you, wasn't it?

736
00:42:40,913 --> 00:42:43,123
Yes. You're right.

737
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:46,293
But I haven't made
as much progress as you have.

738
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:47,836
You're amazing, Ms. Park.

739
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:51,548
I did enter the top law firm
with good grades.

740
00:42:55,135 --> 00:42:56,720
If it's Woongsan General Hospital,

741
00:42:56,804 --> 00:42:58,722
I know someone from their labor union.

742
00:42:58,806 --> 00:43:01,517
-I'll look into their internal affairs.
-Good luck.

743
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,853
If it's Woongsan Group,
it'll be against Woo Myeong-hun again.

744
00:43:05,437 --> 00:43:07,272
What? Why?

745
00:43:07,356 --> 00:43:08,691
He's the legal advisor there

746
00:43:08,774 --> 00:43:10,984
and to most other chaebols too.

747
00:43:12,778 --> 00:43:14,822
He's such a skilled attorney.

748
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:17,324
I wish I could learn from him…

749
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:19,576
…wasn't what I meant.

750
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,911
That's not what I meant.

751
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:22,413
-I…
-What did you mean?

752
00:43:24,748 --> 00:43:27,000
Your eyes are so scary right now.

753
00:43:27,543 --> 00:43:29,336
INCHEON DISTRICT COURT, BUCHEON BRANCH

754
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,092
All rise.

755
00:43:43,684 --> 00:43:44,685
Please be seated.

756
00:43:48,355 --> 00:43:49,648
Your Honor,

757
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,943
I'm sorry, but before we begin the trial--

758
00:43:53,026 --> 00:43:55,362
Is it about the motion
to reassign to another judge?

759
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:57,114
It's just as you had expected.

760
00:43:58,031 --> 00:43:58,991
Yeah.

761
00:43:59,074 --> 00:44:01,326
Gang-hun's case was assigned
to Civil Division 7.

762
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,494
Is that a good thing?

763
00:44:02,578 --> 00:44:03,412
A FEW DAYS AGO

764
00:44:03,495 --> 00:44:06,123
Yes. It's Judge Kim Jin-o.
She has a severe visual impairment.

765
00:44:06,206 --> 00:44:09,418
Really? Goodness, she's amazing.

766
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:11,795
I don't know
if that's necessarily a good thing?

767
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:14,131
What? Isn't it a good thing?

768
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:17,718
She must understand the lives of people
with disabilities better than anyone.

769
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:20,137
She'd relate to them, wouldn't she?

770
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,056
Don't you think so, Mr. Kang?
You know her well, don't you?

771
00:44:23,724 --> 00:44:24,558
No.

772
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:27,770
I only know she's a judge
with a visual impairment.

773
00:44:27,853 --> 00:44:30,063
I can't believe there's a judge
even you don't know.

774
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:33,650
As expected, he only knows
the popular judges.

775
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:36,737
Gosh, this chair feels
especially uncomfortable.

776
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:42,326
By the way, the defense might try
for a motion to reassign the judge.

777
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:43,494
Yes, Your Honor.

778
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:45,496
I'm sorry,

779
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:47,831
but as this is a medical case,

780
00:44:48,373 --> 00:44:52,377
the amount of books and evidence
to refer to might be massive and--

781
00:44:52,461 --> 00:44:54,838
Are you worried how a judge
with a visual impairment

782
00:44:54,922 --> 00:44:56,215
will be able to read them?

783
00:44:56,298 --> 00:44:59,301
Well, no. I didn't particularly mean that.

784
00:44:59,384 --> 00:45:03,597
I probably read Braille texts
faster than you can read.

785
00:45:04,848 --> 00:45:06,975
As for the other texts…

786
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:10,896
Complaint. Plaintiff, Kim Gang-hun.

787
00:45:10,979 --> 00:45:13,190
-Defendant…
-The screen reader reads for me,

788
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:14,399
and I listen.

789
00:45:14,483 --> 00:45:17,819
A trial is all about listening, isn't it?

790
00:45:18,654 --> 00:45:20,739
I'll stay up all night to listen
if I have to,

791
00:45:20,822 --> 00:45:23,033
so you can submit any document you'd like.

792
00:45:24,743 --> 00:45:26,411
How could I possibly dare to question

793
00:45:26,495 --> 00:45:29,665
your ability to do your work, Your Honor?

794
00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:31,792
-It's just--
-Just?

795
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:34,461
Due to the nature of the case,

796
00:45:34,545 --> 00:45:37,130
if this Court proceeds with it,

797
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:40,676
I worry it might cause
unnecessary misunderstandings.

798
00:45:40,759 --> 00:45:43,011
-Counsel.
-Yes, Your Honor?

799
00:45:43,095 --> 00:45:45,138
I'm not a judge with disability.
I'm just a judge.

800
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,394
This trial will proceed
like any other trial.

801
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:52,813
The motion for reassignment is dismissed.

802
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:56,066
But that won't necessarily
be beneficial for us.

803
00:45:57,943 --> 00:45:58,944
Really?

804
00:45:59,027 --> 00:46:00,946
When you go through immigration overseas,

805
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:02,656
-where do you line up?
-Well…

806
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,327
I go to a young female examiner
who looks kind.

807
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:10,080
Wrong. That will most likely
take the longest time.

808
00:46:10,163 --> 00:46:11,832
And why is that?

809
00:46:11,915 --> 00:46:14,042
The more of a minority you are in a group,

810
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:16,378
the more you tend
to strictly adhere to principles

811
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,131
-to avoid being misunderstood.
-I see.

812
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:22,593
Why would they be misunderstood?

813
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:27,389
This lawsuit is based
on groundless speculation.

814
00:46:27,472 --> 00:46:30,642
The plaintiff is only making
vague allegations.

815
00:46:30,726 --> 00:46:33,103
And they have failed
to present objective evidence.

816
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:35,981
The defendant's hospital
is the best in Korea.

817
00:46:36,064 --> 00:46:39,318
They have no reason not to conduct
necessary tests on pregnant patients--

818
00:46:39,401 --> 00:46:41,278
To prove exactly this point,

819
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:46,116
we requested an order to present
all of the medical reports from that time,

820
00:46:46,992 --> 00:46:49,119
but the defendant has not responded.

821
00:46:49,202 --> 00:46:51,246
It's been over than ten years.

822
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:56,126
As they were past the storage term,
they had been already disposed of.

823
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:57,502
Doesn't the defendant's hospital

824
00:46:57,586 --> 00:47:02,090
unofficially keep records
past the storage term

825
00:47:02,174 --> 00:47:03,550
for research purposes?

826
00:47:04,593 --> 00:47:05,427
I don't know.

827
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:09,514
I don't know where you heard that,
but that's not something we know of.

828
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,975
-Your Honor!
-Yes.

829
00:47:12,976 --> 00:47:15,854
They do seem to be past
the legal storage term.

830
00:47:15,937 --> 00:47:19,149
As you don't have objective evidence
that such documents exist currently,

831
00:47:19,232 --> 00:47:20,317
prove it by other means.

832
00:47:27,074 --> 00:47:27,908
Honestly,

833
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,870
the defendant's hospital
is very disconcerted.

834
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:35,374
The plaintiff's mother,
who had nowhere to go,

835
00:47:35,457 --> 00:47:37,542
was able to give birth
at the defendant's hospital,

836
00:47:37,626 --> 00:47:39,628
Korea's best hospital,

837
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:42,130
all thanks to the goodwill

838
00:47:42,214 --> 00:47:45,342
of Woongsan Welfare Foundation,
which desired to help runaway teenagers.

839
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:46,259
But…

840
00:47:47,177 --> 00:47:49,971
Ungratefulness is the only word
that comes to mind--

841
00:47:50,055 --> 00:47:52,891
Counsel, that is irrelevant to the trial.
Please stop.

842
00:47:54,351 --> 00:47:55,727
Yes, Your Honor.

843
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:56,645
However,

844
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,816
we request
an early dismissal of this trial.

845
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:03,860
There doesn't seem to be much
the plaintiff's counsel can do.

846
00:48:03,944 --> 00:48:05,112
Nothing further, Your Honor.

847
00:48:06,988 --> 00:48:07,989
Your Honor,

848
00:48:08,782 --> 00:48:12,661
we will ask the Health Insurance Committee
for a fact inquiry.

849
00:48:13,578 --> 00:48:14,996
About what?

850
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,250
The number of abortions
Woongsan General Hospital

851
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,544
has performed in the last ten years.

852
00:48:20,627 --> 00:48:23,255
And the number of abortions
performed at other big hospitals

853
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:24,423
similar to Woongsan.

854
00:48:25,298 --> 00:48:26,299
What is the purpose?

855
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:27,884
For purposes that are unknown,

856
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:33,640
the defendant's hospital has deliberately
avoided performing abortions

857
00:48:34,182 --> 00:48:36,226
and has urged patients to give birth.

858
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:39,271
Mr. Kang.

859
00:48:41,106 --> 00:48:42,065
Mr. Kang.

860
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:49,322
Mr. Kang!

861
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:51,116
What was all that about?

862
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,743
Did you find some evidence?

863
00:48:52,826 --> 00:48:54,286
No, I have no such thing.

864
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:56,621
Why would you drop a bomb like that
without evidence?

865
00:48:56,705 --> 00:48:58,999
You remember what Myeong-hun said earlier?

866
00:48:59,082 --> 00:49:01,376
"Being ungrateful" or whatever?

867
00:49:02,669 --> 00:49:05,589
What? Right. Woongsan Welfare Foundation

868
00:49:05,672 --> 00:49:08,967
let her get treated at Woongsan General
Hospital to help runaway teenagers.

869
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,261
It came to mind
while listening to that.

870
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:15,015
Actually, So-min never wanted
to give birth in the first place.

871
00:49:15,098 --> 00:49:19,102
It was an unwanted pregnancy.
And she was too young to deal with it.

872
00:49:19,186 --> 00:49:23,064
But the hospital ignored
So-min's opinion multiple times,

873
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:25,317
and kept persuading her to give birth.

874
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:29,613
Why would they send
pregnant runaway teenagers

875
00:49:29,696 --> 00:49:31,907
to Woongsan General Hospital?

876
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:34,367
They weren't even going to
look after them.

877
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:38,079
This might be a ridiculous thought,

878
00:49:39,331 --> 00:49:43,084
but what if there was
some kind of intent behind all of this?

879
00:49:50,091 --> 00:49:52,803
The group with the highest ratio
of abortions is…

880
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:56,389
It's probably runaway teenagers.

881
00:49:58,308 --> 00:49:59,601
Like So-min.

882
00:50:12,155 --> 00:50:15,200
I heard back from members of Woongsan
General Hospital's labor union.

883
00:50:15,283 --> 00:50:18,411
Unless the lives of the mothers
were in imminent danger,

884
00:50:19,037 --> 00:50:22,123
they didn't terminate pregnancies.

885
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:26,211
They said the younger doctors
complained a lot about it.

886
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:30,799
They were nervous because the risk
of missing the right time was so high.

887
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:34,469
They probably didn't tell the mothers
about their fetuses' conditions.

888
00:50:38,557 --> 00:50:40,976
The Health Insurance Committee replied
to our fact inquiry.

889
00:50:41,059 --> 00:50:42,102
What did they say?

890
00:50:44,479 --> 00:50:47,816
They've refused to answer as it concerns
trade secrets of the hospitals.

891
00:50:50,777 --> 00:50:53,029
I can't believe those punks.

892
00:50:53,113 --> 00:50:54,322
HIC CHAIR
PARK CHEOL-MIN

893
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:58,702
They made this perfectly for me.

894
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:03,331
-Yes?
-Call Attorney Woo's office.

895
00:51:03,415 --> 00:51:06,167
Tell him I got his gift
and I appreciate it.

896
00:51:06,251 --> 00:51:08,003
Chairman Park, that fool.

897
00:51:08,086 --> 00:51:10,547
When Myeong-hun worked
at the Blue House Civil Affairs Office,

898
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,549
he got Park that job.

899
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:16,887
Okay. So this is how you're going to play?

900
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:18,638
What do we do then?

901
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:20,974
We'll have to use a method

902
00:51:21,057 --> 00:51:23,351
that Korean civil servants
are scared of the most.

903
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:24,769
What's that?

904
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:26,730
Chairman Park.

905
00:51:26,813 --> 00:51:29,149
I told you not to wake me
when I'm in my massage chair.

906
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:31,276
Chairman Park!

907
00:51:31,776 --> 00:51:34,029
-What?
-I'm sorry.

908
00:51:34,112 --> 00:51:37,365
I told him to wait outside,
but he suddenly barged in.

909
00:51:37,949 --> 00:51:39,826
What on earth? Who are you?

910
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:42,120
You're up.

911
00:51:42,871 --> 00:51:44,789
Nice to meet you.

912
00:51:44,873 --> 00:51:46,207
I'm Attorney Kang Da-wit.

913
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:48,877
Da-wit? Are you from Israel?

914
00:51:51,588 --> 00:51:52,797
By the way, Chairman Park,

915
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:54,799
this is a nice putter.

916
00:51:54,883 --> 00:51:55,717
Is this gold?

917
00:51:56,217 --> 00:51:57,385
Don't hit the floor with it!

918
00:51:58,637 --> 00:51:59,638
I'm sorry.

919
00:52:02,223 --> 00:52:04,476
Right. You're the one
who requested the fact inquiry.

920
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,561
If you're here to throw a tantrum,
get out at once.

921
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:08,104
We've already given our answer.

922
00:52:08,188 --> 00:52:11,399
Throw a tantrum?
Gosh, I'm too old for that.

923
00:52:11,483 --> 00:52:14,444
I'm not a whiny kid. Goodness!

924
00:52:14,527 --> 00:52:15,820
It fell.

925
00:52:15,904 --> 00:52:17,697
It's a complaint we're going to file

926
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:19,866
against you.

927
00:52:20,492 --> 00:52:21,326
What?

928
00:52:25,622 --> 00:52:27,290
Request for information disclosure?

929
00:52:27,374 --> 00:52:28,708
It's not too big of a deal.

930
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,710
It's about your official expenses

931
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:32,379
and company card statements.

932
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:37,050
Goodness, you've used your company card
for whenever your wife perms her hair.

933
00:52:38,093 --> 00:52:39,886
That's great. You're a family man.

934
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,930
This is what I need to learn. So sweet.

935
00:52:42,013 --> 00:52:43,014
-Mr. Kang?
-Yes?

936
00:52:43,098 --> 00:52:46,935
All successful negotiations on earth
have occurred while sitting calmly.

937
00:52:47,018 --> 00:52:48,228
Please, let's sit.

938
00:52:48,311 --> 00:52:49,688
-Please.
-Okay.

939
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:51,022
I'll sit and talk.

940
00:52:51,898 --> 00:52:57,112
Okay. This is the list of furniture
and equipment purchases for your office.

941
00:52:57,195 --> 00:52:59,406
You know the one there
you were just sleeping in?

942
00:52:59,489 --> 00:53:00,949
That's a limited edition one.

943
00:53:01,032 --> 00:53:03,326
Where did you get that?

944
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:09,290
I bought it with my own money
during an overseas business trip.

945
00:53:09,374 --> 00:53:10,625
Overseas business trip?

946
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:13,211
The overseas business trip expenses…

947
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:17,924
Where did you go to research
the cutting-edge medical industry?

948
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:20,010
That's right.

949
00:53:20,885 --> 00:53:22,929
"Let's drink a Maldives in mojito."

950
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:28,309
Of course, you have to go to the Maldives
for cutting-edge medicine!

951
00:53:28,393 --> 00:53:32,272
Wait. But you didn't go with your wife.

952
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:33,773
Mr. Kang!

953
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:36,526
Goodness, Mr. Park.

954
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:38,778
Mr. Kang. Sir. Doctor.

955
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:39,988
I'll call you anything.

956
00:53:40,071 --> 00:53:42,073
I'll call you my big brother.

957
00:53:42,157 --> 00:53:44,659
Lord Da-wit. Let's calmly talk about this.

958
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:48,121
-Let's talk it out.
-Then, shall we talk about it over tea?

959
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:49,581
Yes, sir.

960
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:50,665
RESPONSE TO FACT INQUIRY

961
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:53,752
The response to the fact inquiry
has suddenly come in.

962
00:53:55,378 --> 00:53:58,131
Last time, they clearly said
they couldn't respond.

963
00:53:58,214 --> 00:54:00,300
Well, I…

964
00:54:01,468 --> 00:54:04,345
I don't know what happened either,

965
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:07,098
but in any case,
it doesn't seem to directly relate

966
00:54:07,182 --> 00:54:09,100
to the dispute of the case--

967
00:54:09,184 --> 00:54:10,518
It's 91%!

968
00:54:12,395 --> 00:54:13,605
WOONGSAN'S ABORTION RATE

969
00:54:15,315 --> 00:54:16,983
According to their response,

970
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:22,280
Woongsan General Hospital's abortion rate

971
00:54:22,363 --> 00:54:27,368
is 91% less than the average rate
of other hospitals.

972
00:54:27,994 --> 00:54:32,874
Mr. Woo. Is this a coincidence?
Or a miracle?

973
00:54:32,957 --> 00:54:35,543
Wait. What does that prove though?

974
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:38,588
The numbers are only numbers.

975
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:41,841
Each mother's situation and views
are bound to be unique--

976
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:44,803
That is why we will submit additional data

977
00:54:44,886 --> 00:54:47,764
that is very interesting.

978
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:52,811
EVIDENCE SUBMISSION FORM

979
00:54:53,394 --> 00:54:54,354
Your Honor.

980
00:54:55,688 --> 00:55:00,151
Do you know who the biggest sponsor
of pro-life groups in Korea is?

981
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:03,029
Your Honor, the plaintiff's counsel
is delaying the trial

982
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:04,322
with an irrelevant claim.

983
00:55:04,405 --> 00:55:07,117
It's very relevant, Mr. Woo.

984
00:55:08,284 --> 00:55:12,122
Five years' worth of audits
for these groups

985
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:17,836
were found by a certain bold
and persistent nerd from our firm…

986
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:20,713
Geez!

987
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:24,342
Ms. Park?

988
00:55:29,264 --> 00:55:33,101
What's that? Were you here all weekend?
Why didn't you go home?

989
00:55:33,184 --> 00:55:35,436
-Just take a look at this.
-What is it?

990
00:55:41,693 --> 00:55:44,028
How did you find all of this?

991
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:47,740
What do you mean "How?"
I just went headlong and found it all.

992
00:55:48,658 --> 00:55:51,870
According to the detailed analysis
by this attorney,

993
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:54,205
their biggest sponsor

994
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:58,001
is the Elliot Foundation in Hong Kong.

995
00:55:59,043 --> 00:56:01,421
It's a completely
unknown organization in Korea.

996
00:56:02,547 --> 00:56:05,341
So what about it?

997
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:08,303
Elliot Foundation's address
is in Hong Kong.

998
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:12,307
But they do have
a postal address in Korea.

999
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,641
Its address?

1000
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:22,483
It's 101 Dogok-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

1001
00:56:26,821 --> 00:56:27,739
Just a moment.

1002
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:31,326
-That's--
-Yes, Your Honor. That's right.

1003
00:56:31,409 --> 00:56:34,037
It's the address of the defendant's
Woongsan General Hospital

1004
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,914
and Woongsan Welfare Foundation,

1005
00:56:35,997 --> 00:56:38,458
which are located in the same building.

1006
00:56:39,876 --> 00:56:42,962
And Elliot was the name
used in the US by Choi U-jin,

1007
00:56:43,046 --> 00:56:45,298
CEO Choi Woong-san's only son

1008
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:48,051
who died at the age of 30.

1009
00:56:50,345 --> 00:56:52,764
After the passing of his son,

1010
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:55,642
Mr. Choi suddenly
devoted himself to religion.

1011
00:56:56,226 --> 00:57:00,188
Since then, Mr. Choi has even become
the biggest sponsor and an elder

1012
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:03,233
of Korea's most fundamental
religious body.

1013
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:09,030
That's speculation. Even if Mr. Choi
did have strong religious beliefs,

1014
00:57:09,113 --> 00:57:12,242
there is absolutely no evidence
that he specifically ordered

1015
00:57:12,325 --> 00:57:14,661
-the medical staff to--
-That is what power is!

1016
00:57:14,744 --> 00:57:17,872
Even without direct orders,
due to the nature of an organization,

1017
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:20,541
they can't help
but carry out the leader's will.

1018
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:23,336
Medical staff who didn't follow
the organization's unspoken rule

1019
00:57:23,419 --> 00:57:26,881
were mistreated for various reasons
before being forced to leave.

1020
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:30,093
We will be submitting
the related evidence soon.

1021
00:57:30,176 --> 00:57:32,095
Yes, I would appreciate that.

1022
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:34,847
Well, that's enough

1023
00:57:35,682 --> 00:57:38,017
to be pretty relevant, don't you think?

1024
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:41,729
Please don't forget
to submit the related evidence.

1025
00:57:41,813 --> 00:57:42,855
Yes, sir.

1026
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,368
-Sir.
-Yes?

1027
00:57:55,451 --> 00:57:57,579
You really are good at what you do.

1028
00:57:59,038 --> 00:57:59,956
Hey, kid.

1029
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:01,624
You should be honored.

1030
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:03,126
Despite what you think of me--

1031
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:04,210
Thank you.

1032
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:05,795
And I'm sorry.

1033
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:08,673
You must've had a hard time
because of how I insisted.

1034
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:11,092
What's this all of a sudden?

1035
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:12,927
I'm not used to it. What's with you?

1036
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:16,431
I can't afford to pay,
so I should at least do this.

1037
00:58:17,056 --> 00:58:18,182
I knew it.

1038
00:58:18,266 --> 00:58:20,310
I knew something was up. Geez.

1039
00:58:21,894 --> 00:58:25,189
But your mom never showed up.
Not even once.

1040
00:58:25,273 --> 00:58:27,233
She barely approved
the power of attorney.

1041
00:58:27,942 --> 00:58:30,778
She was furious about me
doing something meaningless.

1042
00:58:31,404 --> 00:58:35,116
She said people like us can't win
against a giant hospital like that.

1043
00:58:36,743 --> 00:58:39,037
But will we really be able to win?

1044
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,542
In the end, we couldn't secure
the medical reports,

1045
00:58:44,626 --> 00:58:46,711
so we've only proved half of our point.

1046
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:50,006
Is that so?

1047
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,769
Am I your punishment then?

1048
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:08,733
-What?
-But what am I getting punished for?

1049
00:59:14,947 --> 00:59:18,201
INCHEON DISTRICT COURT, BUCHEON BRANCH
DAY OF VERDICT

1050
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:30,380
Based on all the evidence
submitted to this Court,

1051
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:33,758
the Court believes
the plaintiff's disability

1052
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:36,219
should have been diagnosed
while they were in the womb.

1053
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:38,179
Thus, the defendant's hospital

1054
00:59:38,262 --> 00:59:40,473
did not fulfill their duty

1055
00:59:40,556 --> 00:59:43,184
of properly diagnosing
and explaining this condition.

1056
00:59:44,477 --> 00:59:45,478
However,

1057
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:48,231
on the argument
that the defendant's hospital failed

1058
00:59:48,314 --> 00:59:51,901
to properly inform the plaintiff's mother
of precautions to take during pregnancy

1059
00:59:51,984 --> 00:59:55,405
or that such a failure
caused the plaintiff's disability,

1060
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:57,824
there is not enough evidence
to acknowledge this claim.

1061
00:59:58,574 --> 01:00:01,494
Therefore, this Court does not accept
the claim of damages

1062
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:02,954
for causing disability.

1063
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:07,959
I knew it.

1064
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:11,003
What remains is the allegation

1065
01:00:11,087 --> 01:00:14,841
that the defendant's hospital failed,
whether by intent or negligence,

1066
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:16,884
to fulfill its duty
to diagnose and explain

1067
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:18,970
the possibility
of the plaintiff's disability.

1068
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:21,264
To put it plainly,

1069
01:00:21,848 --> 01:00:24,434
it did not give the chance
to abort the plaintiff.

1070
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:29,480
In order to accept
the liability for damages,

1071
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:34,026
we have to answer one
of the most difficult questions.

1072
01:00:35,403 --> 01:00:38,072
For the plaintiff to win this case,
we would have to say,

1073
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:41,492
"It would've been better for the world
if this 12-year-old boy Gang-hun

1074
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:44,495
hadn't been born at all."

1075
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:48,791
"His life and existence itself
is damaging."

1076
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:52,795
That is the kind of terrible conclusion
we would have to reach.

1077
01:00:56,966 --> 01:00:59,051
As an individual,

1078
01:01:00,052 --> 01:01:02,972
I do understand the kind of emotions

1079
01:01:03,055 --> 01:01:06,184
the plaintiff must have come
to this court with.

1080
01:01:08,102 --> 01:01:11,105
However, I am here not as an individual

1081
01:01:11,773 --> 01:01:13,107
but as a judge.

1082
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:16,152
And according to
the Constitution of Korea,

1083
01:01:16,235 --> 01:01:19,030
whether you have a disability or not,

1084
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:20,823
whether you are rich or poor,

1085
01:01:21,699 --> 01:01:24,327
the lives of all humans
are equally sacred.

1086
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,788
That is its fundamental premise.

1087
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:28,956
Under the Constitution,

1088
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,710
no right is more valuable than life.

1089
01:01:33,836 --> 01:01:36,339
Thus, it is not possible
to make the hypothetical assessment

1090
01:01:36,422 --> 01:01:38,966
that the absence of a life
is better than its existence.

1091
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,803
Which life has the value to exist?

1092
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:47,225
Which life would be better off
to have not existed?

1093
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:52,897
Such judgments lie
outside the realms of human ability.

1094
01:01:55,066 --> 01:01:55,983
Therefore,

1095
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:59,862
as the Court does not acknowledge
the birth of Kim Gang-hun as damaging,

1096
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:05,535
the plaintiff's claim is without grounds,
and the case is dismissed.

1097
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,918
The beautiful language

1098
01:02:14,877 --> 01:02:16,295
that had made my heart race before

1099
01:02:17,505 --> 01:02:21,008
felt like a giant wall this time.

1100
01:02:35,106 --> 01:02:38,943
In the end, we couldn't break
the existing Supreme Court precedent.

1101
01:02:39,527 --> 01:02:42,238
I submitted all
the related overseas precedents too.

1102
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:45,867
But that doesn't erase
how the fault lies with Woongsan.

1103
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,661
After making them give birth,
they stopped caring.

1104
01:02:48,744 --> 01:02:51,831
-It's ridiculous!
-Why are you yelling at me?

1105
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:58,421
We can't do anything legally, can we?
The logic is airtight.

1106
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:01,424
I disagree.

1107
01:03:01,966 --> 01:03:05,344
I think that's all
a beautiful load of crap.

1108
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:08,431
What are you all doing?

1109
01:03:08,514 --> 01:03:12,226
You weren't just going to
give up like this, were you?

1110
01:03:16,063 --> 01:03:19,609
If you don't get it, memorize it.

1111
01:03:19,692 --> 01:03:22,778
"We will win no matter what."

1112
01:03:22,862 --> 01:03:26,490
If we were bound to lose,
I wouldn't have even started!

1113
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:27,658
Do you get it?

1114
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:29,076
I believe, Mr. Kang!

1115
01:03:29,911 --> 01:03:32,872
Geez. Just bow to him, why don't you?
Is he your cult leader or what?

1116
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:35,416
Then, shall we have some snacks
before our meeting

1117
01:03:35,499 --> 01:03:36,876
on appeal strategies?

1118
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,295
We can't think well if we're hungry.

1119
01:03:39,378 --> 01:03:40,880
-Please sit.
-Sounds good.

1120
01:03:41,797 --> 01:03:43,299
No!

1121
01:03:43,382 --> 01:03:46,385
We won't get enough energy
with just these measly snacks.

1122
01:03:46,469 --> 01:03:47,845
Today,

1123
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:51,349
I'll treat you
to the most delicious bakery

1124
01:03:51,432 --> 01:03:52,266
in the world.

1125
01:03:53,225 --> 01:03:54,810
Let's go!

1126
01:03:54,894 --> 01:03:56,395
-You said it's your treat!
-Okay!

1127
01:03:56,479 --> 01:03:57,980
-Let's eat and cheer up!
-Let's go!

1128
01:03:58,064 --> 01:03:59,440
Let's eat and cheer up, Gi-ppeum!

1129
01:04:01,734 --> 01:04:03,778
It strangely feels like I lost.

1130
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:10,284
It's in French.

1131
01:04:10,368 --> 01:04:12,745
"Joie de vivre." The joy of life.

1132
01:04:12,828 --> 01:04:14,622
The joy, or Gi-ppeum, of life.

1133
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:17,500
Wait!

1134
01:04:17,583 --> 01:04:18,626
It's a blackout.

1135
01:04:21,212 --> 01:04:22,880
Oh, my gosh! Is it your birthday?

1136
01:04:22,964 --> 01:04:26,717
No. I just prepared something
as a way to cheer us up.

1137
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:28,427
There's so much fruit on top!

1138
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:30,513
-So much!
-Okay, everyone.

1139
01:04:30,596 --> 01:04:33,140
When I say "Pro Bono,"
you'll say "Victory."

1140
01:04:33,224 --> 01:04:34,725
Then, we'll blow out the candle.

1141
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:40,356
"Victory" is so lame.

1142
01:04:41,232 --> 01:04:42,358
Welcome.

1143
01:04:42,441 --> 01:04:44,735
What? I've seen that man before.

1144
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:46,028
Okay.

1145
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:47,488
Where have I seen him?

1146
01:04:48,698 --> 01:04:49,740
Right. The taxi.

1147
01:04:49,824 --> 01:04:50,992
Let me introduce them.

1148
01:04:51,075 --> 01:04:52,994
This is my mom and dad.

1149
01:04:55,496 --> 01:04:56,956
-Hello.
-Hello.

1150
01:04:57,915 --> 01:05:00,543
They are attorneys who work with me.

1151
01:05:01,127 --> 01:05:02,586
In order, their names are…

1152
01:05:03,129 --> 01:05:06,257
Jang Yeong-sil.

1153
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,300
-Hello.
-When you report to the local…

1154
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:11,429
-They issue an announcement…
-I want to tie those hands down.

1155
01:05:11,512 --> 01:05:13,889
Can't she talk without moving her hands?

1156
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,268
Kang Da-wit.

1157
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:18,185
Hello.

1158
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:22,064
Hwang Jun-u.

1159
01:05:22,148 --> 01:05:22,982
Hello!

1160
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:25,568
Yoo Nan-hui.

1161
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:26,610
Hello.

1162
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:30,364
We hope you enjoy.

1163
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:33,242
Thank you for the food.

1164
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:34,326
You know sign language?

1165
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:36,370
Just a little.

1166
01:05:38,456 --> 01:05:40,166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1167
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:41,292
Thank you for the food.

1168
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,210
Take a seat, everyone. Please eat.

1169
01:05:43,294 --> 01:05:44,795
You know sign language too?

1170
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:46,172
Just a little.

1171
01:05:46,255 --> 01:05:47,506
Gi-ppeum!

1172
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,051
Your family runs this amazing bakery?

1173
01:05:50,134 --> 01:05:51,886
I'm jealous. That's a bread-lover's dream.

1174
01:05:51,969 --> 01:05:53,054
Isn't it?

1175
01:05:53,137 --> 01:05:56,140
I must have saved the world
in my past life.

1176
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,725
Right? Thank you for the food!

1177
01:05:59,268 --> 01:06:00,227
It's so good.

1178
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,229
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

1179
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:04,523
So…

1180
01:06:07,985 --> 01:06:10,321
You must have opened this pretty recently.

1181
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:11,655
As expected,

1182
01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:12,990
you have a keen eye.

1183
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:14,950
It's only been a month.

1184
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:16,911
What about before?

1185
01:06:17,536 --> 01:06:18,746
In the past,

1186
01:06:19,371 --> 01:06:21,707
they ran a place that was a bit bigger.

1187
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,168
But when I was in high school,

1188
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:26,378
Dad was tricked by a bad friend

1189
01:06:26,462 --> 01:06:28,547
and lost the entire bakery.

1190
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:29,507
Oh, no.

1191
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:32,468
Because he was the co-signer,
he had to take on bank debt.

1192
01:06:33,135 --> 01:06:35,971
After baking with my mom,
my dad had to drive a taxi for ten years

1193
01:06:36,055 --> 01:06:37,181
just to make ends meet.

1194
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:40,142
You said you grew up comfortably
and was raised by a loving family.

1195
01:06:40,226 --> 01:06:43,687
People like that
don't know what real struggle is.

1196
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:46,565
But this competent daughter of theirs

1197
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:49,318
worked hard as an attorney
to pitch in what she earned

1198
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:52,279
and borrowed a little bit
of money to open this place.

1199
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:57,409
You're amazing, Ms. Park.

1200
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:58,577
You're making me shy.

1201
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:00,538
It's true though.

1202
01:07:01,205 --> 01:07:02,206
She's awesome.

1203
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:07,086
You like apricots, Gi-ppeum?
Aren't they sour?

1204
01:07:07,169 --> 01:07:09,088
I like these over the sweet ones.

1205
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:10,798
They're sour and bitter.

1206
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:12,591
It's just like our lives.

1207
01:07:13,259 --> 01:07:14,593
Okay. I'll try one.

1208
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,304
-Gosh.
-What?

1209
01:07:17,388 --> 01:07:18,514
It's so sour!

1210
01:07:21,725 --> 01:07:23,435
The coffee's good and not bitter.

1211
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:26,105
Please enjoy.

1212
01:07:30,192 --> 01:07:31,652
INCHEON DISTRICT COURT
APPEAL HEARING

1213
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:34,446
Doesn't Judge Kook Yeong-jun
look a bit uptight?

1214
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:37,283
Don't worry.
I'm sure Mr. Kang has it all planned out.

1215
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:39,285
-Plaintiff's counsel.
-Yes, Your Honor?

1216
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:40,995
Well,

1217
01:07:41,495 --> 01:07:44,290
is there anything more to do
with an appeal?

1218
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:46,959
In the first trial,

1219
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:50,254
you did everything you could.

1220
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:53,716
He rejected the wise ruling
of the first trial and appealed,

1221
01:07:53,799 --> 01:07:56,010
so I'd like to ask
the plaintiff's counsel.

1222
01:07:56,093 --> 01:07:58,429
What on earth did the defendant do wrong?

1223
01:07:58,512 --> 01:08:01,307
Is it wrong to value life
more than anything else?

1224
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,475
Do you actually think
it's better to not be born

1225
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:05,728
than to be born
as a person with a disability?

1226
01:08:05,811 --> 01:08:06,979
Unless that's the case,

1227
01:08:07,062 --> 01:08:09,190
the plaintiff's appeal
has no actual benefit.

1228
01:08:09,273 --> 01:08:10,608
That is our standpoint.

1229
01:08:13,402 --> 01:08:14,236
Your Honor.

1230
01:08:15,362 --> 01:08:17,489
The defendant's Woongsan General Hospital

1231
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:19,533
followed Woongsan Group CEO
Choi Woong-san

1232
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:23,996
and his sacred belief
that all lives are precious

1233
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:27,249
as they ignored the wishes
of a 16-year-old pregnant girl

1234
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:30,586
to have the plaintiff
Kim Gang-hun be born.

1235
01:08:30,669 --> 01:08:31,712
At the first trial,

1236
01:08:31,795 --> 01:08:35,549
with the sacred reason that all life
is precious and equal, they also ruled

1237
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:38,594
that a life, no matter whose,
cannot be regarded as damaging

1238
01:08:39,428 --> 01:08:41,305
and dismissed the plaintiff's claim.

1239
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:47,311
That is amazing. I was touched too.

1240
01:08:47,853 --> 01:08:49,647
Therefore, at this court of appeals,

1241
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:54,652
we would like to examine one by one

1242
01:08:54,735 --> 01:08:58,364
if Woongsan Group and Korea
really do treat

1243
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:01,533
every life respectfully and equally.

1244
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:03,202
Hold on.

1245
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:06,121
If you simply say
something is precious and equal,

1246
01:09:06,205 --> 01:09:08,249
does that really make it
precious and equal?

1247
01:09:08,332 --> 01:09:11,168
I mean, is it okay for a judge to lie?

1248
01:09:11,252 --> 01:09:13,212
Is it all right for a court to scam a kid?

1249
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:16,215
Plaintiff's counsel! What are you doing?

1250
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,300
Is this trial a joke to you?

1251
01:09:18,384 --> 01:09:22,346
No, Your Honor. I am simply asking
whether the Constitution of Korea,

1252
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:24,431
which states that all lives
are sacred and equal,

1253
01:09:24,515 --> 01:09:26,267
is a scam or not.

1254
01:09:27,017 --> 01:09:28,227
Just a moment.

1255
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:30,729
Why is he blowing things up?

1256
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:33,065
If Gang-hun, the boy sitting here,

1257
01:09:33,148 --> 01:09:37,236
has not been given dignified
and equal treatment in his life,

1258
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,113
if the words "All lives are sacred"

1259
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:42,283
are revealed to be nothing
but a beautiful load of crap…

1260
01:09:44,493 --> 01:09:48,747
then it'll have to be the one
who used his wrong beliefs

1261
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:53,168
to recklessly bring the plaintiff
into this world…

1262
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:57,548
That crazy…

1263
01:09:58,215 --> 01:09:59,216
Your Honor.

1264
01:10:00,509 --> 01:10:04,763
I would like to sue Choi Woong-san,
the CEO of Woongsan Group,

1265
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:07,224
and have him stand trial.

1266
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:15,733
Your Honor, does this even make sense?

1267
01:10:15,816 --> 01:10:17,109
With a ridiculous accusation…

1268
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:19,987
There he goes blowing things up again,
that attention-seeker.

1269
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:22,448
-I really want to learn from him.
-Learn what?

1270
01:10:31,915 --> 01:10:33,876
Sir, I have something urgent to report.

1271
01:10:33,959 --> 01:10:34,793
CHOI WOONG-SAN

1272
01:10:34,877 --> 01:10:36,295
The thing is…

1273
01:10:40,716 --> 01:10:43,552
STAY TUNED TO WATCH THE EPILOGUE

1274
01:10:59,818 --> 01:11:02,821
-What on earth are you doing?
-Aren't on-site inspections done

1275
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:05,407
so judges can form beliefs
from firsthand experience?

1276
01:11:05,491 --> 01:11:06,784
That's what I did as a judge.

1277
01:11:06,867 --> 01:11:10,579
Stop using Gang-hun as a PR stunt.
You're not fighting for yourself, are you?

1278
01:11:10,662 --> 01:11:13,791
I'm going to make a winning team.
If you don't like that, you can leave.

1279
01:11:13,874 --> 01:11:16,752
I'll file a separate lawsuit for damages

1280
01:11:16,835 --> 01:11:19,129
against Chairman Choi Woong-san.

1281
01:11:19,213 --> 01:11:21,924
Do you believe giving birth
to Gang-hun was damaging?

1282
01:11:22,007 --> 01:11:25,260
If Gang-hun's life is damaging,
then who caused that damage?

1283
01:11:25,344 --> 01:11:28,097
-Is it for the money?
-Do you have some kind of right

1284
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,432
to be involved
in the lives and deaths of others?

1285
01:11:30,516 --> 01:11:31,850
Please tell me.

1286
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:35,562
What do I need to do
so I can live like other kids?

1287
01:11:35,646 --> 01:11:37,856
If anyone causes harm to Oh & Partners…

1288
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,066
I won't keep them around.

1289
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:41,568
That goes for Team Pro Bono and you.

1290
01:11:44,113 --> 01:11:46,615
The debtor, Mr. Park Chang-sun.

1291
01:11:48,826 --> 01:11:50,244
The Court rules…

1292
01:11:50,327 --> 01:11:52,204
Wingardium Leviosa.

1293
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,081
…that the debtor

1294
01:11:55,165 --> 01:11:56,500
is exempt from liability.

1295
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:58,293
What? Mom!

1296
01:11:58,794 --> 01:12:00,045
We won!

1297
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:02,297
They said our debt is gone now.

1298
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:03,632
-Really?
-Yes.

1299
01:12:03,715 --> 01:12:07,136
There are no grounds
for denying the exemption from liability.

1300
01:12:09,138 --> 01:12:13,392
The applicant's remaining obligations
as a joint guarantor

1301
01:12:13,475 --> 01:12:16,645
are hereby fully extinguished.

1302
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:19,690
The spell cast by the judge in that moment

1303
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:23,277
was more incredible than any other spell

1304
01:12:23,902 --> 01:12:26,321
from Harry Potter.

1305
01:12:26,405 --> 01:12:29,700
Next, case number 2015-686…

1306
01:12:32,619 --> 01:12:34,997
I see. You're hard of hearing.

1307
01:12:36,081 --> 01:12:37,499
Is this how you do it?

1308
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:39,001
Congratulations.

1309
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:41,462
You won.

1310
01:12:41,545 --> 01:12:42,546
Thank you.

1311
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:44,882
I guess it's right.

1312
01:12:51,221 --> 01:12:53,223
