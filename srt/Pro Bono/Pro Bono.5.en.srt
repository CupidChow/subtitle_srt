PRO BONO

00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:39,435
RESTRICTED NUMBER

3
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:42,021
DON'T LET DA-WIT FOOL YOU
HE'S A CRIMINAL WHO TOOK A HUGE BRIBE

4
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:43,022
HE'S A BRUTAL MURDERER

5
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:56,995
Hey, hold on tight.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,668
Be careful.

7
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,422
This is so… Goodness.

8
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:10,008
Ms. Park?

9
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:31,154
PRO BONO

10
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:33,114
EPISODE 5

11
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:41,539
"The taste of victory. Pro bono."

12
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,003
What's with that look on your face?

13
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:48,212
We won.

14
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,256
There can't be a cleaner win than this.

15
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,507
I told you.

16
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:54,010
Kang Da-wit doesn't know
the meaning of "lose."

17
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:56,095
Okay.

18
00:01:57,764 --> 00:02:00,600
Then, why are you acting
as if you've seen something terrible?

19
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:02,727
It's nothing.

20
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,438
I just feel a little sick
because I was nervous.

21
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:07,607
My goodness, Ms. Park.

22
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,651
You have a long way to go.

23
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:11,069
I know I'm bragging,

24
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,821
but I'm someone who didn't bat an eye

25
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:16,366
when I put active government ministers
into court custody.

26
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:20,036
Even after a case
where someone was butchered with a knife,

27
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:23,289
I had some blood red spicy soup
and gulped it all down.

28
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:26,501
By nature, as a person who practices law--

29
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:27,627
Judge Kang!

30
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:29,837
Mr. Lee!

31
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,465
It's been so long!

32
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,510
Oh, my. Roger!

33
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:38,763
How have you been?

34
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,181
How is your knee doing?

35
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:43,768
My knee is all better now
thanks to you, Judge Kang.

36
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:44,894
I'm no longer a judge.

37
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:47,563
Come on. You're only on a brief hiatus.

38
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:49,440
You should come back soon.

39
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:51,192
Thank you, sir.

40
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:55,363
-Hurry back, Captain!
-Roger!

41
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:57,740
Goodbye, sir.

42
00:02:59,117 --> 00:03:01,035
-Take care.
-I will.

43
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:03,079
Oh, my!

44
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:04,580
Thank goodness.

45
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:07,458
You're pretty popular.

46
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,253
Shall we see how popular I am?

47
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,841
Mr. Kang.

48
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,510
Yes?

49
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,221
You're a good person, right?

50
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:22,932
All of a sudden?

51
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,018
Forget it.

52
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:26,602
I can't forget it.

53
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:29,313
I hate when people don't finish
what they were going to say.

54
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:30,314
What was it? Tell me.

55
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:33,651
I just hope
that you're a good person, Mr. Kang.

56
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:42,535
Gi-ppeum!

57
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,162
Ui-hyeon!

58
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,456
It's been a while!

59
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:48,916
What are you doing here?
I heard you were really busy.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,335
Come on. I'm not as busy

61
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:52,962
as a High Court judge
handling sexual violence cases.

62
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,797
I heard the criminals pray and say,

63
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,550
"Please let me avoid
Judge Jung the Grim Reaper."

64
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:00,094
They shouldn't have done the crimes then.

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,055
Let's go and eat something nice.

66
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:02,972
Let's go.

67
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:06,017
I see.

68
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,853
They either loved him or hated him.

69
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:12,940
He was famous as "the people's judge"
and for having a humble background.

70
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:17,278
But some of the young judges
didn't like him.

71
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:19,364
To be honest, I don't like him.

72
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:20,615
You don't? Why not?

73
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:22,658
He cares too much about his popularity.

74
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,494
He does too many interviews too.

75
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:28,790
Then, why did a person like that
quit all of a sudden?

76
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:31,626
You said he would've been
a justice candidate.

77
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:37,006
Actually, there was a strange rumor.

78
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:39,133
What was it?

79
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:41,594
It came from the secretary's office
of the court chief.

80
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,516
-He was accused of bribery.
-What?

81
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:51,521
There's a disturbing rumor
about an apple box or something,

82
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:55,066
but the higher-ups kept it quiet
to protect the court's reputation.

83
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,027
Is that true?

84
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:02,365
I truly admire you, Mr. Kang.

85
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:04,909
Things seemed so hopeless
when we lost the first trial.

86
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,035
Okay.

87
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,745
Have you all memorized it by now?

88
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:10,790
We will win no matter what!

89
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:12,458
We'll win no matter what!

90
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,295
I lacked faith. Would you like me
to rub your shoulders a bit?

91
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,839
-No, it's all right.
-Okay.

92
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:23,010
But you also didn't see it coming at all

93
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:25,638
that Mr. Choi would adopt Gang-hun's mom.

94
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:27,849
Of course, I did.

95
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:30,768
I'm always several moves ahead and…

96
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:32,562
You got lucky.

97
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:37,275
Lucky? It was all part of my strategy--

98
00:05:37,358 --> 00:05:39,986
Being lucky counts as skill too.
You really are amazing.

99
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,737
Of course, being lucky is also…

100
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,448
No, I said it wasn't luck.

101
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:46,075
Hello.

102
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,326
-Hey.
-Hi.

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,037
Ms. Park.

104
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:51,539
Hello.

105
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:55,585
Well, now that Ms. Park is here,
let me tell you.

106
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:58,296
A Gyeonggi human rights coalition
will be hosting

107
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,339
a morning soccer club competition.

108
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:02,550
As we're a Pro Bono Team,
participation is mandatory.

109
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,760
-We have uniforms too.
-Yes!

110
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:06,971
I heard the Yangchon Team
is on fire these days.

111
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:12,810
Come on. By nature, a law firm attorney
should be conducting business

112
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:15,771
while elegantly playing golf
with clients on weekends.

113
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:18,191
-"Elegantly."
-I love soccer too.

114
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:20,067
I used to be pretty good too.

115
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,528
But we're talking
about our precious weekends.

116
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:26,324
Playing morning soccer
when it's over 30°C outside now?

117
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:29,660
That's not my thing. I can't go.

118
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:31,621
They are our clients.

119
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:34,123
Local human rights
and farmer organizations!

120
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,167
I won't do it!

121
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:39,629
Okay! Did you all get that?

122
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:43,591
For the first five minutes,
we're going to perform a high press, okay?

123
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:46,552
You can play a bit rough
when the referees aren't looking.

124
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:49,680
Whoever gets the ball,
pass it straight to me at the front.

125
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:50,848
To me.

126
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,099
Pass it to me, okay?

127
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:56,270
Let's play dirty. Don't be goody-goodies.

128
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:58,314
-Play dirty, okay?
-Mr. Kang.

129
00:06:58,397 --> 00:06:59,815
As I mentioned before,

130
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:03,110
this game is to build
friendship and solidarity--

131
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:05,279
There's no friendship in a competition!

132
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:07,198
It's either you win or you lose!

133
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,660
-Okay.
-Your new team leader is pretty fierce.

134
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,704
Yes. He's very obsessed with winning.

135
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:14,872
I see. The obsessive type?

136
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:21,170
What's going on?

137
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,339
Where did they hire them from?

138
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,555
Okay, everyone!
We can't let them win. Gather around!

139
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:32,098
-Okay. Come on.
-Okay. Right.

140
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,015
Two, three!

141
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,768
Pro Bono Avengers!

142
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:42,608
Let's go Pro Bono Avengers!

143
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,331
Please bow to your opponents.

144
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,712
Well, Mr. Kang.

145
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:06,924
I hope you get a good taste
of German soccer today.

146
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,343
German soccer, my foot.

147
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,762
It'll probably be just Yangchon-ri soccer.

148
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:16,267
What are you doing?
You want me to read your palm?

149
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,352
It's a teaser for today's score.

150
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:19,895
Five to zero.

151
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:22,148
Boom.

152
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:23,816
That little…

153
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,860
Hey, stop him!

154
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:27,486
Stop him!

155
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,322
-Hey, get him!
-Hey!

156
00:08:31,282 --> 00:08:32,742
-Hey, no foul!
-That's a foul!

157
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:36,162
-Foul!
-Stop him!

158
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:37,371
Mr. Jang!

159
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,292
What are you doing?

160
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,294
FC YANGCHON

161
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,178
Darn it.

162
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:53,929
Give me the ball back!

163
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,724
Okay, one-on-one!

164
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:04,982
Mr. Jang! Jun-u!

165
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:14,659
Are you doing that on purpose?

166
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:17,620
If they kick the ball this way,
you have to block it, not fall down!

167
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:21,666
-Block it!
-Yeah, block it!

168
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:37,264
-This is our goal.
-What was that?

169
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:39,558
-I was…
-Are you crazy?

170
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:40,935
-Were you confused?
-Well…

171
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:43,062
I was going to head it out.

172
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:49,026
Let's change our strategy.

173
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,654
When Harvard gets the ball,

174
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:53,280
we'll all guard him.

175
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:55,157
Gather around him. All of you.

176
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:59,620
After you take the ball from him,
pass, shoot, and score.

177
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:01,330
Pass and score.

178
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:04,250
And Jun-u and Yeong-sil are out.

179
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,627
Nan-hui and Gi-ppeum…

180
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,796
you're in!

181
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,256
Let's go!

182
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:12,550
-Guard him!
-Don't come this way!

183
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:13,676
Oh, no!

184
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,344
Oh, my gosh. What happened?

185
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:17,847
What's wrong? I barely touched you.

186
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,265
I only pushed you a little!

187
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:20,558
Nice one, Nan-hui!

188
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:23,561
Hey, someone's hurt here!

189
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:27,606
What? Don't come this way. Stay away!

190
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,611
No!

191
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:37,241
Don't come this way.

192
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:50,796
You must be psychic.
You got it exactly right.

193
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:52,840
Five to zero.

194
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:01,348
You said you were going to
teach us how to win.

195
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:06,270
Hold on.

196
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,274
It's not over yet.

197
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:11,317
What?

198
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,986
We're attorneys.
We might have lost by the score.

199
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:16,405
But we haven't lost the battle.

200
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:20,784
Sir.

201
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:22,703
-For crying out loud!
-Damn it.

202
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:24,622
Goodness.

203
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:29,543
What? Illegal players?

204
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:32,671
Even in morning soccer leagues,
rules do exist.

205
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:34,381
Even if you'd wanted to win that badly,

206
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:37,384
you can't hire foreign players
for this recreational game.

207
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:39,678
Stop, Mr. Kang.

208
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:41,931
-What?
-Foreign players?

209
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:44,475
What?

210
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:47,645
Then, are you saying
this person is Korean?

211
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:48,771
I am Korean.

212
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,358
My dad is from Nigeria,
but my mom is Korean.

213
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:53,859
I was born in Korea too.

214
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:56,320
Geez.

215
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:01,116
Then, is he Korean too?

216
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,911
My mom is Iranian,
but my father is Korean.

217
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:06,956
Right. His dad met his mom
while vacationing in Tehran.

218
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,208
My mother is Egyptian.

219
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,126
Yeah, while doing trade in Cairo,

220
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,711
his parents got together.

221
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:14,505
His mom is very beautiful.

222
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:17,758
I guess Seoul people
live in a different world.

223
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:19,677
What?

224
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:21,804
That's right, Mr. Kang.

225
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,516
We have so many multicultural families
in Yangchon-gun.

226
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:26,934
Don't you know what they are?

227
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:33,065
-We lost both in the game and in conduct.
-Let's go, Gi-ppeum.

228
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:34,316
How embarrassing.

229
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:40,990
Well, all right then.

230
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:42,992
We'll talk about this issue next time.

231
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:44,034
-Okay.
-Sure.

232
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:45,369
Wait for me!

233
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:47,913
-Bye!
-Mr. Jang!

234
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,164
Wait for me!

235
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,427
Do we really have to do this?

236
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,637
-It's so trivial.
-Come on.

237
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:07,558
The local human rights organization
requested the case and really wanted help.

238
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:09,393
Nothing's trivial about human rights.

239
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:14,398
In the end, it's just a divorce suit,
and it's obvious what happened.

240
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:17,985
She came to Korea to make money
and got married through a broker.

241
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:21,739
Once she got the marriage visa
and got settled, she wants a divorce.

242
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:25,576
This happens a lot these days.

243
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:27,494
Taking this case won't be a benefit.

244
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,249
Hello. Come this way.

245
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:36,003
Won't be a benefit to who?

246
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:40,883
What?

247
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,427
I mean, obviously,

248
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,221
I'm saying it won't benefit Team Pro Bono.

249
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:49,850
You mean it won't help
with your popularity.

250
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:53,687
You need to do a lot of praiseworthy cases
to be called "the people's judge."

251
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:57,066
Come on, Ms. Park.

252
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:00,194
Do you see me
as someone that shallow again?

253
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:02,071
No.

254
00:14:02,154 --> 00:14:04,073
I see you as a thick-skinned person.

255
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,242
Why have you been giving me
attitude recently?

256
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:08,369
Did I do something wrong?

257
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:09,828
-Did you?
-What?

258
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:13,707
Let's not do this.
Why don't you just meet with her?

259
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,835
She's from Yangchon, which is where
the soccer team we played is from.

260
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:20,673
-That Yangchon from last time?
-Yes.

261
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:23,592
Why is she coming all the way here?

262
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:26,303
She should go
to the local human rights organization.

263
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:31,016
I just told you this was requested
by the local human rights group.

264
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,394
She's here.

265
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:42,695
You're…

266
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:44,697
The Pikki Pikki girl?

267
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,990
-She's so cool.
-She really is.

268
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:50,285
Is this Team Pro Bono?

269
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:51,620
-No.
-Hey.

270
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:53,038
It is.

271
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:56,000
What brings you here?

272
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:01,422
I want to get a divorce.

273
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:05,092
Help me.

274
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:09,555
She is…

275
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:12,057
the client.

276
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:25,112
Gosh, Mr. Kang.

277
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:27,614
You look totally different
off the soccer field.

278
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:29,700
On the field, you were…

279
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:34,121
Stop it.

280
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:37,041
I don't really like that dance.

281
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:42,671
By the way, Kaya,
your Korean is really good.

282
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:47,259
-How long have you lived in Korea?
-I think about two years.

283
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:48,260
Two years?

284
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:50,512
But how are you so fluent?

285
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,433
I've studied Korean since I was young.

286
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,232
"Every moment I spent with you shined."

287
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:08,489
-"Because the weather was good…"
-"Because the weather was bad…"

288
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:11,075
"And because the weather was good enough."

289
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:14,036
-"Every day was good."
-"Every day was good."

290
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,121
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God
was amazing!

291
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:18,165
You must've liked Korean dramas.

292
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:21,585
Korea in those Korean dramas
was what I dreamt of.

293
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:25,464
Everything was pretty.

294
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:27,591
And they sparkled so brightly.

295
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:29,927
I love pretty stuff.

296
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,386
Me too.

297
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,679
And--

298
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:34,014
You must've been disappointed.

299
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:35,599
The real Korea

300
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:38,018
isn't a fairytale that appears

301
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,104
when you walk
through the door in Guardian.

302
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:45,400
That's not why I'm getting a divorce.

303
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:49,780
I'm not an immature little girl.

304
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:51,198
What is the reason then?

305
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:59,790
-We don't get along.
-You don't get along? Is that all?

306
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,544
All Koreans get divorced because of that.

307
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:05,754
Is that not enough for me?

308
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:13,095
Kaya, that's not the case,

309
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:15,055
but if you want to file a divorce,

310
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:18,809
there has to be a significant reason
why you can't maintain your marriage.

311
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:20,894
Do you have a specific reason?

312
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,153
My husband…

313
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:33,115
keeps getting suspicious of me.

314
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:34,700
What is he suspicious about?

315
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:37,327
-He thinks I have another man.
-Do you?

316
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:40,581
-Mr. Kang!
-We have to check the facts.

317
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:41,707
Do you have another man?

318
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,836
From what I saw the other day,
I bet you're very popular.

319
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:48,922
Why?

320
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,592
Am I pretty?

321
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,468
Does my opinion matter?

322
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:55,971
What matters is
what the people around you think.

323
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:00,726
You can ask them about that.

324
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:05,230
Anyway, I don't have another man.

325
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:08,442
But your husband
groundlessly suspects that you do.

326
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:10,110
"Damn bitch."

327
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:17,075
He insults me like that.

328
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:21,997
He takes away my phone
and keeps being suspicious of me.

329
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,624
I want to get divorced…

330
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:28,086
just like other Korean women.

331
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:37,930
Refuse the case? Why?

332
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:40,557
She brought the counseling report too.

333
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:43,936
Pathological jealousy and verbal abuse
make a case for a divorce.

334
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,104
Are you sure this is a pro bono case?

335
00:18:46,188 --> 00:18:47,439
Why wouldn't it be?

336
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:49,399
In whose public interest is this?

337
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:51,151
What are you talking about?

338
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:55,572
You saw her walk in with high-end clothes,
sunglasses, and a scarf on.

339
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:58,533
You said she's from
a poor indigenous highland family.

340
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:00,535
It seemed like her Korean Dream came true.

341
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:04,122
That doesn't change
the reason for divorce though.

342
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:06,917
Those were high-end clothes,
but they were knockoffs.

343
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,960
What?

344
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:09,503
And they seemed to be made by hand,

345
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:11,630
clearly made with cheap fabrics
from the market.

346
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,716
Come to think of it,
when she was cheerleading last time,

347
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,052
the skirt looked like
it had been sewn together.

348
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:19,263
-Really?
-Yes.

349
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:20,555
And how do you know that?

350
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:24,810
It's nothing.
I just learned a bit when I worked

351
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:26,728
with Cheonggyecheon Seamers' Union

352
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:28,689
-in the past.
-Is that so?

353
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:31,858
"And how do you know that?"
means something else and you know it.

354
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:35,028
Just what kind of life have you lived?

355
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:38,282
I'm worried about
his severe pathological jealousy.

356
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:40,784
Kaya seemed like a lively person though.

357
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,787
Okay, fine!
Let's say it is pathological jealousy.

358
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,416
Why would she want a divorce by trial
and not by mutual agreement?

359
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,293
You know why, Ms. Park.

360
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:50,836
People on marriage visas

361
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,547
can't stay in Korea
after a divorce by mutual agreement.

362
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,799
They can only stay in Korea
if they get divorced

363
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:59,678
due to their partner's fault
and get a marriage-terminating visa.

364
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:02,889
I see.

365
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,018
In that case,
she can start afresh without worries.

366
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:07,185
Or whatever.

367
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:11,064
Then, she can bring her boyfriend
from back home and get married again.

368
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:12,149
Of course, some do that.

369
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:13,734
But are you being biased

370
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:16,445
before even taking the case, Mr. Hwang?

371
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:20,532
-No, I'm not.
-I see.

372
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,077
Still, we can't take every case out there.

373
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,496
There's something called priority…

374
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,206
When we say public interest,

375
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,460
aren't we talking
about the benefit to Korean society?

376
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:34,921
There's a lot of Koreans
struggling in Korea. Do we have to…

377
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:38,925
Kaya is living in Korea
after marrying a Korean.

378
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:41,511
Is she not a member of Korean society?

379
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:42,971
-Sure.
-Public interest is assuring

380
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:46,725
that all members of society
are protected by the law.

381
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:50,187
Do they need a genealogy
that dates back to the Dangun era

382
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,773
to be protected by Korean law? Wait.

383
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:57,944
Or maybe they have to bring
an apple box filled with money?

384
00:20:58,904 --> 00:20:59,821
What?

385
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,494
Ms. Park, what did you just say?

386
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:07,371
I'm just saying!

387
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:09,748
Okay, everyone. Please stop.

388
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:12,793
Let's make our decision
after inspecting on-site.

389
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,879
There must be a lot
of edible mushrooms in Yangchon-gun,

390
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:19,466
such as wood ear, porcini,
and cauliflower mushrooms.

391
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:23,178
If we're lucky,
we might even find caterpillar fungus!

392
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,805
You must be stoked.

393
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:27,808
Let's all do the on-site inspection.

394
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:31,144
When I say "caterpillar fungus,"
you say "let's go!"

395
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:32,521
Why would we say that?

396
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:34,356
-Caterpillar fungus, let's go!
-Let's go!

397
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:36,024
What are we chanting about mushrooms?

398
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:38,318
-Just do it. Stop complaining.
-Let's give it a try.

399
00:21:42,864 --> 00:21:44,366
Caterpillar fungus would be amazing.

400
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:46,201
Give it a rest.

401
00:22:01,383 --> 00:22:02,217
Ms. Park.

402
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:06,221
I think you've been
acting cold to me lately.

403
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:07,472
My goodness.

404
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:10,225
And when was I ever warm to you?

405
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:11,309
Right.

406
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:15,272
Have you heard something strange about me?

407
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:17,649
Why? Are you hiding something?

408
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:18,733
Hiding?

409
00:22:19,693 --> 00:22:21,653
Of course, I'm not hiding anything.

410
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:25,490
I'm someone who can face the heavens
and have nothing to be ashamed of.

411
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:30,370
Okay, then.

412
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:31,580
What…

413
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:33,832
What do you mean, "Okay, then"?

414
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:35,167
I mean it's fine.

415
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,043
What's fine? Nothing's fine to me.

416
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:37,961
Hold on tight.

417
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:40,505
Geez!

418
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:56,563
YANGCHON ANIMAL HOSPITAL

419
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:04,863
Attorney Five to Zero!

420
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:09,826
Goodness.

421
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,204
A busy attorney like you
should rest on weekends.

422
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:13,705
What did you come here for?

423
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:16,583
We're pro bono attorneys.
We visit places from time to time

424
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,335
to provide a helping hand

425
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,672
and to remind ourselves of the meaning
behind each drop of sweat we shed.

426
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:24,382
Well, you're not sweating.

427
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:26,301
You're covered in sunscreen,

428
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:28,386
so you look like a ghost.

429
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:30,847
The sun's pretty strong today.

430
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:34,059
But it's okay.
I grew up in the countryside too.

431
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:36,186
This much sun is nothing.

432
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,897
Thanks to the sun,
these chilis are growing nice and…

433
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,857
Oh, my gosh!

434
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:42,692
Oh, my gosh! Mr. Kang!

435
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:44,527
Are you all right?

436
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:48,698
-Goodness.
-Geez. You look like a ghost.

437
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:50,575
Geez.

438
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:53,870
Attorney Five to Zero!

439
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:56,081
You sure you don't have to go
see a doctor?

440
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:58,541
I don't need a doctor
for something like this.

441
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:00,585
Geez. I should get back--

442
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:02,629
-Oh, my goodness!
-Oh, my goodness!

443
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:03,713
My goodness.

444
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,882
That's enough. Forget about it.

445
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,467
Get some rest. Take a break.

446
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,635
Should I?

447
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:11,263
But why are the others you came with

448
00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:13,848
such good workers?

449
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:15,517
Who?

450
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:18,353
-Be careful.
-Thank you!

451
00:24:18,436 --> 00:24:19,854
-Go!
-Give me more.

452
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,690
-Here.
-Gosh.

453
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:22,899
-Go!
-I'm off!

454
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:24,442
Why is she so strong?

455
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:27,696
Gosh, thank you.

456
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:29,656
Okay, here it comes!

457
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:31,700
Are you all right?

458
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,053
Good heavens!

459
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:53,847
-Oh, my.
-It split right in half.

460
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:05,900
You're amazing.

461
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:12,490
Goodness, look at those long legs.

462
00:25:13,074 --> 00:25:15,201
I can't believe
how tall and good looking he is.

463
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:19,039
Young man, could you look
at our eaves after fixing that?

464
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,375
Sure thing, miss.
I'll for sure help you out.

465
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:23,793
Oh, my. He must be crazy.

466
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,254
He called me "miss"!

467
00:25:28,465 --> 00:25:32,427
You're an attorney, but they should
lock you up for what you said.

468
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:36,890
Good question. Why are they good at this?

469
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:40,643
Then, I should get back to--

470
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:42,020
-My goodness!
-Goodness!

471
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:43,813
Forget it. Take a break.

472
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:44,898
Gosh.

473
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:46,816
Time for refreshments, Chief!

474
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,943
All right. Refreshments.

475
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:52,822
Okay, everyone!
Come get some refreshments!

476
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:54,741
Come on now! Yes, our attorneys too!

477
00:25:54,824 --> 00:25:56,910
We have a variety of refreshments

478
00:25:56,993 --> 00:25:58,870
since this is Yangchon-ri.

479
00:25:58,953 --> 00:25:59,871
-Yes.
-All right. Here.

480
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:01,373
This is called tang mian.

481
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:03,291
It's Chinese noodle soup. Zhongguo mian.

482
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:06,336
This is pancit bihon,
the Philippines' version of japchae.

483
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,922
This is som tam, which is a Thai dish.

484
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:10,757
It's like what kimchi is in Korea.

485
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,008
-I see.
-Over there,

486
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:14,552
that's Vietnamese bun cha.

487
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:15,595
Have whatever you like.

488
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:17,430
Thank you for the food.

489
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,849
It's like a hotel buffet.

490
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:23,561
Goodness, this was all prepared
by the wives of our village.

491
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:26,147
We are the world here.

492
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:32,862
This stew is authentic.
There must be a Korean housewife here too.

493
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:35,949
Kaya made that zucchini stew.

494
00:26:36,616 --> 00:26:40,286
-The governor's daughter-in-law.
-I made it. It's good, right?

495
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,204
Yes.

496
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:44,165
Okay. Why don't we drink some makgeolli?

497
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,418
All right, everyone. Cheers!

498
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:48,503
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

499
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,549
Cheers, kanpai, bù zuì bù guī,
sự nâng ly, bersulang!

500
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:54,134
Sir, how many languages do you speak?

501
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:56,386
I'm a language genius.

502
00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:02,642
-Nice.
-Stop drinking, sir.

503
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:07,272
Okay, let's share
the information we've gathered.

504
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:11,985
All of their stories don't add up.

505
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:14,904
Geez. Don't even get me started.

506
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:16,114
Ever since Kaya came here,

507
00:27:16,197 --> 00:27:18,575
all the village men have been smitten.

508
00:27:18,658 --> 00:27:21,995
That little fox wears
all these unusual outfits day and night.

509
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:23,997
I don't know
where she gets the money from.

510
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:26,666
-But she's a sweet kid.
-What?

511
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:28,710
She asked me for the recipe

512
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:31,045
to make zucchini stew
since her in-laws like it

513
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:33,089
and wrote it down in her notebook.

514
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:36,259
The governor's son?

515
00:27:36,342 --> 00:27:39,429
He got a wife like that
thanks to his parents. Unbelievable.

516
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,600
I shouldn't say this,

517
00:27:43,683 --> 00:27:45,852
but I heard
the governor's daughter-in-law…

518
00:27:47,604 --> 00:27:48,938
is a bit promiscuous.

519
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:50,565
Really?

520
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:53,651
I'm just saying
that's what people whisper.

521
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:59,115
You could get punished
for saying baseless things about someone.

522
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:02,952
I mean, she smiles at everyone
who asks her anything,

523
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:05,872
so the village men go crazy for her.

524
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:09,250
My big sister Kaya is kind.

525
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:12,879
She always dresses me in fancy clothes.

526
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,423
She takes cute photos of me too.

527
00:28:16,758 --> 00:28:18,176
You really do look cute.

528
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:22,805
Why on earth are you talking
to a grandma going senile?

529
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:24,891
Hello, I…

530
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:28,144
There's a lot of rumors
about Kaya having affairs with men,

531
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,188
but they seemed groundless.

532
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:31,689
Exactly.

533
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:33,775
Honestly, it was difficult to hear them.

534
00:28:33,858 --> 00:28:36,986
There even was a rumor
that Kaya worked in a hostess club.

535
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,363
How could they say such things?

536
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:43,117
Do you have some kind of fantasy
about country people?

537
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:45,370
-Pardon?
-That they're nice, humane,

538
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:46,830
and they help one another?

539
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:49,833
That's just a fantasy
found only in TV shows.

540
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,253
They're jealous people
and never stop gossiping about others.

541
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:55,338
They're always nosy

542
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:58,132
but ignore people
when they go through real hardships.

543
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:01,052
That's how real country people are.

544
00:29:07,684 --> 00:29:11,229
What are you doing here?
Hurry and go get changed.

545
00:29:11,312 --> 00:29:13,106
The governor said

546
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:16,484
he's taking you fine people from Seoul
to his house.

547
00:29:17,694 --> 00:29:19,153
Look at this house!

548
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:20,780
Welcome, everyone.

549
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:21,865
Nice to meet you.

550
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:24,158
Thank you so much
for inviting us to dinner.

551
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:26,327
Busy attorneys came all the way from Seoul

552
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:28,204
to help out in our town,

553
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:29,664
so how can I ignore them?

554
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:32,333
-Honey, our guests are here.
-Welcome.

555
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:35,837
My goodness.
I'm sorry our house is so shabby.

556
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:39,591
-No, no.
-You didn't have to do all this.

557
00:29:39,674 --> 00:29:41,885
-Your house is beautiful.
-Thank you.

558
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:45,722
Dinner isn't ready yet,
so please come to the annex.

559
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:47,640
-Okay.
-This way.

560
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:50,643
Come this way. This is the annex.

561
00:29:51,394 --> 00:29:52,228
Kaya.

562
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:54,022
-Yes!
-Our guests are here.

563
00:29:55,106 --> 00:29:56,441
-Hello.
-All right.

564
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,402
Is this your studio, Kaya?

565
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:01,571
Yes, I make clothes in this room.

566
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:03,865
Gosh, your room is so pretty.

567
00:30:03,948 --> 00:30:06,492
She is a very talented one.

568
00:30:06,576 --> 00:30:08,745
Our family is so lucky to have her.

569
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:12,832
My pretty wife. My kind Kaya.

570
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:15,501
-Honey!
-Hi, honey.

571
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:17,378
Are you done working?

572
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:19,047
Play with me now!

573
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,548
-Well…
-Dong-min.

574
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:22,175
Honey!

575
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:24,218
Only play with me.

576
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:27,847
-Honey, we have guests here.
-Let's go.

577
00:30:28,598 --> 00:30:30,350
Don't do that, Dong-min.

578
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:31,267
Kaya!

579
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:33,311
-I missed you.
-That little brat.

580
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:35,688
She's playing only with me!

581
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,983
He's usually not like that.

582
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:50,411
It's not much, but we hope you enjoy.

583
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:54,666
I'm sure you were very surprised earlier.
That was my son.

584
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:58,795
He loves his wife so much.

585
00:30:58,878 --> 00:31:02,006
My son hurt his head when he was young,

586
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,634
but he's very kind and gentle.

587
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:06,135
By the way,

588
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:09,639
Kaya isn't going to eat with us?

589
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:11,975
My son is pretty shy.

590
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:17,480
The two of them enjoy meals by themselves.
They're still in the honeymoon phase.

591
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:22,986
Then, do they stay
only in the annex in the evening?

592
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:24,737
-Does she go out--
-Nan-hui.

593
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:27,240
It's nothing.

594
00:31:29,283 --> 00:31:33,246
Here. This is a precious ginseng wine
I received as a present.

595
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:34,914
Let's drink.

596
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,002
-I have to drive.
-I see.

597
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:41,963
Those are pretty nice orchids, Mr. Cho.

598
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:44,340
Do you like orchids?

599
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:48,970
I don't really know much about them.
But I see it was sent by Lee Hak-ju.

600
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:51,639
Isn't he the chief
of Woongcheon District Court?

601
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:54,392
Yes, that's right. Goodness.

602
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:56,936
I said it was all right,
but he insisted on sending it.

603
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,148
As governor,
my husband always refuses gifts,

604
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:02,483
but people don't listen to him.

605
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,989
-Okay, let's eat.
-Yes.

606
00:32:09,115 --> 00:32:10,658
-Thank you for the food.
-Your welcome.

607
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:11,784
Thank you.

608
00:32:29,343 --> 00:32:30,470
What are you thinking about?

609
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:34,348
Nothing.

610
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:38,603
After visiting the countryside,
it just reminds me of the old days.

611
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:41,814
You said earlier today

612
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:44,984
that country people are always nosy

613
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,279
but ignore people
when they go through real hardships.

614
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,282
Did something happen
back in your hometown?

615
00:32:56,704 --> 00:32:57,747
It was nothing.

616
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:02,001
The law just isn't
on the common people's side.

617
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:05,338
I learned that for sure.

618
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:08,049
When you say the law, by any chance…

619
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:13,554
With our situation,
we can't afford to sue.

620
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:16,724
We don't have money for an attorney.

621
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:17,892
I'll do it.

622
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,687
I'll handle everything,
so just focus on getting better.

623
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:24,107
You don't know how the world works yet.

624
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:29,278
There's no one who will help
a family like us, Da-wit.

625
00:33:31,697 --> 00:33:33,324
Without money and power…

626
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:36,786
you're just lonely.

627
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,085
You can help them now, can't you?

628
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:49,090
-What?
-The lonely ones without money and power,

629
00:33:49,715 --> 00:33:51,634
just like how you were before.

630
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:54,303
You can help them now.

631
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:56,264
So they won't be lonely.

632
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:15,283
I'm sorry.

633
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:18,286
I shouldn't say that
when I don't know what happened.

634
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,246
I can't believe myself.

635
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:22,748
Get some rest.

636
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:24,500
It's all right.

637
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:50,610
Honey! Only play with me.

638
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,571
-Don't do that, Dong-min.
-Kaya!

639
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:55,198
She's playing only with me!

640
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:56,824
At the partners' meeting,

641
00:34:56,908 --> 00:35:00,244
they told us not to take Kaya's case
and to find another case.

642
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:01,662
What? Why?

643
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:03,289
They said there's not enough evidence

644
00:35:03,372 --> 00:35:05,666
and it won't help the image of the firm.

645
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,339
Let's take this case.

646
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:13,633
-What?
-All of a sudden?

647
00:35:17,386 --> 00:35:20,806
How can a foreign wife's divorce case
be a public interest case?

648
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,391
It's a private interest case.

649
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:24,894
Sir, it's about the human rights
of an immigrant woman

650
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:27,104
who's not readily protected by the law.

651
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:29,523
If we don't help her,
it'll be hard for her to get help--

652
00:35:29,607 --> 00:35:33,819
Cases involving immigrants and refugees
won't be received well.

653
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:38,157
Ms. Park, don't you understand
what the world is like these days?

654
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:41,786
While everyone is struggling
to make ends meet,

655
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:43,663
an immigrant woman's human rights?

656
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:46,123
Did anyone hold a knife
to her throat to come to Korea?

657
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,417
A hit!

658
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:51,087
-What?
-It'll be a hit.

659
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,255
A hit?

660
00:35:54,006 --> 00:35:57,051
The governor's family, who have been
rich landowners for generations.

661
00:35:57,134 --> 00:35:59,262
A husband with intellectual disabilities.

662
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:03,099
A smart and charming daughter-in-law
from overseas who lives in captivity.

663
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:06,269
It's a story the media would go crazy for.

664
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:07,728
It'll go viral.

665
00:36:07,812 --> 00:36:08,688
Mr. Kang.

666
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:12,233
You keep an unprofitable Pro Bono Team
because it's for PR, isn't it?

667
00:36:12,316 --> 00:36:14,902
Criticism is better
than no feedback at all.

668
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:17,321
It's a case worth betting on.

669
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:19,782
Goodness, you can save it.

670
00:36:19,865 --> 00:36:23,619
Ever since "the people's judge" arrived,
we've been walking on thin ice.

671
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:27,164
Why did someone
who craves attention like you

672
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:29,792
have to come to our firm
and make all this commotion?

673
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:33,838
Goodness. I'm sorry I'm late.

674
00:36:34,964 --> 00:36:36,924
It was no fun without me, wasn't it?

675
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:39,885
Gosh, Ms. Oh. Since you're busy,
you didn't have to come.

676
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,429
So, what was the conclusion?

677
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:44,098
You have one, right?

678
00:36:45,558 --> 00:36:47,101
Of course.

679
00:36:47,184 --> 00:36:48,811
Considering the recent social climate,

680
00:36:48,894 --> 00:36:51,188
-this kind of case is--
-That's right.

681
00:36:51,272 --> 00:36:54,608
Considering the recent social climate,
we obviously should take it.

682
00:36:55,568 --> 00:36:57,236
Ms. Oh, what are you talking about?

683
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,614
Who wants to work in factories
or on farms these days?

684
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:03,576
Our entrepreneur clients are up in arms

685
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:05,619
because they can't find people to work.

686
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:07,663
If we want to maintain
cheap and good labor,

687
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:11,834
we must show they won't face any injustice
when they come to Korea and send…

688
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,919
some kind of signal, right?

689
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:19,717
We'll be counting on you,
Mr. Kang and Ms. Park.

690
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:24,180
You can go down first.

691
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:29,143
Thank you

692
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:30,770
for backing us up.

693
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:35,649
I backed you up? Me?

694
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:37,568
Didn't you?

695
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:42,031
Attorney Park Gi-ppeum.

696
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:43,449
She's an interesting one.

697
00:37:44,325 --> 00:37:45,534
Ms. Park? Why?

698
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:48,162
She threatened me

699
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,748
with your video.

700
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:55,002
What?

701
00:37:58,214 --> 00:37:59,632
Goodness.

702
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:09,308
Why are you showing this to me?

703
00:38:12,103 --> 00:38:13,270
Ms. Oh,

704
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:16,148
you knew about this too, didn't you?

705
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:20,486
You knew why
Mr. Kang suddenly quit being a judge.

706
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:22,822
What makes you think so?

707
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:24,824
You two went to JRTI together.

708
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:26,951
Then, you'd know very well

709
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:29,245
that Mr. Kang wouldn't choose
to be a pro bono attorney

710
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:32,873
who doesn't have money or power.

711
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,086
And what if that was so?

712
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:42,675
Team Pro Bono isn't a laundromat.

713
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,053
It's not for appointing someone
with a weakness

714
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:48,431
as team leader
to clean up their image.

715
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,731
You came to me directly
instead of raising the issue publicly.

716
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:02,445
Does that mean you have something
you want from me?

717
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:04,655
I just want you

718
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,616
to support us

719
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,119
so we can do our job well.

720
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:13,080
You want my support?

721
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:15,416
You're promoting
Pro Bono Team led by Mr. Kang

722
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,461
as your own achievement in a major way.

723
00:39:19,128 --> 00:39:21,046
Then shouldn't you show
a little responsibility

724
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:26,051
until it's proven that Mr. Kang deserves
to be our team leader?

725
00:39:31,974 --> 00:39:34,852
Did Ms. Park really do that?

726
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:37,271
I should bring her back to the M&A Team.

727
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:39,148
She has a talent for negotiating.

728
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:41,233
Gosh, I just love her.

729
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:42,276
Wait.

730
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,737
How on earth did she get the video--

731
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,864
Take care of it, okay?

732
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:50,659
Don't let her do something reckless.

733
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,002
Damn it.

734
00:40:05,257 --> 00:40:07,259
DIVORCE SUIT

735
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:08,344
Mr. Kang?

736
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:12,723
The immigrants' human rights organization
requested this?

737
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:15,768
Do they have a rest area
to use as a temporary shelter?

738
00:40:16,352 --> 00:40:18,103
-They do.
-During the divorce suit,

739
00:40:18,187 --> 00:40:20,940
let's ask them to take in Kaya.
It won't take long.

740
00:40:21,023 --> 00:40:24,944
What? We don't have
enough evidence to win the case yet.

741
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:28,113
Kaya herself is the evidence.

742
00:40:28,197 --> 00:40:29,782
What do you mean?

743
00:40:29,865 --> 00:40:32,326
Wasn't there anything strange
in the villagers' stories?

744
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:37,164
How Kaya dressed.

745
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:39,875
How she dressed?

746
00:40:41,377 --> 00:40:44,547
She wears short skirts recklessly.

747
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,590
-What's wrong with it?
-Think about it.

748
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:48,342
Remember how she dressed when we saw her?

749
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:52,304
She didn't want to tan
while working in the farm.

750
00:40:52,388 --> 00:40:54,181
What about the day she came here?

751
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:56,809
It was really hot that day.

752
00:40:57,893 --> 00:40:59,478
-It was 35°C.
-What?

753
00:41:00,854 --> 00:41:02,106
Right. But two weeks before…

754
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:08,404
How she dressed
drastically changed within two weeks.

755
00:41:08,487 --> 00:41:10,656
That means something happened.

756
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:14,994
Something that made her
cover up to her neck

757
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:17,580
in 35°C heat.

758
00:41:25,087 --> 00:41:26,839
I brought her.

759
00:41:26,922 --> 00:41:28,048
Thank you.

760
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:33,178
You can't keep coming here.

761
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:35,389
People will look at me strangely.

762
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:37,391
It's just for a moment.

763
00:41:37,474 --> 00:41:38,809
On the day we played soccer,

764
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:43,063
word about the way you dressed and danced
spread around the village, didn't it?

765
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,985
And the villagers who didn't like you
from the beginning

766
00:41:48,068 --> 00:41:49,403
probably exaggerated it.

767
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:51,905
Was your husband furious?

768
00:41:58,746 --> 00:42:01,999
Your husband put the lock
on your window, didn't he?

769
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:06,045
She's playing only with me!

770
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,465
DOOR LOCKS, THREE-PIECE SET

771
00:42:09,548 --> 00:42:13,719
Kaya, you've mustered up the courage
to get divorced anyway.

772
00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:17,514
You have to be honest for us to help you.

773
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:24,146
What are you hiding with your scarf?

774
00:42:24,938 --> 00:42:26,857
This is just--

775
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,651
Who are you protecting?

776
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:30,235
Your husband?

777
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:35,282
A criminal complaint will help you
in the divorce suit.

778
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:36,617
You can't do that!

779
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:39,828
Kaya, if you want,

780
00:42:39,912 --> 00:42:41,705
we'll help you get divorced quietly.

781
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,167
Really?

782
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:52,216
I can really just get a divorce?

783
00:42:53,801 --> 00:42:54,802
Yes.

784
00:43:19,952 --> 00:43:21,620
SUWON FAMILY COURT,
SINGLE-JUDGE DIVISION

785
00:43:27,376 --> 00:43:28,377
Plaintiff's Counsel.

786
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,338
What is the reason for the divorce?

787
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:32,548
Yes, Your Honor.

788
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:35,384
They are pathological jealousy,
verbal abuse, and…

789
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:37,344
Kaya.

790
00:43:41,765 --> 00:43:42,975
And attempted murder.

791
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,440
COURT 301, TODAY'S TRIALS

792
00:43:49,523 --> 00:43:52,693
Alyona, you're from Kazakhstan. Correct?

793
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,696
-Yes.
-And you work at a restaurant downtown?

794
00:43:56,613 --> 00:43:57,448
Yes.

795
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:58,866
Do you know Kaya here?

796
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,830
Yes, we're learning Korean together
in a study room.

797
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:09,710
On the evening of the 2nd,
did you see Kaya's husband

798
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:11,837
at the restaurant?

799
00:44:16,175 --> 00:44:19,928
-Yes.
-Can you tell us what you saw that night?

800
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:22,055
-Let's drink.
-Okay.

801
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:23,182
Drink.

802
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:27,895
-Does it taste good?
-Yeah.

803
00:44:28,937 --> 00:44:32,566
Dude, instead of stuffing your face,
you should control your wife.

804
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:34,526
My wife?

805
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,988
Geez. Yes, your wife.

806
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:40,491
Do you know how she was
during the soccer game?

807
00:44:41,283 --> 00:44:43,202
What? My wife is kind.

808
00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:45,329
Kind, my foot. Hey.

809
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:47,581
Her skirt was so short
I could see her underpants.

810
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:48,749
You saw it, right?

811
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:50,083
With her arms and legs… Geez.

812
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,753
I was more embarrassed watching.

813
00:44:52,836 --> 00:44:54,296
Be careful.

814
00:44:54,379 --> 00:44:57,341
There's a bunch of guys
who want your wife.

815
00:44:57,424 --> 00:45:00,302
I heard they all went to karaoke together
after the soccer game.

816
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:02,012
When did she come home?

817
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,348
Did she even come home?

818
00:45:04,932 --> 00:45:07,476
We're telling you
because we're your friends.

819
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:10,354
There are only damn wolves out there.

820
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:15,150
Stop lying! My wife isn't like that.

821
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,861
-Okay. Hey!
-Dude!

822
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:19,988
Dude, I got it!

823
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:21,240
Geez, that scared me.

824
00:45:21,865 --> 00:45:24,576
Counsel, you may examine the plaintiff.

825
00:45:25,702 --> 00:45:27,579
That evening…

826
00:45:27,663 --> 00:45:30,332
We can't hear you. Please speak louder.

827
00:45:30,415 --> 00:45:31,708
Okay, I'm sorry.

828
00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:38,507
I went home in the evening
after working at the farm.

829
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:47,015
Honey! What are you doing?
I made those clothes!

830
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,476
-These clothes… Don't wear these!
-Honey!

831
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,728
Honey, don't do this!

832
00:45:51,812 --> 00:45:53,689
Your phone! Give me your phone!

833
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:55,023
Why?

834
00:45:55,107 --> 00:45:56,608
Your phone!

835
00:45:59,945 --> 00:46:00,988
Give it!

836
00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:03,699
Now, you stay only with me!

837
00:46:03,782 --> 00:46:06,451
Don't go out at night! Stay only with me!

838
00:46:06,535 --> 00:46:09,371
But I don't go out at night!

839
00:46:09,955 --> 00:46:13,750
I study Korean every night!

840
00:46:14,376 --> 00:46:15,961
So I can become Korean!

841
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:17,838
You don't need to study Korean!

842
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:19,631
You stay with me!

843
00:46:21,883 --> 00:46:23,176
Honey!

844
00:46:29,141 --> 00:46:34,563
Then, he came back home late
after getting really drunk.

845
00:46:34,646 --> 00:46:36,315
Your drunk husband

846
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:38,817
grabbed you by your shoulders
and shook you violently.

847
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,402
And he even strangled your neck?

848
00:46:42,029 --> 00:46:43,280
Yes.

849
00:46:43,363 --> 00:46:45,240
Stop lying!

850
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:46,700
Please be seated.

851
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,371
And you passed out too. Correct?

852
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:54,499
-Yes.
-No further questions, Your Honor.

853
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:56,418
Your Honor, the plaintiff's counsel

854
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:58,754
is defaming the defendant
without any facts.

855
00:46:58,837 --> 00:47:01,715
They're making things up
because the defendant has a disability.

856
00:47:01,798 --> 00:47:04,051
Can you not see the wound on her neck?

857
00:47:04,134 --> 00:47:06,637
When you strangle someone that hard,

858
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,597
that means it was attempted murder!

859
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,098
No!

860
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:14,227
What?

861
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:21,777
My husband is a good person.

862
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,737
It was a mistake.

863
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,074
He never did it to kill me.

864
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:30,827
I know. It really was a mistake.

865
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:37,209
Don't send my husband to jail,
Your Honor. Please.

866
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:39,753
Stop putting on an act, you filthy thing!

867
00:47:40,837 --> 00:47:43,965
Well, this is a divorce court,
not a criminal one.

868
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:46,009
Whether it was intended or not,

869
00:47:46,802 --> 00:47:48,887
due to the pathological jealousy
of the defendant,

870
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,223
the plaintiff feels very unsafe,

871
00:47:51,306 --> 00:47:53,517
enough to make her unable
to maintain this marriage.

872
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,560
This is our claim.

873
00:47:55,644 --> 00:47:58,730
Your Honor, the defense
would also like to request witnesses.

874
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:02,567
There are many of them,
so we ask you give us enough time.

875
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:06,863
Okay. We'll resume in three weeks
at 2:00 p.m.

876
00:48:15,205 --> 00:48:16,540
That was tough, wasn't it?

877
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,251
Thank you.

878
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,753
It's too early to thank us.

879
00:48:21,837 --> 00:48:23,004
We've only just begun.

880
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:26,675
Mr. Jang went to see the village head,
didn't he? Is he going to testify?

881
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,181
I knew it.

882
00:48:33,765 --> 00:48:37,018
Since Kaya's in-laws have been the leaders
of the village for generations,

883
00:48:37,102 --> 00:48:38,770
no one will step forth easily.

884
00:48:41,857 --> 00:48:43,900
It's a bit tough

885
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:47,446
since it feels like things
are blowing up because of me.

886
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:51,158
It's a small town,
so everyone will know it by now.

887
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,534
Kaya.

888
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:55,412
Just think about yourself.

889
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:57,330
Don't think about anyone else.

890
00:48:57,956 --> 00:48:58,915
Okay?

891
00:49:01,168 --> 00:49:02,419
Thank you.

892
00:49:02,502 --> 00:49:04,713
We'll see you at the next hearing then.

893
00:49:06,256 --> 00:49:07,257
Okay.

894
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:09,426
Goodbye.

895
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:21,772
Mr. Kang.

896
00:49:22,898 --> 00:49:23,774
Yes?

897
00:49:23,857 --> 00:49:25,025
Did you call the reporters?

898
00:49:26,693 --> 00:49:29,070
Why would we do this
if no one knows about it?

899
00:49:29,154 --> 00:49:30,947
We're not even getting paid for this.

900
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:34,618
You know how much she wants
to get divorced quietly.

901
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,539
Don't look at me like that

902
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:42,334
when you're as good
of a negotiator as I am.

903
00:49:43,126 --> 00:49:43,960
Sorry?

904
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,174
You went to see Ms. Oh.

905
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:53,220
Why didn't you ask me anything?

906
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:55,305
-About what?
-You know.

907
00:49:58,683 --> 00:50:00,185
You don't even want to know?

908
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:03,438
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

909
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:08,652
We're in the middle of a trial.

910
00:50:09,194 --> 00:50:11,196
Let's talk about your issue later.

911
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:21,540
So basically, "That's your problem."

912
00:50:26,169 --> 00:50:27,504
I thought we were a team.

913
00:50:54,155 --> 00:50:57,659
What happened? My little girl looks down.

914
00:50:59,119 --> 00:50:59,995
It's nothing.

915
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:09,546
Has this ever happened to you?

916
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:16,094
You feel down because you keep wanting to
trust someone who can't be trusted.

917
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:19,222
Of course.

918
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:23,310
That was how I lost our house.

919
00:51:29,149 --> 00:51:31,026
You don't trust just anyone now.
Right, Dad?

920
00:51:33,403 --> 00:51:35,697
That's right. And that's why it's hard.

921
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:49,628
Counsel,

922
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:52,088
you may examine the defendant.

923
00:51:52,172 --> 00:51:53,006
Yes, Your Honor.

924
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:56,760
When you came home late
and drunk that night,

925
00:51:57,344 --> 00:51:58,970
did you strangle your wife?

926
00:52:00,472 --> 00:52:01,723
No.

927
00:52:01,806 --> 00:52:03,141
Could you please say it louder?

928
00:52:03,224 --> 00:52:06,269
No. No, I didn't strangle her.

929
00:52:06,853 --> 00:52:10,482
Then, did you grab your wife
by her shoulders and shake her?

930
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,404
Please answer, Mr. Cho.

931
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:23,078
-Yes.
-You did grab her shoulders and shake her.

932
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:25,580
Why did you do that?

933
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:28,458
Please tell us.

934
00:52:32,212 --> 00:52:33,213
She said

935
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:35,298
she would leave.

936
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:38,301
Leave? She said she was going somewhere?

937
00:52:38,385 --> 00:52:41,304
Yes, to her family.

938
00:52:41,388 --> 00:52:42,389
To her family?

939
00:52:43,682 --> 00:52:45,308
Back to her home country?

940
00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:47,310
-Yes.
-Let me get this straight.

941
00:52:47,394 --> 00:52:50,647
When you came home drunk that night,

942
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:54,109
she suddenly said
she'd go back to her home country.

943
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:57,904
So, you shook her
by the shoulders out of shock,

944
00:52:57,988 --> 00:53:01,241
but you never strangled her. Correct?

945
00:53:02,867 --> 00:53:03,785
Yes.

946
00:53:08,748 --> 00:53:09,874
That filthy bitch!

947
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,003
That ungrateful girl made it all up.

948
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:16,715
I can't believe she could accuse
my good son of attempted murder,

949
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:18,508
that damn bitch!

950
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:22,053
Ma'am, you are in court.
Mind your language.

951
00:53:23,346 --> 00:53:27,934
My apologies, Your Honor.
It's just so unfair.

952
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:31,730
People always say
no good deed goes unpunished.

953
00:53:33,732 --> 00:53:35,108
All right. Ma'am?

954
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:36,818
You believe

955
00:53:37,569 --> 00:53:40,196
the plaintiff provoked the defendant

956
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,074
by deliberately saying
she'd go back home, correct?

957
00:53:43,158 --> 00:53:44,784
Objection, Your Honor. He's leading her.

958
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:47,454
-Sustained.
-Okay. Let me rephrase it.

959
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:52,250
Why do you think
the plaintiff planned all of this

960
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,461
and requested a divorce by trial?

961
00:53:55,378 --> 00:53:56,671
Is there any basis for this?

962
00:53:56,755 --> 00:53:58,131
Yes, there is.

963
00:53:59,466 --> 00:54:00,550
Please tell us.

964
00:54:01,259 --> 00:54:05,221
She never had plans
to stay with us from the beginning.

965
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:07,015
Our family wants a grandchild

966
00:54:07,098 --> 00:54:09,309
and I worried about her
not getting pregnant.

967
00:54:09,392 --> 00:54:11,936
But there was a reason behind it.

968
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,023
I heard it from the pharmacist in town.

969
00:54:16,649 --> 00:54:19,903
Sir, do you run a pharmacy in Yangchon?

970
00:54:19,986 --> 00:54:22,197
-Yes.
-Did you see the plaintiff

971
00:54:23,031 --> 00:54:24,407
at your pharmacy recently?

972
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:29,162
-Yes.
-What kind of medicine did she ask for?

973
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:33,333
Well…

974
00:54:35,293 --> 00:54:36,294
Sir.

975
00:54:36,836 --> 00:54:39,339
Welcome. What do you need?

976
00:54:39,422 --> 00:54:41,883
Do you have that, by any chance?

977
00:54:44,135 --> 00:54:45,303
Pills to not have a baby?

978
00:54:45,386 --> 00:54:47,472
What? Birth control pills?

979
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:49,516
Why do you need those?

980
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,143
Oh, God. My stomach is killing me.

981
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:54,604
Give me some medicine.
I have a stomachache.

982
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:56,272
Just a moment. I should help her first…

983
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:58,358
It was really strange.

984
00:54:58,983 --> 00:55:01,820
The whole village knows
that family wants a child.

985
00:55:02,445 --> 00:55:06,032
Why would the daughter-in-law
be looking for birth control pills?

986
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:09,369
To be honest, I shouldn't have done it,

987
00:55:09,452 --> 00:55:11,871
but I asked the governor's wife
before realizing,

988
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:17,043
"Is there something going on?
Are your son and his wife having trouble?"

989
00:55:18,294 --> 00:55:19,462
I went ahead and asked.

990
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:21,965
Your Honor,

991
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:24,384
we submit evidence
related to this testimony

992
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:25,677
that Mr. Cho's mother found

993
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,014
hidden deep inside the closet
of the couple's room.

994
00:55:33,393 --> 00:55:34,727
The birth control pills.

995
00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:46,406
Your Honor.

996
00:55:47,031 --> 00:55:48,449
As you can see,

997
00:55:48,533 --> 00:55:51,202
the plaintiff didn't intend
to have a happy family with Mr. Cho

998
00:55:51,744 --> 00:55:54,831
despite clearly knowing
how much he wanted a child.

999
00:55:54,914 --> 00:55:57,667
She provoked him
by suddenly saying she'd go back home.

1000
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:01,296
She made him grab her arm out of shock
and hard enough to leave bruises.

1001
00:56:01,379 --> 00:56:04,716
This can only be seen
as preparations for divorce.

1002
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,511
When Mr. Cho did not cross the line
due to his good nature,

1003
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:12,265
she artificially created
that strangulation mark

1004
00:56:12,348 --> 00:56:14,475
-and framed the defendant.
-Come on.

1005
00:56:15,226 --> 00:56:17,687
How could someone

1006
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,440
strangle their own neck that hard?

1007
00:56:20,523 --> 00:56:22,650
Give us evidence
that the defendant did it.

1008
00:56:22,734 --> 00:56:24,569
Yes, that's what we're going to do.

1009
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:26,196
Your Honor.

1010
00:56:27,322 --> 00:56:29,490
There's a new fact
we had been putting off.

1011
00:56:29,574 --> 00:56:30,617
What is it?

1012
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,827
That night, Mr. Cho's mother

1013
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:35,371
was on a trip with her friends,
so she wouldn't have known.

1014
00:56:35,455 --> 00:56:37,498
But actually, that night,

1015
00:56:37,582 --> 00:56:42,962
the defendant took the plaintiff
to the hospital in town when she fainted.

1016
00:56:44,255 --> 00:56:47,133
To be exact, to the animal hospital.

1017
00:56:52,597 --> 00:56:56,267
May I request the person
who saw the defendant as a witness?

1018
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:59,062
Is that witness here right now?

1019
00:57:00,605 --> 00:57:01,606
Yes, Your Honor.

1020
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:03,483
Mr. Jang.

1021
00:57:09,572 --> 00:57:10,573
Is that our village head?

1022
00:57:17,538 --> 00:57:19,207
I told you I don't know anything.

1023
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:21,209
I thought you were here to help.

1024
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:22,919
But instead, you're here to doom us.

1025
00:57:23,002 --> 00:57:24,379
Unbelievable!

1026
00:57:24,462 --> 00:57:25,296
Geez.

1027
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:29,050
I understand.

1028
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:32,554
Becoming enemies with the governor
of this village wouldn't be easy.

1029
00:57:33,137 --> 00:57:35,640
Kaya is a foreigner from far away land.

1030
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:37,600
Right?

1031
00:57:45,525 --> 00:57:48,111
I heard your mother
worked as a nurse in Germany

1032
00:57:48,194 --> 00:57:50,613
when she was young.

1033
00:57:50,697 --> 00:57:52,991
What? How did you know that?

1034
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:57,036
Your father was a miner
dispatched to Germany.

1035
00:57:57,745 --> 00:58:01,833
They met in a foreign country
and got married.

1036
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:05,795
I heard you lived in Germany
until you were 10.

1037
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:07,338
So,

1038
00:58:07,922 --> 00:58:10,550
were you a good soccer player
back then too?

1039
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:14,470
Even among the big German kids?

1040
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:22,270
It was really tough, wasn't it?
You must have been lonely.

1041
00:58:26,274 --> 00:58:29,360
This time, you can help them

1042
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:33,406
so that everyone who's left their homes
and settled in Yangchon

1043
00:58:33,489 --> 00:58:34,741
won't be lonely

1044
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,368
or sad.

1045
00:58:44,626 --> 00:58:45,627
That night,

1046
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:51,090
he brought his wife to my hospital.

1047
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:53,134
It was past midnight.

1048
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,637
But he was pounding on our door so loudly.

1049
00:58:56,179 --> 00:58:58,348
How was the plaintiff's condition then?

1050
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,267
She seemed to have passed out
from exhaustion and was limp.

1051
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:04,312
-What do we do?
-Her arms were bruised.

1052
00:59:04,395 --> 00:59:06,189
She had a towel around her neck.

1053
00:59:06,272 --> 00:59:07,607
When I took it off,

1054
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:09,984
there were red hand marks on it.

1055
00:59:11,486 --> 00:59:13,112
Thankfully, she came to

1056
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:16,616
when I massaged her hands and feet
and gave some water.

1057
00:59:16,699 --> 00:59:20,745
I was so bewildered
and wondered if I should call the cops.

1058
00:59:20,828 --> 00:59:22,789
But this involved

1059
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:27,168
none other than the governor's family.

1060
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:30,046
And her condition wasn't critical, so…

1061
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:35,218
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1062
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:37,595
Why didn't you tell me?

1063
00:59:38,304 --> 00:59:39,764
I was scared.

1064
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:45,019
Actually, I took some photos that night.

1065
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:48,648
The wound on her neck looked severe,

1066
00:59:49,565 --> 00:59:51,234
so I took them just in case.

1067
00:59:51,317 --> 00:59:55,321
But I erased them out of fear,
so I wouldn't get involved in trouble.

1068
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:59,826
But the files
were still there in the trash.

1069
01:00:01,994 --> 01:00:03,454
Here.

1070
01:00:13,715 --> 01:00:15,508
My gosh. That's horrible.

1071
01:00:22,598 --> 01:00:23,891
Sir…

1072
01:00:23,975 --> 01:00:25,893
It must have been late at night.

1073
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:29,981
How did they get to your hospital?

1074
01:00:31,357 --> 01:00:33,192
He can't drive.

1075
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:35,903
And it's the countryside,
so there are no taxis.

1076
01:00:35,987 --> 01:00:37,405
He came running.

1077
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:40,616
He ran? How far is that?

1078
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,202
Well, I don't know.

1079
01:00:43,286 --> 01:00:46,080
From the governor's house
to my hospital…

1080
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:50,752
It's about three kilometers.

1081
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:52,712
Three kilometers?

1082
01:00:55,965 --> 01:00:59,427
He ran that distance
while carrying Kaya on his back?

1083
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,638
Yes. It seemed
as if he had ran his heart out.

1084
01:01:02,722 --> 01:01:05,475
He was covered in sweat.

1085
01:01:16,652 --> 01:01:17,653
Your Honor.

1086
01:01:18,863 --> 01:01:20,865
We request a continuance.

1087
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:22,366
We need to review something.

1088
01:01:23,367 --> 01:01:25,036
What are you doing?

1089
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,124
Why did you do that?

1090
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:33,336
The village head
even submitted the photos.

1091
01:01:33,419 --> 01:01:35,630
The trial was over. Why suddenly do that?

1092
01:01:39,884 --> 01:01:43,930
Things aren't always what they seem.

1093
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:45,640
Pardon?

1094
01:01:58,361 --> 01:01:59,362
Why did you lie?

1095
01:02:02,114 --> 01:02:03,115
Mr. Kang.

1096
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:05,827
It wasn't your husband who strangled you.

1097
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:09,539
What?

1098
01:02:10,456 --> 01:02:12,834
What are you talking about?

1099
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:14,752
You did say you'd go back to your family,

1100
01:02:14,836 --> 01:02:17,255
he did grab and shake you out of shock,

1101
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:18,756
and you did pass out.

1102
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,468
But you were likely strangled
before he came back.

1103
01:02:23,928 --> 01:02:26,639
That's why you were already
exhausted from shock.

1104
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,101
Am I wrong?

1105
01:02:34,897 --> 01:02:35,815
You're wrong.

1106
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:42,321
Something's been bothering me.

1107
01:02:42,405 --> 01:02:46,993
Are all the people of Yangchon-ri
lying to get their stories straight?

1108
01:02:48,494 --> 01:02:50,788
-Or…
-The governor's son?

1109
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:53,499
He's a bit dumb, but he's very nice.

1110
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:56,085
Even if people curse or hit him,

1111
01:02:56,168 --> 01:02:57,503
he just smiles.

1112
01:02:57,587 --> 01:03:00,339
All of the people in the village
said the same thing

1113
01:03:00,423 --> 01:03:02,049
about your husband.

1114
01:03:02,133 --> 01:03:04,051
"He wouldn't even harm a fly."

1115
01:03:04,135 --> 01:03:05,511
Even you insisted

1116
01:03:05,595 --> 01:03:08,264
that your husband was a good person.

1117
01:03:10,933 --> 01:03:11,934
When I heard earlier

1118
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:17,440
he ran his heart out with you
on his back for three kilometers at night,

1119
01:03:18,608 --> 01:03:20,026
that kept bothering me.

1120
01:03:20,109 --> 01:03:23,112
How could such a good person

1121
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:27,950
strangle his wife hard enough
to leave clear finger marks on her neck?

1122
01:03:32,538 --> 01:03:33,539
No.

1123
01:03:41,547 --> 01:03:43,716
Ms. Park, look at the photos again.

1124
01:03:44,342 --> 01:03:47,053
The marks look clearer
since this was right after the incident.

1125
01:03:48,846 --> 01:03:50,264
How does the bruise look?

1126
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:56,228
There is a long mark

1127
01:03:57,146 --> 01:03:58,981
on the right side of Kaya's neck.

1128
01:03:59,899 --> 01:04:01,484
But it looks like a thumb mark.

1129
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:03,653
Then, it was pressed with his right hand.

1130
01:04:03,736 --> 01:04:05,237
He must be right-handed.

1131
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:06,364
Kaya.

1132
01:04:08,324 --> 01:04:09,325
Kaya.

1133
01:04:10,242 --> 01:04:12,036
Is your husband right-handed?

1134
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:15,206
He's not.

1135
01:04:16,123 --> 01:04:17,583
I saw him in court.

1136
01:04:21,963 --> 01:04:23,464
Is this true, Kaya?

1137
01:04:24,715 --> 01:04:25,800
What's going on?

1138
01:04:26,759 --> 01:04:29,095
The opposing attorney isn't a fool!

1139
01:04:29,178 --> 01:04:31,555
Everything will end up
being revealed, so why?

1140
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:33,975
Why did you make up such a lie?

1141
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:41,816
There's one other strange thing.

1142
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:44,360
When you went
to get the birth control pills,

1143
01:04:45,653 --> 01:04:48,280
it happened to be the day
after the incident.

1144
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,118
The birth control pills
your mother-in-law found and submitted

1145
01:04:53,661 --> 01:04:55,204
are morning-after pills.

1146
01:04:56,706 --> 01:04:57,790
This one.

1147
01:04:59,959 --> 01:05:01,335
Morning-after pills?

1148
01:05:02,962 --> 01:05:04,630
It can't be.

1149
01:05:06,215 --> 01:05:09,093
You have to tell us. What on earth…

1150
01:05:09,176 --> 01:05:11,345
What on earth happened that day?

1151
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:13,681
When your mother-in-law
was on a trip with her friends

1152
01:05:13,764 --> 01:05:16,350
and when your husband
was out late drinking,

1153
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:18,394
what happened, Kaya?!

1154
01:05:55,598 --> 01:05:56,891
I get it now.

1155
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:01,979
The reason why you hid
so many things from the start.

1156
01:06:03,564 --> 01:06:05,232
Even when you'd decided to divorce him,

1157
01:06:06,734 --> 01:06:08,778
the reason why you worried
about your husband.

1158
01:06:09,403 --> 01:06:10,696
Mr. Kang.

1159
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,741
What on earth are you talking about?
What happened?

1160
01:06:13,824 --> 01:06:16,035
From the information Mr. Hwang gathered,

1161
01:06:18,204 --> 01:06:19,413
didn't something bother you?

1162
01:06:21,165 --> 01:06:23,626
What Jun-u heard was…

1163
01:06:24,293 --> 01:06:26,462
She asked me for the recipe

1164
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:28,964
to make zucchini stew
since her in-laws like it

1165
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:30,966
and wrote it down in her notebook.

1166
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:32,426
What are you talking about?

1167
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:34,762
I heard she doesn't want
to cook for her father-in-law,

1168
01:06:34,845 --> 01:06:37,223
so she goes out drinking
at night these days.

1169
01:06:37,306 --> 01:06:39,433
God, she's mean.

1170
01:06:43,062 --> 01:06:44,355
Your father-in-law.

1171
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:51,779
When you had to eat
with only your father-in-law…

1172
01:06:54,657 --> 01:06:56,367
you went out.

1173
01:06:57,785 --> 01:06:59,620
You needed to avoid him.

1174
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,542
That lock.

1175
01:07:06,377 --> 01:07:07,711
You put that lock on yourself…

1176
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,756
so that no one could enter from outside.

1177
01:07:18,931 --> 01:07:20,891
I can't believe this.

1178
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:25,813
Oh, my God…

1179
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:48,169
No! I'm being framed!

1180
01:07:48,252 --> 01:07:49,712
That damn bitch!

1181
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:51,714
That conniving bitch! How dare she?

1182
01:08:14,737 --> 01:08:17,948
You should've pretended you didn't know.

1183
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,077
It's not something
you can quietly cover up.

1184
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:24,788
I said I don't care what happens to me.

1185
01:08:25,789 --> 01:08:27,750
I just wanted to leave that family

1186
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:30,461
and live quietly in Korea.

1187
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:33,881
Kaya.

1188
01:08:35,299 --> 01:08:36,175
Kaya.

1189
01:08:36,717 --> 01:08:39,011
No matter how much you love your husband,

1190
01:08:39,094 --> 01:08:42,306
you can't protect him
by covering up something like this.

1191
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:45,768
Love?

1192
01:08:47,144 --> 01:08:50,064
I don't love him, Ms. Park.

1193
01:08:51,982 --> 01:08:55,861
-What?
-Can you love someone you got married to…

1194
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,907
only an hour after meeting him?

1195
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:03,702
I just wanted to come to Korea

1196
01:09:03,786 --> 01:09:06,497
because I hated my home.

1197
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:09,792
I would have followed anyone here

1198
01:09:10,584 --> 01:09:12,461
if they let me leave that place.

1199
01:09:13,462 --> 01:09:16,924
I thought I was just doing my job.

1200
01:09:18,676 --> 01:09:22,346
Because they let me live here.

1201
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:32,231
But I…

1202
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:38,279
I ruined everything.

1203
01:09:40,948 --> 01:09:42,700
I ruined him too.

1204
01:09:45,369 --> 01:09:49,540
If I had left quietly by myself,
it would've been fine.

1205
01:09:52,334 --> 01:09:53,669
I…

1206
01:09:53,752 --> 01:09:57,339
If I could've done that, Ms. Park…

1207
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:00,092
Kaya.

1208
01:10:12,396 --> 01:10:15,232
I read the motion
to amend the cause of action.

1209
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:18,902
It was rather shocking.

1210
01:10:18,986 --> 01:10:21,488
Yes, Your Honor.
Thankfully, we found DNA evidence

1211
01:10:21,572 --> 01:10:25,492
from the blankets and underwear,
so the defendant's father was arrested.

1212
01:10:25,576 --> 01:10:29,204
It's obvious that this marriage
cannot be continued.

1213
01:10:29,288 --> 01:10:32,624
We request the Court render
the divorce judgment as soon as possible.

1214
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:35,878
Defendant, do you have
anything more to say?

1215
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,554
Then, this Court will close
the arguments of the case.

1216
01:10:45,637 --> 01:10:48,098
The verdict will be delivered on--

1217
01:10:48,182 --> 01:10:49,308
Your Honor.

1218
01:10:52,978 --> 01:10:54,396
Woo Myeong-hun?

1219
01:10:58,317 --> 01:10:59,568
What is going on?

1220
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:02,363
I'm the newly appointed attorney
for the defendant.

1221
01:11:02,988 --> 01:11:05,240
I'll submit the power of attorney
and the counterclaim.

1222
01:11:05,324 --> 01:11:07,701
-What?
-This case is already closed--

1223
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:11,663
Your Honor, we request
that the arguments be reopened.

1224
01:11:11,747 --> 01:11:14,124
Well, is there anything more to do?

1225
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:17,086
The reasons for divorce
have already come to light.

1226
01:11:17,169 --> 01:11:18,420
The premise for a divorce

1227
01:11:18,504 --> 01:11:22,508
is that the marriage must be valid.

1228
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:25,177
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

1229
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,222
Your Honor,
he is making an unreasonable claim

1230
01:11:28,305 --> 01:11:29,515
to delay the trial--

1231
01:11:29,598 --> 01:11:34,269
The plaintiff Kaya had already given birth
in her country before she got married.

1232
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:39,149
What? What on earth is he talking about?

1233
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:42,111
It's not true, is it?

1234
01:11:45,823 --> 01:11:46,657
No.

1235
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,992
The plaintiff hid the fact
that she had given birth

1236
01:11:49,076 --> 01:11:50,244
and deceived the defendant

1237
01:11:50,953 --> 01:11:52,121
for a fraudulent marriage.

1238
01:11:52,204 --> 01:11:55,916
We request a body examination
of the plaintiff to prove this.

1239
01:11:55,999 --> 01:11:57,626
I fell for a trap.

1240
01:11:58,419 --> 01:12:00,879
I was fooled by that immoral bitch.

1241
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:02,131
I see.

1242
01:12:03,424 --> 01:12:07,302
A story like that
is what a case like this needs.

1243
01:12:07,386 --> 01:12:11,473
If you think of anything you need to say,
you can tell me anytime.

1244
01:12:11,557 --> 01:12:12,516
I have a definite one.

1245
01:12:15,769 --> 01:12:16,854
What is it?

1246
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:19,398
I saw it clearly that night.

1247
01:12:20,315 --> 01:12:23,986
That bitch had
a pregnancy line on her stomach.

1248
01:12:28,282 --> 01:12:29,700
A pregnancy line?

1249
01:12:29,783 --> 01:12:30,617
Yes.

1250
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:33,579
Kaya.

1251
01:12:33,662 --> 01:12:34,746
It's not true, is it?

1252
01:12:35,372 --> 01:12:36,498
Brazen bitch.

1253
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:39,543
And the defendant files a counterclaim

1254
01:12:39,626 --> 01:12:41,837
for an annulment
of marriage due to fraud

1255
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,131
and seeks compensation of 100 million won.

1256
01:12:49,595 --> 01:12:52,848
The Court will accept the counterclaim

1257
01:12:52,931 --> 01:12:56,351
but will decide later
whether to hear it with the main claim.

1258
01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:09,323
Why didn't you tell us?

1259
01:13:09,406 --> 01:13:12,451
You gave birth before marriage?
Is that really true, Kaya?

1260
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:14,411
We're in a totally different
situation now.

1261
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:18,248
An annulment of marriage
is different from a divorce.

1262
01:13:18,332 --> 01:13:20,334
It nullifies the marriage itself,

1263
01:13:20,417 --> 01:13:23,170
so it'll be
as if you were never married at all.

1264
01:13:23,253 --> 01:13:26,298
The marriage visa you used to come here
will be canceled.

1265
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:28,675
You'll be deported from this country!

1266
01:13:28,759 --> 01:13:29,676
Mr. Kang.

1267
01:13:30,344 --> 01:13:33,263
You'll be kicked out
from this country, Kaya!

1268
01:13:33,972 --> 01:13:34,848
What?

1269
01:14:04,044 --> 01:14:05,921
The Court will deliver the verdict.

1270
01:14:06,004 --> 01:14:07,214
No way.

1271
01:14:07,297 --> 01:14:08,549
That's nonsense!

1272
01:14:08,632 --> 01:14:10,384
Kaya's final appeal was dismissed.

1273
01:14:10,467 --> 01:14:13,220
They're going to let the man
who committed sexual assault go

1274
01:14:13,303 --> 01:14:14,221
and deport the victim?

1275
01:14:14,304 --> 01:14:16,473
Kaya's visa will be canceled,
and she'll be deported!

1276
01:14:16,557 --> 01:14:17,599
Are you going to give up?

1277
01:14:17,683 --> 01:14:19,518
We have to find some sort of way.

1278
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:21,061
Let's seek asylum.

1279
01:14:21,144 --> 01:14:22,187
America? France?

1280
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:23,105
Hold on!

1281
01:14:23,188 --> 01:14:24,022
I'm Kaya's attorney.

1282
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:26,400
We seek asylum.

1283
01:14:26,483 --> 01:14:27,317
Will it be okay?

1284
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:28,318
Of course, we'll lose.

1285
01:14:28,402 --> 01:14:29,695
You said we'd lose.

1286
01:14:29,778 --> 01:14:33,282
We'd lose the trial,
but we'll win the case.

1287
01:14:33,365 --> 01:14:36,201
Do you expect me
to play along in this clown show?

1288
01:14:36,285 --> 01:14:38,120
I may be a clown.

1289
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:40,372
But this trial isn't a clown show.

1290
01:14:40,455 --> 01:14:43,292
It's a desperate fight.

1291
01:14:47,504 --> 01:14:49,506
