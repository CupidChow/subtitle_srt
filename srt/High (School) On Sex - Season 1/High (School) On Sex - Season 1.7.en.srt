1
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:12,685
Enough with the flowers and letters.

2
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:13,779
Huh?

3
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:18,654
I'm so stupid.

4
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,345
Hunter, it's not your fault.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,036
Please, Lem!

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,779
I really need you right now!

7
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:26,387
Don't forget, you're mine.

8
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:39,837
Look at the audience, and?

9
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:41,990
Don't forget to pose.

10
00:00:53,362 --> 00:01:01,779
Stay with me
and let's paint the night!

11
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:03,005
It's you.

12
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,087
I can't remember anything.

13
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:06,771
Did something happen last night?

14
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:12,632
It's you.

15
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:56,195
Wes?!

16
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,677
Max?!

17
00:02:58,264 --> 00:02:59,264
It's you?!

18
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:00,507
You?!

19
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,584
Fuck. Fuck.

20
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:03,612
Fuck!

21
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,112
I don't know where
she is right now, Auntie.

22
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:19,885
I looked all over the school three times.
I couldn't find her.

23
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,452
We agreed to meet earlier, but...

24
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:25,362
- I have no idea where she could be.
- My goodness.

25
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,029
- Ma! Gibo!
- Oh, Karla!

26
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:28,404
What's this?

27
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:33,529
Where were you?
We were so worried!

28
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:35,309
You're not answering your phone.

29
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:38,543
Gibo here searched
the school three times!

30
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,795
Is everything okay?

31
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,654
Yes, Ma. Everything's okay.

32
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,424
I was just at the library.

33
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:44,882
I fell asleep.

34
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,968
Oh, thank goodness.

35
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:49,404
I was about to call your Papa.

36
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,070
You got me worried.

37
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,670
Wow, alright. Get in.

38
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:56,449
And my gosh, change your clothes.

39
00:03:56,474 --> 00:03:58,045
Okay, Ma. I'll be right there.

40
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,820
Thanks, Gibo.

41
00:03:58,845 --> 00:03:59,845
Okay, Auntie.

42
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:02,487
Are you alright?
How are you feeling?

43
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:03,945
Did you get dizzy?

44
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:05,754
Are you on your period?

45
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:06,862
Fuck, Gibo!

46
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,195
What are you doing here?

47
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,237
Why'd you go to my Mama?
What if she tells Papa?

48
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,070
You know how he gets!

49
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:18,279
Why are you angry at me?

50
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,279
I couldn't reach you,
and it's late.

51
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:23,987
Of course I would panic.

52
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:25,779
Because what?

53
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,529
Because you got stood up?

54
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:30,505
We're not even back yet and
you're already smothering me!

55
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,070
Just go home!

56
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:35,320
Now wait a minute.

57
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:38,029
I'm the one who got stood up.

58
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:43,445
Karla, you can't just do whatever you want
and expect me to let it go.

59
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,052
That I'd do nothing!

60
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:47,904
You treat me like a...

61
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,029
Why did I ever think you'd change?

62
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:02,185
What was that?

63
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,029
Karla, you're driving me nuts.
What the fuck?

64
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:09,701
Sorry, I was wrong.

65
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,154
No excuses.

66
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:12,581
Sorry, Gibo.

67
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,654
Can't sleep. You up?

68
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:15,004
Yup. Wanna talk till we feel sleepy?

69
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:18,292
Or try to stay up? I got
something else that's still up.

70
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:25,080
Hunter, what's up?

71
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:49,413
Issa!

72
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:03,070
Issa, sweetie!

73
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,362
Sweetie, wait up!

74
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:07,862
What the hell?

75
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:11,612
The hell, mom? I thought
you were done with that.

76
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:16,529
I am. That's old news. He was
my customer but not anymore.

77
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,398
Sweetie, this is different.

78
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:22,070
Seriously, mom? So what,
he's your boyfriend?

79
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:26,737
You're serious?

80
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,862
Sweetie, have my back on this.

81
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:34,695
Ever since God took your daddy away,
I haven't loved anyone else.

82
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,237
Yes, you, but this...

83
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:39,807
Well aren't you a charmer.

84
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:44,070
He's a nice man. And that
guy loves me very much.

85
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:45,419
It's just him?

86
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:46,444
Yes.

87
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:53,404
Fine, fine. But mom,
lock the door next time.

88
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:55,070
Ah, no, not that.

89
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,404
Do it when I'm not home.

90
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:03,070
Okay, okay. Okay, sweetie.

91
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,987
But what brings you here?

92
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:12,404
Nothing, I just wanted to ask
if you still have connection to the police.

93
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,654
That guy upstairs.

94
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:17,192
What's the matter, sweetie?

95
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,737
Did you get involved in something?

96
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:22,762
Huh?

97
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,129
Mom, don't be dramatic.

98
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,654
It’s not for me.

99
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,070
It's for my friend.

100
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,654
Call a friend, is it?

101
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:34,750
Good morning, Ma.

102
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,508
- Good morning, Pa.
- Good morning!

103
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,399
Pa, Karmina called last night.

104
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:43,629
She's asking when we're coming to visit.

105
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:45,404
It's her break na next week.

106
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:48,179
You and me. Karla here.

107
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:53,235
I heard you got home late.

108
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:54,945
Sorry, Pa.

109
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:58,945
No, it's okay. I don't
care about what you do.

110
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:02,820
Just remember to be discreet about it.

111
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,904
Remember, I'm in the board
of that school.

112
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:07,635
Yes, dad.

113
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:10,654
You know what I don't get?

114
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,379
Out of all my children...

115
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:14,029
Pa, not this again.

116
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:15,762
No! I want to talk about it.

117
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,350
Out of all your sibling, it's just you...

118
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,750
It's only you who's stupid
enough on staying here.

119
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,670
After all the strings I had to pull
to get you a good education.

120
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,375
You are so stubborn.

121
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:36,279
Remember this, if you mess up, you're
on your own. Don't come running to us.

122
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:41,070
Christ. You just ruined my day.

123
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,695
Pa!

124
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:55,122
Love, give me a little peek.
Just a teeny bit, please.

125
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,487
That's it. Lower.

126
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:59,362
There, you see?

127
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:01,717
They've reduced your bandage.

128
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,570
Just a little more
and I'll be able to hold it again.

129
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:08,670
What did the nurse tell you,
by the way?

130
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,404
You can be released tomorrow, right?

131
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,487
Want me to pick you up?

132
00:12:14,962 --> 00:12:17,087
Hey! Love! You okay?

133
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,112
Ah, yes.

134
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,154
You know what, I can
drop by at lunch.

135
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:23,112
We can eat together.

136
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,045
I'm feeling hungry.

137
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,862
And I miss you very much, love.

138
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:29,654
Promise, I'll be gentle.

139
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:30,945
Okay, love.

140
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:32,904
Hunter!

141
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:36,112
Hunter!

142
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:38,904
Have you thought about what I said?

143
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:40,644
I don't want to think about it.

144
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:42,695
Then I'll think about it for you.

145
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,279
I did some research. There's
tons of people who can help us.

146
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:47,862
Any kind of help.

147
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:48,987
Even legal assistance.

148
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,529
What do you want me to do?
File a police blotter?

149
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,029
Sue him?

150
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:54,987
Why not? If you want to.

151
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:56,462
No way.

152
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:57,487
Hunter!

153
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,779
It's wrong to let this go.

154
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,487
What if there are others?

155
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:03,570
Tell Madz at least.

156
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,029
She's going to protect you.

157
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:08,271
Sorry, but you can stop worrying about me.

158
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,070
What now?

159
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,414
You're just gonna
pretend everything's okay?

160
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:15,945
I thought you’ve changed.

161
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,897
I thought you said you'll be on the side
of truth, no matter what other people say.

162
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:21,279
I'm never gonna change.

163
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:22,935
I can't do it.

164
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:25,070
So stop forcing it.

165
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,362
Then she hugged me in the end.

166
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:36,487
Crazy, right?

167
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,612
She's either upset with me
or being extra sweet.

168
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,044
And I keep falling for it.

169
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:45,029
I can't help myself.

170
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:46,695
Is that wrong?

171
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,695
Am I being too much of a pushover?

172
00:13:48,737 --> 00:13:49,737
Shut up.

173
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:52,154
Huh?

174
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:53,737
Just shut up!

175
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:55,737
The fuck did that come from?

176
00:13:56,612 --> 00:14:00,857
You know, out of everyone with so much
bigger problems than your wack-job ex...

177
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:04,438
There are worse problems
than your ex's mood swings,

178
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:05,754
worse than your stupid feelings.

179
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,154
You really think so, Issa?

180
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:11,612
That's rich coming from you.

181
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:15,709
You who has breaks all attachment
to life because you're scared.

182
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:17,612
I'm not scared.

183
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:19,445
Just cautious.

184
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:23,629
At least I wouldn't fall
for a message, a hug, or a kiss.

185
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,070
What's cautious about
having so many issues?

186
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:28,604
That when someone
tries to get close to you,

187
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:30,795
people who don't even want to hurt you,

188
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:33,018
people who's just looking out for you,

189
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,997
get hurt because of your paranoia, Issa.

190
00:14:40,273 --> 00:14:41,898
I thought we were cool.

191
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,459
That there's nothing too intense
or too shallow to share between us.

192
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:47,779
Guess I was wrong.

193
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:52,609
How dare she dismiss my feelings?
I thought you were different!

194
00:14:58,237 --> 00:15:00,779
Usually, when faced with a threat,

195
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,237
the response is either
fight or flight, freeze or fawn.

196
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:09,279
But what I'm saying is,

197
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:11,237
you're still young.

198
00:15:11,654 --> 00:15:13,904
At an exciting time in your life.

199
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,612
What can you be stressed about, right?

200
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:21,362
Okay, guys. I have some
special announcements.

201
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:24,612
Number one. This is very good news, okay?

202
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,212
The board has approved the monthly ten
thousand pesos incentive for each of you.

203
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:34,935
The muscles tense, the body produces
perspiration, stress hormones are released.

204
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,143
The body prepares for flight or fight,

205
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:44,737
but recent studies show that when faced
with a threat, an attacker, one can freeze.

206
00:15:44,762 --> 00:15:45,762
Hunter.

207
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:48,487
Are you okay?

208
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,962
I think he had a big shock

209
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,865
when I announced the results. Right?

210
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:59,237
You thought you weren't
part of the team, huh?

211
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:03,112
Okay, boys.
Congratulate your new teammate.

212
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:06,678
Power forward, Hunter Anchetta!

213
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,212
Why don't you look happy? Hey!

214
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,254
He's not in the mood.

215
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,737
I'll take your ten thousand
if you don't want it.

216
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:13,945
Split it with me.

217
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,970
High five!

218
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,487
Hi, love!

219
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:19,851
Hi.

220
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,560
Oh, kiss diverted?

221
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,712
Sorry, I haven't brushed my teeth.

222
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:31,695
I don't care what meal you last ate,

223
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,881
give me that.

224
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:36,170
Ugh, I missed you so much!

225
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,695
Wait, wait.

226
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:41,279
Love, can we talk?

227
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:49,333
Oh, right. Eat out before make-out.

228
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:51,420
What do you want? Let's order.

229
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,237
Love, we need to talk.

230
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:58,404
Speaking of talk,

231
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:01,182
you just left me
on seen last night.

232
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,240
Is the nurse giving you sleeping pills?

233
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:05,810
Ah, no, but…

234
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,362
Love, we need to talk.

235
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:11,546
There's another stress response
one employs...

236
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:12,588
Fawn.

237
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:16,629
This is the tendency
to please someone to avoid conflict.

238
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:19,795
Save that all that
talk business for later. Okay?

239
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:22,779
Wait, what are you doing?

240
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,678
What are you doing?

241
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,087
Mav, we really need to talk.

242
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,154
What are...

243
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:38,529
Mav...

244
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:41,237
I really need to say something.

245
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:00,570
Oh, Mavs…

246
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:05,445
Oh, Mavs…

247
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:08,480
Nevermind all that talk.
Tell it to my pussy.

248
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:11,029
Oh, yes…

249
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,545
Yes!

250
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,847
Let's!

251
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:14,570
Yes!

252
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:15,595
Let's!

253
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:16,916
- Yes!
- Let's!

254
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:18,695
- Let's!
- Yes!

255
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:21,279
- Yes!
- Let's!

256
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:23,148
Let's break up!

257
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:43,076
Bestie?

258
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,070
Are you okay?

259
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,062
Here, here.

260
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,053
Mavic.

261
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:56,371
Sit down. Take a seat.

262
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:58,425
Sit. Sit.

263
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,070
Bestie?

264
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:15,746
What's wrong?

265
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:25,029
Bestie…

266
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:31,820
You know this, right? I'm the one
who breaks up with them.

267
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,612
I can't believe he broke up with me
in the middle of pumping!

268
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:43,445
I'm so confused. I don't
know what's happening.

269
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,589
And can you imagine?

270
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:54,761
Half of your body's in pleasure,
and the upper half's breaking in pieces.

271
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:58,612
Bestie, it hurts in here.

272
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,362
It hurts so bad.

273
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:07,019
Bestie?

274
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,949
Bestie, hang on.

275
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:10,967
Bestie. Bestie.

276
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,328
Stop crying.

277
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,612
Stop crying. What did he say?

278
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:22,345
So original, actually. The OG.

279
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:27,550
He said, it's not you, it's me.

280
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:33,404
Son of a bitch, right?

281
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,029
He told me he doesn't want
to make things hard for me.

282
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,761
That I should think everything is okay.

283
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:49,279
But the truth is, it's not.

284
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:54,972
Bestie, the struggle is real.

285
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:03,212
Because he's confused?

286
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,129
He said he doesn't know what to do.

287
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:09,568
The universe sure has great timing, huh?

288
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:18,529
Right when I'm about to
deliver my campaign speech.

289
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,964
Look at me!

290
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:28,410
What's so confusing?
What's his deal?

291
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:31,832
That's what I don't get.

292
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,972
We're a perfect match, aren't we?

293
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:36,029
He's my 'the one',

294
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:40,837
and I'm the path.
The path to his happiness.

295
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:42,612
That's what I believe.

296
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:47,074
But what happened, girl?
What is going on?

297
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,570
Bestie?

298
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:00,487
Did he mention anything?

299
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,737
Did you notice anything
when you went to see him?

300
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:11,070
Oh my gosh! Don't tell me...
There's someone else?

301
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,862
Bestie, don't. Don't spill it.

302
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:22,383
I can't take it right now.

303
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:28,154
Whatever it is, shut up
about it for now, got it?

304
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,330
Dude, I don't get why he
let go all his drop passes.

305
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:40,129
Dude, he's got holes in his hands.

306
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:41,379
You're acting like a sell-out.

307
00:22:41,404 --> 00:22:42,654
He doesn't want to hold a ball.

308
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:44,679
He's scared, dude.

309
00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:45,904
Goddamn... hey.

310
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:48,904
Surprise!

311
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,029
Congrats, Hunter!

312
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:55,054
My Mr. Best Forward's so impressive.

313
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:58,695
And we all saw how amazing he is,

314
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,754
so of course, this is well-deserved!

315
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:03,074
Yes!

316
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:04,670
So amazing!

317
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:06,404
- You deserve it!
- No!

318
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:08,362
- I don't want this!
- What the fuck?

319
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,154
I'm doing everything to
make it up to you, Hunter.

320
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,862
But I don't even get a simple
Thank you, Gia!

321
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,820
How about show me
some appreciation, Hunter?

322
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,466
Unless…

323
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:25,779
Tell me the truth.

324
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:28,654
Is there someone else?

325
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
There's no one else!

326
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,045
Gia.

327
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,487
Stay out of this.

328
00:23:38,945 --> 00:23:40,737
Tell me the truth, Hunter.

329
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:42,487
Who is it?

330
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:43,823
Who are you dating?

331
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:45,612
Who are you canoodling with?

332
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:47,379
Is she good in bed?

333
00:23:47,404 --> 00:23:48,695
What's her name?

334
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,095
Give me a reason.

335
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,612
Is it that slut, Issa?

336
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:54,320
Do you want her more than me?

337
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:55,737
Yes, fine!

338
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:00,910
And when threatened,
when a person is cornered,

339
00:24:00,935 --> 00:24:05,962
there's no other choice but to fight.
She fights and fights hard.

340
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,529
Dude, what are you saying?
What's happening to you?

341
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:09,964
Why did you confess? What's going on?

342
00:24:10,904 --> 00:24:13,570
Ma, I think we're gonna be out late.

343
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,873
We're still working on a project.

344
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:20,404
It's an important project
so I need to stay behind in school.

345
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:22,862
Don't worry, I'm with my groupmates.

346
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Karla.

347
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:26,671
- Ah, okay!
- And I'll just ask Gibo to walk me home.

348
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:27,904
Hi, Gibo!

349
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:31,112
Gibo, take care of my baby, okay?

350
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:34,487
Ah, yes, Auntie, I'll bring her home.

351
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:35,712
Okay. Take care. Bye!

352
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,279
Okay, Ma. See you.

353
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,862
Take care! Bye!

354
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:39,862
See you, Auntie.

355
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:41,362
For real?

356
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:42,529
Where are we going?

357
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:44,570
Can we do this later?

358
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,237
Karla, what's the problem now?

359
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,195
You keep changing your mind.

360
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:53,757
I don't know what's going on with you.

361
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:57,070
We were fine,
now you're mad again.

362
00:24:57,695 --> 00:24:59,529
Gibo, look.

363
00:25:00,404 --> 00:25:01,404
Sir?

364
00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:03,862
Do you need anything?

365
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:06,695
I just need something from Karla, sir.

366
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:09,279
Well, not now.

367
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:12,445
This is our time, okay?

368
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:14,948
All right, sir.

369
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:27,045
Bestie, how about you ditch the campaign?

370
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,362
Just take time off.

371
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,722
Nevermind the party, nevermind Max.

372
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,070
No.

373
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:40,144
No, Bes.

374
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:44,529
My boyfriend just fucked me
over the wrong way,

375
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:47,542
and now I'm on an unlucky streak.

376
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:50,726
I don't even have anything to show for it.

377
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:53,404
At least with this campaign,

378
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:56,820
all my hardwork will pay off.

379
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:03,695
I won't let this end
without putting up a fight.

380
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:07,214
That's why Bestie,

381
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:09,371
I need your help.

382
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,355
Lend me your confidence.

383
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:13,737
That's it?

384
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:18,279
- There's another thing.
- What?

385
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:19,979
Bring out your concealer.

386
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:37,362
Over here. My eyebags might show.

387
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,582
Okay, yes. We're getting there. Chill out.

388
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:40,945
Fuck 'em.

389
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,730
They should watch out for me.

390
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:45,832
I'm gonna slap them
with my money.

391
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:48,445
With this pretty face?

392
00:26:49,945 --> 00:26:50,945
Issa.

393
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:52,695
Issa!

394
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,404
Issa.

395
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,570
Silence, please.

396
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,000
Fuck off, nerd.

397
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:00,092
Issa!

398
00:27:00,237 --> 00:27:01,945
Gia. Slow down.

399
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
What's happening?

400
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:05,529
Nothing, sir.

401
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:09,859
I'm just looking for Issa because
I need her for something urgent.

402
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:12,483
Okay, but you seem upset.

403
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:15,445
She's not on duty today.

404
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,345
But you can check the bleachers.

405
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:19,362
I think she goes there going here.

406
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:21,237
Okay. Thank you, Sir Lem.

407
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:22,262
Welcome.

408
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:27,545
Thank you, Mr. Posadas.

409
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:33,154
And now, let's hear it for Vanguard Party's
candidate for Batch Rep,

410
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,137
Ms. Maria Victoria Lagdameo.

411
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:42,362
And you're done.

412
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:43,420
Okay.

413
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:44,751
Mavic!

414
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:46,237
Ah, Luke.

415
00:27:55,337 --> 00:27:56,920
I don't think I can do this.

416
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:58,362
Yes, you can, Mavic.

417
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:01,407
Doesn't feel like it.
I don't think I can.

418
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:05,254
I can't project, Luke.
I don't feel confident right now.

419
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,362
Hey, hey. Listen to me.

420
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:09,473
You don't need to do that.

421
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,862
It's effortless with you.

422
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:15,931
Remember what I told you.

423
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,195
Look at the audience, and breathe.

424
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:20,445
Okay?

425
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:23,612
Pause.

426
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:29,279
You don't need to project
because just as you are,

427
00:28:29,862 --> 00:28:30,862
you're already a winner.

428
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,070
If you were able to convince me,

429
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,699
everyone else will be a piece of cake.

430
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:36,033
You'll kill it.

431
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:37,404
Right?

432
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,095
Luke, thank you.

433
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,861
Of course.

434
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:49,987
- Bestie?
- Yeah?

435
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:51,012
Let's go.

436
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:54,695
Fighting!

437
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:56,529
Fighting!

438
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,612
I'm here.

439
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:20,236
Good day to all of you.

440
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:23,654
I'm here today, standing before you

441
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:27,445
searching for the truth.

442
00:29:29,154 --> 00:29:31,404
Like you, I hate being lied to.

443
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:35,279
Because the person standing
in front of you right now,

444
00:29:36,404 --> 00:29:38,237
was cheated once already.

445
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:39,860
It hurts, doesn't it?

446
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:43,695
And I know we don't want that.

447
00:29:43,862 --> 00:29:45,987
We don't like being fooled.

448
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:51,237
How do we distinguish the
people who are being real to us?

449
00:29:51,737 --> 00:29:54,487
Is it someone who's seen us naked?

450
00:29:56,042 --> 00:30:00,375
Someone who embraces
you along with all your issues?

451
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:10,462
All of your anger,
all of your sadness…

452
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:25,320
Someone who can go along with your whims…

453
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:33,112
Someone who'll willingly
adjust for your happiness…

454
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:54,695
Someone who'll take the first step
with you, to rise and succeed together.

455
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:04,737
Who should you choose, the person
who's there for you through thick and thin,

456
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:11,901
or the person who only shows up
when they need something?

457
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,279
You see,

458
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:24,612
I want you to know that
I don't need a title or power

459
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:28,737
because I'm already capable all on my own.

460
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:42,154
So, Harmon High, I want to serve you.

461
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:45,570
I want to do what makes you happy.

462
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:54,529
So please, make me happy, too.
Because I'm hurting so bad!

463
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:00,237
Give me a chance to take charge.

464
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:09,822
Because when I win, it's your win, too.

465
00:32:13,195 --> 00:32:18,945
Harmon High, this is
Maria Victoria Lagdameo.

466
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:24,070
Thank you for coming and I'm sorry.

467
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:42,529
Are you stalking me?

468
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,635
Stalking is different from assisting.

469
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:47,404
Hunter,

470
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,862
you can't face this on your own.

471
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:51,862
He needs to pay for what he did.

472
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,904
I'll help you. I promise.

473
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,904
What are you scared of? Your grades?

474
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:58,320
I'll tutor you!

475
00:32:58,504 --> 00:32:59,379
Why don't you want to?

476
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:01,154
I don't want to because I'm ashamed!

477
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,554
Are you still going on about that?

478
00:33:02,904 --> 00:33:04,984
You're still concerned
about what others will think.

479
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,737
It's not just that, Issa.

480
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,779
What's shameful about all this,

481
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,987
is not the fact that I didn't protest…

482
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:16,695
What's shameful is he made me
come with what he did!

483
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:17,779
Fuck!

484
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,362
I'm so ashamed.

485
00:33:19,387 --> 00:33:21,554
I'm disgusted with myself.

486
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,112
That's the body's normal response, Hunter.

487
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:25,804
Fuck if that's normal.

488
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
You can't ruin yourself over this.

489
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,445
You can't go on like this, Hunter.

490
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,112
No. I'm going to be fine.

491
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:37,679
I'll suck it up for as long as I can.

492
00:33:38,904 --> 00:33:42,070
You need help.
And I mean professional help.

493
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:44,529
This isn't something you
can weather on your own.

494
00:33:46,654 --> 00:33:48,320
I won't be on my own, won't I?

495
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,320
You'll be there.

496
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,346
Where are you hiding?

497
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:14,529
Wow. Just wow.

498
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:16,112
You're a revelation.

499
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:19,195
This is the biggest turnout I've ever seen.

500
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:21,045
And our numbers are looking good, Mavic.

501
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,837
Not all votes are in yet, but
we're looking at a landslide.

502
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:24,862
Congrats.

503
00:34:25,904 --> 00:34:27,529
Guys, thank you.

504
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,195
And let me say this,
your speech was incredible.

505
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,620
I didn't think you could
pull it off, but you aced it.

506
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:37,320
There is one person who
knew this would happen.

507
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:38,745
Max.

508
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:41,779
The moment he introduced you to me,

509
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:43,974
he said, she's an asset.

510
00:34:44,137 --> 00:34:45,137
She's a gem.

511
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:46,904
Not because she's beautiful,

512
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,779
charming, has a way with words,

513
00:34:50,195 --> 00:34:52,771
but because you harbor no judgment.

514
00:34:52,796 --> 00:34:59,542
Whoever you are, where you came from,
whatever your insecurities or fears,

515
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:01,487
she's going to fight for you.

516
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,070
He said you're a real fighter.

517
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,953
Guys, let me borrow this.

518
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:17,728
Wait, where are you going?

519
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:19,943
Aren't you going to wait
for the results with us?

520
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:22,765
The fight isn't over till
all the numbers are in.

521
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,937
Sweetie, I have another fight.

522
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:30,070
You're right. This sounds better.

523
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:31,596
Wes!

524
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:36,034
Wesley Sumaguing!

525
00:35:37,143 --> 00:35:38,904
It's your bestfriend!

526
00:35:40,818 --> 00:35:41,818
Let's go.

527
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:43,045
Where?

528
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,070
To Max!

529
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:45,241
Huh?

530
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:47,427
Yes, I'm not giving this up.

531
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:50,195
I'm not gonna let anyone
just pull out on me like that.

532
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,570
What's the plan?

533
00:35:51,904 --> 00:35:53,029
You're going to force him?

534
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:56,112
I'm going to punch him with my love.

535
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:59,012
So, come on. Drive me there.

536
00:35:59,195 --> 00:36:00,570
Borrowing him for a sec.

537
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:02,195
Les. Mike.

538
00:36:07,354 --> 00:36:08,487
Did you know

539
00:36:08,512 --> 00:36:10,592
that I've never felt this
crazy about anyone before.

540
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:13,659
When you make me mad,

541
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,737
I just want you more.

542
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:20,534
When I give chase, and
you keep pulling back...

543
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,028
It drives me crazy.

544
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:24,904
Finally, I get to pin you down.

545
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:29,042
So don't get away from me, okay?
Stay here.

546
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,781
I think you should break it up with Gibo.

547
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Why?

548
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:45,029
Are you jealous?

549
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:47,612
I just don't like sharing.

550
00:36:51,404 --> 00:36:55,570
Does this mean
we're done cooling off?

551
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,236
What do you think?

552
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,695
Maximus Lopez.

553
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:33,779
I stand before you,

554
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:37,112
hoping that even though my
pits are sweating with shame,

555
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:38,304
you'd hear me out.

556
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,862
I'm hoping you would
remember how we started.

557
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:45,404
Hoping you remember the color red.

558
00:37:45,404 --> 00:37:48,737
The red of my lips that
constantly seeks yours,

559
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:53,188
the red of my gums and throat
that I bare out in the open

560
00:37:53,213 --> 00:37:55,510
everytime you make me laugh.

561
00:37:56,362 --> 00:37:59,445
The red of my cheeks when
I'm giddy in love with you,

562
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:06,070
that looks better than any foundation
because our foundation is that solid.

563
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:12,237
First off, we both believed
we were the right one for each other.

564
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:18,313
Secondly, in the chaos of the world,
I can only breathe easy

565
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:22,456
when I am in your arms,
and you in mine.

566
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:28,070
Thirdly, I feel free when I'm with you.

567
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:30,529
Free to dream,

568
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:37,070
free to love, free to
act stupid, or go crazy.

569
00:38:37,612 --> 00:38:40,820
Because we don't find faults
or count the wrongs,

570
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,487
we only give to each other generously.

571
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:46,904
So I was hoping,

572
00:38:47,112 --> 00:38:50,195
that maybe you just
forget that we can still try.

573
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:52,404
That even if you're confused right now,

574
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:56,195
I'll still accept you for
everything that you are,

575
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,195
with all of your mess.

576
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:04,445
So, sure, things are going
south but let me just remind you,

577
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:07,029
that I love you very much.

578
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,695
And I hope that you still
love me, too. Don't you?

579
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:17,837
Mavic.

580
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:19,987
Whoops... Let me speak first.

581
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,695
I couldn't answer earlier.

582
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:27,945
Max, whatever it is that's bugging you,

583
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:31,362
just let it do that.

584
00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:35,112
But let me stay beside you.

585
00:39:35,945 --> 00:39:38,737
Let's give it another try.

586
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:40,612
Mavic, I...

587
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:43,445
I can't.

588
00:39:44,695 --> 00:39:46,820
Max, please…

589
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:50,695
I love you.

590
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:53,862
Can't we at least try again?

591
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:57,570
You give up so easily.

592
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,987
It's not that I don't want to try,

593
00:40:02,757 --> 00:40:04,471
- Max, please.
- But...

594
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:08,779
Give me a chance to fight for you.

595
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:14,862
I already know.

596
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,741
I'm no longer confused.

597
00:40:19,695 --> 00:40:21,695
Everything is clear to me now, Mavic.

598
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:26,244
I cannot be with you because…

599
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:33,912
I like Wes.

600
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:47,909
You fucker.

601
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,510
Gibo, can we talk?

602
00:41:15,112 --> 00:41:16,154
Mavic. Mavic...

603
00:41:16,195 --> 00:41:18,690
I'm sorry.

604
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:22,484
Tell me the truth,
did something happen between you?

605
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:25,820
Motherfucker!

606
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:26,845
Mavic!

607
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:29,487
Just wait a second.

608
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,862
Mavic.

609
00:41:32,612 --> 00:41:34,654
I didn't know, okay?

610
00:41:36,254 --> 00:41:39,587
I didn't know it was
Max that night at first.

611
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:41,945
But it meant nothing.

612
00:41:42,404 --> 00:41:44,445
Nothing. No feelings.

613
00:41:44,862 --> 00:41:46,404
Mavic, you're the only...

614
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:53,837
I'm not sure about a lot of
things, but I'm sure of this.

615
00:41:53,862 --> 00:41:56,029
Mavic, I love you.

616
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,112
You're the only constant
thing in my life, so, please...

617
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:02,237
Please, don't do this to me.

618
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:05,942
Shut up.

619
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,987
Wesley, just stop it.

620
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,362
Because I can't take it anymore!

621
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:17,212
Fuck.

622
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:19,279
For fuck's sake, Wesley, you get in bed
with anything that moves.

623
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:22,929
You keep changing partners,
chasing after a new trip, a new high.

624
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:25,302
And what's your excuse?

625
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:27,245
That you're looking for yourself?

626
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:34,654
Well, fuck, you can't find yourself
because there's nothing in there!

627
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:35,762
You are hollow!

628
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:39,529
That's…

629
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:41,945
That's mean.

630
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:43,570
You're mean!

631
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,737
You had to take Max, too?
Really?

632
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:54,581
Why? Because he's different?
Because I chose him?

633
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:58,029
You're probably going
to stay that way, Wesley.

634
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:07,570
You can't admit to yourself
that you're just a normal guy.

635
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:09,404
That you're average.

636
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:17,029
That that thing you're trying to fill up
is just a hole where your heart should be.

637
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,276
I heard you.

638
00:43:43,112 --> 00:43:45,404
I heard everything.

639
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:50,643
Don't you dare bring shame upon my name.

640
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:52,768
Got that? Do you understand?

641
00:43:56,612 --> 00:44:01,612
But Dad, sir, what if...

642
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:06,065
Don't ever do that
disgusting act again.

643
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,421
Do you understand?

644
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:10,737
Do you understand?

645
00:44:11,754 --> 00:44:17,795
But Dad, sir, what
if this is really who I am?

646
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,471
You're my son.

647
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:23,109
You're my son.

648
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:35,070
You're my son.

649
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:37,570
You're my son.

650
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,529
You will not bring shame upon my name.

651
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:49,445
Remember the values, boy.

652
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,779
The discipline. The control.

653
00:44:57,693 --> 00:45:00,359
And whatever nasty thing's
wriggling inside that head of yours,

654
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:04,224
whatever it is that's making you soft,

655
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:08,338
fight it.

656
00:45:09,987 --> 00:45:11,195
Fight it!

657
00:45:12,768 --> 00:45:14,123
Do you understand?

658
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,087
Do you understand?

659
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:17,120
Yes, sir.

660
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:42,905
Cheesy?

661
00:45:46,487 --> 00:45:47,487
Cheesy?

662
00:45:52,795 --> 00:45:53,795
Cheesy?

663
00:45:59,086 --> 00:46:00,086
Cheesy?

664
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:51,088
Karla, should we really do this now?

665
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:53,362
Won't your mom be looking for you?

666
00:47:53,779 --> 00:47:56,987
Yeah, so let's get this over with.

667
00:47:57,195 --> 00:47:58,987
We have to settle this now, Gibo.

668
00:47:59,195 --> 00:48:00,779
Settle what?

669
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,820
Wait, sorry...

670
00:48:03,154 --> 00:48:04,487
Did I do something wrong?

671
00:48:05,195 --> 00:48:07,445
Did I get too clingy again?

672
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,362
Karla, tell me so I'll know.

673
00:48:10,531 --> 00:48:12,031
So I don't upset you.

674
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:13,279
Please?

675
00:48:15,612 --> 00:48:16,612
What?

676
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,070
What can't you say?

677
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:23,404
It's like there's something
you're not telling me.

678
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:27,779
There's plenty, but here it goes…

679
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:30,529
I can't hide it anymore anyway.

680
00:48:31,987 --> 00:48:35,695
Gibo, I made a mistake.

681
00:48:36,279 --> 00:48:39,362
And I'm not proud of it, but…

682
00:48:39,976 --> 00:48:42,268
I just used you as a rebound.

683
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:52,737
Please, Gibo!

684
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:01,945
Gibo, answer your phone!

685
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,279
Cheesy?

686
00:49:13,445 --> 00:49:16,404
Rebound? What do you mean?

687
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:18,570
I'll explain.

688
00:49:19,295 --> 00:49:21,295
First, you need to understand that...

689
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,320
Gibo!

690
00:49:23,654 --> 00:49:24,945
Is Cheesy with you?

691
00:49:24,987 --> 00:49:26,612
Huh? No!

692
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,070
Shit!

693
00:49:28,195 --> 00:49:29,529
Cheesy's missing!

694
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:30,487
What?

695
00:49:30,529 --> 00:49:31,529
Gibo!

696
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,029
Wait, one at a time!

697
00:49:34,029 --> 00:49:34,862
This is nuts!

698
00:49:34,862 --> 00:49:36,404
He's not there and the cage is gone!

699
00:49:36,404 --> 00:49:37,779
He's not under the bleachers either.

700
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:38,979
Did he slip out of his cage?

701
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:43,170
But wait, Cheesy, Issa, if I don't talk
to Karla, our chance might slip away, too.

702
00:49:43,195 --> 00:49:44,404
Gibo, I need you.

703
00:49:44,712 --> 00:49:46,337
I mean, you need to know about...

704
00:49:46,362 --> 00:49:48,026
She's lying to you!

705
00:49:48,854 --> 00:49:52,562
There. That's what she
couldn't admit outright.

706
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:55,320
She's with someone else.

707
00:49:55,987 --> 00:49:58,362
All this time.
And it's not you, Gibo.

708
00:49:59,987 --> 00:50:01,337
He's talking to someone else,

709
00:50:01,362 --> 00:50:04,029
texting someone else,
having sex with someone else.

710
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,570
There's someone else.

711
00:50:05,945 --> 00:50:06,945
Not you.

712
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:12,103
Is that true, Karla?

713
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,753
Why did you take me for a ride, huh?

714
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:19,112
Why'd you have to fool me?

715
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:22,862
Karla, answer me!

716
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,070
What's your deal, huh?

717
00:50:27,487 --> 00:50:29,695
Were you really just toying with me?

718
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,529
You just wanna ruin my life?

719
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,654
What? Answer me!

720
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:37,045
Karla!

721
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,070
Shit!

722
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:40,012
What do we do? Let's
take her to the clinic!

723
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:41,833
The nurse's gone home!

724
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:43,487
Let's go straight to the hospital!

725
00:50:43,712 --> 00:50:45,004
Wes. Call Wes.

726
00:50:45,029 --> 00:50:45,779
Hurry up!

727
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:47,679
Karla! Karla!

728
00:50:49,237 --> 00:50:52,154
Wes! Help! Emergency!

729
00:50:52,837 --> 00:50:54,587
Yes! Wait for us at the gate! At the gate!

730
00:50:54,612 --> 00:50:55,195
What did he say?

731
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:56,154
Let's go to the gate. Hurry!

732
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:57,315
To the gate. To the gate.

733
00:50:57,643 --> 00:50:58,643
Let's go.

734
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:01,987
You must be the father.

735
00:51:05,677 --> 00:51:07,504
Are you sure it was taken?

736
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:09,462
Maybe it got away.

737
00:51:09,487 --> 00:51:10,487
No!

738
00:51:10,512 --> 00:51:12,095
Issa saw me being harassed by coach!

739
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,795
I choose violence.

740
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,651
Let's go to the office.

741
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:19,504
Office? So kinky!

742
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:23,154
I turned my back on the person
who was always there for me.

743
00:51:24,445 --> 00:51:27,404
For the person
who never once chose me.

744
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,112
It's Issa you're feeling for, Gibo.

745
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,070
I'm at fault.

746
00:51:37,904 --> 00:51:39,104
I'm the one with broken parts.
