1
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:58,742
I love you, babe!

2
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:04,159
Steady, I'm almost there!

3
00:01:05,326 --> 00:01:08,013
Wait, I just need to burn.

4
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:11,909
Good idea. You're so hot.

5
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:14,534
No, I meant my skin.

6
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,259
Slow down, you're going to rip my panties.

7
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:18,284
I'm coming!

8
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:19,451
I'm coming!

9
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:28,367
Shit.

10
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:32,029
Where's my phone?

11
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,576
My dream has to come true.

12
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:40,784
Karla?

13
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,867
Karla…

14
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:48,951
I need this to happen right now.

15
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:57,784
Here I go… you're gonna get it.

16
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:05,951
Karla!

17
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,509
Karla!

18
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:13,888
Karla!

19
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:23,576
Sorry, Gibo. This is goodbye.

20
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:37,701
Move on, Gibo.

21
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:43,742
Good morning, Ma. Pa.

22
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:44,801
Morning.

23
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:45,826
Son.

24
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:56,617
So no talking, huh?

25
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,159
Hello?

26
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,328
Can't even talk to anyone.

27
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:05,867
You should have given me a brother.

28
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,406
A child's just an expense.

29
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:12,455
Stop fiddling with your gadgets.

30
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:14,992
You're driving yourselves blind.

31
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:17,009
Aww, sorry, Dad.

32
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:18,592
We've been swallowed by the internet.

33
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:21,075
You know, that thing that
was invented in our time?

34
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,734
Sorry if you can't relate.

35
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:26,023
You're one to talk.

36
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:28,634
You'll mess up your eyes
well way before we do.

37
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,024
If you keep jacking off.

38
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,634
That's fine, at least I let my load out.

39
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,672
Pa, this is not the right time.

40
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:38,051
Gibo's too young
for that kind of talk.

41
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:39,076
Ma!

42
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:40,617
This kid?

43
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,509
These kids are experts at jacking off.

44
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:43,700
Take it easy, okay?

45
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,266
You'll go blind.

46
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:46,531
Is that true, Pa?

47
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:48,302
That's what they say.

48
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,492
Watch out, that's all I'm saying.

49
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:51,201
Right?

50
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:52,906
Nobody could stop you
when you were young.

51
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,801
Son, are you ready for your first day?

52
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,242
Your papers all sorted out?

53
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,405
Yes, Ma.

54
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,467
Man, I can hardly believe it.

55
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:03,492
Gilberto Senior and Junior.

56
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:08,227
My co-alumnus at Harmon Catholic University
in the near future!

57
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,741
It'll be easier for you to get
into college after you graduate

58
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:16,350
because of your home court advantage.

59
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,592
Believe me.

60
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:21,759
In Harmon, dreams do come true!

61
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:22,649
Yes.

62
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:23,951
All dreams, I hope.

63
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:26,700
Son, she's coming home this summer, right?

64
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,683
Besides, you and Karla are still young.

65
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:32,326
And even if she's been to New York,
if you're meant to be,

66
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:36,164
you'll find your way to each other.

67
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:37,409
And if not,

68
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,034
Joogle Maps can help you.

69
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,242
- Stop it, Pa.
- What? It's true.

70
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:47,576
Here, eat up.

71
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:54,284
I'm just cautioning you against LSS.

72
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,284
Last Sweetheart Syndrome.

73
00:04:57,451 --> 00:05:00,742
The world's a big place!
You'll meet other girls!

74
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,992
Son, your first love isn't as important

75
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,951
as your last love.

76
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:10,903
All right, eat up.

77
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:16,703
You are beautiful.

78
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,210
I just want…

79
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:23,544
wa...

80
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,967
I think we found your
perfect shade of lipstick.

81
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:29,297
See?

82
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:31,605
See?

83
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,593
Yeah.

84
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:33,617
This is it.

85
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:34,797
Perfect.

86
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:36,522
By the way, Wes.

87
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,492
Does it say "badass" right off the bat?

88
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:41,026
Yes, Bes!

89
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:42,776
Love it!

90
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,242
This is my key…

91
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,242
to find the one.

92
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:50,659
Not that again?

93
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,409
What's it to you?

94
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:57,475
New school, new prospects.

95
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:01,534
I didn't have much luck
in our old school.

96
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,495
They all looked like feet.

97
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:06,471
Except you.

98
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:09,409
Good thing we were
just there for a year.

99
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:14,909
But Harmon has rich boys.

100
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,433
Exciting, huh?

101
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,682
Sure, but...

102
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,761
For hunting down for prospects?

103
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:22,784
Not my style.

104
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:25,600
I'd prefer if they came after me.

105
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:27,176
Come after you?

106
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,992
You like having options, huh?

107
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:35,092
So you got girls, boys,
gays, tomboys, even pigs?

108
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:37,616
My dear Maria Victoria,
that is so '90s.

109
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:41,933
I told you, you can't box
people's identities in this century.

110
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:43,835
Right, of course.

111
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,509
We should be 'aggressive'.

112
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:46,995
You mean 'progressive'.

113
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:53,565
Forgive me, they don't
sell that in our local shops.

114
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:54,853
But…

115
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:56,867
look at me.

116
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:00,409
I'm catching up.

117
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:02,492
Be it for the progressives or…

118
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:03,909
for the one.

119
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:06,634
Well, we are works in progress.

120
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,242
As for me, I'm figuring out what I want.

121
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:11,554
Ouch!

122
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,576
My anemics!

123
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:15,658
Anem.. nevermind.

124
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:19,659
BORIS: Wesley? Mavic? Breakfast is ready!

125
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,635
Yes, uncle.

126
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,159
Just a sec, Daddy!
We'll be down in a bit.

127
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,342
Tilt it this way to hide your double chin.

128
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:25,970
Okay.

129
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,866
Then add a filter to reduce your wrinkles.

130
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:31,018
Okay, let's try it. There we go.

131
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:32,713
Whoa, what a looker!

132
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,992
You're right, I look so much better!

133
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:37,634
You were right, Wes.

134
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:40,259
Money does wonders.

135
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:41,409
Unlike before...

136
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:43,229
One time I went to the mall,

137
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,992
and the salesladies looked down on me.

138
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,551
Hey! You can't afford these!

139
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,992
- Christ!
- So I said, "Yes, I couldn't..."

140
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:51,545
But now I can!

141
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,801
Now, I'm rich!

142
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:58,967
Imagine, 6/45 LOTTO solo winner!

143
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,806
Rich in… Calcium?

144
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:02,950
Totally, for strong bones!

145
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:04,245
Yeah!

146
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:08,042
Daddy, it's not rich in calcium,

147
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,759
It's rich and famous.

148
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:10,492
That's it!

149
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:13,766
That's my daughter.
She's not just a pretty face!

150
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,440
You got your smarts from me.

151
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:19,715
I'll tell you this much.

152
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:22,342
Make sure you make a lot of friends.

153
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,117
Yeah.

154
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:27,016
Never let anyone walk all over you.

155
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:27,701
Got it?

156
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:29,326
And if they do that,

157
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,034
you know they'll contend with my fist!

158
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:36,367
Why, of course! I'm a Lagdameo, after all!

159
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:37,409
Right?

160
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,600
Go on then, my darling.

161
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,534
We better get going.

162
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,217
Oh, uncle! First day of school.
Let's take a picture!

163
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:44,826
Here, I know how to work this.
Wes taught me some tricks.

164
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,541
The filter... Okay, there it is.

165
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:50,592
Uncle, we're going to
be late. We'll go ahead.

166
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:51,658
- Okay, take care!
- Bye! Bye!

167
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,104
Take care of my little girl!

168
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,378
Yes, uncle! Bye!

169
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:55,393
Wesley!

170
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:58,176
Darling! Love you!

171
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,201
Love you, too!

172
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:14,867
Your change.

173
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:15,992
Thank you.

174
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:19,401
Here, sweetie.

175
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:21,857
Ma, I need more.

176
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:24,326
Why? You're not gonna commute.

177
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,076
Miss Marie, what's new?

178
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:30,784
What shouldn't she be wearing, man?

179
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:35,659
Miss Marie, all day, all
night-without her undies.

180
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,867
Listen here, Kulas.
Better attend to your mother.

181
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:43,326
I heard you're the one nicking
underwear from everyone.

182
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:45,992
Be careful you don't get in
trouble for your nasty vice.

183
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,451
So what?

184
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:48,992
Let it go, man.

185
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,576
Let's leave them.

186
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:52,634
These bums…

187
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,034
Ma, what was that?
Are you back at the bar?

188
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:57,771
No, he's just an asshole.

189
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,502
I'm done with that place.

190
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:03,701
Besides, you're gonna get me
out of this place, won't you?

191
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:05,867
Ma, it's only the first day.

192
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,576
I know you're gonna do well.

193
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:10,659
Take this.

194
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,076
Come straight home, okay?

195
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:16,451
Yes, mom.

196
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:17,701
I better go.

197
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,242
Ah, shit, my helmet.

198
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:53,624
Issa.

199
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,088
Hey.

200
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:57,867
I got a spare.

201
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,157
It's okay, I'd rather not.

202
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:00,299
I don't want any trouble.

203
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,122
Don't act like we're not friends.

204
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,780
Are we, though?

205
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,176
We're not even close.

206
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,201
Oh, we're not?

207
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:08,950
Okay, just take it as neighbors.

208
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:10,975
We live on the same street,
go to the same school…

209
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:13,076
and new school.

210
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:14,741
Congrats, by the way.

211
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:15,766
Thank you.

212
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,467
Wait, how did you know?

213
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:19,492
Online.

214
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:24,591
Wow, nobody even tagged me.

215
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:26,367
Everybody knows you anyway.

216
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:28,509
Your picture's all over the group chats...

217
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:30,408
Oh, shit, I've said too much.

218
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,475
Not that picture, mind.

219
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,124
Not that I'm a creep,

220
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:36,807
or I'm into those
nasty stuff, but...

221
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:39,385
They just send it over...

222
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:41,925
No, I meant your admissions
picture for Harmon.

223
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,159
Sorry.

224
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:45,451
Here, take it.

225
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:47,784
Go on, just use it.

226
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:50,492
It's okay. Thanks.

227
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:54,534
It's dangerous to ride
without a helmet!

228
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:57,866
You're so sensitive.

229
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,971
I'm daring, aren't I?

230
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:01,742
I'll go with you.

231
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:07,867
Hey! Wait for me!

232
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,042
Catch the helmet!

233
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,300
You good?

234
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:51,541
Let's go!

235
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,242
Hey!

236
00:13:01,927 --> 00:13:03,134
Gibo, my bro!

237
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:03,867
- What's up?
- What's up?

238
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,926
Are you ready
to get your cherry popped?

239
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,684
- You asshole.
- What?

240
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:09,116
Hi, Mavic!

241
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:10,141
Hi, Gibo.

242
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:12,509
Don't be such a virgin.

243
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:14,425
That's right.

244
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:20,384
Better move fast. There's not a lot
of you left. We're in senior high, baby!

245
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:23,992
If I were you, I'd forget
about my ex-girlfriend, and…

246
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:26,533
let others get a taste of your sausage.

247
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:28,301
You do the same, man.

248
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,301
Enough talking about your naughty bits.

249
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:32,217
We're going to miss the
orientation. Let's go in.

250
00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:33,768
- Let's go.
- Let's go, Bes.

251
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:34,793
Come on.

252
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:43,201
Everyone, we are overjoyed to welcome
new students to our new academic year.

253
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:46,342
To the students who
passed, congratulations.

254
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,201
And to those who failed
or got kicked out,

255
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,992
I send you my prayers.

256
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,384
Now, you all know each other.

257
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,009
Since prep school, you've been together…

258
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:01,201
All of us for almost 13 years.

259
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:06,242
13 long years that have
tested our limits, dear Lord God.

260
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:08,596
So now, this year,

261
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:11,432
the school has decided
to open its doors

262
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:14,551
to exemplary students
from other schools.

263
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:20,616
And with that, we'd like to welcome
our new trasnferees starting with…

264
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:24,112
Mr. Gilberto Nolasco, Jr.
Please stand up.

265
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:34,815
My name is Gilberto Nolasco, Jr.

266
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,917
"Gibo" for short.

267
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,975
I heard he's called "Daffy".

268
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:42,034
Yes, Mr. Biggie.

269
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:43,995
That's just a preview, Gia.

270
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:47,159
Loop, but when it's fully loaded…

271
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:50,801
I remember one time at sports camp…

272
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:52,741
Gibo! Gibo! Coach wants you!

273
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,073
What is it?

274
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:55,617
What?

275
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:56,823
Gibo…

276
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:00,831
You've grown!

277
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,128
Huh? Are you crazy?

278
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,509
Wait, Jude, like how big is big?

279
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,534
Lower.

280
00:15:12,117 --> 00:15:13,326
More.

281
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:15,009
Go lower, girl!

282
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:16,842
- What?
- Much lower!

283
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:17,867
That's it!

284
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:18,892
Oh my God!

285
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,870
Next, we have Maria Victoria Lagdameo.

286
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:44,926
Hi, everybody! Standing in front of you
is a proud flat-chested, oops!

287
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:52,169
A five-foot flat stunner by the name of
Maria Victoria Lagdameo, Mavic for short.

288
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:57,683
I hail from Batangas famous for
its signature congee. You like that?

289
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:04,492
Not too soupy, but loaded with meat!

290
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,076
Get to know me, and you
won't get enough of me!

291
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,992
I love you, Mavic! Be with me!

292
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,372
I love you!

293
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:23,224
Are your shoes new?

294
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:27,638
I heard she acts all sweet
but not so innocent.

295
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:32,326
She's the daughter of who
they call The Lemery Butcher.

296
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:34,592
From jackshit to jackpot,
but you can't buy class.

297
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:38,057
-This is how you eat this, darling.
- but you can't buy class.

298
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:40,537
I want some of that.

299
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,151
Wow! Cheers.

300
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,176
Cheers!

301
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:48,839
I can be your dream girl, attack girl,
or any girl that you want.

302
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:51,534
I am confidently beautiful,

303
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:55,867
God-fearing, and…

304
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,701
flexible!

305
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,491
That's not how you
do the sign of the cross.

306
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:07,659
Stand up and please go back
to your seat, Ms. Lagdameo!

307
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:16,258
Now, next, please welcome Isabela Ramos.

308
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:18,492
Short introductions only, please.

309
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:22,073
Boo! Boo!

310
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:24,489
You're disgusting!

311
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:25,984
Boo!

312
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,284
Hello, my name is Issa.

313
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,547
Isn't that the girl
you hooked up with?

314
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,217
Was it all groping,
or you went all the way?

315
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:35,326
Yeah…

316
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:38,491
You braggart. I'm gonna
punch you in the neck.

317
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,899
Wipe that smirk off your face or I will.

318
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:48,826
Yep, I scored with Issa.
Twice? Thrice?

319
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,284
Man, you're a beast.

320
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:59,414
But dude, I heard she banged
the whole team back in her old school.

321
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:01,301
That's what I heard.

322
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:03,426
That means you got the scraps, dude.

323
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:04,866
Nah, he's not good at Math.

324
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:06,516
She's a slag.

325
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:07,385
Bingo.

326
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,533
You got ripped.

327
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,683
Next, Mr. Wesley Sumaguing.

328
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:14,296
Where is Mr. Wes...

329
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:16,242
Mr. Sumaguing?

330
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:19,217
Mr. Sumaguing?

331
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:21,195
Maybe he got shy.

332
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:24,717
Mr. Sumaguing, is that you?
Can you please come out?

333
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:27,159
All the students are here.

334
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:33,366
Oh my God!

335
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,075
Is he gay?

336
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,301
He's just fashion-forward.

337
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:37,616
No!

338
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:39,953
- Mr. Sumaguing, where are your trousers?
- Trying to look cool for sure.

339
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:50,904
We want some of that, too!

340
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:53,180
Sorry, sister. I got dragged along.

341
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:56,399
Can you please step out
and pull yourself together.

342
00:18:58,492 --> 00:18:59,909
Harmon High.

343
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:04,576
Reminder that although
your hormones are raging,

344
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:08,617
please, you should always
uphold your decency.

345
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:12,576
We have one more student
but she's not yet here.

346
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:15,284
So that's it.

347
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:18,301
Please, always be kind.

348
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:23,784
And lastly, to reiterate our
school motto, Veritas Curat.

349
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:25,801
What did she say? Penis?

350
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:28,241
- Hey.
- Cu! Curat!

351
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,182
Truth Cures.

352
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:35,884
Don't make her feel insecure.

353
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,620
- You're so pretty.
- Issa, sit here.

354
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:43,217
True. I'm really thankful
you're my friend.

355
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:47,576
Save your thanks because
she took your seat, girl.

356
00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:54,576
Excuse me.

357
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:12,967
Good morning, class.

358
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,651
Good morning, ma'am.

359
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,534
May I have the attendance sheet?

360
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:28,884
God, is this for real?

361
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:34,701
At Harmon, dreams do come true.

362
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:35,843
Mr. Nolasco…

363
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,700
- Don't you know it's rude to stare?
- Are my dreams finally happening?

364
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:42,365
- Is that what they taught you?
- It's only the first day, but I'm winning.

365
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,700
Lewdness?

366
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:47,641
Sorry, ma'am… It's not...

367
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:51,342
All right, then.
Show me what you got.

368
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:55,576
Please take my place,
and teach me.

369
00:20:56,992 --> 00:21:02,065
You teach me.

370
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:08,342
Teach you? Look at my pet, ma'am,
it's ready to teach you a lesson.

371
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,741
Always present at standing in attention!

372
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:16,176
Shit. The best class exercise ever!

373
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:20,492
Let's go, ma'am,
let's start the drills!

374
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:28,534
Open your books to- I mean boobs to...
she showed 'em right away!

375
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:35,284
She wants it bad down there, too, huh?

376
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:43,534
Me, too! Shit, this is it, Gibo.
Get ready 'cause class is in session!

377
00:21:44,284 --> 00:21:51,069
I'm right here, ma'am,
ready and present...

378
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:54,440
Oh, so good!

379
00:21:54,465 --> 00:22:01,800
Shit, it's so warm and tight. I'm feeling
the strictness deep down and I love it!

380
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:03,437
Do it.

381
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:04,992
Do it, Nolasco.

382
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:11,401
Do it! Duet?
You mean come together?

383
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:16,326
Wait, I think I'm almost there. I’m coming!

384
00:22:16,351 --> 00:22:18,518
Nolasco Jr., Gilberto?

385
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,992
Please stand up and say 'present.'

386
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,909
Mr. Nolasco.

387
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,276
Present, ma'am.

388
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,509
I can see that.

389
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:34,034
Please show yourself to Mother Superior.

390
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:37,551
But calm your pet down first.

391
00:22:37,576 --> 00:22:38,576
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:51,326
Don't be shy.

393
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:53,700
That's normal.

394
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:55,808
Why are you here?
Are you sick?

395
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:58,826
Sick? No, I'm just here for the AC.

396
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:02,701
That looks sick. Must be painful.

397
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,659
You held it in, huh?

398
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:07,201
I don't get it, man.

399
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:08,951
I unloaded this morning.

400
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:11,951
It's my teacher. She got me excited.

401
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:14,159
Let me guess. It's Mrs. S, isn't it?

402
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:18,375
You're hot for her, too, are you?

403
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,284
Be quiet.

404
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:22,047
Are you a senior?

405
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:23,326
Senior?

406
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:25,116
Thanks, man.

407
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:27,933
But… here.

408
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:31,075
Sir, sorry, sir. I was
just kidding about Mrs. S.

409
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,305
It was just a joke.

410
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:35,576
Calm down, don't worry about it.

411
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:38,659
A lot of guys fawn over Mrs. S.

412
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:40,909
It's Gibo.

413
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:41,968
Gibo.

414
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:48,242
What's really scary and shameful
is to have nobody to talk to about it.

415
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,781
It's more than just
hormones, or being horny.

416
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:54,909
It's normal in your transitional years.

417
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:57,034
Especially among teenagers.

418
00:23:57,326 --> 00:23:58,789
So you better unload that.

419
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:01,242
Right now, sir?

420
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:03,076
Not here!

421
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,509
I better go.

422
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:05,409
Okay, sir.

423
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:06,434
All right.

424
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:11,701
Bes.

425
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:13,867
it's so cold.

426
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:16,195
I feel like a corpse.

427
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,326
What about that one?

428
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:21,742
Too hot and horny.

429
00:24:22,617 --> 00:24:26,951
Looks like he's gonna
fuck anything that moves.

430
00:24:28,492 --> 00:24:29,602
I don't like that.

431
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:31,242
Too skinny.

432
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:35,492
This one's too buff.

433
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:42,031
Ugh, it's so hard
to find the ideal guy.

434
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:45,784
Meeting you have raised
my standards too high.

435
00:24:47,326 --> 00:24:49,284
You sure I can't just have you?

436
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:54,076
Don’t be daft. I want to stay
in your dad's good graces.

437
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,242
Mavic, Bes…

438
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:59,867
I love you too much to
muddle our friendship with sex.

439
00:25:00,826 --> 00:25:02,076
Remember last time?

440
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:04,576
Wes.

441
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:06,701
You have to excuse me, but…

442
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,078
This is how I want it. I move fast.

443
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,076
Slow down. It's okay.

444
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:12,867
Do you know what I want?

445
00:25:12,892 --> 00:25:14,801
Whatever it is, I'll give it to you.

446
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:15,826
Really?

447
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,046
Leave it to me!

448
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:20,367
Groping, playing…

449
00:25:40,826 --> 00:25:42,034
You sure?

450
00:25:43,617 --> 00:25:44,891
You bet.

451
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:47,034
Let's do it!

452
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:24,992
Huh?

453
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,558
Turn over. Hurry.

454
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:29,882
Hold on.

455
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:40,509
Go?

456
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:41,117
Go.

457
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,142
Right!

458
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:43,242
Go.

459
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:44,308
Put it in.

460
00:26:46,242 --> 00:26:47,034
Go!

461
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:47,992
Go!

462
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:50,141
No, you go!

463
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:08,617
Right?

464
00:27:09,076 --> 00:27:13,451
Fuck. I found my best buddy,
not a fuck buddy.

465
00:27:13,476 --> 00:27:14,826
True.

466
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:18,617
I've never met anyone
as crazy as you.

467
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:19,642
Duh.

468
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:23,384
So Bes, between friends and bootycalls,

469
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:28,451
I think we're better suited for
the long-term as BFFs, okay?

470
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:30,951
Love you.

471
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:34,159
Love you, too.

472
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:35,576
Don't get it twisted.

473
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,664
Pay tribute.

474
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:46,717
One! Hold your rods tight!

475
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:48,000
Two!

476
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:50,784
Three!

477
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:54,451
Give me more power! Don't go soft.

478
00:27:54,951 --> 00:27:55,951
Four!

479
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,076
As you were!

480
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:04,734
Nolasco!

481
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:08,826
Gibo Nolasco, Jr., sir.

482
00:28:09,117 --> 00:28:10,576
I was summonded by Mads.

483
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:13,451
You and Mads seem close.

484
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:16,034
Guys.

485
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,350
Get a load of this guy.

486
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:20,926
A transferee, but he's
late on his first day!

487
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,409
And what are you wearing?

488
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:26,701
What wall did you jump over, Gibo?

489
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:28,826
For you to earn Mother's favor so quickly?

490
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:29,909
Excuse me, sir?

491
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:31,551
Let me just remind you.

492
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,100
Just because you're the new teacher's pet,

493
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,427
doesn't mean you automatically
pass my class.

494
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:37,827
And what's up with your voice?

495
00:28:38,023 --> 00:28:39,135
Lower it.

496
00:28:39,242 --> 00:28:40,867
Don't think you can act tough around me.

497
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,210
I might get excited.

498
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:46,055
I might just give you a whirl.

499
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:49,658
Ah, sir, I don't mean any...

500
00:28:49,683 --> 00:28:52,558
You didn't advise me
that you will be late.

501
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:57,159
So stay behind after class and clean
the equipment in the storage room.

502
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,484
Am I clear, Nolasco?

503
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:00,510
Got it, sir.

504
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:02,076
That's more like it.

505
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:10,617
One!

506
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:13,826
Good. Two!

507
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:18,034
We haven't done it in so long,
my juices are turning into curd.

508
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:20,102
Just kidding.

509
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,451
I heard she's got an alter account.

510
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:26,430
Maybe Issa-prank.

511
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,875
No, dude, I swear.

512
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:34,069
I've already seen all the videos.

513
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:35,701
They'll make your mouth water.

514
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:37,200
Watched all of them, I swear.

515
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:38,225
You guys are gross.

516
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,921
Girl, she's much worse.

517
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:41,946
Seriously.

518
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:45,172
But I promise you, it's true.

519
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,367
Search it right now.

520
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,826
Hashtag alter pinay.

521
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:49,583
Hashtag tween princess.

522
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:51,342
What was it?

523
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:53,426
Hashtag alter pinay,
hashtag tween princess.

524
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:54,491
Don't follow it, okay?

525
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:55,808
You're a genius.

526
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:58,451
Look, it does exist. Watch it.

527
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,624
I told you, everyone knows.

528
00:30:00,992 --> 00:30:04,930
See? That girl Issa slut.

529
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:07,926
Don't be mean.

530
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:10,266
I think she heard you.

531
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:12,217
Here she comes.

532
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:14,409
Quick, take a video.

533
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:17,217
Whatever gossip you picked up,

534
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:18,951
or fake news you gathered,

535
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:21,117
that's all it is, fake.

536
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:25,492
Are you saying my boyfriend is a liar?

537
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,284
Well, he spoke from experience.

538
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,826
Your boyfriend?

539
00:30:31,284 --> 00:30:35,516
Even whores have standards.

540
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,409
So don't believe everything
just about anyone tells you.

541
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:43,426
You lost!

542
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:47,617
It's true. It really happened. I swear.

543
00:30:47,955 --> 00:30:50,929
You think it's something
to be proud of, do you?

544
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:57,867
Hey, Issa.

545
00:30:57,892 --> 00:30:58,926
- Oh, shit.
- Ah, fuck.

546
00:30:58,951 --> 00:30:59,951
Oh, sorry!

547
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,366
Sorry, sorry!

548
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:03,350
How many times
have you said 'sorry' today?

549
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:04,509
Who's counting?

550
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:05,992
I’m kidding, let me.
I'll do it!

551
00:31:05,992 --> 00:31:07,176
I'll do it, I'll do it.

552
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,201
I'll do it!

553
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:11,117
There.

554
00:31:34,201 --> 00:31:35,201
What was that?

555
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:36,674
What?

556
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:38,409
Can't you hear it?

557
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,051
I think I want rice cake, Wes.

558
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:43,201
Rice cake?

559
00:31:43,226 --> 00:31:45,384
Missing the Misa de Gallo?

560
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:46,256
Your treat?

561
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,033
Sure, yeah. Let me see if they have it.

562
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:49,058
Okay.

563
00:31:53,492 --> 00:31:55,509
Ah. Hi, Ernest.

564
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:56,534
Hi, Mavs.

565
00:31:57,201 --> 00:31:58,326
Long time no see.

566
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:00,576
Miss you.

567
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:04,688
You think there might be
a second chance for us?

568
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:10,242
I don't think so.

569
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:12,576
We're done, Ernest.

570
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:15,742
Besides, I've outgrown you.

571
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:19,076
I'm not into preloved items anymore.

572
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:21,326
Come on.

573
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:23,367
Just try me.

574
00:32:23,492 --> 00:32:24,492
Second serving?

575
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:26,409
Want a refill?

576
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:43,067
Ernest…

577
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:45,599
Sorry, but…

578
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:48,284
let's stick to being friends.

579
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:51,076
Give chance to others.

580
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:58,034
Take a chance on me.

581
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,709
You want ice cream?

582
00:33:01,264 --> 00:33:04,742
How about leche flan?
You might like… my heart?

583
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,951
Hang on, don't cut in line.

584
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:10,926
Yes?

585
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:12,576
Yes, sir. Why don't you all
take a number?

586
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,076
Sandwich.

587
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:16,284
Thank you.

588
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:17,309
Welcome.

589
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:22,608
I think it's here.

590
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:24,492
Oh no!

591
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,213
Oh no!

592
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,242
Hello!

593
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:33,784
What happened to its owner?

594
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,326
They probably failed the strand

595
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
so they dropped out.

596
00:33:39,742 --> 00:33:40,742
Let's check it out.

597
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:44,177
- Hello!
- Why are you having lunch here?

598
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:49,920
What about you? Why are you here?

599
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,079
You don't have to talk to me.

600
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,687
Besides, I already
told you we're not close.

601
00:34:01,826 --> 00:34:03,492
Especially with my reputation…

602
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,159
I don't believe any of that.

603
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:08,551
I know they're just bullying you.

604
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:12,051
And for the record,
I did speak up for you.

605
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:13,534
They just didn't believe me.

606
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:17,951
Even if I tell them you're
my neighbor or my friend.

607
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:22,617
That's because neighbors
doesn't mean friends.

608
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:24,117
I know you enough.

609
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:27,409
I know that your mom
used to work at the KTV.

610
00:34:27,653 --> 00:34:29,253
They're just projecting her work on you.

611
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:33,242
Just say the word. Whore.

612
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:35,154
You may have your facts right,

613
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:42,076
but they'll believe the version of
the story that fits their perspective.

614
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:45,742
Well, if we're talking versions,

615
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:49,201
Miss Whore, meet Mister Penis.

616
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,655
You think you're funny?

617
00:34:53,076 --> 00:34:54,076
Did it work?

618
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,552
Nah, I’m kidding.

619
00:34:55,577 --> 00:35:00,201
I'm just saying, every person
has a past they can't run away from.

620
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:02,779
Are you talking about Karla?

621
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,534
Yes, you're also a group chat topic.

622
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:10,367
News is, while everyone's moving up
to high school, you two are breaking up.

623
00:35:11,034 --> 00:35:12,034
Yeah.

624
00:35:12,556 --> 00:35:15,107
So much for the news
and new things, huh?

625
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,076
But so far, it's not so bad.

626
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,076
At least some of us got lucky today.

627
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:22,742
One life saved.

628
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:24,826
You're the sentimental type, huh?

629
00:35:25,617 --> 00:35:26,889
Cheesy!

630
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:29,592
Did you know that's my favorite flavor?

631
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:31,159
But not with feelings.

632
00:35:32,576 --> 00:35:35,201
Please. Everyone's
been cheesy at one point.

633
00:35:35,492 --> 00:35:36,492
Even this guy.

634
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:37,731
Am I right?

635
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:40,742
Hey, not bad.

636
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,492
Why don't we call him Cheesy?

637
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:45,367
Fits, doesn't it?

638
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:46,452
Sounds good.

639
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,195
Cheesy!

640
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:50,950
Hey, Issa! Hang on.

641
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:52,529
We missed a stain.

642
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:53,576
I'll do it! I'll do it.

643
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:54,990
Rub it out completely, it might...

644
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:57,467
- It might stain.
- I'll do it.

645
00:35:57,492 --> 00:36:00,326
What squirted on your skirt?

646
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,992
Shit!

647
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:05,575
It's only the first day
and you already scored.

648
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,808
Hotshit!

649
00:36:07,593 --> 00:36:09,051
Bro, no need to be rude.

650
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:11,709
You don't deserve respect
if there's nothing to respect.

651
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:13,862
Boom!

652
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:15,803
Gibo, leave it.

653
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:20,842
Hold on. I thought
you had giant balls?

654
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:22,678
Why are you hiding behind this girl?

655
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:24,084
So?

656
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,623
Is that the best you can do?

657
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:30,135
Riling us up, are you?

658
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,592
Looking to get your ass beat up, huh?

659
00:36:31,617 --> 00:36:32,534
Knock yourself out.

660
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,559
What now?

661
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:35,659
You got it!

662
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:37,678
What are you gonna do?

663
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:42,756
- Fight me!
- Stop it!

664
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,768
I've spoken to Mr. Ancheta.

665
00:36:46,992 --> 00:36:49,451
Kenneth and Kendrick, too.

666
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:53,075
Your stories don't add up.

667
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,725
If you could please clear it up.

668
00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:58,283
Now, I know you've been extra careful
because you're scholars

669
00:36:58,308 --> 00:37:01,279
and you wouldn't
intentionally provoke a fight.

670
00:37:01,492 --> 00:37:04,076
But still, I don't tolerate violence.

671
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:07,634
Now, if you promise to get all sorted out,

672
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,051
I will just give you a consequence
and forget about suspension.

673
00:37:11,076 --> 00:37:12,325
- Please don't!
- Please don't!

674
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,826
Like I said! Better sort it out.

675
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:19,635
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

676
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,991
Good. Now for your consequence.

677
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:25,616
You'll be doing extra hours
of service for the school.

678
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:28,116
And this will happen every after class.

679
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:32,033
So inform your parents or guardians
that you'll be coming home late.

680
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:36,617
Issa, you're assigned to the library
since you're a student scholar anyway.

681
00:37:36,885 --> 00:37:39,301
Hunter, you're on sports track.

682
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:44,842
Assist the head of interschool
sports program, Coach Tanyag.

683
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:49,963
And Gibo, you'll be assisting Mrs. Salva
with extra-curricular activities.

684
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:52,135
Awesome.

685
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,450
Awesome? You don't think
it's punishment, do you?

686
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:58,563
No, Mads. I only meant...
Oh no, so many things to do.

687
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:00,006
I'm not happy.

688
00:38:00,557 --> 00:38:06,990
Awesome! I don't care if Mrs. Salva
makes me her slave. I'm game.

689
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:12,607
I'm telling you, bestie, this
is how those sluts get dough.

690
00:38:24,617 --> 00:38:28,912
We heard that Hunter almost
got suspended because of you!

691
00:38:29,302 --> 00:38:34,188
FYI, Kenneth, Kendrick,
and Hunter the "Kens"

692
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:36,810
are part of our clique.

693
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:38,713
You bitch. You're not gonna go without.

694
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:41,115
Because your offense to them…

695
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:45,166
is an offense to us.

696
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,592
Your clique's called Clique?

697
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:51,409
Are you really looking for a fight?

698
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:52,434
Huh?

699
00:38:55,197 --> 00:39:00,739
If it's a fight you want, why
don't we finish it right here?

700
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:05,117
Just between us girls.

701
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:06,909
Girls?

702
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:08,974
She said girls. So split.

703
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:12,867
Bestie, she's bullying me…

704
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,117
Issa!

705
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:15,218
Ouch!

706
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:17,021
Oops!

707
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:24,992
I slept in class.

708
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:26,717
Now my bones are all brittle.

709
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,200
What do you say we
knock these bitches down?

710
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:30,225
Want me to?

711
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,909
Shoo!

712
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:37,784
Did you see her face?

713
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:40,451
Those losers.

714
00:39:40,617 --> 00:39:43,451
You didn't have to do that.
I can handle myself.

715
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,592
That's okay, silly.

716
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:46,992
I'm the one who offered.

717
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,409
Mavic, by the way.

718
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:52,450
I was a transferee at
your high school last year.

719
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:54,492
But we weren't classmates.

720
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:55,534
So…

721
00:39:55,535 --> 00:40:01,117
I know you. And hey, you don't
have to talk to me out of nowhere.

722
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,439
For the sake of old school ties.

723
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,104
Better keep your distance.

724
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,259
I don't want you
getting dragged in my issues.

725
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:09,467
At least I'm used to it.

726
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:12,190
Oh please, you worry too much.

727
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:15,909
Telling me to avoid you but
you're already pulling away.

728
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:22,492
Besides, harness that
feisty woman inside you.

729
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,201
Like what my bestfriend Wes always says,

730
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:28,909
Embrace your sexuality!

731
00:40:29,534 --> 00:40:34,201
So if you're experienced,
then congratulations!

732
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:36,034
What's it to them, right?

733
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:39,034
So guys get called heroes,

734
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:40,963
while women get called whores?

735
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:42,842
You shock me sometimes.

736
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:46,346
The sweet princess image doesn't suit you.

737
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:48,073
Sweet my ass.

738
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:50,742
I myself have had my
share of life experiences.

739
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,557
You know… ULO.

740
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:56,701
ULO? You mean YOLO.

741
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:57,951
No!

742
00:40:58,326 --> 00:41:01,159
U-L-O as in ulo (head).

743
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:02,616
Not all the way.

744
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:05,266
Just the head.

745
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:06,884
Just the head.

746
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,384
Just the head.

747
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:09,565
What?

748
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:10,909
Let's just go.

749
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,023
Let's go down.

750
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:13,048
Head?

751
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:15,701
Our next auditionee is…

752
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,159
Wes Sumaguing.

How about we meet at dinner time?

775
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:41,742
Are you game for Vivamax and relax?

776
00:42:43,284 --> 00:42:48,159
No, I'll just call you.
Okay? Bye.

777
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:54,576
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

778
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,742
Whatever it was, I won't tell.

779
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,617
Did you hear everything?

780
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:02,284
It's okay.

781
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:06,301
You know, I just don't want
students talking about us

782
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:09,492
and our personal lives as teachers.

783
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,742
They find it intriguing, you see.

784
00:43:14,463 --> 00:43:16,300
Yes, sir. My lips are sealed.

785
00:43:16,617 --> 00:43:18,367
Besides, no one will believe me.

786
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:23,701
Isabela.

787
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:25,951
I choose to believe you,

788
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:30,117
and can you make a promise
and keep this between us?

789
00:43:31,284 --> 00:43:32,284
Okay?

790
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:46,701
OT? At the bar?

791
00:43:47,367 --> 00:43:49,242
That's not even a client call.

792
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:53,201
Just say it...

793
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:55,647
That you're seeing someone else.

794
00:43:58,367 --> 00:43:59,534
What about us?

795
00:43:59,992 --> 00:44:01,792
When was the last time
we went out on a date?

796
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,117
When was the last time...

797
00:44:08,117 --> 00:44:10,784
Don't talk to me like that!

798
00:44:12,076 --> 00:44:13,826
I'm still your wife.

799
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,367
You know what…

800
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,701
do what you want.

801
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:33,284
Ma'am.

802
00:44:37,617 --> 00:44:38,617
Sorry.

803
00:44:39,951 --> 00:44:42,117
You shouldn't have heard that.

804
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:46,701
My husband and I just
have our misunderstandings.

805
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:50,451
Please excuse me for that.

806
00:44:52,742 --> 00:44:55,867
You don't need to apologize
for something you didn't do.

807
00:44:56,242 --> 00:45:01,909
Also, there's no excuse for
bad behavior and bad words.

808
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,076
Ma'am,

809
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,576
you don't deserve that kind of treatment.

810
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:11,242
Sorry, but I think your
imagination is going wild.

811
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,617
What you assumed? You're wrong.

812
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,004
What do you know about these things anyway?

813
00:45:23,124 --> 00:45:25,856
Sorry. That was uncalled for.

814
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:27,660
I apologize.

815
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:29,367
It's okay, ma'am.

816
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:32,201
All I know is what my father taught me.

817
00:45:32,992 --> 00:45:35,617
That you should never make a woman cry.

818
00:45:40,742 --> 00:45:41,742
Thanks.

819
00:45:47,492 --> 00:45:48,617
That's enough.

820
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:50,034
We should get to work.

821
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:51,951
Okay.

822
00:45:54,367 --> 00:45:58,076
That's okay, ma'am,
just let it all out.

823
00:45:58,652 --> 00:46:03,009
But why do I feel like
letting something out?

824
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:03,909
What's wrong with you, Gibo?

825
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:05,141
Hello, mister?

826
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:06,249
Where are you?

827
00:46:07,617 --> 00:46:08,617
Traffic?

828
00:46:10,076 --> 00:46:12,409
Okay, I'll just wait for you here.

829
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:14,742
Okay, drive safe. Bye.

830
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:51,784
Don't try anything.
You'll bleed like a pig.

831
00:47:04,576 --> 00:47:10,576
Bryce: I'm the useless one? That's rich!
If only you did those things with me!

832
00:47:17,409 --> 00:47:18,451
Ma'am?

833
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:21,784
Your phone kept vibrating.

834
00:47:27,074 --> 00:47:28,617
Did I do that?

835
00:47:33,992 --> 00:47:35,701
Ma'am, you can stop me, but...

836
00:47:36,409 --> 00:47:37,909
Wait a minute.

837
00:47:39,992 --> 00:47:40,992
Not here.

838
00:47:41,742 --> 00:47:46,527
I just wanted to tell you
to wait at the other gate.

839
00:47:47,617 --> 00:47:48,992
- The other gate?
- Yeah.

840
00:47:49,017 --> 00:47:52,308
Because Gate 1 closes early.

841
00:47:52,617 --> 00:47:54,117
I didn't want you to get bored

842
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,256
waiting for nothing.

843
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:58,592
Is that all? I'm sorry.

844
00:47:58,617 --> 00:48:01,659
And while you're waiting
for your driver…

845
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:05,534
I noticed that when you're tense,

846
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:07,842
you were biting your lips.

847
00:48:07,867 --> 00:48:11,217
You might hurt yourself.

848
00:48:11,242 --> 00:48:12,866
Lips? You mean nails.

849
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:13,659
Yeah.

850
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:15,566
Sorry, sorry… right, I meant your nails.

851
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:17,302
You were biting your nails, right, yeah.

852
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:18,832
I'm Mavic.

853
00:48:19,134 --> 00:48:21,926
Max. Maximus Lopez.

854
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:23,637
So… may I?

855
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:25,451
May I cut your nails?

856
00:48:25,476 --> 00:48:27,201
Sure, file them down.

857
00:48:27,226 --> 00:48:28,226
Get right in there.

858
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:30,784
Hey, Issa.

859
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,409
Hey.

860
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:34,409
How would you rate your first day?

861
00:48:35,284 --> 00:48:37,242
First day? 0.5 for sure.

862
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:40,576
These are extra hours now. But…

863
00:48:41,201 --> 00:48:43,909
Okay, ratings. Three stars, I guess.

864
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:45,701
Lots of new things.

865
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:48,159
New enemies, new issue,

866
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:51,492
new encounters. But of course, new friends.

867
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:54,117
Sorry about today.

868
00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:55,951
You got in trouble because of me.

869
00:48:56,451 --> 00:48:57,451
Come on.

870
00:48:57,909 --> 00:48:59,117
That was me.

871
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,159
That was my choice.

872
00:49:01,867 --> 00:49:04,576
It may be late, but I
wanna make it up to you.

873
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:06,784
Who knows, here at Harmon,

874
00:49:07,492 --> 00:49:08,950
people might finally know the truth.

875
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:17,268
So yes, past is past, and accept
the new completely, right?

876
00:49:18,565 --> 00:49:19,899
- That's just how it is.
- Sure.

877
00:49:24,867 --> 00:49:27,617
I think it's stuck.

878
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:29,826
You having trouble with that?

879
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:31,284
It won't release.

880
00:49:32,076 --> 00:49:33,409
It's so easy. Let me do it.

881
00:49:34,284 --> 00:49:35,284
Give me your key.

882
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:40,491
You just do it like this.

883
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:41,833
Easy peasy.

884
00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:43,357
What's the fuss about?

885
00:49:43,382 --> 00:49:44,382
Here.

886
00:49:46,326 --> 00:49:47,326
Oh my God.

887
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:49,159
Karla?

888
00:49:58,652 --> 00:50:00,860
Let's be friends. Official.

889
00:50:00,885 --> 00:50:01,926
Aren't you going too fast?

890
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:02,951
What about you, Hunter?

891
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,967
How do you make her happy?

892
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:06,825
You just went to the
club looking for trouble.

893
00:50:06,826 --> 00:50:07,701
Watch yourself.

894
00:50:07,702 --> 00:50:10,491
Just because you have pure intentions...

895
00:50:10,516 --> 00:50:11,997
All I want is to love her.
