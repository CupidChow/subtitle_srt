1
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:09,454
Let's be friends. Official.

2
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:10,579
Aren't you going too fast?

3
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:13,579
What about you, Hunter?
How do you make her happy?

4
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,496
You just went to the club
looking for trouble.

5
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:16,412
Watch yourself.

6
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:19,162
Just because you have pure intentions...

7
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:20,677
All I want is to love her.

8
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:28,606
Shit!

9
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,496
Right there.

10
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,537
Love, am I going too fast?

11
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:51,704
Just tell me.

12
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,167
I haven't met anyone like you before.

13
00:02:57,454 --> 00:02:58,829
Forget about being 'too fast'.

14
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:01,315
Ride me as hard as you want, love. Go!

15
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:02,912
Just like that. Go!

16
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:06,496
Hang on. Are we safe here?

17
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:11,307
Yes. They're out for the weekend,
so the house is always empty.

18
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:12,332
Let's go.

19
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:15,596
Okay.

20
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:18,793
Hold on.

21
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,204
Wait, wait. Not there.

22
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,003
Sorry, right... Control.

23
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,871
The heck are you talking about?

24
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:35,454
What I meant was don't put it there.

25
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,704
Aim it higher.

26
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:37,604
Huh?

27
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:38,746
Go higher.

28
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:39,496
Higher?

29
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:40,704
Yes, up there.

30
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,261
But isn't this the fire exit?

31
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,596
Love, I'm saving my V-card for D-day.

32
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,621
Wedding day.

33
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:51,954
So on regular days,
let's use the backdoor.

34
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,271
Ah, no, but...

35
00:03:54,204 --> 00:03:56,829
Isn't that for... you know?

36
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:57,969
Gay?

37
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,221
No! Why don't you try it first?

38
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:02,996
Go ahead. Higher.

39
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:03,787
Here?

40
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:04,829
Yes, a little more.

41
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:05,854
Almost there.

42
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,901
Yes, bingo!

43
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,287
Bingo!

44
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:09,429
Rice Cakes!

45
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:11,370
Hello, neighbors!

46
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,471
Buy my snacks!

47
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:15,934
Carmie!

48
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,304
Here, I have your favorite.

49
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:19,621
Maja blanca!

50
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,396
This goes great with coffee.

51
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:24,485
Issa, you and Gibo are classmates, right?

52
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:27,378
Hey. She's talking to you.

53
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:29,028
Oh, sorry, ma'am. What was it?

54
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,456
I said you and Gibo are classmates.

55
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm glad. It's good
to know someone.

56
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:38,246
How are you teachers and classmates?

57
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:45,221
Everything's fine, ma'am.

58
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:48,511
Sorry about her.
She's not quite herself.

59
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:49,911
She's been staying up late.

60
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:51,371
Scribbling away on her notebooks!

61
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,471
I told her she should have
some fun sometimes.

62
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:55,440
You're crazy.

63
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,662
You should come in and rest.

64
00:05:57,956 --> 00:05:59,622
Wait, let me get Gibo.

65
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:02,537
Auntie, that's okay, you don't have to.

66
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,005
Is there an issue?

67
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,054
- No, auntie.
- Well, is there?

68
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,104
No, there's nothing.

69
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:08,704
She's really out of it today.

70
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,787
We should really get going.
I'll bring these to the other neighbors.

71
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:12,937
All right. Be safe.

72
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:14,018
Thanks, auntie.

73
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:19,370
Is there an issue? Don't tell me
you have a crush on the guy?

74
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:20,412
No, I don't.

75
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:22,596
No secrets, okay?

76
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:24,412
Is this your project with Issa?

77
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,454
No, Pa. We found a pet in school.

78
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,996
I can't bring it home
because you know,

79
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,329
mom's allergic.

80
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:34,437
You sure you're not looking
after something else?

81
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:37,137
Nothing like that, Pa.

82
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:39,704
Besides, it's Issa. Our skinny neighbor.

83
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,162
She's just a friend.

84
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:43,523
Sure, sure, if you say so.

85
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,422
Ah, Pa, I'll just take this call.

86
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:49,425
Who is this?

87
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,162
Hey, Wes.

88
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,971
Gibo. It's the weekend.
Let's go! Party mode on!

89
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:57,954
I'm busy.

90
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,371
Gibo, please. Stop moping!

91
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,018
The world's not ending just because
she deleted your pictures together!

92
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:05,735
Huh?

93
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:07,037
What are you talking about?

94
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:10,737
Shit. Haven't you seen it? Sorry!

95
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:23,273
Sorry, but that's that, bro.
Final blow.

96
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:27,037
She practically announced
to the whole world that you're over.

97
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:29,746
Let's go.

98
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:31,162
Lemuel?

99
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:32,471
Is that you?

100
00:07:32,496 --> 00:07:34,371
- Auntie Margo. How are you?
- Hello!

101
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:35,417
Hi, hi!

102
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:36,954
It's so nice.

103
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,304
Do you remember Lem?
Your Auntie Sonia's son!

104
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,329
Of course, Ma.

105
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:43,929
Oh my gosh, Lemuel.
I didn't know you were back.

106
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,721
I thought you're in the US.

107
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:50,471
Ah, wait! You were in
that retreat last summer!

108
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:52,412
Karla, didn't you see each other there?

109
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,792
Yes, auntie, but only briefly.

110
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:58,496
Nice! So you teach here, huh?

111
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:03,554
Training? As part of your last year?
Wow, you're graduating!

112
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,229
Yes, auntie. I am.

113
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:09,807
You know what, you should
practice by tutoring Karla!

114
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:10,932
Ma!

115
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,596
Oh, sure. By the way, auntie,
I have to clock in.

116
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,037
I'm running late.

117
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:18,276
- Okay, okay, dear.
- Thank you.

118
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:26,054
Gibo!

119
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,454
Gibo, dear!

120
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,137
How are you?

121
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:31,079
Hi! Hello! Hello!

122
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,262
How are you, dear?

123
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:34,537
I'm okay, ma'am. What about you?

124
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:37,098
Always good. How's your mom?

125
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,137
Actually, you know what?
I should actually donate more to their NGO!

126
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:44,823
You haven't been to the house in ages!

127
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:46,287
I'm starting to feel bad.

128
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:47,437
- No need, Ma!
- Sorry about that, auntie.

129
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,579
Look at the time.
You'll be late. Go on!

130
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,262
- Okay.
- Okay, auntie.

131
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:54,284
Bye, my love.

132
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:55,409
Bye!

133
00:08:56,246 --> 00:09:01,121
Karla hasn't been getting enough sleep.
Look how puffy her face is!

134
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:04,329
It doesn't help that
your textbooks are so heavy!

135
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:06,346
Karla, Iet me take that!

136
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,413
I'll carry your bag for you.

137
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,704
Always such a good boy, Gibo.

138
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:10,937
Thank you!

139
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:12,096
- Thank you, auntie.
- Bye, darling!

140
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,537
Bye, Ma!

141
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,121
- We'll go ahead.
- Bye! Take care.

142
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:16,229
Enjoy!

143
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:17,682
Take care.

144
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:27,839
Nevermind, give me that.

145
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:29,164
I know.

146
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,745
I just didn't want to embarrass your mom.

147
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:36,448
Karla, I already know we're over.

148
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:40,054
But you didn't have to be
a bitch about it.

149
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,079
Excuse me?

150
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:45,096
Yeah, that's how you're acting
in case you haven't noticed.

151
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:47,071
I just wish…

152
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:48,662
you didn't do it to me.

153
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:52,909
Because even if you hurt me,
I'll never retaliate.

154
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,496
Just give some respect.

155
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,621
It's pretty basic.

156
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,086
See you.

157
00:09:58,456 --> 00:09:59,700
Issa!

158
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,262
Let's go?

159
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:07,137
Students, the celebration of
the Day of the Rosary is coming up.

160
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:09,412
And as per university tradition,

161
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:12,104
we will have an overnight retreat.

162
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,512
Fun!

163
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:16,871
Okay, okay. Silence. Silence.

164
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:20,938
For those who wish to come, you just
need to submit a signed consent form

165
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:23,029
from your parents or guardians.

166
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:27,512
You will have to pay fees for meals
and miscellaneous expenses.

167
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:29,679
Before you writhe in joy,

168
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:31,912
I just want to remind you,

169
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:35,596
that we shall spend that time to pray,

170
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:38,018
reflect, and confess our sins.

171
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:40,096
Not to fool around, okay?

172
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:41,706
Yes, Mads. Of course.

173
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:44,554
- Yes, Mads! Sure!
- Now for additional reminders.

174
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,065
Miss Salva, please.

175
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,162
You may approach Miss Salva, okay?

176
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:52,704
Everyone's done confessing.

177
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,121
Just one.

178
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,831
Oh, come on.

179
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:05,005
Hey, Luke!

180
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:06,054
Hey, Max.

181
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,137
I have a new recruit for our party.
Mavic Lagdameo.

182
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:10,162
- Hello there!
- Hi!

183
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:13,404
Mavic, welcome to the longest
running political party

184
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:16,096
in Harmon Vanguard,
Senior High Chapter.

185
00:11:16,121 --> 00:11:18,362
This is Luke, our party president.

186
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:21,005
Hi! Oh, oops.

187
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,690
I forgot... You're politicians.

188
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,003
- Hi, Luke!
- Hi.

189
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:25,537
Alright, let's take our seats.

190
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:26,937
Yep, let's go.

191
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:28,137
Thank you.

192
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:29,429
How sweet.

193
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,276
Hi!

194
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:32,378
What's up, guys?

195
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:34,782
Guys.

196
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:40,246
And if we're talking parties,
I'm all about that.

197
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:43,912
It's Mavic, right?

198
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:45,445
Yes.

199
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,137
Were you ever a student officer?

200
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:51,246
I was muse. I strutted. Want a sample?

201
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:52,229
Ah, no need.

202
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:53,846
Okay.

203
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:56,246
But you were active in the student body?

204
00:11:56,305 --> 00:11:58,619
Active? Body?

205
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:02,454
Sure! Want to go
for three rounds? No problem!

206
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:03,912
- Right, love?
- What?

207
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:08,012
She means yes.
She's interested in civic duties.

208
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:08,995
Yeah.

209
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:10,704
You better be sure.

210
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:14,554
Love? What's civic?
Isn't that a car?

211
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,581
I'll tell you later,
but he didn't mean the car.

212
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:17,912
So, may we start?

213
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,528
So, where were we?

214
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:24,021
Issa.

215
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,371
Ta-da!

216
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:31,816
Not bad.

217
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:33,937
Pretty cute.

218
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:36,440
Are you describing this or me?

219
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:38,529
Assuming?

220
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:45,633
What was that for?

221
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:47,339
Nothing. Memories.

222
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:51,037
At least, one year from now
it'll show up on our feed, huh?

223
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:55,120
Ah. I only have feeds for Cheesy.

224
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,471
I deactivated my Fezbook and TikTak.

225
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,133
Not a poster, nor a poser.

226
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:04,042
Besides, I don't like
being in social media.

227
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:05,246
Really now?

228
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:08,204
Yeah, but I'm on IJ and Tweezer.

229
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:12,304
But I only use them to check
for earthquake and fire updates.

230
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:15,621
Okay. I'll add you.

231
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,721
I'll wait for your approval. Hang on.

232
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:21,454
She unfollowed him on IJ,
in real life, too?

233
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,221
Ah, life!

234
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:25,679
What's up?

235
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,198
What's with the long face?

236
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:30,302
It is Karla again?

237
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:35,065
Yeah, I know she deleted your pictures.

238
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:38,971
Wow, not a poster but a lurker.

239
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:41,422
It doesn't bother me anymore.

240
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:42,526
I'm over it.

241
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,667
But of course…

242
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:48,496
I wish I knew the real reason
why she broke up with me.

243
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:51,402
I did a recall, see.

244
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,346
And I really couldn't find a trigger.

245
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:58,454
If there was a third party,
that would make sense.

246
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,246
You think so?

247
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:06,237
Sir, these are for you.

248
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:09,121
What are you doing?

249
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:10,417
Just flirting.

250
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:14,429
You know what? You're so immature.

251
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,682
Isn't that why you fell for me?

252
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:18,839
Don't be such a bitch.

253
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:21,137
Good morning, Sir Lem.

254
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:22,162
Ms. Sanchez.

255
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:23,800
Thank you.

256
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:24,825
You may leave.

257
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:31,454
Yeah, if there's a third party,
I'd rather know.

258
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,242
I'll find out what he has that I don't.

259
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:39,429
If he's more handsome, richer, taller.

260
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:40,596
Wait!

261
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,813
Is this what you mean by 'over it'?

262
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:48,599
You're the OG cheesy for sure.
Not this one.

263
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:52,079
You've never been
cheesy your whole life?

264
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,221
Never fell in love
and got your heart broken?

265
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,273
Such a big talker.

266
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,204
Karla's your first girlfriend, right?

267
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,925
Yeah? At least I got one in the bag.

268
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:06,299
Is your heart a virgin, too?

269
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:07,966
So rude!

270
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:09,787
For real?

271
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,979
I'm not ignorant,
if that's what you're asking.

272
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,871
Okay, who is it then?

273
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:16,996
What's his name?

274
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:19,143
It's...

275
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,704
It's... It's Bob.

276
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,554
Bob? What kind of name is Bob?
Who names their kid that?

277
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,768
That's the name of the loony
hobo on our street.

278
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,636
Bob? That sounds made up.

279
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:34,425
You're so mean to all the Bobs.

280
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,980
Bob.

281
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,162
Bob.

282
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:40,621
What if…

283
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,032
I court you?

284
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:49,704
I'm joking! Unless you want
to take it seriously?

285
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:51,093
Just say so.

286
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:52,704
Don’t be shy.

287
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,787
We're good at keeping secrets, aren't we?

288
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:57,621
Huh?

289
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,526
I meant Cheesy.

290
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:03,878
You might have told the teachers.
They'll get rid of it for sure.

291
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:06,776
Ah, no. It's our secret.

292
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:09,954
According to recent studies,

293
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:14,871
the highest cases occur in men
having sex with men.

294
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,871
As for heterosexuals.

295
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:19,018
Men having sex with men?

296
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,846
Why call it something else
when it's just gay?

297
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:27,706
Now, just to clarify, when we say
men having sex with men,

298
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:32,346
we are not automatically
referring to gays or homosexuals.

299
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:35,602
We should not box gay people.

300
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:37,262
Let them...

301
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,887
Let me just clarify, students, okay?

302
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:47,792
That this setup and act is not condoned
by the church and the university.

303
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:51,836
Now, as for me, I will hold
my opinion on this matter

304
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:54,323
but as curriculum dictates…

305
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,579
Go on, madam lecturer,
please tell us the details.

306
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,245
That's gay. Period.

307
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:02,599
If you want it up the ass, that's gay.

308
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:07,964
What if you're cleaning out
your hole after you take a shit?

309
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:09,954
And you accidentally put your finger in,

310
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,271
does that make you gay?

311
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:13,607
Disgusting.

312
00:17:15,787 --> 00:17:16,912
The teacher's right.

313
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,846
Besides, it's tighter down there.

314
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,715
Does my girlfriend look like a homo to you?

315
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,721
Yes!

316
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:25,704
Homo?

317
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:36,287
God.

318
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:38,412
You're lurking like a ghost.

319
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:41,722
Do you do this all the time?
Stay after school?

320
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:43,037
No, sir.

321
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,568
I just have papers due, and…

322
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,106
my laptop's broken.

323
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:50,299
It's cheaper here
than to rent a computer.

324
00:17:50,324 --> 00:17:51,386
Rent a computer?

325
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:54,706
Sorry, you're too rich to understand.

326
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,454
Just like Karla.

327
00:17:58,704 --> 00:17:59,704
Karla?

328
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,454
Why mention her name?

329
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:03,099
Ah, I just remembered her.

330
00:18:03,412 --> 00:18:05,704
We were classmates in our old school.

331
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:07,375
She's one of the rich students, too.

332
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,000
So you know each other.

333
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,409
Just based on your reaction, I mean.

334
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:16,871
Family friend.

335
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,912
Our parents are somewhat close.

336
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,037
Just somewhat.

337
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:23,526
Anyways.

338
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,719
Did you apply to the Chronicles yet?

339
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:27,787
Yes, sir. Why do you ask?

340
00:18:28,537 --> 00:18:30,878
Well, I'm just glad I was
able to convince you.

341
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:33,305
And I'd be happy to see you there, Issa.

342
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:34,996
Thank you, sir.

343
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:36,149
You're welcome.

344
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:42,371
Taking forever! I'm dying to stamp,
I mean hump Miss Salva!

345
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:47,262
I'm ready to press hard against her,
put it inside her, make a mark!

346
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,573
Let me help you out, sir.
How many more are there?

347
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,425
Just a few pages left.

348
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:53,162
Here you go.

349
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:54,557
There it is.

350
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:56,304
And last one. There!

351
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,187
- Are you done?
- Thank you, son.

352
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,162
You're all good, sir.

353
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:03,870
- You're not heading out yet?
- We'll just tidy up.

354
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,531
All right. I'll go ahead.

355
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:09,246
- Okay, sir.
- Okay, sir.

356
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:21,589
So… what needs tidying up, Felize?

357
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:27,589
All the mess we'll make.

358
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,261
You've felt me up.

359
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:35,214
But you, Gibo, I still have to review.

360
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,871
Review.

361
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:01,318
Hold on.

362
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:02,716
Don't you want it?

363
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:05,512
I do, of course, but…

364
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,482
Can we do it step-by-step?

365
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,412
Since it's my first time.

366
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:11,115
You've never been...

367
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:15,097
But last time, you seemed to
know exactly what you were doing.

368
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:18,365
Well, we're good at video games.

369
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:20,560
Like so and so, right?

370
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,357
But it's really my first time.

371
00:20:25,662 --> 00:20:28,246
So I want to relish the experience…

372
00:20:29,216 --> 00:20:31,954
and savor everything we'll review.

373
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,058
Savor?

374
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:35,700
Savor.

375
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:43,662
Yes, ma'am. I'll savor every drop!

376
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:47,174
Oops, let's get rid of this,
or it might get soaked.

377
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:52,982
Because I assure you, Mrs. Salva.
You'll be melting in my mouth!

378
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:19,162
I've never felt so…

379
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,154
so…

380
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:24,169
So good!

381
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:44,621
Do I pass the oral exam, ma'am?

382
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:49,079
Sorry, we didn't get bond some more.

383
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:52,021
My ride came early. Our quality time
got cut short, among other things.

384
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,370
What 'other things'?

385
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:06,371
Video call?

386
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:09,847
No, cybersex.

387
00:22:10,732 --> 00:22:11,935
Like this?

388
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:14,690
Like this?

389
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:16,412
Like what you see?

390
00:22:17,132 --> 00:22:19,419
Yes. Touch there.

391
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:21,880
I'm close.

392
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,904
Wait. Hold it. Let me see yours.

393
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,466
Show me more.

394
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:29,146
Right there.

395
00:22:34,757 --> 00:22:36,849
Show me more.
I'm close.

396
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:41,107
You've been saying that.
What's taking so long?

397
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:43,013
Ah, sorry...

398
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,690
Ah! Wait, I know.

399
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:47,736
Can you show it from behind?

400
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:49,345
I want to see you from behind.

401
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:51,521
Ah, hold on.

402
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:54,247
How do we do this?

403
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:58,724
Maybe set it up on a table
or cabinet or whatever.

404
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,701
Okay, okay.

405
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:14,524
- There. Do you see?
- Yes, just like that. Go on. Go on.

406
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:16,497
Yeah. I'm almost there.

407
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:33,649
Ah, yes. I'm close.

408
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:35,302
Yes, that's it! That's it!

409
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:48,938
I don't understand how your husband
can possibly not like this.

410
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,055
You're so hot.

411
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:53,950
It's complicated.

412
00:23:55,732 --> 00:23:56,732
Try me.

413
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,435
I pick up on things pretty fast.

414
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:02,320
It's not about the hotness,
or being sexy.

415
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:06,163
If you don't have what they're looking for,

416
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:09,954
the pleasure of sex doesn't even figure in.

417
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:11,062
It's just not as important.

418
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,036
What's important?

419
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:17,205
Will his brain even work
while he's doing it?

420
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,480
Because while I'm doing it--

421
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:20,216
I'm just taking it all in.

422
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,980
And I mean all of it.

423
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:25,413
We got bogged down trying
so hard to have a baby.

424
00:24:25,438 --> 00:24:29,177
I don't know. All I know is,
the excitement faded.

425
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:33,943
Eventually, it became a responsibility.

426
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,927
Dates we had to follow
closely on the calendar.

427
00:24:37,364 --> 00:24:42,787
Or maybe we overdid it,
and now he's spent.

428
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:44,438
Just him?

429
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:48,145
Wait, are you still attracted to him?

430
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,330
I think so.

431
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:54,130
But that is overshadowed
by a lot of things.

432
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:56,490
When I attempt to you know...

433
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:58,224
I find it difficult to get in the mood.

434
00:24:58,342 --> 00:25:02,114
Because bad thoughts would intrude,
like my shortcomings,

435
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:05,654
or if there's someone out there
who can give him what I couldn't.

436
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:10,080
Maybe he feels that for me.

437
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:11,685
His hesitation.

438
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:13,792
That's why he got tired of it.

439
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:17,480
I may not fully grasp
the depths of your issue,

440
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:20,938
I understand shortcomings.

441
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,563
It doesn't feel good,

442
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:26,005
and it's not easy to admit.

443
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:29,160
Thank you for making me talk.

444
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:32,146
For listening.

445
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:48,390
For the retreat. Don't be shy.
It's our secret.

446
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,388
Whatever, Gibo.

447
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:58,146
Silken tofu!

448
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:04,365
Silken tofu!

449
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:19,848
Issa!

450
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:22,146
- Issa!
- Auntie!

451
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,536
Issa. Are you looking for Gibo?

452
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:29,403
No, auntie. I was just...

453
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:31,911
I'm taking the wheels for a test run.

454
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:35,044
Test them on your way to school
so you can meet with my son.

455
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,105
His dad drove him to school early.

456
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:41,121
We didn't talk about meeting today.

457
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:44,163
Okay, but you'll still
see each other, right?

458
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,605
Enjoy your retreat, okay?

459
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,771
- Okay, auntie.
- Take care.

460
00:26:46,796 --> 00:26:47,796
Thanks!

461
00:26:52,496 --> 00:26:53,705
Let's go! Let's go!

462
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,771
It's hot out here!

463
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,621
Okay, boys and girls, students…

464
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:07,443
- Hi, Mads!
- Listen carefully.

465
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:12,338
Guys and girls can't be
in the same room, got it?

466
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,896
Don't even try to jump fences
because I have eyes everywhere.

467
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:21,130
And remember, Jesus is always watching you!

468
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:24,781
Just reminding you.

469
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,246
No drinking, no gambling, no flirting,

470
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:31,771
and no monkey business at all.

471
00:27:31,996 --> 00:27:32,705
Okay?

472
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,496
Clear?

473
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:34,688
Yes, ma'am!

474
00:27:34,713 --> 00:27:35,755
Okay. Go!

475
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,136
Let's go!

476
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:47,855
And deliver us, Lord

477
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:55,396
from evil.

478
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:59,896
The peace of the Lord be with you always.

479
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,537
And also with your spirit.

480
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:08,438
Let us offer each other the sign of peace.

481
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,326
Peace be with you.

482
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,730
You're so cheesy!

483
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,779
You're so fun to tease.

484
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:25,401
One candle you give to someone
you're grateful to or for,

485
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:30,288
another candle for someone
you want to say 'sorry' to.

486
00:28:30,313 --> 00:28:33,607
So if there's something
you wish to change, do it now.

487
00:28:33,632 --> 00:28:37,382
You may start by lighting your candles.

488
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:46,871
Thanks, because you gave me the courage
to be true to my feelings,

489
00:28:46,896 --> 00:28:49,412
so now I’m with The One.

490
00:28:49,904 --> 00:28:53,246
You're the cupid in our love story.

491
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:55,396
So, thank you, friend!

492
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:57,005
Welcome, Mavic!

493
00:28:57,745 --> 00:28:59,328
Welcome, friend!

494
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,240
Wait, Issa.

495
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:06,114
This is for you.

496
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:10,925
Sorry for what I did that time.

497
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,958
And for going along with others' bullying.

498
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:17,205
For liking the video, sharing it,
and reposting.

499
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,544
Yeah, okay, I get it.

500
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:23,536
Thanks for saving me last time.

501
00:29:24,855 --> 00:29:26,771
Thank you. I appreciate this.

502
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:29,408
You're not such a bad guy after all.

503
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:30,818
If you choose not to be.

504
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:34,788
And you're actually nice.
If only you followed through.

505
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:36,146
That's the problem.

506
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:37,338
I don't know if I can do it.

507
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,125
Why?

508
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:41,980
Are you just being nice right now?

509
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:44,063
You're just a good guy in secret?

510
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:47,371
My friends will feel weird.
They might think I'm getting  soft.

511
00:29:47,396 --> 00:29:49,482
Okay, I guess.

512
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:51,302
Good luck with that.

513
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:53,563
Thanks, Issa.

514
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:57,146
Clique, I can't let this go.

515
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,580
I already gave that slut a warning.

516
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:01,688
But she just can't help herself.

517
00:30:02,482 --> 00:30:04,521
Is it violence she wants?

518
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:05,787
Fine.

519
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,521
Are you with game?

520
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:09,730
I'm down, girl.

521
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:14,023
Thank you for being nice to us.

522
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:46,080
Let's talk first.

523
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:47,105
Later.

524
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:52,121
Why?

525
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:54,355
Why aren't you answering my calls?

526
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,713
What's the point of asking?
I'm here, aren't I?

527
00:30:58,856 --> 00:30:59,865
Wait!

528
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:02,630
No.

529
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:19,938
You're pretty gutsy. You don't care
where we do it, huh?

530
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:25,521
Is this mine?

531
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:28,521
All yours.

532
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:29,708
You sure?

533
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:31,491
Okay.

534
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:33,060
Good.

535
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,021
Oh my God.

536
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:40,146
What's that?

537
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,105
Okay, students, may I just remind you?

538
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,037
You only have an hour left
until lights out.

539
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:58,412
So take a bath, get dressed,
brush your teeth, and pray.

540
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:02,163
We'll check that everyone's
in their assigned rooms after

541
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:04,563
so don't even think about
any funny business.

542
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,722
And once you're in your room,

543
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:09,955
after lights out, I don't want
to hear a single squeak.

544
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,230
You are not to roam the grounds.

545
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,146
Mads?

546
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:17,271
What if I need to pee?

547
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,646
Jude, keep quiet.

548
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:23,646
Students, I'm warning you.

549
00:32:24,288 --> 00:32:25,830
Don't try anything stupid.

550
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:30,846
Or I'll have you walk all the way back
to Manila as a form of penance.

551
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:32,663
Yes, Mads.

552
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:34,105
Okay. Now, go.

553
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,849
Yes! I can go to the bathroom.

554
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:41,552
Hurry up, girls! I'm gonna spring a leak!

555
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:44,870
Here we go!

556
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:46,185
Let's go.

557
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,121
You do it. Go on.

558
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:52,146
That's it.

559
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:53,855
Let's finish the whole bottle.

560
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,005
Alfred first, then counter-clockwise.

561
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,038
Going that way.

562
00:32:57,063 --> 00:32:58,997
All right, all right.

563
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,271
Hurry up! Ash is falling asleep.

564
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:03,576
Alfred's takes the first shot.

565
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:07,955
Hey!

566
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,545
Don't we have a chaser?

567
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,070
Finish all of it, dipshit.

568
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,583
You left a few drops.

569
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:18,708
That shot's for Mavic, Max.

570
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:24,701
Can you pass it to me?

571
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:29,365
Here, let's swap.

572
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,334
We can do this! Right, Gibo?

573
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,526
That's a tall shot.

574
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:34,698
Hey!

575
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,115
I'll go find something to munch on.
I'll be right back.

576
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,497
Sure, Gibo.

577
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:04,543
Ugh, fuck.

578
00:34:06,965 --> 00:34:08,974
Why did you leave so quickly?

579
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,168
Can we talk?

580
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,950
There's no one here.

581
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:15,997
All the teachers are in the lounge.
I checked.

582
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,938
Aren't we good now?

583
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,604
What do you want now?

584
00:34:20,997 --> 00:34:22,289
Just now, yeah.

585
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:28,216
But why did you ignore me
over the weekend?

586
00:34:28,563 --> 00:34:30,646
If mom didn't drive me to school,

587
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:32,452
you wouldn't even spare
me a glance or nothing.

588
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,239
What do you want from me?

589
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:39,865
To be and do what boyfriends do.

590
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,492
And what is that exactly?

591
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,146
To baby you?

592
00:34:46,563 --> 00:34:47,605
Look after you?

593
00:34:48,313 --> 00:34:52,646
Didn't you like me because
I'm so different from your exes?

594
00:34:53,063 --> 00:34:54,938
So here's different for you.

595
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,919
You're not being different, Lem.

596
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:59,781
You're being difficult.

597
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,391
Life's like that, Karla.

598
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,304
So you have to learn how to deal with it.

599
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:07,251
Besides, are you thick?

600
00:35:07,276 --> 00:35:09,234
I'm a graduating student,
don't you get that?

601
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:10,926
I gotta deal with my academic requirements

602
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:12,513
on top of my training.

603
00:35:12,538 --> 00:35:14,201
What don't you understand?

604
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:16,607
You know what?

605
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:18,938
I'm not gonna slow down
for you, Karla. Okay?

606
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,980
But I moved to this school for you!

607
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:23,982
Because of you!

608
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:28,177
Because you made me believe
it'll be good for us.

609
00:35:29,414 --> 00:35:31,331
Karla, news flash?

610
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:32,601
You chose that.

611
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:35,271
I didn't ask you to do that.

612
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,771
Okay? So don't ask for anything extra.

613
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:25,151
You weak shit!

614
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,826
More shots!

615
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:34,730
Did we finish the bottle yet?

616
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:38,451
Is this gone?
What is this?

617
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,284
The gin.

618
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:44,638
There's still some…

619
00:36:49,904 --> 00:36:50,904
There's still some...

620
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:51,705
Chaser.

621
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,938
The fuck, bro.

622
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:55,177
Shot. Let's have shots, both of us.

623
00:36:56,826 --> 00:36:57,855
Shot.

624
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:04,378
Whatever. Just drink.

625
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:09,938
Shot! Do it.

626
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:10,963
That's too much.

627
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:14,655
That's nothing. It's mixed with...
what is this?

628
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:23,011
Your turn.

629
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:25,294
What's your plan?

630
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:26,945
Am I the only one drinking here?

631
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,121
I plan to enjoy myself.

632
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:34,058
Enjoy to the max.

633
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:37,038
So no regrets, man.

634
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:39,693
Before adulting takes over my life.

635
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,093
Know what I mean? And also...

636
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:45,956
Once adulting swallows me whole,

637
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:48,177
I want it to choke.

638
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:57,278
Shot.

639
00:37:57,303 --> 00:37:58,303
Your turn.

640
00:37:58,896 --> 00:37:59,896
Wait.

641
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:05,284
You know what my plan is?

642
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:10,205
I plan to go with my parents' plan.

643
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,146
Okay?

644
00:38:12,063 --> 00:38:15,232
They have it all figured out
so I don't need to think about anything.

645
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:17,204
As if they'd let that happen.

646
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:21,246
As if they'd let me decide on my life.

647
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:22,365
Like I have a choice.

648
00:38:24,913 --> 00:38:26,455
Here, it's your shot.

649
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,855
I didn't understand
a single thing you said.

650
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,663
Let you?

651
00:38:31,688 --> 00:38:34,896
Let me be or do anything I want.

652
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:35,538
Okay.

653
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,188
I gotta be an achiever, no talk-backs,

654
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:41,921
get snappy, tighten up…

655
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:44,830
Sir, yes, sir!

656
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,021
Sir, yes, sir!

657
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:47,046
Sir!

658
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:51,919
Your turn.

659
00:38:51,944 --> 00:38:52,944
In my case...

660
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:00,177
No, really.

661
00:39:00,996 --> 00:39:02,038
What?

662
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:05,115
If your parents are strict towards you,

663
00:39:05,484 --> 00:39:07,026
mine are way too lax.

664
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,288
- Mm?
- It's true.

665
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,146
I swear.

666
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:10,005
Honest.

667
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,326
Really?

668
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:22,794
Because I am a product of a fun-loving,
liberated homosexual parents.

669
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,746
Oh.

670
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:26,480
I mean, don't get me wrong, man.

671
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:29,130
I'm proud of them--ouch! I'm proud of them.

672
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:34,597
But that's just how it is.
They're celebrated for being different.

673
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:41,313
So look at me, as different as could be.

674
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:48,685
I envy you.

675
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,422
- Why?
- It's so hard.

676
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:54,105
Why do you say that?

677
00:39:54,188 --> 00:39:57,261
Maybe it's hard for them, too.

678
00:39:57,286 --> 00:40:00,451
Yeah, you get it.

679
00:40:00,476 --> 00:40:03,021
I mean, they're probably having
a tough time deciding how tight

680
00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:06,388
or how loose they gotta be with us.

681
00:40:07,057 --> 00:40:08,307
Like this freaking drink.

682
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:11,605
I can't get the mix right.

683
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:15,980
You're right.

684
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:17,146
Yeah.

685
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:18,380
It's so bitter.

686
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,620
It is bitter.

687
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:53,813
Oh my God! Oh my God!

688
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:26,294
That's enough!

689
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:30,496
Hey!

690
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,951
Stop it!

691
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:38,481
You monsters!

692
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,130
Are you okay?

693
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,396
I'm gonna get kicked out for sure.

694
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:53,544
All my plans... Nothing.

695
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:55,500
They're all gone.

696
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:57,505
It's going to pass.

697
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:59,067
People are gonna forget about it.

698
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,029
Trust me, Issa.

699
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,627
There are worse things that can happen.

700
00:42:03,652 --> 00:42:07,443
Thanks. Am I supposed to be comforted?

701
00:42:08,438 --> 00:42:09,646
I don't know.

702
00:42:10,188 --> 00:42:11,188
Maybe.

703
00:42:13,605 --> 00:42:15,371
Seriously though, Karla.

704
00:42:15,396 --> 00:42:16,794
Thank you.

705
00:42:17,778 --> 00:42:19,487
Aren't you gonna report them?

706
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:22,271
The likes of them?

707
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:25,201
They're just going
to blow it out of proportion.

708
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,888
I'll think of something.

709
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:29,263
All right.

710
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:32,706
Just let me know if there's any way
I can help, okay?

711
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:34,669
Thank you.

712
00:42:40,355 --> 00:42:41,355
So.

713
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,258
Are you dating Gibo now?

714
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,021
Huh?

715
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:46,599
No.

716
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:48,363
Karla, where'd that come from?

717
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:50,302
Nothing.

718
00:42:50,883 --> 00:42:52,008
Just curious.

719
00:43:00,605 --> 00:43:01,730
What happened?

720
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,621
Hey. What happened to you?

721
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:05,688
Get dressed or the van's
going to leave you.

722
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:07,296
Ah. Right.

723
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:08,646
Hi, love.

724
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,146
You're wasted. Looks like you got beat.

725
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:11,938
What?

726
00:43:11,938 --> 00:43:15,013
Yeah, but why are you here?
Aren't girls--

727
00:43:15,038 --> 00:43:16,605
Ah, I crashed in their room.

728
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,505
You know me, one of the girls.

729
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:21,380
And me? Be crushed by the system? No way.

730
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:23,434
No way.

731
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,480
No way.

732
00:43:25,622 --> 00:43:27,813
You're right. You're right.
There's no way.

733
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,896
Did it ever cross your mind
to give me a try?

734
00:43:29,896 --> 00:43:30,271
No.

735
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:32,813
Because you're not meant
to be used or tried out, Issa.

736
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:35,538
You're not just a phase or a quick shag.

737
00:43:35,563 --> 00:43:36,938
That's it! Oh, yes!

738
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:37,896
Oh! Oh! More!

739
00:43:37,896 --> 00:43:46,021
Address your students properly
whomever he or she may be.

740
00:43:46,046 --> 00:43:48,938
Harmon! Who here thinks
they can take me on?

741
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:50,909
I challenge you!

742
00:43:51,192 --> 00:43:52,550
Woo!

743
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,855
Your eyes are puffy.

744
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
Look at me.

745
00:44:04,766 --> 00:44:06,497
What did you see

746
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:09,544
that night at the retreat?
