1
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,991
Harmon High, I want to serve you.

2
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:11,825
This is not something you'll get
through on your own.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,271
I won't be on my own.

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,558
You'll be here, right?

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,324
Who are you dating?

6
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,294
Is it that slut, Issa?

7
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,741
Do you prefer her over me?

8
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:21,766
Yes, fine!

9
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:24,408
Issa!

10
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,622
I think you should break it off with Gibo.

11
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:27,849
Why?

12
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:29,308
Are you jealous?

13
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,658
Are you really just messing with me?

14
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:33,141
You want to ruin my life?

15
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:34,771
Answer me!

16
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:36,731
I wonder where you're hiding…

17
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:42,933
Wes!

18
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:44,825
Help! Emergency!

19
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:47,172
Let's break up!

20
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,583
Yes, Aunt Margaux.

21
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,903
Thank you for remembering me.
Yes, ma'am.

22
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,558
We'll take care of Karla, okay?

23
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,747
Ciao!

24
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,408
Am I really stuck in this
hospital for today's video?

25
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:01,867
I've been called back here
over and over.

26
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:03,247
You were here earlier?

27
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:07,533
Yes! Aunt Carmi!
It's your honorary son speaking.

28
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:09,505
Yes, ma'am. Yes!

29
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:12,866
Overnight with Gibo?
Yes, yes! Okay, Auntie.

30
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:14,653
Love you. Bye!

31
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:16,028
And go. Spill.

32
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:20,366
Nothing. They were talking
then Karla just fainted.

33
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:21,391
Seriously?

34
00:01:22,418 --> 00:01:24,216
Fine!

35
00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:26,427
I said something I shouldn't

36
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:30,449
because Gibo's so clueless
he doesn't know he's being duped.

37
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:33,116
So he got angry at Karla
and yelled at her.

38
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:35,783
That's when Karla suddenly fainted.

39
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:37,058
Wes, I don't...

40
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,824
Calm down. Calm down.

41
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,771
Shit! Is this on me? What the hell is
going on? Why'd she fall all of a sudden?

42
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:46,824
She's not the only one who fell, is she?

43
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,266
What about you?

44
00:01:50,283 --> 00:01:53,866
Okay, we can't do anything anyway
because we can't go in there.

45
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:55,908
We won't be able to drink, eat, sleep.

46
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,308
So I suggest we get some
rest and get our strength back.

47
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,241
Okay? Let's just go.
Let's say goodbye.

48
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:02,266
Okay.

49
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:07,849
Gibo, we'll go ahead.

50
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:09,013
All right, come on.

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,241
Bye.

52
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:12,114
Bye. Take care.

53
00:02:56,365 --> 00:03:01,740
Students, you all know very well
how we value life in this institution.

54
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:04,052
All forms of life.

55
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:08,408
Lord please forgive me,
I have one exception.

56
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:09,729
I hate...

57
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:13,699
And you can quote me here...
I hate rodents with a passion.

58
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:18,991
So whoever took that guinea pig,
if you could please return it this instant.

59
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:20,044
We don't want an infestation.

60
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,533
Lord, deliver us...
Deliver me from this cursed vermin!

61
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:29,700
Whoever did this, better confess now.

62
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:37,294
Or not. I'm getting the CCTV checked
and I will find the culprit soon enough.

63
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:39,196
And I will make sure of that.

64
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:40,834
By the way,

65
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:45,606
our Foundation Day's
coming up! It's jubilation.

66
00:03:58,516 --> 00:04:01,308
- Hurry up!
- I'm going as fast as I can.

67
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,599
It stinks!

68
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:07,957
You're so fussy.

69
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:11,763
Loop, it stinks, right?

70
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,408
I'm getting anxious.

71
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:14,763
I can't take this.

72
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:17,533
Okay, fine. We're gonna deal with it.

73
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:20,741
Yeah, and I can't have
a stinky locker!

74
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,366
I don't like this, bestie.

75
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:24,841
I said we'll deal with it.

76
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,597
So we're going to commit guinea-cide?

77
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,458
Not you, this person.

78
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:34,685
- Why me?
- Just do it.

79
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:37,738
After class. Clear?

80
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,891
Okay.

81
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:43,866
Let's go.

82
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,183
Wait, I need to lock it.

83
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:46,391
Hurry up!

84
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:51,766
Vanguard, we are pleased to announce...

85
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:54,099
No, to confirm the expected,

86
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:57,810
give it up for our new
batch rep, Mavic Lagdameo!

87
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,266
Yeah!

88
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:02,558
Congrats!

89
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:05,860
Thanks, guys.

90
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,669
So, when's the victory party?

91
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,520
Let's wait for the official announcement.

92
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:15,449
Mads says she'll proclaim
the winner on Foundation Day.

93
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:16,646
Look your best, guys.

94
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:19,266
And by the way, congrats again, Mavic.

95
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:22,558
Thank you. Thanks, guys.

96
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,669
We did it!

97
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:25,224
High five!

98
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:26,599
Congrats!

99
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:27,741
Congrats! Congrats!

100
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:28,981
Super proud.

101
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:31,857
Luke, thank you.

102
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:34,425
You deserve it, Mavic.

103
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,977
Thank you.

104
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:42,474
Guys, congrats.

105
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:48,366
But since Mavic won,
we need to be consistent.

106
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:52,933
So now would be the best
time to discuss our future plans.

107
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:53,958
Right?

108
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,591
Karla. How are you?

109
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:28,783
How are you feeling?

110
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:29,891
I'm okay.

111
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:40,533
Good morning. We've identified
the reason behind your fainting spell,

112
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:42,116
why your anemia's getting worse,

113
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,708
and your low energy.

114
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,808
Ms. Sanchez, there is
a parasite in your body.

115
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,491
What?

116
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:53,450
Yes, but don't worry. I think
it's going to come out cute.

117
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:55,911
This is for confirmation.

118
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,047
It will probably be out of your system
in about six or seven months.

119
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,074
Doc, sorry. What are you saying?

120
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,974
And you must be the father.

121
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,974
- Doc, does that mean?
- Yes.

122
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,391
She's pregnant. Congratulations.

123
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:20,891
I'll leave you to it.

124
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,169
Are you sure it was taken?

125
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:36,810
Maybe it escaped?

126
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,433
The cage is missing, too, sister.

127
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,308
That's why you shouldn't
have experiments like that.

128
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:44,974
Stop.

129
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,433
Pause there.

130
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:48,558
Right there.

131
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:50,622
Isn't that them?

132
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,016
This one looks like
they're carrying something.

133
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:55,976
But it's blurry.

134
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,224
It could be a cage, right?

135
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,266
Who are they?

136
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:02,516
Suspicious.

137
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,724
They entered the building
after class hours.

138
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,060
Issa, have you seen any seniors that
stay behind aside from you and Gibo?

139
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,974
No, Mads.

140
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,513
But this one looks familiar.

141
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:19,310
I just can't remember
where I've seen him.

142
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:28,797
Sorry, Karla. I shouldn't
have been rough with you.

143
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,599
And don't worry, I'll face Auntie.

144
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,266
And your Papa.

145
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,266
I'll take responsbility.

146
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:41,016
You don't need to do that.

147
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:43,224
I need to.

148
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:47,183
And this time, you won't
be able to stop me, Karla.

149
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:48,766
Yes, I can.

150
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:51,641
Gibo, don't get ahead of yourself.

151
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:55,302
Why?

152
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:02,974
Karla, what's the matter?

153
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,266
Are you made of stone?
Are you a robot?

154
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,350
Why doesn't this seem
like a big deal to you?

155
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,352
Don't you know how major this is?

156
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,410
I'm missing a medium?

157
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,803
I think you're a size small.

158
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:17,074
I always keep an extra just in case.

159
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,349
For allowance.

160
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,374
Want some?

161
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:24,449
Crisis? Karla, what's
really going on with you?

162
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:26,891
Don’t ask. Something.

163
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,808
I'm just scared.

164
00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:32,479
I'm scared that this time,
if I get it wrong,

165
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:33,909
nobody will be there to catch me.

166
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:34,933
Sorry.

167
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,364
But I can adjust for you.

168
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,474
I'm pushing you away
because I don't like you.

169
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:41,641
There's someone else I like.
Get it now?

170
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:44,115
How long have you known?

171
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,356
A while.

172
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,059
If it isn't mine, whose is it?

173
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:54,630
You'll find out soon.

174
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,891
He's on his way.

175
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:17,177
Why are you here?
This is my spot.

176
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:18,512
I was just joking, hey.

177
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:23,818
Sorry.

178
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:27,497
I just don't like crowded places.

179
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:30,294
Okay, you can crash here for now.

180
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,792
So, you still good?

181
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:43,504
I'm not sure.

182
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:50,949
I don't even remember
the last time I smiled.

183
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:57,091
No, I do. When I picked flowers for you.

184
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:02,099
From the neighbor.
And I barely escaped their dog.

185
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:10,849
No, no, I mean…
that was for a project.

186
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:14,599
Hunter, I already know.

187
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:21,528
And thank you, because I get
my strength from your letters.

188
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:25,141
Thanks for your neighbors' flowers, too.

189
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:31,516
For the record, are you
courting me or just showing off?

190
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:39,474
I don't know. I just found myself
going back to that memory.

191
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,541
When we were at the rooftop.

192
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,483
I keep wishing,

193
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:46,388
that I make you happy the way
you made me happy that time.

194
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:52,349
What about you, what's your wish?

195
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:56,391
I wish we find Cheesy soon.

196
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,762
Hang on, any updates on that?

197
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,683
We saw people wearing
matching hoodies in the CCTV.

198
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:12,901
But hello, everyone's twinning
and three-ning these days.

199
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:14,919
So it's not much of a lead.

200
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:17,868
Wait, check your IJ.

201
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:20,141
Just try it. Go on.

202
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,867
Go to Gia's page.

203
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:29,641
Okay, so she bought
the same brand of hoodie?

204
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,433
- So what?
- Not that.

205
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:33,864
Not that. Try her story.

206
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,138
Under Clique highlights.

207
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,511
Same hoodie!

208
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,211
I told you I was right.

209
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:46,245
Jude has it, too.

210
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:58,664
Excuse me?

211
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,974
Sir Lem?

212
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:06,349
Thank you for what you did.

213
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:08,374
I know you have a lot of questions.

214
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:10,224
But can we hold it off for now?

215
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:12,833
Let's think about Karla's condition first.

216
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:15,683
I'll take it from here. Okay?

217
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,070
You may go.

218
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:20,158
"You may go"? Are we in class?

219
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:21,724
Like "you're dismissed"?

220
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,458
But fine. Karla chose you.

221
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,333
Issa, I need your help!

222
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:36,974
Help me with Mavic!

223
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:41,442
Hold on. I'll help you, I promise.

224
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,911
Just give me a sec.

225
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:44,328
What are you doing?

226
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:46,441
Contact tracing.

227
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:48,758
We're looking at the
suspects who took Cheesy.

228
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,208
Ah, the petnappers.

229
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:58,183
Shit, there's no tag.

230
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,367
What's with that hashtag?

231
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:01,935
Work at the faculty room?

232
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:05,066
No, no, no. Werq at work.

233
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:07,563
The... What's that called?

234
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:10,317
The workshop at the back.
Where the ciggie gang hangs out.

235
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:11,949
There's such a place?

236
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:12,974
Yeah.

237
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:14,677
Let me see.

238
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,261
Stop already.

239
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:22,380
Take another one.

240
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:24,403
- It's blurred.
- Hurry up!

241
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,013
Can I see, Loop?

242
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,033
- I'm not cute there!
- She's not cute.

243
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:29,974
One more.

244
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,333
Hurry up.

245
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,391
- Okay.
- Perfect.

246
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:39,481
Okay, Jude. You know what to do.

247
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:41,599
Are you sure about this, Gia?

248
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:45,185
We might make a mess

249
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:48,478
then the blood overflows!

250
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:50,185
My God, ew!

251
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,724
Did you bring a plastic or something?

252
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:56,016
Sure, Gia.

253
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:01,433
I mean look at me.
I woke up like this.

254
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:05,630
And I thought, I'm going
to kill a rat today.

255
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:08,685
I should bring a plastic!

256
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:11,231
Why, of course!

257
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:13,724
I got nothing.

258
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:17,366
What if we just flush it down a toilet?

259
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:19,708
No. It's just going to clog.

260
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:21,427
Let's just do it.

261
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:22,833
Now.

262
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,558
Whoa!

263
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:29,047
- What the hell?
- Cheesy!

264
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,088
Don't hurt Cheesy!

265
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,231
And why not?

266
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:39,153
You took Hunter.
I take your rat.

267
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:41,224
Sounds fair, right?

268
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:44,808
I didn't take him from you.
We're not a thing!

269
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:46,016
You're not?

270
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:49,491
Then why are you always together?

271
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,435
What, you just became instant BFFs?

272
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,036
What could Hunter possibly
need from you?

273
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,349
Shit, no reaction.

274
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:03,266
Look at you.

275
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:06,099
You can't even defend yourself, Issa.

276
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,512
- Jude.
- Yeah?

277
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,427
Issa saw me being harassed by coach!

278
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:29,153
Mr. Nolasco.

279
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:31,724
What are you doing?

280
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,433
You startled me.

281
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:40,128
Sorry I was just trying to make you smile.

282
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:43,372
Obviously not effective.

283
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:45,408
Are you all right?

284
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,833
My teacher got my first love pregnant!

285
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:50,037
I'm totally fine...
Of course not!

286
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:51,419
I was embarrassed to tell you.

287
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:53,683
Feelings are whirling inside me

288
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:55,446
and I want to explode, but…

289
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:58,117
I'm afraid that if that happens,

290
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:01,766
I might not recover.

291
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,755
There, you just shared what happened.

292
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,403
If this hadn't happened to Cheesy…

293
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,341
I'm sorry, Hunter.

294
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,349
I'm so sorry.

295
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:16,268
You're not disgusted?

296
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:19,363
Never.

297
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:22,783
Guys, if there's someone
who deserves to be drilled,

298
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:27,214
it's not the guinea pig,
but that pig of a coach, Coach Tanyag!

299
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,783
We need to charge him!

300
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,016
Let's start a movement.

301
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,308
Hashtag I Am Hunter.

302
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,574
Why? Why?

303
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,974
Will it be that easy?

304
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,391
I think he'll be able to deny it.

305
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:41,864
Jude's right.

306
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,528
We need a strong evidence.

307
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,991
Where are we gonna get that?

308
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:49,808
Honey, honey. Dirty people,

309
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,075
they always leave some dirt behind.

310
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,435
Yes.

311
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,508
Guys, are you sure about this?

312
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:00,491
If it doesn't work,
you'll be dragged in this.

313
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:02,933
We don't mind!

314
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,294
Hunter, I won't let him
get away with this.

315
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:08,533
If it comes to that, so be it.

316
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:09,896
Right, girls?

317
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:12,106
I choose violence.

318
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:16,199
You're gonna make an effort for me?

319
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:17,474
Of course!

320
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:18,683
We'll do it for Gia.

321
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,949
Guys, this is for Hunter.
Let's put in goodie points for heaven!

322
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:23,999
- For Hunter!
- For Hunter!

323
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:26,074
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

324
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:27,558
Quit fooling around!

325
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,692
I just got carried away, girl!

326
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:31,950
This is for you.

327
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:34,747
Coach better be ready.

328
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:37,438
Pregnant?

329
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:41,097
She's known it for a while.

330
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:45,231
That's what she meant when
she said she was just using me.

331
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,167
A front. A cover story for her secret.

332
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,614
I thought back to
everything that's happened.

333
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:55,981
All the signs were there.

334
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,739
I was just too stupid
not to notice any of them.

335
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,224
Gibo.

336
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,817
Don't be so hard on yourself.

337
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:07,122
The worst thing about this is,

338
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:11,099
I kept choosing Karla
even if I knew it was wrong.

339
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,397
Even if someone else
was getting hurt by it.

340
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,005
Because I was so blind.

341
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:21,270
What I utterly regret is.

342
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:26,683
I turned my back on the person
who was always there for me

343
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,616
in favor of someone who
treated me like I was nothing.

344
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:32,060
Then say sorry.

345
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,349
Let her hear all of these.

346
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:38,508
How important she is,

347
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:44,481
how broken you are, or how wrong.

348
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,341
I know her.

349
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,901
I'm not sure she'll let me
into her world again.

350
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,700
But you know yourself more.

351
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:58,516
You know that
not making it up with Issa,

352
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:00,266
will haunt you forever.

353
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,302
If she cares for you as
much as you do for her,

354
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:07,138
Issa will forgive you.

355
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:11,308
I hope so. I hope she
gives me another chance.

356
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,808
Because after all that she's been through,

357
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,875
I want to be the one
to be there for her.

358
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:25,909
What is it?

359
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:31,583
You sounded just like
you did back then.

360
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,162
And you were saying
the same words back then.

361
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:38,622
But about your ex.

362
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:40,263
Really?

363
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:43,495
Yes. Did it not resonate?

364
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:53,247
If that's the case, I guess you're
over your ex even before you knew it.

365
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:56,786
All these just made it clear.

366
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:01,581
Heartbreaks, lies,

367
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:06,060
cover-ups, a pregnancy…

368
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:09,458
It's Issa you're feeling for, Gibo.

369
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:22,891
Okay, so is this the setup
of what happened?

370
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:24,683
Yes.

371
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,903
Okay, wait a minute.

372
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:29,625
Issa, help me with the framing.

373
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,857
Like that. Wait, go a bit higher.

374
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:34,849
Like that. That's it.

375
00:21:34,997 --> 00:21:38,005
Hunter, could you please
tell us what happened.

376
00:21:39,237 --> 00:21:42,724
I was standing like this,
leaning against the table.

377
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:44,241
Coach was seated in front of me

378
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:45,683
holding down my legs.

379
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,574
And then?

380
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,349
Then he slowly pulled down my shorts.

381
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,390
All right, all right.

382
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:52,624
Loop, please check the door.
Make sure no one gets in.

383
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:53,616
Jude?

384
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:54,474
Nobody's snooping?

385
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,416
Can you play coach?

386
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,408
Ah, me as coach?

387
00:21:58,433 --> 00:21:59,074
Okay, sure.

388
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,974
Issa, please check the frame again.

389
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:01,908
Yes, that's right.

390
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,919
I'm up for this. Oh my gosh.

391
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:05,236
- How should I do? Like this?
- Hey, stop playing.

392
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,266
Jude.

393
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,949
No, Jude. That's not it.

394
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:10,533
- How about this?
- Kneel. Kneel in front of him.

395
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:11,516
Jude.

396
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,990
You have to be kneeling.

397
00:22:14,523 --> 00:22:16,365
- The other way, shithead.
- No. You.

398
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,849
Ah, me?

399
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:19,783
Okay, just keep going.

400
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:20,908
Issa, how's this?

401
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:24,849
He was slowly pulling my shorts down.

402
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:27,058
Jude, do what he says
so we can see it on frame.

403
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,349
Shit.

404
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:30,516
There. And then?

405
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:35,516
That's it. Then I saw coach's head moving.

406
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:39,308
Jude! Move your head!

407
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,183
Okay. Go on, Issa.

408
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:44,099
So that's the frame, and the lighting.

409
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:47,016
Did you hear any sounds?
It was in the office, right?

410
00:22:47,474 --> 00:22:48,766
Yeah, but it was a bit dark in there.

411
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:50,575
All right. I've got an idea.
I know what we'll do.

412
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,866
I've got it.

413
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:52,919
Jude.

414
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:54,474
Jude.

415
00:22:55,543 --> 00:23:00,699
I know how we're going to
catch coach with his pants down.

416
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:04,058
Me and the whole alter world.

417
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:07,033
Okay? Come, let's huddle.

418
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:09,021
Come on, let's huddle over here.

419
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:18,602
Issa, let's talk please.
Hey. Where are you?

420
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,011
Ah, shit.

421
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:39,449
Going down on boys is his favorite kink.

422
00:23:39,474 --> 00:23:43,366
He likes to take secret
videos of him doing the deed.

423
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:46,832
And the elements are always the same.

424
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:50,482
It's always dark, and after he blows them,

425
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:53,199
he stands up with his back on the camera,

426
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:56,533
goes around his victim
and licks their nape.

427
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,558
Presenting guys, the
new spawn of Mang Kanor.

428
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,916
Papa Blink!

429
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:03,558
Will that be enough?

430
00:24:03,683 --> 00:24:06,116
In all the videos,
we can't see his face.

431
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:07,074
Right.

432
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:10,683
No, it's not enough but
we can still catch him using a trap.

433
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:11,699
A decoy.

434
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:13,699
Decoy being me.

435
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:14,974
- You?
- Yeah.

436
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:16,183
Wes, don't do it.

437
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:19,646
You can't do that. I don't want
someone else to go through that.

438
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:21,921
Well, they won't work.
Coach isn't into girls.

439
00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:23,193
Jude?

440
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:26,505
Sorry, but you're not
a great fit either.

441
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,412
Guys, don't worry about me, okay?

442
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:32,516
We're going to hang him
upside down. Okay?

443
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:35,866
For Hunter.

444
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,849
For Hunter.

445
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:38,130
For Hunter.

446
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:41,699
For Hunter!

447
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:42,658
We can do this!

448
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:43,641
Thank you, guys.

449
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,666
You're welcome, dude.

450
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:56,872
Bye!

451
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:59,866
We said we'd go at the same time!

452
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:00,833
Just go ahead!

453
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:02,293
We said no going ahead.

454
00:25:02,318 --> 00:25:03,474
Issa, I'm here!

455
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:04,499
Shit!

456
00:25:04,693 --> 00:25:05,693
Shut the hell up!

457
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:08,183
You're making a racket.

458
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:10,130
How's Cheesy?

459
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:12,888
He's fine. I'm taking him home.

460
00:25:13,974 --> 00:25:17,183
At least nobody will hurt you
at home, right, Cheesy?

461
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:21,849
You're welcome there
and people like you.

462
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:24,154
What if I like her too?

463
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:27,349
We've been together for hours.

464
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,376
Shouldn't that be the
first thing you tell me?

465
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:37,239
I was feeling dizzy earlier.

466
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:43,879
And I guess I was
just happy to see you.

467
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,560
I mean, they already know…

468
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:52,146
Wes, Issa, Gibo.

469
00:25:53,313 --> 00:25:57,074
I don't know what to do
or what will happen.

470
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:02,029
But Lem, raising your voice
isn't helping so please, don't.

471
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:04,458
Who else knows about that?

472
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:06,953
And when did you find out?

473
00:26:08,732 --> 00:26:10,266
After summer?

474
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:13,107
A month, maybe two?

475
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:17,778
Shit...

476
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:26,549
Sorry.

477
00:26:29,683 --> 00:26:32,849
I'm just shocked as you are.
I'm not in the right state of mind either.

478
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:36,333
But Karla,

479
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,136
forgive me.

480
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:43,391
Sorry.

481
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:47,887
I'm here for you. Okay?

482
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:50,891
Thank you.

483
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,933
I'm sorry about that.

484
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:02,058
I'm here for you until we
get this dealt with, okay?

485
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:05,308
Dealt with?

486
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:10,724
Yes, I'll go with you.

487
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:13,266
To abort the baby.

488
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,747
You like to what?

489
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:26,122
I want to make it up to you.

490
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:30,005
To take care of what we've started.

491
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:34,141
I want to make up for all the times
I said the wrong thing.

492
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,195
The times that I…

493
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:38,451
took for granted.

494
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:42,062
I was too focused on
chasing after the past,

495
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:44,951
I didn't notice how beautiful,

496
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:49,025
and how valuable the
one that's in front of me.

497
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:53,143
You talk too much.

498
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:56,021
Fine, we can take turns caring for Cheesy.

499
00:27:56,302 --> 00:27:58,474
You can come visit at home anyway.

500
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,747
Like I live so far away.

501
00:28:01,477 --> 00:28:02,574
Huh?

502
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,724
Hotdog.

503
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:04,749
Come on.

504
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:07,787
The heck did she say?

505
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,390
After I bared my heart to her, that's it?

506
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:12,396
- I don't get a reaction?
- You're a dumbass, Issa.

507
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:14,951
Just an egg… or hotdog, rather.

508
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:18,533
Did she turn me down?
I don't get it.

509
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:19,933
I wanna go down.

510
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:23,403
What?

511
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:25,669
I want out.

512
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,558
Out of this relationship!

513
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,683
Out of your gaslighting,
your manipulation!

514
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:34,597
You're a giant red flag
I should have noticed long ago!

515
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:38,058
I'll take care of myself!
Of the baby!

516
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:40,474
Where the fuck are you going?

517
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:41,841
Karla!

518
00:28:42,141 --> 00:28:43,779
Karla! Fuck!

519
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:08,693
Ah, good evening, sir.

520
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:10,638
Well, Max, good evening to you.

521
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:13,287
What brings you here?

522
00:29:13,943 --> 00:29:15,591
Man, you're really handsome!

523
00:29:16,949 --> 00:29:18,908
I remember when I was your age,

524
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:21,232
I looked exactly the same!

525
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:23,206
Who are you here for?

526
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:24,942
Is Mavic here?

527
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:27,060
Ah, yes. Hang on.

528
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,505
Mavic!

529
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:30,932
Mavic, darling!

530
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:35,177
Mavic?

531
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:36,533
Daddy.

532
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:37,716
Here she is.

533
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:43,442
Okay, dad, could you leave us for a while?

534
00:29:44,968 --> 00:29:47,880
Sure. Take your time.

535
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:48,905
Okay, sir.

536
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:15,826
I just wanted to say congratulations.

537
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,943
And I wanted to say sorry.

538
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:22,490
Mavic,

539
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:28,138
when I said it's me,
not you, I was serious.

540
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:32,753
Nothing's wrong with you,
nothing missing.

541
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:35,974
Actually, you're great.

542
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:42,870
You're the most generous,
kindest person who came into my life.

543
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:47,433
I'm the one at fault.

544
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,599
I'm the one with broken parts.

545
00:30:57,183 --> 00:30:58,683
You know what Max,

546
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:02,724
you're not broken.

547
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:10,396
It's not a defect,
it's just your gender.

548
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:14,435
Still, it hurt you.

549
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:24,037
You and Wes. I know how
special he is to you and you to him.

550
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:28,239
And he's right. He's innocent.

551
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,846
I'm the one...

552
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,016
I'm the one with feelings for him.

553
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:37,849
And I'm the one who made a move.

554
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:44,683
It's the first time I
freely expressed myself,

555
00:31:47,516 --> 00:31:51,701
to follow how I feel...
and this happened.

556
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:57,265
So please, Mavic.

557
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:03,308
If you cannot forgive me,

558
00:32:04,565 --> 00:32:06,840
at least please, forgive Wes.

559
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:12,630
I don't want to ruin
what you guys have.

560
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,974
I don't want you to lose someone special.

561
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:24,016
That's not me.

562
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,786
Goodbye, love.

563
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:04,316
Mavs? I'm sorry.

564
00:33:07,256 --> 00:33:08,376
Hi Papa Blink!

565
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:13,490
Looking for gig, message me
for full video, or meet up!

566
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:14,552
Teaser

567
00:33:17,151 --> 00:33:18,590
I left right away, of course.

568
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,224
It was awkward.

569
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:25,302
In my mind, he was my cool teacher.

570
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:29,855
It's a little weird to think
he's the father of Karla's baby.

571
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,266
How's Karla?

572
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:35,474
She was still a bit faint
when I left.

573
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:37,058
Same old Karla.

574
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,130
Quiet.

575
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,974
I can't imagine what she's
going through, you know?

576
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:45,141
I mean, it's so sad.
She's feeling so vulnerable.

577
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:48,849
And if you think about
how Sir Lem is treating her.

578
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:52,456
So you should be
a good friend to her.

579
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:55,064
Do you really mean that?

580
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:57,480
Aren't you always against her?

581
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:59,159
This is different, duh.

582
00:33:59,224 --> 00:34:00,909
This is a big deal!

583
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:04,027
At least you have me.

584
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:08,183
She needs a real friend
now more than ever.

585
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,891
Guys, the thirst trap is set.

586
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:54,064
Wait, what did you say
just now? Say it again.

587
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,991
I said she needs
a real friend right now.

588
00:34:57,016 --> 00:34:58,391
No, before that.

589
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:33,449
Hello, Wes.

590
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:35,199
Bro, bro. Where are you?

591
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:36,366
Home. Why?

592
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:39,391
Check out Karla's post. Sounds like
she's gonna do something. Hurry!

593
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,165
He said I should look at her post.

594
00:35:52,911 --> 00:35:53,911
Gibo!

595
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:55,521
Is everything okay?

596
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:58,357
The help says there's an emergency.

597
00:35:58,724 --> 00:35:59,849
What is it?

598
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,558
And why are you here this late?

599
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:05,041
Everything's okay, Auntie.
I just needed something from Karla.

600
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,266
Huh? Okay.

601
00:36:08,058 --> 00:36:09,849
If it's that important.

602
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:11,516
Just make it quick.

603
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,891
Before her daddy gets home.

604
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:14,074
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

605
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,099
Thank you.

606
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:20,899
Gibo.

607
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:28,891
So you weren't planning something?

608
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:31,266
No.

609
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:35,058
What's with your goodbye post then?

610
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:39,393
I just said goodbye to my small uniform.

611
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,987
Next week I'll need to start using medium.

612
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:44,474
Because of this.

613
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:50,683
I'm glad you didn't consider...

614
00:36:52,183 --> 00:36:54,474
Does Auntie know?

615
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:01,349
I don't know how to tell her.

616
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:05,433
I don't know if I have the strength to.

617
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,308
Gibo,

618
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:11,099
I don't know if I can do it.

619
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:19,612
If you feel weak,
just stay on your feet.

620
00:37:20,683 --> 00:37:22,058
I'll hold you up.

621
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:27,433
Why? Why are you so kind to me?

622
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,599
I did nothing but hurt you.

623
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:32,974
I told you, didn't I?

624
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:35,224
I'll take responsibility.

625
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:52,596
Ma, I'm sorry.

626
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:01,477
Gibo…

627
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:07,942
Sweetie...

628
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:12,349
Why?

629
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:16,433
Why?

630
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,474
Come here.

631
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,099
Come here.

632
00:38:56,641 --> 00:38:57,641
Max.

633
00:39:01,526 --> 00:39:03,683
Finally called me by my name, Dad?

634
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:06,808
Does Mama know?

635
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:16,589
What you saw...

636
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:22,521
A man who lost a fight a long time ago

637
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,474
and is still losing.

638
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:27,974
Dad,

639
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,458
it doesn't have to be this way.

640
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:34,433
It has to.

641
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:36,253
Even if it hurts?

642
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:39,808
Even if I go through the same thing?

643
00:39:42,974 --> 00:39:45,683
What if we go easy on each other?

644
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:48,433
Try to be at ease.

645
00:39:49,308 --> 00:39:50,997
You're not my superior.

646
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,224
I'm no soldier.

647
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:00,974
We're family, Daddy.

648
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:50,516
And I am more than happy

649
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:54,458
that the rodent has been found.

650
00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:56,283
I just have an announcement.

651
00:40:56,308 --> 00:41:00,591
Mr. Lemuel Cordova will no
longer be part of the faculty

652
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:03,391
as he will be indisposed indefinitely.

653
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:08,308
But on a happier note, our student
council elections was a success.

654
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:14,516
So let's all welcome our
new batch representative,

655
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:17,771
Ms. Maria Victoria Lagdameo.

656
00:41:21,474 --> 00:41:22,474
Thank you, Mads.

657
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:25,224
Hi, guys!

658
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:32,933
First of all, thank you everyone
for your trust and support.

659
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:35,933
You're the best!

660
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:40,866
You have no idea how grateful I am because

661
00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:43,146
even though I made a mess of my speech,

662
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:48,021
you still understood what I meant,
recognized the sincerity

663
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:50,820
and sense in my words.

664
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:53,401
Things may have been
weird for me last time,

665
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,933
but today my heart and
mind are happy and at peace.

666
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:00,271
I promise, it's all good from here on out.

667
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:05,933
I've recovered and ready to fight for you!

668
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,224
Go, Mavic!

669
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:17,474
Should we keep everyone waiting?
It's time to party!

670
00:42:26,974 --> 00:42:27,974
Hey.

671
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:29,559
What are you doing there?

672
00:42:30,778 --> 00:42:33,935
Why aren't you joining
the festivities outside?

673
00:42:34,036 --> 00:42:35,833
Nothing, just tidying up.

674
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:37,766
My work here is done.

675
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:39,891
We have a new batch rep.

676
00:42:41,872 --> 00:42:43,426
What do you mean by 'done'?

677
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:46,016
We still have lots to do, right?

678
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:47,074
Yep.

679
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,058
But you'll be busy with the council.

680
00:42:49,141 --> 00:42:51,841
And I'll be focusing on recruitment.

681
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:55,283
Luke, I'm worried.

682
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:56,308
Why?

683
00:42:56,419 --> 00:42:58,669
I'm not sure if I'm ready to be on my own.

684
00:42:59,558 --> 00:43:01,808
Of course you are. You can do it.

685
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:05,785
Besides, you have Max, right?

686
00:43:09,016 --> 00:43:10,641
Oh, I get it.

687
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,599
Sorry.

688
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:14,099
It's okay.

689
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:18,183
If you're not together anymore,

690
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:20,366
are you open to be...

691
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:21,391
Yes.

692
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:23,458
Shit.

693
00:43:23,808 --> 00:43:26,263
Oh, shit. Here I go again. Sorry, sorry.

694
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:30,141
I know you were going to say
something else but I interrupted you.

695
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,599
Oh, shit. Can I do this? Oh my gosh.

696
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:37,891
Let's rewind, all right? And...

697
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:49,141
I was saying...

698
00:43:50,016 --> 00:43:51,891
Are you open to be my girlfriend?

699
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,641
Sorry if I'm too straightforward.

700
00:43:53,933 --> 00:43:57,849
I take my chance to win whenever possible.

701
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:01,308
Sorry if I'm going too fast.

702
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:02,641
You think that's fast?

703
00:44:38,183 --> 00:44:39,183
Mavs?

704
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:43,016
Impossible.

705
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:48,574
Meet me? This is for real.

706
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:49,599
Where?

707
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:52,791
At the jail booth.

708
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,683
I surprised you, didn't I?

709
00:45:08,448 --> 00:45:10,052
Surprise me later.

710
00:45:10,433 --> 00:45:11,903
You won't regret it.

711
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:17,786
Don't get too excited, Papa Blink.

712
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,060
Yes.

713
00:45:32,452 --> 00:45:33,483
Stop it.

714
00:45:33,508 --> 00:45:35,500
You have big muscles.

715
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:40,266
Sports does that to you.

716
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:46,033
Let's play later.

717
00:45:46,058 --> 00:45:47,930
Somebody might see this.

718
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:49,790
Let's do it in the office.

719
00:45:50,198 --> 00:45:53,735
Office? So kinky.

720
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:58,641
But I don't play like that. Bitch.

721
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:08,118
Papa's finished.

722
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:13,116
You're done. The whole school
knows you're Papa_Blink

723
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:16,415
because you are the star for today's video!

724
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,505
What the hell is this?

725
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:20,783
Hey, uncuff me.

726
00:46:20,808 --> 00:46:22,360
What the hell. Get me out of here.

727
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:23,864
Okay.

728
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,391
There.

729
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,954
You know what, forget it.
You asshole.

730
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:34,008
I hate you.

731
00:46:36,868 --> 00:46:40,008
Mr. Tanyag, you'd better come with us.

732
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:42,491
Sir.

733
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:46,516
Okay, I'm innocent.
This is just a set-up. Okay?

734
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:47,985
Okay, bye-bye.

735
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:52,008
I don't need to be cuffed.

736
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:55,274
I don't need handcuffs, okay?
I'm innocent...

737
00:46:55,891 --> 00:46:56,891
Hey!

738
00:46:57,308 --> 00:46:59,219
I'll sue you!

739
00:47:01,297 --> 00:47:04,860
I'll sue you! You little shit.

740
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,574
Solid.

741
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,625
Eternal damnation.

742
00:47:10,824 --> 00:47:11,824
Okay, guys. Everything cool?

743
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:12,696
Enjoy?

744
00:47:12,736 --> 00:47:14,074
Come on. Let's go!

745
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,099
Let's go!

746
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,113
Enjoy! Foundation Day!

747
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:19,969
You mad at me bro?

748
00:47:29,058 --> 00:47:30,308
Did you do that?

749
00:47:34,558 --> 00:47:35,558
Wow.

750
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:37,849
Is that a new thrill for you?

751
00:47:40,141 --> 00:47:41,141
No.

752
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:47,433
I did it because that's
what you would have done.

753
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:50,474
Even if it was dangerous
or I'll look crazy,

754
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:52,207
I know you'll do it because

755
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:54,308
it's the right thing to do.

756
00:47:56,144 --> 00:48:00,079
Okay, that's me. That's me, Wes.

757
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:01,808
What about you?

758
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:07,433
Me?

759
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:11,058
You know what,

760
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,016
honestly,

761
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:19,141
I'm still getting to know myself.

762
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:23,849
I know that the best parts of me

763
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,379
are the parts that are good because of you.

764
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:31,366
Okay? You're rough around
the edges, blunt and tactless,

765
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:33,908
and I'm so sorry, but you are.

766
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:37,516
You're honest, sometimes too honest,
and money's not an object

767
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:40,261
not because you're rich or you
have a lot of it or you're privileged,

768
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:42,184
but because you're humble.

769
00:48:43,266 --> 00:48:46,599
And Maria Victoria,

770
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:51,724
the best part about you is that…

771
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:53,683
you love without fear.

772
00:48:57,516 --> 00:49:03,183
I can't fully trust myself
to make a choice,

773
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:08,949
but right now, I choose… you.

774
00:49:08,974 --> 00:49:14,391
I choose to do everything for you
to forgive me and take me in again.

775
00:49:16,474 --> 00:49:17,933
Oh my gosh.

776
00:49:18,141 --> 00:49:19,724
That's crazy.

777
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:23,110
You're going to make me bleed out.

778
00:49:23,558 --> 00:49:25,266
Could you say it like I'm five?

779
00:49:27,224 --> 00:49:28,224
Yeah!

780
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:31,391
Okay, what I mean is,

781
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:39,683
I, this young, handsome, beautiful thing,

782
00:49:39,782 --> 00:49:45,493
standing in front of this
crass lil girly with a big heart,

783
00:49:46,808 --> 00:49:53,604
I'm asking you to love this
gender-fluid beautiful person

784
00:49:53,971 --> 00:49:58,485
in a platonic, non-sexual,
forever kind of way.

785
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:04,599
Mavic, Bes… I love you.

786
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:08,599
How can I not forgive you?

787
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:11,349
Give me a kiss first.

788
00:50:14,242 --> 00:50:16,180
I love you, too, Bes.

789
00:50:19,658 --> 00:50:21,699
Hey, where are you taking me?

790
00:50:21,724 --> 00:50:23,224
Where you belong.

791
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:25,766
You deserve this.

792
00:50:28,016 --> 00:50:29,016
Thanks, man.

793
00:50:30,724 --> 00:50:31,724
Hey.

794
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:35,891
For you.

795
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,349
Issa, about what I said last night,

796
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:43,641
I wasn't talking about Cheesy.

797
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:49,016
I mean it wasn't just Cheesy,
it's about you, too.

798
00:50:49,808 --> 00:50:54,183
No. No, I was talking
about you, not Cheesy.

799
00:50:54,974 --> 00:50:57,849
Ah, shit. Sorry, it's confusing.

800
00:50:58,534 --> 00:51:00,242
Issa, I just want to tell you that…

801
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:03,599
What?

802
00:51:05,974 --> 00:51:07,433
- Tell me what?
- Issa, I like you.

803
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:13,933
Possibly for a long time now. When we were
kids riding those bikes down our alley.

804
00:51:14,724 --> 00:51:19,224
The road was difficult and long,
and because I was impatient,

805
00:51:20,308 --> 00:51:21,641
I rode past you.

806
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:27,141
But now, I've found
the way back to you, so...

807
00:51:28,183 --> 00:51:31,665
I hope you can still accept me.

808
00:51:31,933 --> 00:51:34,774
I hope we can still do this together.

809
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:37,391
Gibo,

810
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:39,849
I never left.

811
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:44,224
You said we'll do it together.
I stuck by that.

812
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:45,901
I never strayed.

813
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:50,058
I promise, I won't leave you behind again.

814
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:59,033
Okay. Gibo, Issa, do you take this...

815
00:51:59,058 --> 00:52:00,058
Yep.

816
00:52:03,808 --> 00:52:05,558
Okay, you may now...

817
00:52:08,808 --> 00:52:09,808
Excited much?

818
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:11,431
Fine, then you're married.

819
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:09,766
Students! Please proceed to the
grounds now for your attendance.

820
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:12,386
And make sure your presence is felt.

821
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:17,495
It's our Foundation Day!
Why aren't you here? Where are you?

822
00:54:07,683 --> 00:54:08,808
Students!

823
00:54:09,558 --> 00:54:11,034
Come to the school grounds right now.

824
00:54:11,058 --> 00:54:12,058
Right now!

825
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:16,266
Students!
