1
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:08,877
We'd like to welcome...

2
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:11,127
our new transferees…

3
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:12,110
Hey!

4
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:13,718
Hey!

5
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:20,685
That girl Issa slut.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,252
Whatever gossip you picked up,
or fake news you gathered,

7
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:26,735
that's all it is. Fake.

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,277
While everyone's moving up to high school,

9
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:29,568
you two are breaking up.

10
00:00:29,593 --> 00:00:30,385
Yeah.

11
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:31,568
Mavic.

12
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:33,460
Max. Maximus Lopez.

13
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:35,068
Looking to get your ass beat up, huh?

14
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:36,093
Okay.

15
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:38,644
There!

16
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:39,877
You think you can take us on?

17
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,293
Issa, you're assigned to the library.

18
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:43,318
Hunter, you're on sports track.

19
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,710
And Gibo, you'll be assisting Mrs. Salva

20
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:48,044
with extra-curricular activities.

21
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:50,418
Awesome.

22
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:54,880
You teach me.

23
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,512
Oh my God.

24
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:01,560
Am I seeing things?

25
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:03,127
Huh?

26
00:01:03,152 --> 00:01:04,152
Karla?

27
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:08,527
Yes…

28
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:10,568
Oh, baby.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,918
You want more, huh? Want more?

31
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:16,943
Yeah.

32
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,034
Yes, baby.

33
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,393
Say it, baby! Say it!

34
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:24,360
Which one?

35
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:26,460
All of it!

36
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,085
All of it! Just say it.
I wanna hear you moan!

37
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,547
Say it!

38
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:33,585
Yes! I want more!

39
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,735
Give it to me!

40
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:37,234
Please! Give me all of it!

41
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:39,836

Yes!

54
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:41,073
Yes!

55
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:48,110
Wes?

56
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:54,960
The transferee? What the fuck?

57
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:58,276
No! I said yes, baby!

58
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:02,168
I heard his name.
I'm sure of it.

59
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:03,193
I heard...

60
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,085
Wait a minute.

61
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,909
No, wait, baby!

62
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,057
Fuck.

63
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,902
What the fuck, Ashley.

64
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:19,823
You're cheating on me
right in the middle of...

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,152
Ah, fuck. You even liked the post.

66
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:25,468
Care to leave a comment, too?

67
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:28,182
Don't play fucking games with me.

68
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:32,252
Is it cheating if it's your dick inside me?

69
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:35,710
Well, he's the one
inside your head!

70
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:36,735
So, what?

71
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,511
You're turned on by him?

72
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,151
You're disgusting! You pigs!

73
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:44,144
You know what…

74
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,691
do what you want.

75
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:48,002
No, Kendrick!

76
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:48,860
We're over. We're done.

77
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,862
Wait, Kendrick! Are you
still driving me to school?

78
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,085
Morning, son!

79
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:40,981
- Son, good morning.
- Ma. Pa.

80
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:42,777
Morning.

81
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:44,357
Morning, Wes.

82
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,550
So…

83
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,013
What's going on?

84
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,052
We're up to speed, son.

85
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:00,293
That's okay.

86
00:05:00,318 --> 00:05:03,138
We saw the screenshots
in the group chat.

87
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:05,693
You have a group chat?

88
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:09,985
Yeah.

89
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:13,543
Whatever I told you, that you seem
to have told the whole village,

90
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:14,527
that's all there is.

91
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:16,802
On my way out of school, I saw her.

92
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:19,360
So she lied?

93
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,252
That bit... Mm, no.

94
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,669
- Auntie, uncle, sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

95
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:25,610
That bitch!

96
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,277
Then what? What happened?

97
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:30,318
Karla, what about New York?

98
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,902
What about your scholarship?

99
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:35,668
Nevermind! It didn't work out
so I'm here.

100
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,110
Why here at Harmon?

101
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,168
My dad's a board member here, remember?

102
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:40,735
No other reason, Gibo.

103
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
I see.

104
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:44,947
We split up because you're not
into long-distance relationships, right?

105
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,815
And you said you wanted
to focus on your studies?

106
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:49,627
If you're here now, then…

107
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:51,003
Does that mean...

108
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,127
I don't know what to tell you, Gibo.

109
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:56,985
I'm sorry, but there's just so
many things happening right now.

110
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,927
I need to think.

111
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:11,082
You're right, it's messed up!

112
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,159
You're giving me a headache,
up here and down there.

113
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:19,323
So what if it's destiny?

114
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:22,777
A wise person once said, that bitch.

115
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,644
That's me and I will say it again.

116
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:26,896
She's stringing you along.

117
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:30,627
And why do you keep going
along with her plans anyway?

118
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:32,443
Can't it be both?

119
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:36,710
Bro, if there's even the slightest chance
that you're getting back together,

120
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:38,548
you should discuss it or else…

121
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:40,110
that's a rebound.

122
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:41,527
Rebound?

123
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,460
How can I be both
the ex and the rebound?

124
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:47,354
You're a rebound because
you're dumb enough to crawl back to her

125
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,064
after she left you hanging.

126
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,524
Are we back to the courting stage?
I don't know, man.

127
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,460
I'm not clear on our status.

128
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:56,602
The status is you're the only one lost.

129
00:06:56,627 --> 00:07:00,377
As far as Karla's concerned,
you two have broken up.

130
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:01,735
Pe-ri-od.

131
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:04,798
Can you let me have a bite?

132
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:08,985
There's more. Eat up.

133
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:12,485
Sir.

134
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:26,878
Sir.

135
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:29,668
At ease.

136
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:33,193
At ease!

137
00:07:36,193 --> 00:07:37,283
What?

138
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,068
Are you deaf or...

139
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,619
Are you a moron?

140
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,068
What?

141
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,693
No, sir.

142
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:01,072
Ugh, God.

143
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:14,652
Dad… I mean, sir…

144
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:17,485
What's this?

145
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:23,485
Why are you so lousy?

146
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,064
Pull yourself together!

147
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:31,853
My God!

148
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,485
It's too damn early!

149
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,830
Good morning, dad.

150
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:57,818
Good morning, son.

151
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,485
Just one 'good' thing.

152
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,610
I heard someone stayed out late last night.

153
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:13,307
Yeah.

154
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:18,400
I heard the two of them
stayed late last night.

155
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,384
Huh. Round two?

156
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:25,318
Sluts never seem to run out of energy.

157
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,710
Hi, Issa. Are you busy later?

158
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,735
You want to go to the gym?

159
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,134
Let's sweat it out.

160
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,710
Wanna ask if I'm busy?

161
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:37,710
We were just messing around.

162
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,697
Beat it, guys.

163
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:41,297
Issa, sit here.

164
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,370
Thank you.

165
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:51,877
Good morning, class.

166
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:55,901
Class, please welcome your new classmate,
Karina Angela Sanchez.

167
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:57,464
Who is she?

168
00:09:58,152 --> 00:10:00,418
That's Karla.

169
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:02,835
An 'it girl' at her old school.

170
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,252
Her dad's a judge,
her mom's an heiress.

171
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:09,168
Fashionista, has been
featured in some magazines.

172
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,585
All of the boys are into her.

173
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:18,027
But she chose someone not
so well-off, but well down there.

174
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:20,557
Mr. Giborat himself.

175
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,471
Latest scoop says they've split up.

176
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,588
Can someone give her a seat?

177
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,360
It's okay, ma'am.
I can handle myself.

178
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:30,385
Okay.

179
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:36,235
Proof? Unfollowed on IG,
unfollowed in real life?

180
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:47,039
I unfollowed you but I'm
still crazy about you, Karla.

181
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:54,934
Where's the key, Wes?

182
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,793
Wait. It's here.

183
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:58,277
- Perfect.
- What do you need?

184
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:00,293
I need to check myself out.

185
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:02,393
You're already gorgeous.

186
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:03,831
And rich. Don't worry.

187
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,119
But still…

188
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:09,031
Wait, tilt it over here.

189
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:12,565
I wanna see myself, too.

190
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,167
There.

191
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:20,393
So blunt, down to the hilt.

192
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:21,693
So pretty.

193
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:23,620
Who cut your nails?

194
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,581
Secret.

195
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:30,585
My gosh…

196
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,485
What?

197
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,460
He's gorgeous.

198
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,627
- Who?
- He's so yummy!

199
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,068
Who is it?

200
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,758
Him. The one.

201
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,360
I swear to god if you fall in love again,
don't come crying to me...

202
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,206
Not bad.

203
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,652
- Is that him?
- Shit, man.

204
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:55,008
Imagine, just before
you blow your load,

205
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:59,055
you hear the name Wes.

206
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:00,305
Fuck.

207
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:03,500
The fuck, man.

208
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:06,877
I'm surprised your dick didn't go limp.

209
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm being serious, man.

210
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:09,752
So am I.

211
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:10,860
It's really painful.

212
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:12,805
It hurt me. Imagine if
you had to go through it.

213
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,659
It's fucked up.

214
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,943
Somehow I feel emasculated by it.

215
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,054
Kendrick, want to teach
that Wes a lesson?

216
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,110
Bro, forget it.

217
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:28,659
Then everybody will know.

218
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:32,695
He doesn't know that when
my girlfriend thinks about it,

219
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:35,547
it makes her wanna...

220
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:41,110
Motherfucker!

221
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,027
Bro!

222
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:46,570
I make out with that chick
for five fucking minutes.

223
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:50,473
In this group, fuck,
we don't have to do that.

224
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:53,527
But I’m all about performance.
I'm 100 percent game all the time.

225
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,289
And I mean all the time, no cap.

226
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:01,443
But it's never enough, bro. Never enough.

227
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,277
I don't know what else to do.

228
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:11,193
Thing is, bro,

229
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:15,793
Loop and I don't have that issue.

230
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:18,102
That's because nothing ever
happens between you, man.

231
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:22,235
Exactly. But that hurts, too.

232
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:23,902
Hi, Mavic.

233
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:26,652
I was gonna ask you a favor.

234
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Sure.

235
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:29,527
What kind of favor?

236
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,527
Can you be my...

237
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:33,752
That was too fast.

238
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:36,547
Sorry, nope. I'm not here.

239
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,360
Ah, no.

240
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,485
That's not what I was gonna ask.

241
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:40,985
I see.

242
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,418
Can you be my...

243
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:43,985
…test subject for a project?

244
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:45,777
It's for my marketing presentation.

245
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:47,277
- See?
- Oh, I see.

246
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,877
Shit.

247
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,027
Shit, shit.

248
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:53,943
What have I done?

249
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:56,735
So awkward.

250
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,016
Well...

251
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:01,570
Max?

252
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:03,549
Can we rewind?

253
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:06,360
Can I take back what I said?

254
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,771
Cancel order, if you catch my drift.

255
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:11,277
I'm worried you'll cancel me.

256
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:13,773
I just got excited

257
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:17,450
because you're nearly perfect.

258
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,735
The Lord might even take you back early.

259
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,794
But please, Lord, I hope not.

260
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,485
Let me have a taste first and...

261
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:29,193
I still gotta love you.

262
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:31,777
Whoa. Slow down.

263
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:33,193
Slow down.

264
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,516
Hey! That's me.

265
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:37,815
Slow…

266
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,318
What about you, Hunter?

267
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:50,027
With Gia...

268
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:54,610
How do you satisfy her?

269
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,252
Hi, handsome.

270
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:02,918
What are you looking for?

271
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,860
Hey, why are you hanging around Sheila?

272
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:06,093
Don't you know she's mine?

273
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:07,761
Or are you looking for a fight?

274
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:09,036
- Ry.
- What?

275
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:11,727
Stop. Don't do this... hey.

276
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:14,002
Did you hear what I said?

277
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:15,152
Don't make a scene here.

278
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,168
Come on. Stop.

279
00:15:17,193 --> 00:15:18,852
I can hear you. So what?

280
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,568
You think you're hotshit?

281
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,367
You think you're better than me?

282
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,752
Ry! Ry!

283
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:26,352
What's wrong with you?

284
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:29,085
Wait!

285
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,250
Ry!

286
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:31,820
Ry!

287
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:35,485
Where's that dipshit?
I'm gonna kill him!

288
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:36,818
Fuck!

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,354
That was close.

290
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:44,735
Yep.

291
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:47,710
He might come back.

292
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:48,735
Come on.

293
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:53,312
That was fun.

294
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:56,652
What's your deal?

295
00:15:56,985 --> 00:15:59,800
Did you just come here
looking for trouble?

296
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:01,485
No.

297
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:04,152
It just feels nice
to be free sometimes.

298
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:05,985
But hang on...

299
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:09,181
How did you know to get me out of there?

300
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,362
You looked like you needed some help.

301
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:13,307
Did I look like an easy target?

302
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:15,042
For Sheila? Sure.

303
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,198
But maybe because...

304
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,565
I know what being trapped looks like.

305
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:23,143
And in those times,

306
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,089
if somebody would take my hand,

307
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,229
anyone would feel glad
to be rescued, right?

308
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,135
It's not just sex.

309
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:43,628
You should nurture
a connection with each other.

310
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,443
Hunter, what the hell?

311
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:47,693
You're making me wait.

312
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:54,318
A connection between her
bag and your arm, you mean?

313
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:56,193
Let's go.

314
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,839
Dumbass.

315
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:00,193
Thanks for the advice, bro.

316
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:01,943
Is that it?

317
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,886
Oh, Besh.

318
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,960
Who's thirsty?

319
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:10,985
Is it him?

320
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:12,495
Or me?

321
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:14,877
What if…

322
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,425
that was me?

323
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,995
I wish I was that bottle.

324
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:23,335
Ashley.

325
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Right?

326
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:25,729
Yeah?

327
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:28,003
Like what you see?

328
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:32,127
Oops… sorry.

329
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,543
It just came out.

330
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:35,460
I couldn't hold it in much longer.

331
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,464
Yes… I like.

332
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,335
It's okay. Walk with me?

333
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,877
Actually, I'm looking
for something sweet.

334
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:50,440
So, let's grab some snacks and
then you can tell me what else you like.

335
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:51,693
Okay.

336
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Let's go?

337
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:07,278
Go on, spill. Before Cheesy
bites your hand off.

338
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
It's nothing.

339
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:16,417
Karla just got me wondering.

340
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:20,460
All my life...

341
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:22,110
All your life?

342
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,885
Like you're so old.

343
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:26,943
Smartass.

344
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,110
Fine.

345
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:31,004
For most of my teenage years…

346
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:33,168
Makes more sense.

347
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:35,013
For most of my teenage years…

348
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:37,152
my days revolved around her.

349
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:41,693
When we broke up, I told myself
I wouldn't be able to bear it.

350
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:45,902
But now, I'm finally moving on
and she shows up.

351
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:50,402
Like why won't this love
story end, you know?

352
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:53,193
It's like it doesn't want
to end, whatever this is.

353
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,918
Are all girls like that?

354
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:57,252
Indecisive?

355
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:58,627
Confusing?

356
00:18:58,652 --> 00:18:59,652
No.

357
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,335
That's what I hate the most.

358
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,668
People who act half-baked,
just dropping hints,

359
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:08,693
they don't tell you straight up what
they want, then expect shit from you.

360
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,034
All they do is drop hints.

361
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,860
Why not just buy a giant puzzle
and play with yourself?

362
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:19,471
Besides, who wants to pin their hopes
on something uncertain?

363
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,893
Mm, ice cream. Chocolate.

364
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:27,610
Is that your stash?

365
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:30,081
No, it's my friend's.

366
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:31,581
She keeps her stash in the lab.

367
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:35,943
Don't want it?

368
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:37,418
There are other flavors.

369
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,753
I like this more.

370
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:46,346
Let me have a taste, Wes.

371
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:47,985
Now?

372
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:49,643
Why not?

373
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:52,182
Experiment on me.

374
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,471
Try anything with me.

375
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:57,971
You sure?

376
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:22,693
What are you sure about?

377
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,068
That I want to finish my studies.

378
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,027
That I'll strive to have a
good life and be a journalist.

379
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:38,277
And that I won't be affected by
fake news and those fake accounts.

380
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:40,485
What else?

381
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,612
Huh? Are we meeting a quota?

382
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:46,068
No, but let's add more to the list.

383
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:48,710
Let's be friends.

384
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:49,735
Official.

385
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:52,794
Aren't you going too fast?

386
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,708
Are you ready for that commitment?

387
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,335
We just ate lunch yesterday.

388
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,755
Then we were called
to the principal's office.

389
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:07,546
I think trouble finds us
when we're together.

390
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,402
I guess you're right.

391
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:12,128
But maybe…

392
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,651
I just want something
to hold on to right now.

393
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:17,527
So you're just using me?

394
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,985
Then use me, too.

395
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,102
What happened?
Something wrong?

396
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,293
Ah! Ouch!

397
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:30,543
Shit! It hurts! My tummy hurts.

398
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:33,503
I thought it was something serious.

399
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:34,839
Go to the toilet!

400
00:23:36,526 --> 00:23:38,668
Sorry, what were you saying?

401
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:41,127
I said, use me too.

402
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:42,152
Go ahead.

403
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:43,683
Turn me into a subject.

404
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:45,683
Practice on me for interviews.

405
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,235
No holds barred.

406
00:23:47,402 --> 00:23:48,652
No secrets…

407
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,294
…if you can.

408
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:52,152
Is that a dare?

409
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:55,769
Depends if you can keep a secret.

410
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,110
Of course!

411
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,488
So… friends?

412
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:01,777
All right.

413
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:04,093
Officially friends.

414
00:25:39,402 --> 00:25:40,818
Hey, Issa!

415
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,143
Honesty is the best policy, right?

416
00:25:46,443 --> 00:25:48,918
But with guys…

417
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,932
we're supposed to act demure?

418
00:25:51,943 --> 00:25:54,696
Ugh, I just don't get it.

419
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,042
Usually I can help myself,

420
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:59,354
but with Maximus…

421
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:02,485
He has such a strong effect on me.

422
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:06,568
Hey, Issa. Are you listening?

423
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:08,693
Oh, sorry. Were you talking to me?

424
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,943
Duh, friend.

425
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,735
Come sit with me.

426
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:15,925
What's with today? Why do I
suddenly have so many friends?

427
00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:18,985
Going back, Issa,

428
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,218
what do you think?

429
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:24,668
If things are going fast
between a boy and a girl,

430
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:25,902
does that mean it's not real?

431
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:31,502
Let's be friends.

432
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:32,527
Official.

433
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:34,956
Aren't you going too fast?

434
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:37,527
Are you ready for that commitment?

435
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:40,792
Depends.

436
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:46,735
Depends on what?

437
00:26:47,402 --> 00:26:48,581
For example,

438
00:26:48,943 --> 00:26:51,370
what if your feelings are true?

439
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,245
Is length of time or
intensity more important?

440
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,752
I think it's the intensity.

441
00:26:58,777 --> 00:27:00,735
Oh, really now?

442
00:27:01,073 --> 00:27:02,714
So I'm not doing anything wrong?

443
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:05,050
Everything's cool?

444
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,127
Because if we're going with intensity,

445
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:11,667
girl, nothing can top this!

446
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:14,943
Wait, Mavic. Be careful.

447
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:19,417
Just because your intentions are pure,

448
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:22,252
make sure the guy
matches your intensity…

449
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:23,792
otherwise it might not work out.

450
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:25,693
Like say, in a storm,

451
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:28,377
instead of being pulled
towards the center

452
00:27:28,402 --> 00:27:30,127
where it's calm

453
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:31,894
you might be hurled further away.

454
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,511
Oh...

455
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:37,193
I don't like that.

456
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:42,636
I'd rather be sucked in. Always.

457
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:45,058
Thank you, friend!

458
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:47,460
You're welcome, friend.

459
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:48,652
See ya!

460
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:49,805
Okay.

461
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,566
Thank you.

462
00:28:05,568 --> 00:28:08,277
Ah, miss, I'm missing a medium?

463
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:10,960
I think you're size small.

464
00:28:10,985 --> 00:28:14,485
I always keep a spare size, for allowance.

465
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,068
Okay, I'll order more.

466
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,210
Okay then.

467
00:28:17,235 --> 00:28:18,235
Karla!

468
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,058
Notes from yesterday,
so you don't miss anything.

469
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:22,878
Thanks.

470
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:24,737
So, that's it?

471
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:26,668
I worked hard on that.

472
00:28:26,693 --> 00:28:29,175
I even looked for your
favorite highlighter.

473
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:31,784
Gibo, why are you doing this?

474
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,110
Do what?

475
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,152
This.

476
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:39,735
Sorry, I guess I'm just
used to looking after you.

477
00:28:40,527 --> 00:28:41,527
But Karla,

478
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:46,277
maybe we still have a chance.

479
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:48,527
Gibo…

480
00:28:50,193 --> 00:28:51,610
Okay, how about this?

481
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:52,835
Just let me do things for you.

482
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,318
Let's leave it at that.

483
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:57,127
So, later? I'll walk you home.

484
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,152
Will you stop if I tell you to?

485
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:01,918
You know what, suit yourself.

486
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:02,943
Wait, wait.

487
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:05,860
You're always leaving me hanging.

488
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:08,668
Karla, I just want you to know that

489
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:12,193
after you, I haven't done it with...

490
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,735
I'm still a virgin.

491
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:18,152
I saved myself

492
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:21,277
because I'm still hoping that someday,

493
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,693
you'll make good with your
promise, that in the right time,

494
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:26,610
we'll do it with each other.

495
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:29,198
Are you expecting a thank you?

496
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,136
You think you're a blessing
to women or something?

497
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:34,683
I didn't mean it that way.

498
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:37,710
Gibo, we're in senior high.

499
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:41,300
You're no longer the Top One
people-pleasing crowd favorite.

500
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:43,214
Get over yourself.

501
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:45,710
How can I get over...

502
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:51,339
when in my dreams, you're under me,
over me, all around, all the way?

503
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:53,447
Shit, what's your secret?

504
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:56,793
Nothing, I just…

505
00:29:56,818 --> 00:29:58,277
know your spots.

506
00:29:58,693 --> 00:29:59,985
For example,

507
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:01,527
I know your clit.

508
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:05,474
You know where it is? Dang.

509
00:30:05,818 --> 00:30:07,460
We need to do this again.

510
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:08,485
Game?

511
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:11,193
Maybe not?

512
00:30:12,652 --> 00:30:13,652
Why?

513
00:30:14,027 --> 00:30:15,826
Did I do something?

514
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:17,502
Or didn't do?

515
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:20,349
No, no, it's just...

516
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:28,902
I just don't get off the same way where
we'll both be satisfied at the same time.

517
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,652
So just now...

518
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:33,435
you didn't come?

519
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,636
That's not my goal.

520
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:41,927
My goal was to pleasure you.

521
00:30:42,193 --> 00:30:46,107
And that satisfies me.

522
00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:48,152
Aww…

523
00:30:48,652 --> 00:30:51,110
But we can still change up the styles.

524
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:54,127
No, I know my spots.

525
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,960
I know myself. If we do
the same thing twice in a row,

526
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:58,755
I'll look for something else, and...

527
00:30:59,835 --> 00:31:04,252
I don't want to make you feel undesirable,
or unwanted because...

528
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:07,377
Ashley, you're a very desirable woman.

529
00:31:07,402 --> 00:31:08,402
Okay?

530
00:31:09,277 --> 00:31:10,485
Aww…

531
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:14,235
If that isn't the sweetest
breakup speech ever.

532
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:16,849
And the best sex ever.

533
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:20,060
There might still be a second best.

534
00:31:20,402 --> 00:31:25,021
Just let your partner
know what you want. Okay?

535
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:27,724
No, I get all flustered.

536
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:30,318
I don't know what to say.

537
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,485
You're exchanging fluids.

538
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:38,490
And you can't even
exchange suggestions?

539
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:41,638
Okay, I'll do that.

540
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:46,005
But can we go for one last round?

541
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:49,927
I just want to be sure
what I'm going to suggest.

542
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:52,585
Okay.

543
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,857
Why not?

544
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:07,726
Who will speak up
if we do not speak up?

545
00:32:08,277 --> 00:32:11,630
Who will act if we do not act?

546
00:32:12,027 --> 00:32:15,302
If not now, then when?

547
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:18,168
These are the words of?

548
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:19,583
Vilma Santos?

549
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:23,902
Close, but no.

550
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,293
These are the words of Ditto Sarmiento.

551
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:29,060
My point here is, class,

552
00:32:29,735 --> 00:32:31,662
to speak the truth to power,

553
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:33,318
is a dangerous occupation.

554
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,485
But this is absolutely necessary.

555
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:39,544
So in your young minds,

556
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:43,935
don't think, it doesn't matter,

557
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:45,747
it's all just for page count,

558
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:48,240
empty words to puff up a paper.

559
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:51,029
Because these matter.

560
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:53,235
You matter.

561
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:56,568
Because you are necessary.

562
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:58,485
Thank you.

563
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:01,543
Thank you, sir Lem.

564
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:04,277
Thank you to all the attendees.

565
00:33:04,302 --> 00:33:08,043
And don’t forget to watch
out for our next event.

566
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:11,451
To those who wish to apply
at Harmon Chronicles,

567
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:13,085
don't hesitate to reach out to us.

568
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,708
Thank you all very much.

569
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,654
Sir! Let's take a selfie!

570
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:19,404
Sure, for five pesos.

571
00:33:19,818 --> 00:33:21,622
I'm kidding. Come over here.

572
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
Thank you, sir.

573
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:27,527
Thank you, thank you.

574
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,552
Careful out there.

575
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:34,896
Journalism program?

576
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:38,818
I'm free to dream.

577
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:41,527
Of course you are.

578
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:43,443
You may.

579
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:45,027
And you should.

580
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:46,652
And you know what?

581
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,412
I should make you a list.

582
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,693
I know some schools that
offer scholarship programs.

583
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,349
You'll have allowance
and a place to stay.

584
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,802
Same schools that offered me back then.

585
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,318
And while you're at it, why
don't you join the school paper?

586
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:03,849
I'm not confident in my skills, sir.

587
00:34:04,598 --> 00:34:05,614
Hang on.

588
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:07,759
You're almost always here
at the library, aren't you?

589
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:11,735
Sit-in during events and you can apply
what you learn in the Chronicles.

590
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,610
Okay.

591
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,152
Sir, you mentioned that
they offered you a grant?

592
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:18,735
Did you push through?

593
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:22,735
Change of plans.

594
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,427
My older sister had to go abroad.

595
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:28,435
So I was left to care for my parents.

596
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,201
Burden of the youngest.

597
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:34,485
I should make you that list.

598
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:36,735
Please, sir, nevermind.

599
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:38,818
Oh, I apologize.

600
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:40,193
It's not you.

601
00:34:40,864 --> 00:34:43,083
I just prefer not to owe someone.

602
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:45,485
Don't be silly. This is my job.

603
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:47,787
Whether it's a favor
or a debt of gratitude,

604
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:50,793
don't let us stop you from
pursuing your dreams.

605
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:55,247
And don't let anything
derail you. Am I right?

606
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:59,060
Whether it be your
responsibilities or otherwise.

607
00:34:59,523 --> 00:35:00,926
Because you're important.

608
00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:03,318
Thank you, sir.

609
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:04,652
Welcome.

610
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,002
I'll go ahead, Felize.

611
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,412
Okay, ma'am. Be safe.

612
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:27,002
Something wrong, Mr. Nolasco?

613
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:28,419
Ah, sorry, ma'am.

614
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:31,877
No, go on.

615
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:33,427
You can talk to me.

616
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:43,402
It's about the new student, ma'am. Karla.

617
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:47,682
We weren't just schoolmates.

618
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:49,838
We used to date.

619
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:52,995
She broke up with me,

620
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,657
because she went abroad.

621
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,181
Said she'll attend school there.

622
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:58,485
But she came back.

623
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:01,360
And for some reason,

624
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,526
everything's changed between us.

625
00:36:06,562 --> 00:36:08,322
We didn't have issues back then.

626
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:11,018
So why couldn't we just
pick up where we left off?

627
00:36:12,027 --> 00:36:14,792
She seems to be pushing me away.

628
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,589
While here I am, and all I want is...

629
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:20,536
All I want is to love her.

630
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:23,485
Okay?

631
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,277
But Karla doesn't want
to give me a chance

632
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:29,526
to be a proper boyfriend to her.

633
00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:31,943
It's so hard.

634
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,318
I just wanna be there for her.

635
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:36,668
Be her man.

636
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,027
Okay? Is that it?

637
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:42,068
Being a proper boyfriend…

638
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:43,693
will appease you?

639
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,110
Yes.

640
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:46,735
Ah, maybe.

641
00:36:47,902 --> 00:36:49,110
I don't know.

642
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:55,235
All right.

643
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:56,735
Try me.

644
00:36:57,777 --> 00:37:00,104
I haven't gone on
a date for so long.

645
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,557
But ma'am, you said
we can't do it here.

646
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,198
Are we going to 'that place'?

647
00:37:13,902 --> 00:37:16,210
Ma'am, is this really okay?

648
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:17,402
Yes.

649
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,860
This is what my husband
and I used to do.

650
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:25,471
Dinner, then movie.

651
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:27,690
I kind of miss it.

652
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:30,043
The movie?

653
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:32,589
The routine, or your husband?

654
00:37:35,193 --> 00:37:38,068
What do I miss? Popcorn!

655
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:42,041
We don't have that here.

656
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:45,068
Ma'am?

657
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:47,168
Yes, Nolasco?

658
00:37:47,193 --> 00:37:49,401
This is a proper date, right?

659
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:52,065
Then can you just call me 'Gibo'?

660
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:55,443
Only if you drop the honorifics.

661
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,777
Okay, Felize?

662
00:38:19,902 --> 00:38:22,909
Okay, this is it, Gibo…

663
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,027
Do some stretching…

664
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:31,268
now, offense..

665
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,956
Hand on the ball…

666
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:41,245
now shoot it in the basket!

667
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:56,527
Mavic?

668
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:58,235
Hey, Mavic!

669
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,460
Hi, Max.

670
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:06,737
It's you.

671
00:39:06,922 --> 00:39:09,580
Yeah. I'm not in a rush, so…

672
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:11,960
and I had my driver take a break.

673
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:14,792
So if your ride's not here yet,

674
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,167
I can pass the time with you.

675
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:20,402
Oh, I don't want to trouble you.

676
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,932
Your parents might be waiting for you.

677
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:25,085
No, they're never home anyway.

678
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:29,068
Well, Dad always comes home late
from the National Assembly.

679
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,793
National Assembly?

680
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:32,714
Yeah. He's in Congress.

681
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,190
He's always busy at work
so he's rarely home.

682
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:38,761
I see.

683
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:44,627
So that means there's nobody at your house.
Okay, you can go ahead. Bye!

684
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:45,964
Hey, wait. Wait!

685
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:51,495
Are you avoiding me because
of what happened earlier?

686
00:39:55,402 --> 00:39:57,425
To be honest,

687
00:39:58,068 --> 00:39:59,068
I am.

688
00:40:00,277 --> 00:40:02,443
I got too excited.

689
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,235
I'm embarrassed.

690
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:08,198
You might think I'm cheap.

691
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:11,110
It's true, I used to be.

692
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:14,652
But ever since we won the LOTTO,

693
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,487
things have been easier money-wise.

694
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,818
We're winning at life.

695
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,675
How I wish even in love.

696
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:23,877
Universe, if you would…

697
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:25,581
So that's why.

698
00:40:26,914 --> 00:40:28,416
I want that, too.

699
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:32,370
Someone to greet,

700
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:34,025
and be greeted with…

701
00:40:34,247 --> 00:40:35,247
good morning.

702
00:40:36,485 --> 00:40:38,777
Someone to be with,

703
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,985
and even maybe, someone to love.

704
00:40:42,793 --> 00:40:46,002
But I admit... I'm not used to this.

705
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,636
You dive fast, but I'm really impressed.

706
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:51,745
I really admire and respect your candor.

707
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:53,815
- Candor?
- Yes.

708
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:56,885
I think you're the one going too fast.

709
00:40:57,074 --> 00:40:59,099
- You got a dirty mind, too.
- Hey!

710
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:01,612
I meant your honesty.

711
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,918
But actually, the truth is,

712
00:41:04,943 --> 00:41:06,479
I was surprised.

713
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,714
I wanted to be the first to say...

714
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:14,995
that I like you.

715
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,950
I like you, too.

716
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:21,668
Ah, wait, wait.

717
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:23,339
Let me process this.

718
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,443
Does this mean...

719
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,735
We're have a mutual understand (MU) now?

720
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,121
Yeah.

721
00:41:31,943 --> 00:41:32,943
Oh my gosh.

722
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:35,258
- For real?
- Yeah.

723
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,277
Woo! Woo!

724
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:40,922
Why, I got the one! The one!

725
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:42,418
The one! The one!

726
00:41:42,443 --> 00:41:43,750
Woo!

727
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:47,898
I'm on top of the world!

728
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm so happy! I'm so happy!

729
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:13,232
Sorry.

730
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:16,991
Don't be, love.

731
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:45,485
Wait. Sorry.

732
00:42:46,527 --> 00:42:47,943
I thought we were going too fast.

733
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:50,781
I ain't seen nothing yet.

734
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,484
Why hold back when you're raring to go?

735
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:00,148
Are you sure? Should we?

736
00:43:00,777 --> 00:43:02,318
Can we have a taste test first?

737
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:04,418
Taste test?

738
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:05,711
Sure, go for it.

739
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:37,685
Okay, we're back in the heat
of the battle. Offense, Gibo!

740
00:43:38,662 --> 00:43:47,443
Move from the bottom to
the top... lay-up, feel her up.

741
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:55,193
There we go! It's wide open! Shoot it!

742
00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:03,777
You got an assist! Shoot!
Now dribble, keep going!

743
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:10,902
The enemy's melting in
your hand, moaning…yes!

744
00:44:29,138 --> 00:44:33,372
At least my hand got laid. Some life.

745
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:39,349
I'll walk you home later?

746
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,552
Shit, shit, shit!

747
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,818
Ah, Karla! Sorry!

748
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:45,210
Have you been waiting long?

749
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:46,560
Should we go?

750
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:49,193
Huh? I'm waiting for someone else.

751
00:44:49,568 --> 00:44:51,318
Who? Auntie?

752
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:54,377
No. Just leave it. Go home, Gibo.

753
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:55,740
Wait, Karla.

754
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:57,630
You're doing it again.

755
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,747
What are you afraid of?

756
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:03,419
Could it be… you're still affected by me?

757
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:07,794
Because if you are,
admit it. Don't be like this.

758
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:13,294
I admit I still have feelings for you.

759
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,610
Christ…

760
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:19,168
I didn't want to spell it out for you,

761
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:20,860
but you're so dense, Gibo.

762
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,693
I'm avoiding you
because of all this fuss.

763
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:26,210
You're always so over the top.

764
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:27,235
Extra.

765
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:28,912
It's suffocating.

766
00:45:29,818 --> 00:45:30,818
Sorry.

767
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,388
But I can adjust for you.

768
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,630
I'm pushing you away
because I don't like you.

769
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:38,052
There's someone else I like.
Get it now?

770
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:44,210
Did she say she doesn't like me?
Or she doesn't like me anymore?

771
00:45:44,235 --> 00:45:46,794
Hello? I'm your ex?

772
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,607
That really hurts.

773
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:24,792
Fuck!

774
00:46:26,277 --> 00:46:27,402
You're a fucking idiot, Gibo.

775
00:46:27,427 --> 00:46:28,510
So stupid!

776
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:32,652
Ouch.

777
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,027
Shit!

778
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:49,402
That's enough!

779
00:46:49,427 --> 00:46:51,935
But you were active
in the student body.

780
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,960
Active?

781
00:46:52,985 --> 00:46:54,127
Body?

782
00:46:54,152 --> 00:46:58,027
Of course! Let's go for
three rounds, no problem!

783
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,210
If you're going to change something,

784
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:01,835
change it now.

785
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,860
What's that?

786
00:47:02,943 --> 00:47:06,693
What if my bladder starts throbbing?

787
00:47:11,235 --> 00:47:12,793
Hey, what's wrong?

788
00:47:12,818 --> 00:47:14,168
What happened to you?

789
00:47:14,193 --> 00:47:16,193
Get dressed,
or you'll miss the ride!

790
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:17,585
Oh, right.

791
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,610
Respect is all I ask.

792
00:47:19,293 --> 00:47:19,918
Same thing you're asking.

793
00:47:19,943 --> 00:47:23,716
You chose that.
I didn't ask it of you.

794
00:47:24,627 --> 00:47:26,752
Okay? So don't ask for anything extra.

795
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,485
Wait, wait, love. Not there.

796
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:30,277
- Sorry.
- Move it higher.

797
00:47:30,277 --> 00:47:32,360
- What?
- Yeah. Higher.

798
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:34,287
Higher? Isn't that the fire exit?
