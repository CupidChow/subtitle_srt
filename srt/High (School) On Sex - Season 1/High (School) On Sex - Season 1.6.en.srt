1
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:16,794
DJ, drop that bass!

2
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:20,349
I'm going to tell him how I really feel.

3
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:21,840
Claiming the truth!

4
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:24,724
Who left this open?

5
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:37,324
Emergency!

6
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:40,307
Emergency! It's Max!

7
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,399
Shit, what the hell was that?

8
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:38,641
Was that a dream?

9
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:59,849
See you at the party.

10
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:05,213
There.

11
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:06,657
A little bit to the left.

12
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:07,682
Where?

13
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:09,266
- It's a little curved.
- Where?

14
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:10,677
Right there.

15
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:12,116
There.

16
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,224
Here?

17
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:14,657
Thank you.

18
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:15,932
You're welcome.

19
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:17,182
Scratch it more.

20
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:21,875
Finally.

21
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:33,477
Did we...

22
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:35,557
Hey!

23
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:36,457
No!

24
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,366
No way! No!

25
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,391
Fuck, no!

26
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:41,812
I'm not G for G! I'm straight!

27
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,406
Did I say you were?

28
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,763
Shit. Fucking wasted.

29
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:50,432
But thanks. You let me sleep over.

30
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:52,391
You're such a gentleman.

31
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,999
Get out, bitch!

32
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,224
And for the record,
I was just drunk last night.

33
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:59,516
So don't act so familiar.

34
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:01,911
And nobody will hear about this!

35
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,557
Guess I'll cherish it in my memory.

36
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,141
Get out!

37
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,383
So annoying!

38
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,432
My head hurts.

39
00:03:57,457 --> 00:03:58,563
Me too.

40
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:00,974
What a night.

41
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,132
You had fun?

42
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,699
Ugh, my head is splitting.

43
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:08,182
But wait… last night, did we
rip each other in half, too?

44
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:10,449
Is this a hangover...

45
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:11,182
Morning.

46
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,771
Or did my buddy down there
get blasted too?

47
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:14,961
- What happened to you?
- Eat up.

48
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:18,116
Shit, I forgot to text my mom!

49
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:22,099
Don't worry. I already told your parents
you spent the night here.

50
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:25,474
And I already sent them
your drunken photos.

51
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,807
- I saw that.
- Right?

52
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:31,227
My head hurts.

53
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:33,961
That means you should hydrate.

54
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:37,317
Actually, you, too.

55
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:39,782
You look thirsty from
all that fun last night.

56
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,991
Sucked dry, were you?

57
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:42,099
Miss Bubble Tea.

58
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:43,432
With popping boba!

59
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,457
Popping all over the place.

60
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:47,107
I had a delicious time.

61
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:49,766
Good for you.

62
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:52,491
Wait, 'good for you'?

63
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:56,474
A little bird told me that sex with the ex
happened last night.

64
00:04:58,016 --> 00:04:59,315
That's what I thought.

65
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:00,695
Or at least I wish I was sure.

66
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:06,973
Shit, imagine that? Karla and I
have been holding it in for so long…

67
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:10,771
Then last night,
she finally agreed we do it...

68
00:05:11,304 --> 00:05:12,320
And?

69
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:13,557
I can't remember anything.

70
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:15,262
What?!

71
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:16,641
Yeah!

72
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:20,649
Well, I know that I kissed her.

73
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,630
Then she climbed on top of me.

74
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,656
Okay…

75
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:27,396
Then I don't know
what happened next.

76
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,492
Huh?

77
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,820
Ugh! I can't remember my one great sex!

78
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:39,599
You know what, just eat.
You might remember after.

79
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:40,849
Eat up.

80
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:41,891
Yeah. Let's eat.

81
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,199
Hotdog?

82
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:47,974
Eat? Hang on, did I get to eat last night,
or did she do all the eating?

83
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:49,716
I hate this!

84
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:51,774
Love, sorry for all this.

85
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,817
You don't need to be here.

86
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:56,086
Come on.

87
00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:59,199
Don't make me feel bad.

88
00:05:59,224 --> 00:05:59,932
Careful.

89
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,150
Is that why you didn't call me?

90
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:13,448
We already did everything.
Why act all shy now?

91
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:16,414
Well, not all.

92
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:21,807
Don't worry about it.
I want to do this.

93
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:23,068
Why?

94
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:24,715
It's such a hassle for you.

95
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,703
Don't be dramatic.

96
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,642
I'm your girlfriend.

97
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,141
Shouldn't we have
each other's backs?

98
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,096
Besides, I want to
meet your parents, too.

99
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,712
You don't talk about them much.

100
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:46,748
No, sorry... But they're not coming.

101
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,857
Why? Out of town again?

102
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:51,442
It's just a thing.

103
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:54,689
Our family, showing weakness.

104
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,708
Besides, I don't want
to bother them with this.

105
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,516
They're too busy.

106
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,805
Busy?

107
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,349
Love, this is a big deal.

108
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,008
You got hospitalized.

109
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:14,800
It's okay. I'm used to it.

110
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,700
In fact, people know me here.

111
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,604
Because every time I'm sick,

112
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,099
I stay here.

113
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:25,841
At least I have people here
looking after me.

114
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:27,836
Aww.

115
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:33,974
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
I promise.

116
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,047
Okay?

117
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,877
- Hey.
- Hey.

118
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,961
- How's it going?
- How's it going?

119
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:53,724
- I'm good.
- I'm good.

120
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:57,495
How did it go last night?

121
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:59,223
Were you around
when the ambulance pulled up?

122
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:01,755
You were at the party?

123
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:03,032
Why didn't I see you?

124
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,953
I didn't see you either.

125
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:10,188
I can't remember anything.
Pretty wild last night.

126
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:12,557
I can't remember anything either.

127
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:15,907
But Karla and I talked, and then...

128
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:19,599
Sorry. I forgot
I have to go to Mads.

129
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:21,864
Can we just talk later?

130
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:22,657
All right.

131
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:25,432
I sure missed a lot
of things last night. Even Issa!

132
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:26,032
Hey.

133
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:28,057
Not that kind of 'miss'.
Gibo, pull yourself together!

134
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:28,999
Maybe you didn't get enough sleep?

135
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:30,932
It's not that.

136
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:33,244
No extreme diet
you're trying out?

137
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:34,307
No.

138
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:37,449
Rub this on your temples
and take whiffs of it, too.

139
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:40,391
Drink plenty of water.
You're probably just dehydrated.

140
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,854
Do you often feel faint?

141
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:45,894
It's been more frequent lately.

142
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,116
But I have anemia and PCOS,
so that could be related.

143
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:51,346
I'm taking my medicine, though.

144
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:52,141
Ah, okay.

145
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,366
Better to consult with a doctor.

146
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,167
You probably just need
to adjust your treatment.

147
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,759
- Okay, nurse.
- Okay.

148
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:03,141
Students,

149
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:07,891
it has come to our attention
that there was a party last night.

150
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:14,219
Not only that, there was one student
casualty in that unsanctioned event.

151
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:18,528
Let me just remind everyone
that though this is not illegal,

152
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:24,636
we do not encourage such get-togethers
especially without adult supervision.

153
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,813
You're in senior high now.

154
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:32,175
Think carefully about your actions
because they will affect your future.

155
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:35,964
Always exercise discretion and control!

156
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:42,784
Karla.

157
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:43,974
Karla!

158
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:45,157
Stop it!

159
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,447
What's this? Huh?

160
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:48,994
What the fuck is this?

161
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,103
Can't you scratch your own itch?

162
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:51,387
That's nothing!

163
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:52,722
Nothing?

164
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:54,177
Are you trying to insult me?

165
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:56,016
You think I can't drop you
whenever I want?

166
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,824
Don't think you can use this against me.

167
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:01,766
I'm gonna end this on my fucking terms
because I am the man here!

168
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:03,424
I call the shots, not you!

169
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:06,430
Why? Why is it always you?

170
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:08,544
Because you're a fucking kid!

171
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:09,986
Is that all I am to you?

172
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:11,822
Because you're acting like a child.

173
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:15,164
I thought I was just there
to give you directions.

174
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,689
To help you. I thought
you could be what I need.

175
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:20,097
No, please. Lem!

176
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:23,255
I'm sorry. Please.
I really need you right now.

177
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,367
Sorry?

178
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:28,892
I don't need this right now.

179
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:38,705
Okay, guys.

180
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:41,807
We're at the final leg
of the drafting season.

181
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:42,856
All right, listen.

182
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:44,766
We have a good problem.

183
00:10:45,823 --> 00:10:47,490
You guys really put on a show.

184
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:51,891
But not everyone makes the team.

185
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:52,988
Okay?

186
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:56,596
Only one reserve player.
The rest will be trainees.

187
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:58,117
But here's the thing.

188
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:02,187
Only the official members of the team will
be eligible for the athletic scholarship.

189
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:05,699
So get your prayers in
and may the best players win.

190
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:07,474
So, guys, do your drills!

191
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:09,199
Let's go!

192
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:10,224
Let's go!

193
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:13,849
Hi, love.

194
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:19,086
Hello.

195
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:26,116
I brought bread, fruits,
and instant noodles for you.

196
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:29,349
If you're feeling hungry
at night, just grab some.

197
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,016
Aww, thank you.

198
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:32,221
You're welcome.

199
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:37,629
This is good for three days but if
you get extended, I'll stock up more.

200
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:40,474
Ugh, three days. Hassle.

201
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,602
I'll miss a lot in school.
Even in the org.

202
00:11:45,086 --> 00:11:46,711
Nevermind that. Leave it to me.

203
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:47,986
I'll cover for you.

204
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:49,143
Okay?

205
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:52,157
The notes and readings, sure.

206
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:54,521
But what about the party?

207
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:57,898
I won't make it in time for the
campaign period for student council.

208
00:11:57,953 --> 00:12:03,578
Imagine all those volunteer work
and those educational sessions.

209
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,357
It's all for nothing.

210
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,528
And my dad is expecting me
to get a position.

211
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:12,294
Can you have a proxy?

212
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,559
You mean 'sub'?

213
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,626
Ah, yes. That's what I meant.

214
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:24,416
I'll be the first runner-up
while the grand champion is recuperating.

215
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:29,682
When you're all better,
I'll pass you the crown.

216
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:31,205
Just like that.

217
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:33,273
I'm not sure.

218
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:37,807
No worries.

219
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:40,016
I'll think of something.

220
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:41,699
Let me handle it for you.

221
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:43,354
Just focus on getting better,

222
00:12:43,518 --> 00:12:48,019
and I'll focus on doing
better in the party. Deal?

223
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:55,157
While that's broken,
I'll content myself with this.

224
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,557
Oh no, love.

225
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:04,392
Okay, guys.

226
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:09,001
Today we will be announcing the official
members of the Harmon High Basketball Team.

227
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:12,271
Here we go. In no particular order.

228
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:13,213
Let's go.

229
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:14,238
Hidalgo.

230
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,071
Boom.

231
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,065
Asistio.

232
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:18,491
Thanks, coach.

233
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:20,016
Okay. Bautista.

234
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:22,141
Chua.

235
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,178
Lustre.

236
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,057
Let's go!

237
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:27,082
Mariano.

238
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,432
Tolentino!

239
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:31,528
Ordonez.

240
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,574
Yes

241
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,641
Perez.

242
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:36,474
De Guzman.

243
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:38,297
Sy!

244
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:39,345
Yes, coach!

245
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,157
Nolasco, Jr.

246
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:45,241
And our sole reserve is…

247
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:46,099
That's you for sure.

248
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:48,203
Gomez.

249
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:51,677
The rest of you, trainees.

250
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,031
Dude, that’s okay.

251
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:56,949
Sorry, man.

252
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:58,824
There must be another way.
You'll figure it out, man.

253
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:02,557
Okay. So now, we will be announcing
your next practice schedule.

254
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,541
For now, okay, guys, party. Party up.

255
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:06,557
See if you can talk to coach.

256
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:08,290
For sure, man.

257
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:11,315
Find a way, okay?

258
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:13,532
You'll get in, for sure.
Just talk to coach.

259
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:14,682
Go on!

260
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:19,554
Coach, can I ask for Gomez's standing?

261
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:23,062
I was thinking maybe
you could pick me as reserve instead.

262
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,875
I'm fine to take that spot.

263
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,355
Well, you're not lazy.

264
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,422
I really need that scholarship, too.

265
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,412
We'll see what we can do.

266
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,493
See me at the office.

267
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,091
Really, sir?

268
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:42,719
Thank you!

269
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:44,366
Karla, Karla. Wait.

270
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:45,974
Sorry to ask you this.

271
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:47,645
I hope...

272
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,056
I mean...

273
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:50,998
No offense...

274
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,398
Did something happen
between us last night?

275
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:54,979
Jog my memory!

276
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:57,649
Or we can just do it again.
I'm game!

277
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,333
Gibo!

278
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
Yes.

279
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,461
Really?

280
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,395
As in… sex?

281
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:29,324
Sex, all the way, homerun,
exchanging body fluids level?

282
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:32,141
Shit! I wasn't wearing anything last night.

283
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,532
I meant protection.
I had nothing on, right?

284
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:38,891
Raw? Raw meat!
We really stayed on the grind!

285
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,082
Shit, shit, shit!

286
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:41,724
Sorry, my bad.

287
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:44,687
It's not that I have regrets
or anything, but…

288
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:50,299
I simply meant whatever happens,

289
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,266
I'll take responsibility.

290
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,057
Face up, stand up,
kneel, anything!

291
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:55,457
Gibo, you're overreacting.

292
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,313
No, I just wanted to reassure you.

293
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:04,853
Karla, I just want you to know
that I'm here whenever you need me.

294
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:07,133
Okay.

295
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:08,403
Karla.

296
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,741
Does this mean…

297
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:15,182
We're back together?
That we'll do it again? Come on!

298
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,247
Or did it mean nothing?

299
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,664
Like it's just a casual thing to you?

300
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,713
Sorry but I'm really confused.

301
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,200
I don't know either.

302
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:27,895
Maybe.

303
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:30,599
It's a maybe.

304
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:33,874
A maybe? Even though
we almost made a baby?

305
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,298
We need to start the campaign now.

306
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:38,704
Wait a second. Where the hell is Max?

307
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,099
Present, sir.

308
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:42,361
I'll present on his behalf.

309
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:43,665
You know, proxy.

310
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,007
We're still at the filing stage,

311
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:48,601
he's still a running candidate
and already there's a substitution?

312
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:51,436
If he's going to play it like that,
let's just drop him!

313
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:52,503
Heck no!

314
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:55,352
Luke. Look here.

315
00:16:55,485 --> 00:17:00,193
Swear on the bones of the cow
my daddy butchered,

316
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:02,927
I'll fight to the death for this party.

317
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:06,459
If you're going to drop Maximus,
I won't stop you.

318
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:08,700
But let me run in his place.

319
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,529
That way I'll fight his fight
under my name.

320
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:15,385
I have something
our opponent doesn't have.

321
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:19,516
The softness, the strength, the charms…

322
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:22,211
and most importantly, the heart.

323
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:26,353
My victory is your victory.

324
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,103
Mark my words.

325
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:31,408
So give me a chance to take charge.

326
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:35,953
Bet on me, Mavic Lagdameo!

327
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:39,030
And I, thank you!

328
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:44,283
Oh, hey. I made you smile.

329
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:45,696
Don't deny it.

330
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,016
All right, let's give it a shot.

331
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:50,404
But I'm telling you now,

332
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:52,092
it won't be easy.

333
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:54,016
I'll grind you down for preps.

334
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:55,672
Grind me, you say?

335
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:57,047
Bring it on!

336
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:58,361
Try me.

337
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:20,182
Ugh. Fuck.

338
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,570
Hey! Be careful.

339
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,070
You might fall.

340
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,125
Wes.

341
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:34,203
What are you doing here?

342
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:36,891
Did you think Mavic
would just leave you without anybody?

343
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:38,896
She asked me to look
after you, of course.

344
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:39,804
Here.

345
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:42,319
Don't you have class?

346
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:44,741
Technically, I don’t.

347
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:49,224
I have something with the choir
but what I did was this.

348
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:53,063
So I told them I'll go to
the hospital for a checkup

349
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:55,382
and who knew I'd find you here, too?

350
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,724
What are the odds of that?

351
00:18:57,749 --> 00:19:00,224
So just relax. I'm here now.

352
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,083
Come, let's sit you up.

353
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
There we go.

354
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:10,427
Sorry, but when was the last time
you took a shower?

355
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:18,544
Hey, Issa! Did you wait long?

356
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,241
Ah, yeah. I'm almost done, though.

357
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:21,016
I'll go ahead.

358
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,444
Ah, wait. Give me five minutes.
I have news for you.

359
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:27,057
I already know.

360
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:29,187
I read your status.

361
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:31,094
That was fast.

362
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:35,557
Well, for the record, that's it for now.
Karla and I are still complicated.

363
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:36,891
Nothing's for sure.

364
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,969
But you must be sure enough of something
to change your status.

365
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,699
Well, anyway, congrats.

366
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:46,807
I'm so happy for you guys.

367
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:52,669
I guess that's that. Thanks for the effort,
but now that you're sort of back together,

368
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:54,880
I'll have to avoid any more complications.

369
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:58,432
So can you please stop
with the flowers and letters?

370
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:01,345
What flowers and letters?

371
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,470
The ones you left on the bike?

372
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:06,552
Huh?

373
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:10,733
Ah, nothing, nothing.
Forget I said all that.

374
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:13,057
Forget I said anything.
Except for the congratulations.

375
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:15,689
I hope you're happy, Gibo.

376
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,173
- What are you...
- I'll go ahead.

377
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:19,351
Issa, why did you assume?

378
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:20,266
Hey.

379
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:26,396
Flowers? Letters?
Is she dropping hints?

380
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:28,713
Is she telling me
she wants to receive them?

381
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:31,802
Just tell me straight up. Jeez.

382
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:34,072
Okay, again.

383
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:35,472
Whenever you're delivering your speech,

384
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:37,258
look at the audience,

385
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:41,085
don't forget to breathe in, and…

386
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,622
Don't forget to pose!

387
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,830
Pause.

388
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:49,382
You'll stop
when you do a pose, too.

389
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:50,643
Same-same.

390
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:53,266
Here.

391
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,657
This is our sample ballot.

392
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:02,057
On election day, the Chronicle
will be alert for beats for sure.

393
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:05,252
So show up early and
get your photo taken.

394
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:08,202
That way, you'll be the first one
to show up on people's media feed.

395
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:11,141
Alright, let's try.

396
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:13,213
Let's practice.

397
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:16,016
And then?

398
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,041
You ready?

399
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:20,022
Okay, do it.

400
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:24,966
Project.

401
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:28,352
Smile for the press.

402
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:30,220
Go on.

403
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:32,576
Shoot the ballot.

404
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:46,674
Oh my gosh! I'm sorry.

405
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:50,161
We're good for today.

406
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:51,891
Yeah.

407
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,224
I think we have a winner.

408
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:56,266
I mean…

409
00:22:56,735 --> 00:22:58,462
We'll win this for sure.

410
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:01,673
I meant I will win. Sorry.

411
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,478
All right.

412
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,704
Shit, shit, shit, fuck.

413
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:11,189
Steady. I don't bite.

414
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:13,759
Well, sometimes I do.

415
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:16,141
Sorry.

416
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,142
- There's nobody...
- Family?

417
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:20,563
I get it.

418
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,736
Mavic already told me.

419
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:26,766
And you don't have
to feel sorry for yourself.

420
00:23:26,963 --> 00:23:28,542
Not like you're destitute.

421
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:31,945
I've never engaged in self-pity.

422
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,224
Luh, luh, luh, said the turkey.

423
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:38,438
Your mouth says something

424
00:23:38,463 --> 00:23:41,714
but everything else says
something differently.

425
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:46,205
What everything else?

426
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:52,099
Your eyes, your eyebrow…

427
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:58,891
And your voice thins out
whenever you get defensive.

428
00:24:00,112 --> 00:24:03,432
I think you were hurt
really badly, Maximus.

429
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:07,258
So you cover up your feelings
even before you can feel them.

430
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:11,641
And whoever hurt you,
I hope they lose their sense of taste.

431
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:13,932
You don't have to worry.

432
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,940
I won't hurt you, okay?

433
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,891
You don't have to be defensive.

434
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,309
Wow.

435
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,915
I didn't even say much.

436
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,974
How did you get all that
from there's nobody?

437
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:33,893
I don't know. Intuition,
divine intervention, whatever.

438
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:38,495
All I know is, we click.

439
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,659
Got something in your ear. Hang on.

440
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,141
Sorry!

441
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:03,961
- That's okay.
- Sorry.

442
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:33,807
If not him, then who?

443
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:47,369
Ah, boss, boss.
Let me get that for you.

444
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:49,519
I might get in trouble, sir.

445
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:50,336
No, it's okay.

446
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:52,111
We can handle it. Thank you.

447
00:25:52,391 --> 00:25:52,932
Okay, thank you.

448
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:54,604
Thank you, sir.

449
00:25:56,716 --> 00:25:59,119
- If you could just bring that out. Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

450
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:03,516
You're doing too much.

451
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,432
I owe you big time. Promise.

452
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:07,391
It's nothing.

453
00:26:07,494 --> 00:26:08,552
Don't worry about it.

454
00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:11,263
Why did you jolt up
like that anyway?

455
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:13,866
You seemed electrified
when I touched your ear.

456
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:15,932
I don't know. Sorry.

457
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,474
Sorry about the mess.

458
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:18,349
That's alright.

459
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:19,616
It was just shampoo, jeez.

460
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:24,641
You're probably the most uptight,
scared little boy I ever met.

461
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,457
It's true!

462
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:28,493
It's like, all your emotions are inwards.

463
00:26:28,518 --> 00:26:29,542
Like you're holding back.

464
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,016
Try to chill.

465
00:26:31,153 --> 00:26:32,198
Let it out.

466
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:34,627
How do I do that?

467
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,781
How indeed?

468
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:41,291
Let's try something.

469
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:43,564
Go along with me.
I think you know this song.

470
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,552

We're taking it slow?

504
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:56,636
Okay, let our lips touch
before our bodies.

505
00:28:57,907 --> 00:29:01,532
Okay, ma'am, our lesson
for today is Biology!

506
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:04,534
Feel all this blood pumping,
I'm ready for it!

507
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:08,766
Do you like that?

508
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:09,516
Of course!

509
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,313
Hell yeah, doggie!

510
00:29:11,338 --> 00:29:16,057
Somebody hold me back,
I wouldn't be able to hold it in!

511
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:17,128
Huh?

512
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:18,474
I don't know!

513
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:21,724
What's with the switch? I'm getting
confused! But strangely turned on!

514
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:23,766
- But it feels good! What's going on?
- Maybe you want me?

515
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,167
I like you, Gibo!

516
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:26,766
I like you, too!

517
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,766
I like that!

518
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:30,253
Keep going!

519
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,182
What a mess!

520
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:33,573
No, you're a mess!

521
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:36,324
Give it to me, Gibo!

522
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:37,948
Are you close, Gibo?

523
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:40,349
I'm gonna explode!

524
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:47,544
Shit!

525
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:49,156
Issa?

526
00:29:52,177 --> 00:29:53,885
That was a wild review.

527
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:56,773
What a long test.

528
00:29:56,987 --> 00:29:58,266
What's with you?

529
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:03,471
You were in a wild mood, too.

530
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,986
You caught me there.

531
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,611
I guess I'm reviewing
this intensely because…

532
00:30:12,716 --> 00:30:14,716
I want to ace the main exam.

533
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Gibo, I think I want to try
to understand my husband more.

534
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:29,164
Actually, me too.
I think we're good.

535
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,557
Is it because of your ex?

536
00:30:35,229 --> 00:30:37,688
You know what,
I know what this is.

537
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:40,635
This will be over soon.

538
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:46,820
But I didn't expect that
I will actually miss you.

539
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:51,641
Yeah, I actually miss you already.

540
00:30:52,638 --> 00:30:54,805
We're still gonna see
each other in class, won't we?

541
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:56,955
Of course!

542
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:59,241
You're not yet done
with your extra hours.

543
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:00,141
Oh, right.

544
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,557
This time, I'll make you
do real work.

545
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:05,888
Wow…

546
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:11,188
I want to say thank you.

547
00:31:12,046 --> 00:31:14,448
Not just for the sex,
but for trusting me.

548
00:31:15,953 --> 00:31:20,589
After that breakup with Karla,
I kept thinking what was missing,

549
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:21,896
what was wrong,

550
00:31:22,783 --> 00:31:26,932
if there's something about me
that made her second guess.

551
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:28,813
Man!

552
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:31,854
So I'm grateful. Really.

553
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:35,743
I found a confidant, a friend in you.

554
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:39,330
You also helped me
gain back my self-confidence.

555
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:41,995
Wait, is this everything we've reviewed?

556
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:43,705
Sounds like it's effective.

557
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:49,870
Well, now we have
to face our own test.

558
00:31:50,104 --> 00:31:54,339
But you have a good heart.
I know you'll do well.

559
00:31:55,524 --> 00:32:00,899
I am telling you, Felize.
You "do" well.

560
00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:04,032
Oh! Wait, I almost forgot...

561
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:07,500
I have something to show you.
Check your phone.

562
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:09,554
Here, I'm sending it to you.

563
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:12,461
There you are.

564
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,899
That's the clean edit.

565
00:32:14,924 --> 00:32:16,341
Send it to your husband.

566
00:32:17,063 --> 00:32:19,104
This is for my eyes only!

567
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:22,044
But why? You have nothing to lose.

568
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,785
Yeah, I do. You.

569
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:28,539
And how you make
me laugh so hard.

570
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:34,632
That's okay. I kept a copy, of couse.
So I can review you.

571
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:37,708
So, you like it?

572
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,450
It's something, huh? I told you.

573
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,875
- That was fun.
- Yeah.

574
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:44,479
Sing it to win it!

575
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,254
You just gained a new song
in your karaoke arsenal!

576
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:51,837
Well, not really.

577
00:32:51,895 --> 00:32:53,895
I don't sing karaoke.

578
00:32:54,195 --> 00:32:55,372
At all?

579
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:58,063
- No… - You've never done
karaoke in this country?

580
00:32:58,088 --> 00:33:01,849
May God have mercy on your soul.

581
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:04,703
So, what? What? Keep grinning.

582
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:07,432
You're turning up your charm,
are you, sad boy?

583
00:33:07,457 --> 00:33:09,207
Hey, I'm not a sad boy.

584
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,375
Well, that is up for debate.

585
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:18,828
But you know what, in all honesty,
you're good. I think you're okay.

586
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,562
And you're cuter when you're carefree.

587
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:25,617
In fairness, you're not so bad yourself.

588
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:29,096
Not so bad? Wasn't I great before?

589
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:31,205
Not so bad? A little bad?
What's that?

590
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,266
Like fat? From eating
all that extra rice?

591
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,083
What are you talking about?

592
00:33:35,494 --> 00:33:37,625
No, not bad. I mean not bad.

593
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:40,774
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

594
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:45,883
Shit, shit! Come on!

595
00:33:46,677 --> 00:33:47,750
Answer your phone!

596
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:51,142
Sorry, sir. I didn't know
you were here.

597
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:55,064
Issa. Sorry you had to hear that.

598
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,078
My girlfriend's ignoring my calls.

599
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:02,453
Ah, sorry. Too much information.

600
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:07,945
That's okay, sir.
Like you said, more information...

601
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,161
To counter misinformation.

602
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:12,190
I see you're doing good sa Chronicles.

603
00:34:13,477 --> 00:34:14,891
That sigh was a notch too deep.

604
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:18,593
Did you do something
for her to ignore you?

605
00:34:19,794 --> 00:34:21,544
I think it's about what I didn't do.

606
00:34:22,203 --> 00:34:23,203
I get it.

607
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,861
Or she finally came to her senses.

608
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:30,451
So, Issa, don't go out there
breaking hearts, okay?

609
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:40,322
I can take it from here.
Go on, you may go.

610
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:54,539
Issa's still here? Should I wait
for her? What, like a boyfriend?

611
00:35:00,977 --> 00:35:01,977
Yes!

612
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:19,142
Fuck.

613
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:43,783
Looking for me?

614
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,247
Issa?

615
00:35:52,242 --> 00:35:53,250
Issa.

616
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,599
Hunter.

617
00:35:58,497 --> 00:36:00,330
You need to report Coach right now.

618
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:03,063
No.

619
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:04,629
I need the scholarship.

620
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:06,283
So, what?

621
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,491
You're just gonna let him
get away with this?

622
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:11,330
You've been on the team for so long!

623
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:14,557
You might even see each other in college.

624
00:36:14,844 --> 00:36:16,391
You're just gonna suck it up?

625
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:18,356
For the scholarship?

626
00:36:19,149 --> 00:36:21,117
I'm embarrassed, okay?

627
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:24,344
I'm ashamed to go this low!

628
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:29,088
And because I'm such
an idiot... Fuck!

629
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,461
I'm pissed off.

630
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:33,884
But what can I do?

631
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:38,078
I'm so stupid!

632
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:44,057
Hunter, it's not your fault.

633
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,983
None of it is your fault, okay?

634
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:49,307
Sorry about earlier, alright?

635
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:51,273
I lost my cool.

636
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:54,007
Everything got confusing.

637
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:57,469
Can we clear things up first?

638
00:36:59,588 --> 00:37:06,130
What happened last night? Huh?
I've been trying to call you several times.

639
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:07,526
You weren't answering.

640
00:37:09,223 --> 00:37:12,015
And you usually don't do that, right?

641
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,415
You usually answer my calls.

642
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:16,854
I just treated you the same way
you treated me

643
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:18,524
when you were at that party.

644
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:20,367
So now we're even.

645
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:22,617
So we're just gonna keep
getting back at each other?

646
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:27,039
You'll list all my sins
and use them against me?

647
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:31,450
If I'm getting back with somebody,
it won't be you.

648
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:33,697
And who would that be?

649
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:35,016
Your ex?

650
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:36,477
Huh?

651
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:39,243
Did you finally kiss?

652
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:41,114
Did you finally have sex?

653
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:44,399
Did you also moan like with me?

654
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:50,484
Get this through your head.
You're mine.

655
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,333
Someone might see.

656
00:37:56,695 --> 00:37:58,461
I don't care. Got it?

657
00:37:59,016 --> 00:38:00,016
You're mine.

658
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:05,297
How do you know
which person is being true to you?

659
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,119
Is it the person
who's seen you stark naked?

660
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:13,844
The person who fully embraces you
with all your baggage,

661
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:15,255
and your anger?

662
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:17,185
What are we doing here, Issa?

663
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,127
You'll see.

664
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:22,804
Here. You can let go
of all your anger here, okay?

665
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:24,438
Just scream it all out.

666
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:27,174
Nobody will pay you no mind.
If someone comes out, I'll take care of it.

667
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:28,977
So just let it all out, okay?

668
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:30,002
You sure?

669
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:31,819
I'm sure. Watch me go.

670
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:35,599
Go!

671
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:37,932
Louder!

672
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,397
More!

673
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:56,682
Is it the person who goes along
with your crazy ideas?

674
00:39:57,502 --> 00:40:01,752
The person who makes room for your joys…

675
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:14,729
Or the person who waits patiently

676
00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:17,729
until you can take the
first step hand-in-hand,

677
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:20,352
and rise together towards success?

678
00:40:20,414 --> 00:40:23,419
She sure is taking her time.
I'm starving.

679
00:40:23,444 --> 00:40:25,766
Maybe she's just
leading me on as usual.

680
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,973
Karla. Where the heck are you?

681
00:40:27,998 --> 00:40:29,790
I think she just ghosted me again.

682
00:40:29,815 --> 00:40:34,065
I swear, Karla. You sure are consistent.
You keep leaving me hanging.

683
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,958
Who are you going to choose?

684
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:40,313
The person who's always by your side?

685
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:45,156
Or the person who only shows up
when they need something?

686
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:50,781
The truth is, I don't need
titles, or power.

687
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:53,892
Because I'm empowered all on my own!

688
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:57,505
But I want to serve you.

689
00:40:57,758 --> 00:41:00,049
I want to put a smile on your face.

690
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:03,880
All my actions will have you in mind.

691
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:07,200
So please give me a chance
to champion your causes.

692
00:41:07,572 --> 00:41:08,771
Harmon High,

693
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:14,037
this is Maria Victoria Lagdameo,
your champion!

694
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,638
And I, thank you!

695
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:37,705
Tell me what you think
of my speech, love, okay?

696
00:41:37,866 --> 00:41:41,074
Love, the campaign's settled.
I'll tell you about it later.

697
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,699
I filed for candidacy.
But this is for you, love.

698
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:47,045
Have you eaten?
Love? Hey?

699
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:01,766
Alright, go to sleep.

700
00:42:13,466 --> 00:42:14,841
Max…

701
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,254
It's you.

702
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:58,074
Harmon High, I want to serve you.

703
00:42:58,099 --> 00:42:59,891
This is not something
you'll get through on your own.

704
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:01,248
I won't be on my own.

705
00:43:02,432 --> 00:43:03,641
You'll be here, right?

706
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,407
Who are you dating?

707
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:07,224
Is it that slut, Issa?

708
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:08,641
Do you prefer her over me?

709
00:43:08,724 --> 00:43:09,807
Yes, fine!

710
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:11,682
I think you should
break it off with Gibo.

711
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:12,932
Why?

712
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,541
Are you jealous?

713
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:16,695
Are you really just messing with me?

714
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:18,631
You want to ruin my life?

715
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:20,102
Answer me!

716
00:43:20,127 --> 00:43:22,006
Where would I hide?

717
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:28,200
Wes!

718
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:29,994
Help! Emergency!

719
00:43:31,307 --> 00:43:32,391
Ah... Let's break up.
