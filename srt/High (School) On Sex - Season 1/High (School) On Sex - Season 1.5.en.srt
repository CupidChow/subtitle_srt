1
00:00:07,162 --> 00:00:09,287
Didn't you ever think
of getting a taste of me?

2
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:12,062
No! Because you're not meant
to be used or tried out, Issa.

3
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,829
You're not just a phase or a quick shag.

4
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,187
That's it! Oh, yes!

5
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:17,200
Oh! Oh! More!

6
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:25,391
Address your students properly
whomever he or she may be.

7
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:28,286
Harmon! Who here thinks
they can take me on?

8
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,333
I challenge you!

9
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:38,937
Your eyes are puffy.

10
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:40,893
Look at me properly.

11
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:53,687
What did you see
that night at the retreat?

12
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:03,314
Bryce?

13
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:05,038
What...

14
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:07,349
What are you doing?

15
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,106
Aren't you ashamed?

16
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:11,271
Why should I be ashamed?

17
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,513
Would you rather I cheated on you?

18
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:15,966
Stop that!

19
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:17,135
Then finish it for me.

20
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:19,046
Stop!

21
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,021
I'm almost done.

22
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:22,057
Please do it.

23
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:25,807
That's it.

24
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:28,455
That's right.

25
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,122
Match the rhythm.

26
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:32,943
Like this?

27
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:34,851
Should I go faster?

28
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:36,358
Fuck.

29
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:37,008
There we go.

30
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,437
Faster?

31
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,666
I'm coming!

32
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:52,323
I missed this.

33
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:54,020
That's the latest viral video, Mads.

34
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:57,170
And the sharers are already tagging us.

35
00:02:57,838 --> 00:03:00,338
Are you sure this happened in Harmon?

36
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:01,861
Yes, Mads.

37
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:06,217
You can see from the background,
the hallways, the lockers…

38
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:11,326
I'm fairly certain because
I watched it over and over,

39
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:13,604
fast-forwarding, rewinding,
looping, zooming in.

40
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,754
I almost ran out of battery.

41
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,365
Okay, I will look into this.

42
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,349
Thank you, sister.

43
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:22,104
And remember, in veritas,

44
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:23,396
- Burat!
- Curat!

45
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:24,091
Ah, Curat!

46
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:25,896
Wow, it's so big!

47
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:28,354
It's not that big, come on!

48
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,212
Oops, don't get too excited!
You'll choke!

49
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,283
Gibo, why did you do that?

50
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:36,456
Do what? I didn’t do anything.

51
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:37,799
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,225
Fine. Nothing.

53
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:43,356
Thanks for nothing.

54
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:47,684
And trust me, I saw nothing.

55
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:50,059
Giborat!

56
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:52,021
- I saw your...
- Shh!

57
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:54,427
Oh, what, you're gonna deny me, honey?

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,079
You can't hide anything from me!
We showered together when we were little.

59
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,062
I know all your high and low notes.

60
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:01,521
Bro, Issa can hear you.

61
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:03,614
She's a big girl now. Aren't you?

62
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,181
By the way, see you
later at my party? Alright?

63
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,746
Check your phones.

64
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,979
It should come up right… now?

65
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:13,963
- There it is.
- Got mine, too.

66
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:15,205
- Yup, yup, yup.
- I'll check it later.

67
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,062
Okay, see you later?

68
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:18,687
Of course, bro!

69
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:20,379
Also, trim. Bye!

70
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:23,489
Trim?

71
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,044
Trim what?

72
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:33,661
Students, unsavory and indecent videos
are becoming widespread across campus.

73
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:35,561
We are very concerned.

74
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:38,989
We will not tolerate the
proliferation of these videos.

75
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:42,639
Not only are these damaging both to
the person in the video and the university,

76
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:44,747
it also reflects negatively on the
people watching and sharing it.

77
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:46,272
Pinay Port! Winner!

78
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,989
Hashtag Harmon Dicks!

79
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:52,343
You think this is funny?

80
00:04:53,114 --> 00:04:54,780
Go on, then, laugh all you want

81
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:59,055
while your souls
burn in fire and sulfur!

82
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:02,911
Now, as I was saying...

83
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:05,437
Technology must be used wisely.

84
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:11,268
So now, we will be having
specialized sessions on media literacy.

85
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:13,393
Required for all strands.

86
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:17,044
We will also have workshops
on Gender Sensitivity Training, okay?

87
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:19,950
Go ahead. Go forth and stop multiplying.

88
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:20,975
Good morning.

89
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:29,325
Okay, I'm glad to fill in for Mr. Ruiz.

90
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:32,185
I'm not glad with the
papers you've submitted.

91
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,108
Your eyeballs are gonna fall off.

92
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,325
You're into him, aren't you?

93
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:38,236
I'm not!

94
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:40,771
Okay, has everyone read
the text uploaded on J-Drive?

95
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:41,812
Hunter. Seriously?
Let's talk. I miss you.

96
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:43,104
- Yes, sir!
- Hey.

97
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:44,462
- Good.
- Hunter?

98
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:02,812
You reading this? Me, too.

99
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,403
The fuck?

100
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:17,679
Excuse me?

101
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:22,951
The facts are right, sir.

102
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,660
That's it for today, class.

103
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:30,841
And also, please submit a reflection piece
on our topic by Thursday.

104
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,166
Don’t forget to cite your sources.

105
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:38,579
And also, keep direct
quotations to a minimum.

106
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:40,187
Thank you. Class dismissed.

107
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:41,843
Thank you, sir.

108
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,630
Karla?

109
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,731
Please assist me to
the faculty room, please.

110
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,151
For your class papers.

111
00:06:56,454 --> 00:07:02,621
I'm so confused. From "love you" to
"who are you?" Now she's reaching out?

112
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,864
And what's with "hey"? The hell?

113
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,140
Hey, Cheesy's getting fat.

114
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:11,123
I think it's your turn to feed him.

115
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:14,885
Hey.

116
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,802
What's bothering you now?

117
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:20,271
Hey!

118
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:21,962
Ah. Sorry, sorry.

119
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:27,788
Karla texted me last night.
She said, hey.

120
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,825
What did you say?

121
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,159
Nothing.

122
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,580
Why didn't you say anything?

123
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:35,981
What am I supposed to say?
After what she did?

124
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:39,010
She played me a while ago,
now she just did the same to you.

125
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,369
I don't get why she
didn't tell Mads the truth.

126
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:43,769
So are those the facts?

127
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,202
That's your headline?

128
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,783
She broke your heart,
now she's dropping hints.

129
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:52,632
Or… What the Hey?

130
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:55,978
But what's your issue?

131
00:07:57,072 --> 00:08:01,405
Why do you think
you're bothered right now?

132
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,525
All right, let's do a profile.

133
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,342
Why do you think she
would text you out of the blue?

134
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,562
Well, if we're talking about the old Karla,

135
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:17,733
she wouldn't drop hints for no reason.

136
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:19,887
Maybe she needs something.

137
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:22,287
It must be important.

138
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:25,479
Am I wrong? Should I
have gotten back with her?

139
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,799
No, don't do that.

140
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:31,684
Pick me instead.

141
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:33,932
I want you to be mine.

142
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:19,739
Hey, Issa.

143
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:21,544
What happened?

144
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:25,213
Ah! Sorry, sorry, my
tummy's acting up again.

145
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:26,822
Your tummy's so sensitive.

146
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:28,639
It's stealing my thunder.

147
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,619
Anyways, so what should I do?

148
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:33,560
Should I text her back?

149
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,311
Should I reply to her?

150
00:09:36,757 --> 00:09:37,757
Your call.

151
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:47,635
About the party last night,
I couldn't get out of it, okay?

152
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,447
My seniors invited me
so I couldn't say no.

153
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:55,264
Plus, I also needed to socialize.

154
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:57,205
For connections.

155
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:00,325
So please stop stalking me
on social media.

156
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:04,213
Think about what I said
about being independent.

157
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,112
There's a bigger world out there beyond us.

158
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,632
Beyond senior high.

159
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:11,679
What are your plans?

160
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:16,859
So what's this?
Silent treatment?

161
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:19,330
Say something.

162
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:21,522
Why should I?
We're on break, right?

163
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,916
Your actions make it pretty clear.

164
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:26,233
I get it. Message received.

165
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,455
I should focus on myself.

166
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,893
And about my plans,
that's none of your business.

167
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,126
I don't need to ask
for your permission.

168
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:34,705
Are you done, sir?

169
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,455
Okay, class... While
looking at your partner,

170
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,932
study your face very closely.

171
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:54,338
Their features, the shape
of their eyes, lips, nose…

172
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:59,130
Now, try to draw your partner.

173
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:16,038
Is it me or you like me in a playground,
immature kind of way?

174
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:17,855
Or are you just annoyed at my face?

175
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:20,979
It's just an add-on.

176
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:25,124
And excuse me,
you're not my type.

177
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,669
Ah, a leslie!
So what's your issue?

178
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:30,945
What add-on? Oh! I know.

179
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,845
Got a free coupon
for hate parade?

180
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:38,002
Forget it. You won't
be able to handle it.

181
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:39,194
Ouch!

182
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:41,074
Go ahead. Try me.

183
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:42,702
I can take it. Spill the tea.

184
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:43,727
You sure?

185
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,138
All right, then.

186
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:52,494
I'm annoyed at how you parade yourself
and how all these people respond.

187
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:56,927
You can be open about your sexuality
because at the end of the day,

188
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:58,243
you're still a man.

189
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:01,989
But for us non-binaries
in female bodies,

190
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,514
or 'lesbians' as you like to call it,

191
00:12:06,763 --> 00:12:08,026
acceptance is not that easy.

192
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:09,354
Okay.

193
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,528
I get it.

194
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:15,687
Hate on the patriarchy
but don't hate on me, bitch.

195
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,291
Double bitch.

196
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:20,066
Rub-a-dub-dub,
two bitches in a tub.

197
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:21,716
Temptation Island!

198
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:33,966
Mine!

199
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:46,788
Issa, are you okay?

200
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:49,313
Hey, guys. Move away.
Let's give her some space.

201
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,898
That'll teach you not
to take what isn't yours.

202
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,381
So you don't get hurt.

203
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:57,341
What's mine is mine.

204
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:15,701
Good! Good.

205
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:16,726
Thank you.

206
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:20,751
This time, share about yourself.

207
00:13:21,528 --> 00:13:27,236
Start by giving one word.
Describe yourself.

208
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Go first.

209
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:31,028
Fluid.

210
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:34,202
Not quite there.

211
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:35,436
Or, floating.

212
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:39,513
One word. And give a better description.
I could mistake you for a whale.

213
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,283
No, let me explain.

214
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:42,100
Okay.

215
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,208
How I identify
and how I express myself...

216
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:48,009
it's hazy even in my category.

217
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:51,049
So I feel displaced.

218
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:52,032
Okay?

219
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:53,342
To be honest, us...

220
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,992
Lipstick lesbians.

221
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:56,231
Femme.

222
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,223
We have become a minority.

223
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,654
Did somebody mention Bortialand?

224
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,134
I'll let you understand.

225
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:08,444
These boys somehow think that if
they'd bed us, we'll turn into real women.

226
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:10,314
As if we don't get laid more than they do.

227
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,688
Butch lesbians on the other hand,

228
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:16,990
feel they're more lesbians just because
they present themselves more as male.

229
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:20,353
When they're courting,
it's okay to be aggressive.

230
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:24,201
But if we do it, they say it's a turn-off
and it doesn't suit us.

231
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:25,976
Okay, okay, I get it.

232
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:33,001
So there are less lesbians,
and lesbians?

233
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:38,427
But I don't get it.
Why don't you just unfriend them?

234
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:43,146
Yes, except my girl friends,
when I came out to them,

235
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:45,771
they have this idea
that I'm into ALL girls.

236
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:47,479
So they avoided me.

237
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,646
So, there. That's why I said 'floating'.

238
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:52,979
Okay. Okay, Okay.

239
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:56,421
So guys, butch lesbians, girls
all have a problem with you,

240
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:59,737
and once again, gay saves the day.

241
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:02,137
So, tell me.

242
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:06,846
What's this floaty femme's anchor?

243
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,900
You know what? I just
wish that they'd understand...

244
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:15,258
that I'm just a girly girl who gets
turned on by the right girly-girls.

245
00:15:15,283 --> 00:15:16,283
Period.

246
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,460
Okay. Interesting.

247
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:23,497
Tell you what. Are you
free tonight, floaty femme?

248
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:25,553
Why, what do you have for me?

249
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:33,067
I think I may just have
the perfect girly-girl for you.

250
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:35,440
Game.

251
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:09,143
Dude, dude, dude.

252
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:10,965
Sucks when you slip.

253
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,156
- Come on, come on.
- Got it.

254
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:14,484
We'll get them next time.

255
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,690
Right on, man.

256
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:18,411
Okay, good game. Good game.

257
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:23,144
We'll have two more games to decide
who among you boys has got what it takes.

258
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:26,642
Check back for the schedule
of the next varsity practice.

259
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,917
Before that,

260
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,780
play on your own, okay.

261
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:34,812
Know what I mean?
Keep scoring.

262
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:38,779
Keep doing the drills so
the next time I see you,

263
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,716
and we go one-on-one,

264
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:46,713
you'll know your real standing. Okay?

265
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:49,177
Yes, coach.

266
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:50,729
Yes, coach!

267
00:16:50,838 --> 00:16:53,008
- Thank you, coach.
- Okay. See you.

268
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:54,190
See you, coach.

269
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,628
See you, coach.

270
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:58,604
See me at the office, Nolasco.

271
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,619
Are you okay?

272
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,215
What happened to you?

273
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:08,322
Nothing, I just need an icebag.

274
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:09,680
All right. Wait here.

275
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:22,755
Issa, you okay?

276
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:26,075
I would be if your girlfriend
wasn't going after my ass.

277
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,486
Can you just tell her there's
nothing going on between us?

278
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:32,858
But technically...

279
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:34,870
Hunter, I've forgiven you.

280
00:17:35,627 --> 00:17:37,752
But that doesn't mean
I'll forget what you did.

281
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:41,046
You can't just ruin my life
then suddenly we're buddies?

282
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:43,780
We're good,
but we're not friends, okay?

283
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:47,179
Whoever said that's a bad thing?

284
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:49,663
Nobody. I just don't
think it's going to work.

285
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:54,051
I might have thought of it before
the fake account and the scandal,

286
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,942
but that time has passed.

287
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,978
Our chance has passed.

288
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
Sorry if it took me
a while to man up.

289
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:02,522
Sorry, too.

290
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:05,573
It was just bad timing.

291
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:10,064
So please, let's give it a rest.

292
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:20,146
Yes, coach?

293
00:18:20,728 --> 00:18:22,020
Have a seat.

294
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:28,242
I know that was you
in the video.

295
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:35,549
We're mandated to report
all acts of lasciviousness.

296
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:38,791
That's instant suspension.

297
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:40,896
My, my.

298
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:45,304
This might affect your scholarship.

299
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:53,216
But you know you can
count on me, Nolasco.

300
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:57,112
Especially to my prospective
team members.

301
00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:01,062
Thanks, coach.

302
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,319
So…

303
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,041
What will you give me in return?

304
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:10,456
How about this?

305
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,061
Let's pretend this is a game.

306
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:19,804
Give and take. Teamwork.

307
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:24,794
You wouldn't want
to lose your scholarship,

308
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:29,694
while I wouldn't want to
lose my future star player.

309
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,820
Is that what you want?

310
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:36,854
I want something else.

311
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:41,968
Fuck!

312
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:48,286
Nolasco, teamwork, remember?

313
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:53,202
You know what, coach?
You're right.

314
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:57,396
I’m a scholar. Rector scholar.

315
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:00,379
You could say Father Bo
and I are pretty close.

316
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,257
I wouldn't want to hassle the whole team
in the middle of drafting

317
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:08,425
because we'd lose our coach.

318
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:11,145
It's like you said...

319
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:12,783
Teamwork.

320
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:15,330
So, it's up to you, coach.

321
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:18,850
Is that what you want?

322
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,579
You can't take a joke.

323
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:26,121
You see, I was just confirming
if you're the one in the video.

324
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:27,854
Now I know it's really you!

325
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:28,879
Confirmed.

326
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,299
You know what, nobody's gonna know.

327
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:35,486
Go.

328
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,257
All right, coach. I'll go ahead.

329
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,682
Thanks, coach.

330
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:54,354
Bro, last thirty seconds.

331
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:57,525
Last three points.

332
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:02,937
She-bang! Shoot!

333
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:07,283
Am I right? Saw it with my own eyes.

334
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,162
Exactly.

335
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:16,396
He can keep doing that
because he's not some loverboy.

336
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:19,996
Dude's made of steel. Cold blood.

337
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,621
Unlike your friend who's gone all soft.

338
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,187
He's your friend.

339
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:25,837
Babe, you know all
about strategic positioning.

340
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:26,871
Automatic.

341
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:28,146
Bring that over here.

342
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:29,872
Whoa.

343
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,112
Quit wasting food. These assholes.

344
00:21:38,137 --> 00:21:39,512
Give me your fried chicken.

345
00:21:42,658 --> 00:21:44,241
This is a problem, dude.

346
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:47,807
Suit yours...

347
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:48,832
Guys!

348
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:50,734
You're nuts!

349
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,343
Kendrick, listen to me.

350
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:54,947
We can't be like that.

351
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,309
Everyone's getting dragged into it.

352
00:21:57,737 --> 00:21:58,737
What the hell is this?!

353
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:04,369
That's right. I'm gonna
throw up with all this tension.

354
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:05,394
Calm down.

355
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:07,772
Because of your little quip,

356
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:10,588
our status is taking damage, too.

357
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,483
I got nerds giving me their
lunch money every week.

358
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:19,200
Now they're not even scared anymore.
We're losing our reputation.

359
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:20,266
You said it.

360
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:22,166
I agree.

361
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:29,944
And look, Gia. I'm covered in bruises
from all your pinching!

362
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:31,886
I'm turning into a Dalmatian!

363
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:34,244
Hang on a second. Eyes on me.

364
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,311
Let me ask you guys.

365
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:40,294
Is this an emergency?

366
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,526
Do we need to sit down and talk?

367
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:45,663
You're right.

368
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:48,522
Gia, what do you say?

369
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,497
I don't feel like it.

370
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,997
You should probably feel like it.

371
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:55,537
Gia, please.

372
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:57,479
He's right. Let's do this.

373
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,319
Let's discuss.

374
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:01,841
Sorry for bugging you.

375
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:05,591
I just want to talk. If you're game,
I'll see you at the party later.

376
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:18,193
Sorry, I just needed to check
something in the bathroom.

377
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,345
It's okay, no worries.

378
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:29,912
I have a favor to ask.

379
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:32,356
Sure. Anything.

380
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:37,427
The other day,

381
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:42,333
what you did... I think it worked.

382
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:49,119
I didn't feel so shy around my husband
as much as I used to be.

383
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:55,051
Just enough for me to
see from his point of view.

384
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:00,466
That's great. Good for you.

385
00:24:02,913 --> 00:24:04,747
Yes, that's why…

386
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,638
Gibo, I want you
to take a video of me.

387
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:12,930
Maybe if I saw myself
in the way that he wants,

388
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:14,330
I would understand him more.

389
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:17,851
So capture everything.

390
00:24:19,062 --> 00:24:20,312
All of me.

391
00:24:21,812 --> 00:24:23,146
On video.

392
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:28,693
Okay, okay.

393
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:43,654
Ready, ma'am? Lights, camera…

394
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,470
Shit, I'm gonna ca-cum for sure.
You're such a cocktease, ma'am!

395
00:24:47,495 --> 00:24:52,537
Oh my goodness…

396
00:24:58,021 --> 00:25:01,479
Your cup C's captured on video, wooh!

397
00:25:01,704 --> 00:25:03,079
Go easy, Gibo.

398
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:07,937
Press and focus on your phone,
your live action is coming soon!

399
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:11,130
I feel like joining in.

400
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:18,521
Would you like me to touch you?

401
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,253
Just keep your eyes on me.

402
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:26,385
Let your body react to
what I'm making you feel.

403
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:29,356
But on video,

404
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:32,937
watch me writhe under your hungry eyes.

405
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:39,245
You got my peepers, but
what about my pecker?

406
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,186
You're so unfair.
This is an injustice!

407
00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:49,437
Shit, finger fest.
You're so hands-on, ma'am.

408
00:25:50,835 --> 00:25:51,835
Are you okay?

409
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:56,604
I'm not okay. I'm so mad!

410
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:01,015
You finished?

411
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:07,437
Now that we're off-cam,
make me cum.

412
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:12,062
Make you cum? You got it!
I'm about to blow!

413
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,604
Cum here, ma'am!

414
00:26:13,878 --> 00:26:21,854
Yes, fantasy come true... cum to the board
and rise to ma'am challenge. Delicious!

415
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:44,187
Here's some tissue.

416
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:46,728
There you go.

417
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:48,354
Take what you need.

418
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:52,898
For all the tears
that won't go to waste.

419
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,062
Go Loop, start.

420
00:27:04,452 --> 00:27:05,452
Guys.

421
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:08,718
The bickering ends now.

422
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,466
Break-up, fine.
But our friendship isn't over.

423
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:13,491
True that.

424
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,075
We're wasting away all those moments.

425
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,767
So please, guys, that’s enough.

426
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:23,959
I think, we'll put a stop to all this

427
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:26,526
if we have an open forum right now.

428
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:30,733
Let's just say what we want to say.

429
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:31,758
You know how it goes.

430
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:33,002
Right?

431
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:37,937
Respect each other's opinion.
Don't interrupt, okay?

432
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:38,962
Okay?

433
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:41,318
Hold your judgment till after we're done.

434
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:43,531
- You got that, Gia?
- Okay?

435
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,458
Okay, I'll start.

436
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:47,358
Go ahead.

437
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:50,633
You really hurt me when you
punched me that time, Hunter.

438
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,670
And I don't mean in the physical way.

439
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,002
Right in here, bro.

440
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:00,627
How many times have I
saved your ass in a fight?

441
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,678
He's right.

442
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,203
Huh? How many times?

443
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:04,767
Can't remember?

444
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:09,137
But man, just because
of Issa, that one chick,

445
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,780
you punched me, man.

446
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:13,919
You punched me.

447
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:15,775
My turn, Gia.

448
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,130
You know, sometimes,

449
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,405
I feel like,

450
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,763
your feelings are the
only thing that matters.

451
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:25,865
Jude and I always let
you take center stage.

452
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,848
She's right.

453
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,456
But we're fine with that.

454
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:29,481
Totally.

455
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,611
But sometimes, do you even
stop to ask how we're doing?

456
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,427
Never, right?

457
00:28:38,655 --> 00:28:40,114
Yes, Gia.

458
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,472
What I'm saying is,
you hog the convo.

459
00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:47,702
Sorry not sorry.

460
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:51,131
It's getting a little heavy.

461
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:56,507
So to lighten up the mood a little bit,

462
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:59,041
I just want to say,

463
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:02,807
that I'm thankful for all of you...

464
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:06,040
For the friendship that we have,
this circle that we have...

465
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:09,825
I'm really thankful. You know why?

466
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:12,448
Because if you remember,

467
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:14,848
when things weren't looking
good for me and Ashley,

468
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:18,819
you were there for me.

469
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:25,473
Now that Hunter and Gia are
going through the same thing,

470
00:29:27,054 --> 00:29:30,263
you can bet you got
your friends with you

471
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:32,121
to help you sort things out.

472
00:29:33,028 --> 00:29:35,819
But only if you put in the effort.

473
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:39,119
Gia, Hunter, they're right.

474
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:41,795
Think about it.

475
00:29:43,468 --> 00:29:48,260
Are we just going
to throw all this away?

476
00:29:48,895 --> 00:29:55,228
Kens, Clique, we're a
great fit. Like this. See?

477
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,119
Together, we rule the caf!

478
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,779
We share notes, our lunch, news…

479
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:06,521
And we share our lives, so please…

480
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:10,296
Mommy and daddy,

481
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:13,486
fix this now!

482
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,062
Okay, fine.

483
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:18,653
But Jude, promise us
that when this is over,

484
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:21,011
you're going to trim your
uneven mustache, okay?

485
00:30:21,968 --> 00:30:23,472
We're being serious here.

486
00:30:23,497 --> 00:30:24,914
I'm serious, too.

487
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:26,695
My turn.

488
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:28,583
Please.

489
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,021
I'm sorry, too.

490
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:36,482
I didn't think my breaking up with Gia

491
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,874
would affect everyone.

492
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:45,811
Me, too.

493
00:30:47,565 --> 00:30:49,732
I don't want to lose you guys.

494
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:50,757
Thank you.

495
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,499
Even you, Hunter.

496
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:59,458
Sorry about everything I did
but I'm really jealous of that Issa.

497
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:04,325
Sorry, too. I shouldn't have been
making you jealous while we were dating.

498
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:07,413
But Issa and I are just friends, I promise.

499
00:31:09,874 --> 00:31:11,624
I don't want to lose you guys.

500
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:17,481
And if I have to make up
with Gia as friends,

501
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,377
so we can be complete again,

502
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:22,442
I'll do it.

503
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:24,329
Oh! There we go!

504
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:27,371
So, we're back. I miss you, guys!

505
00:31:27,396 --> 00:31:31,050
Hey, hey, we're not done.
Keep your promise. Shave that.

506
00:31:31,075 --> 00:31:34,616
Sure! As long as you say yes to Loop!

507
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:36,891
I love you guys!

508
00:31:37,085 --> 00:31:38,085
I love you!

509
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:39,592
Easy, bro.

510
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:41,558
You're coming in hot.

511
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:42,924
You're coming in hot.

512
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:45,241
Woo! Now, that's a workout!

513
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:48,896
Mrs. Salva, I got all of
you on record, on loop!

514
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:49,921
Gibo!

515
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:52,421
Hey. What's up, Issa?

516
00:31:52,908 --> 00:31:56,658
Going home? You finished
your extra hours early.

517
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:58,378
Mrs. Salva was really quick about it.

518
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:00,201
Huh?

519
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:03,942
I meant she finished
our video project in a jiffy.

520
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:04,854
That's what I meant to say.

521
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:08,046
So are you going
to the party later?

522
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:12,479
What's with that face?

523
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,241
Man, you really have
a good read on me.

524
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:21,268
So, Karla messaged me.

525
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:24,052
She said we'll talk at the party.

526
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:27,387
Is that why you're going?

527
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:31,874
I just thought, I'd be a
hypocrite if I didn't at least try?

528
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:34,299
I told you that you're more important,

529
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:36,853
that's why I ignored all
those rumours about you.

530
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:40,362
Because I chose to see
the good in you.

531
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,294
And I also encourage you to do that.

532
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,530
So I should stand by my own advice.

533
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:49,445
I need to believe that there
is some good left in Karla.

534
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:52,728
And that she must have a good reason
for wanting to talk to me.

535
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:57,842
I mean, what do I have to
lose if I just hear her out?

536
00:32:58,538 --> 00:33:00,330
Besides, I'm not hurting anybody, right?

537
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:03,694
Yeah, no. You're not hurting anyone.

538
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:06,788
So, see you later?

539
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,315
I don't know. Whatever.

540
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:12,079
Whoa. Hey, Issa!

541
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:13,729
Huh, did I read that right?

542
00:33:13,754 --> 00:33:14,421
I'm off.

543
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:15,835
Is something wrong?

544
00:33:16,387 --> 00:33:17,887
Nah, it can't be.

545
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:20,691
Weird.

546
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:26,598
Close your eyes.

547
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:28,454
I am! Come on, game!

548
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,604
No peeking!

549
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:31,339
I'm not! I'm not!

550
00:33:31,364 --> 00:33:32,364
Can I open my eyes now?

551
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:33,389
Open up!

552
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:36,528
Voila! And boom!

553
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,060
Oh my god! You're gorgeous!

554
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:40,835
Of course.

555
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,860
What's going on?

556
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:43,209
Come on. Let's go.

557
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:46,069
To your coming out part two, floaty femme.

558
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,227
My coming out?

559
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:49,843
Or yours?

560
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,937
Game.

561
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:53,629
Come on. Let's go.

562
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:56,937
I'll cement your place.

563
00:33:57,271 --> 00:33:58,563
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

564
00:34:01,312 --> 00:34:03,542
Cheers!

565
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,472
Wow! I love your moves!

566
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:31,792
Welcome, welcome horny people of Harmon!

567
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,020
Welcome to tonight's party
sponsored by yours truly.

568
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,586
Wild Wild Wes!

569
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:45,278
And with me tonight
is my very hot co-host

570
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:48,903
who is looking
for even hotter women!

571
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:52,011
Not boys, not butchies,
not squammy girls...

572
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,833
Ladies and gentlemen,
no shade and no shame,

573
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:58,311
give it up for… Rovie!

574
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:04,583
And now, ready your liver
for alcohol!

575
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:06,983
Use a condom
before you put it in the hole!

576
00:35:07,008 --> 00:35:10,383
And don't forget to lock the doors!

577
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:14,574
DJ, drop that beat!

578
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,041
Mads?

579
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:37,572
Ah, I'm sorry.

580
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:40,111
You startled me!

581
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:45,291
Sorry, I was just massaging my thigh.
I was standing all day. It hurts.

582
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:49,304
So, are you feeling better?

583
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:52,478
After what happened
with that video?

584
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:55,007
Did you get back at them yet?

585
00:35:56,874 --> 00:36:00,666
I know you're telling the truth.

586
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:05,436
And I know you know the difference
between jokes online and offline.

587
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,163
I'm just ignoring them.

588
00:36:08,823 --> 00:36:10,948
No, that's where you're wrong!

589
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:16,760
These days, taking the high ground
doesn't work. Especially with this batch.

590
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,908
Ignoring them, keeping to your corner…

591
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:22,788
But Mads, isn't revenge a bad idea?

592
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,980
Well, that's a relative statement.

593
00:36:25,288 --> 00:36:30,788
All I'm saying is, we can't let them
wrong-doers get away with everything.

594
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:35,921
Fake news, for example, they'll never
stop if you don't counter them with facts.

595
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:39,613
You lie, and you lie, and
eventually it becomes the truth.

596
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:42,937
That's why, Issa,
you claim your truth!

597
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:47,709
As the saying goes, veritas...

598
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:49,114
Curat!

599
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:52,444
Finally! Somebody got it right!

600
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,896
So, are you heading home?

601
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:59,132
No, ma'am. I'll need
to claim something first.

602
00:37:00,997 --> 00:37:01,997
Okay.

603
00:37:02,296 --> 00:37:03,296
I'll go ahead.

604
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,637
Go, dance, love!

605
00:37:14,662 --> 00:37:16,245
I don't know how to.

606
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:21,802
Wow, Max! I love your outfit!
Matchy matchy! I like it!

607
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:22,577
Cheers!

608
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:23,810
Cheers!

609
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:28,830
So good. I hope you're enjoying.

610
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:30,270
Yeah.

611
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,121
Wait, I'll be right back, yeah?

612
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:35,021
There's just... I just need
to greet Giborat. Wait there.

613
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:36,848
Go! Go ahead, bestie!

614
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:41,062
Giborat, how's it going?

615
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:44,020
Why aren't you drinking?
Come on, get fucked up.

616
00:37:44,354 --> 00:37:45,604
I'm booked up.

617
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:49,853
Hey. Eyes up here, man.

618
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:52,825
Jeez, don't fall for that
for the nth time! It's a trap!

619
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,475
Look around. There
are so many other ladies.

620
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,067
Don't worry, I'm stronger now.

621
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:00,837
We'll just talk.

622
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,446
It's your funeral.

623
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:04,468
Hey, guys!

624
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:07,825
Dude, drink up.

625
00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:10,021
Dude, that's spiked.

626
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:12,432
Guess happy trip to you.

627
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:14,595
Hey.

628
00:38:15,187 --> 00:38:16,854
Wow, thank you!

629
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:22,580
Wow, you guys look like
you're enjoying yourselves.

630
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:29,448
Mavic!

631
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,412
Hey, Issa, my friend!

632
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:35,521
We're looking ravishing tonight.
Feeling sexy, are you?

633
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,287
Have you seen Gibo?

634
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,687
Yeah, over there!

635
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:39,651
Oh, okay.

636
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:40,843
Wait, wait, wait.

637
00:38:40,982 --> 00:38:42,440
That's it? You'll just drop me?

638
00:38:42,513 --> 00:38:46,138
Find him later. You're
always together anyway.

639
00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:49,186
Mavic, I gotta tell him
something important.

640
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:51,562
Oh my gosh!

641
00:38:51,587 --> 00:38:53,670
Are you finally confessing?

642
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:55,551
Hey! No, it's different!

643
00:38:56,271 --> 00:38:58,687
What, it's totally obvious?

644
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:02,587
You guys look like you're
always about to make out!

645
00:39:02,612 --> 00:39:04,356
Am I wrong?

646
00:39:05,622 --> 00:39:09,704
You're right. I'm going to
tell him how I really feel.

647
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:11,207
Claiming the truth!

648
00:39:12,038 --> 00:39:13,663
I'm so happy for you!

649
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:16,604
That's right, friend, claim the truth,

650
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:20,254
and it's only a matter of
time before you claim the toot!

651
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:21,696
You're crazy, Mavic.

652
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:26,856
Of course. So, shots? Get back to me.

653
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,333
Want some?

654
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:34,088
What's this about?

655
00:39:35,778 --> 00:39:38,819
Why did you reach out?
You're done with this, right?

656
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:42,897
Are you bored or sad?

657
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:44,911
Yeah.

658
00:39:48,642 --> 00:39:50,142
Damn, you just went for it.

659
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:53,760
Wait. Sorry. Hear me out.

660
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:56,111
Gibo,

661
00:39:56,692 --> 00:39:58,442
ever since we were little,

662
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:02,124
right from grade school,
you've always been there for me.

663
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:03,749
You're always there to catch me.

664
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:06,396
And I'm so stupid that
it took a crisis for me

665
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:08,668
to appreciate everything you've done.

666
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:14,182
Crisis? Karla, what's
really going on with you?

667
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:18,314
Don’t ask. Something.

668
00:40:18,885 --> 00:40:20,302
I'm just scared.

669
00:40:21,106 --> 00:40:25,397
I'm scared that this time, if I get it
wrong, nobody will be there to catch me.

670
00:40:25,562 --> 00:40:28,562
Is that really all you
think of me? A fall-back?

671
00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:34,382
Karla, I can keep doing that,
if only I was the one you're falling for.

672
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:37,199
But I'm not! It's always somebody else!

673
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,233
Fuck.

674
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,823
Fuck you, Karla!

675
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:45,048
You've never cursed at me
like that before.

676
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:46,677
Why?

677
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:48,744
Why are you so angry, Gibo?

678
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:52,442
If you're that affected,
it must mean something.

679
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:54,065
I must still mean something.

680
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,257
Yes, you still mean something.

681
00:40:57,763 --> 00:41:02,013
But that something are just
dregs that need cleaning up.

682
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:03,531
Prove it!

683
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:05,814
Prove that I mean nothing to you now.

684
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:26,731
You look like you're gonna faint.

685
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:29,028
Hey, that's mine.

686
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,682
Leave it there.

687
00:41:32,853 --> 00:41:34,121
- That was my drink.
- What's going on?

688
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:38,856
That drink got me tipsy... my tip's
pressing against you, it wants to come out!

689
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:40,464
But you're making me dizzy...

690
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:43,989
Oh, no, you're going so fast!
I like that!

691
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:47,662
Take it off? Take off yours, too.

692
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:50,146
Hey, why did you push me?

693
00:41:50,537 --> 00:41:54,162
And they're out! Jackpot!

694
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:55,312
Oh, shit!

695
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,354
Like what the hell, right?

696
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,521
One day he can't get enough of me,

697
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:05,770
and then the next day,
we're just civil?

698
00:42:06,354 --> 00:42:08,021
What fucking shit is that?

699
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:13,749
I reduce you to tears from pleasure,
now I'm the one in tears?

700
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:17,688
I don't get it.

701
00:42:17,888 --> 00:42:22,762
How can people go from dating
to just friends in like, a snap?

702
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:31,854
Fuck, Issa, you slut.
This is all your fault.

703
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,749
I told you, it's not my fault!
You're a broken record!

704
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:37,983
I'm not trying to steal your boyfriend!

705
00:42:38,062 --> 00:42:40,062
You liar! You shitface!

706
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:45,187
Fine, I'll give you a free pass, Gia.

707
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,437
One time. Take it all out on me.

708
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:54,521
One smack. After that, we're quits, okay?

709
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:57,437
You fucker!

710
00:43:04,111 --> 00:43:06,361
What he did hurt more.

711
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,848
Me, too. Fuck them!

712
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:42,604
Love, should we turn off the lights?

713
00:43:42,646 --> 00:43:46,771
I don't want to. Let's keep the lights on.
Don't waste the view.

714
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,590
Harder!

715
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:02,104
More! More!

716
00:44:04,854 --> 00:44:05,854
Harder!

717
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,396
That's it. I'm coming.

718
00:44:14,646 --> 00:44:17,146
Love, do me. My turn.

719
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,729
Game! My turn! Come on!

720
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:21,952
Come on.

721
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:25,354
Love, let's go.

722
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,520
It's kinda dead.

723
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:29,122
Huh?

724
00:44:33,187 --> 00:44:34,521
What the hell?

725
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,312
It's dead.

726
00:44:35,337 --> 00:44:37,171
You're always leaving me hanging!

727
00:44:37,437 --> 00:44:38,729
You're so unfair!

728
00:44:55,354 --> 00:44:57,229
Am I seeing double?

729
00:44:57,604 --> 00:45:00,187
No way, you really let them both out?

730
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,708
What's the hurry?

731
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:07,733
Take it easy. Hold up... hallelujah!

732
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,979
You swallowed everything in one go!

733
00:47:07,187 --> 00:47:10,146
I am so sorry.

734
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:11,171
Shit.

735
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:15,896
Oh my God!

736
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:18,377
That's my first time.

737
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:22,104
Wanna try again?

738
00:47:23,854 --> 00:47:25,643
Are you sure?

739
00:47:25,854 --> 00:47:27,312
Why not. Game?

740
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:29,062
Game.

741
00:47:38,062 --> 00:47:40,437
This is not working out.

742
00:47:43,104 --> 00:47:44,104
You know what?

743
00:47:44,371 --> 00:47:45,621
Let's just drink.

744
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:49,346
Exactly on my mind.
Yeah, let's just drink.

745
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:51,329
I'll get some drinks.

746
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:52,729
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Please.

747
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:12,021
Hey.

748
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:16,854
Are you okay?

749
00:48:21,604 --> 00:48:22,604
You okay?

750
00:48:54,452 --> 00:48:55,452
Floaty?

751
00:50:43,937 --> 00:50:45,562
Who left this open?

752
00:50:58,284 --> 00:50:59,620
Rovie!

753
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:01,187
Floaty!

754
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:03,271
Floaty!

755
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,062
Floaty!

756
00:51:09,729 --> 00:51:11,896
Fuck, what is happening?

757
00:51:12,454 --> 00:51:16,121
Wes! Emergency! Emergency!

758
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:18,146
It's Max!
Max is in trouble!

759
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:19,121
Huh? What's wrong?

760
00:51:19,146 --> 00:51:20,312
Pipe down, everyone.

761
00:51:20,337 --> 00:51:21,962
I called up all the hotlines.

762
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,579
What? You silly girl.

763
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:26,079
Hey! All illegal stuff, out!

764
00:51:26,104 --> 00:51:28,104
This party is cancelled!

765
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:31,371
Get out! Time to go!

766
00:51:31,396 --> 00:51:33,604
Go! Hurry up!

767
00:51:54,598 --> 00:51:57,108
Enough with the flowers and letters.

768
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:58,133
Huh?

769
00:52:01,676 --> 00:52:02,967
I'm so stupid.

770
00:52:02,992 --> 00:52:04,659
Hunter, it's not your fault.

771
00:52:04,684 --> 00:52:06,351
Please, Lem!

772
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,108
I really need you right now!

773
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:10,717
Don't forget, you're mine.

774
00:52:12,854 --> 00:52:15,521
Look at the audience and?

775
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:18,083
Don't forget to pose.

776
00:52:19,635 --> 00:52:28,454
Stay with me
and let's paint the night!

777
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,479
It's you.

778
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:31,396
I can't remember anything.

779
00:52:31,463 --> 00:52:32,880
Did something happen last night?
