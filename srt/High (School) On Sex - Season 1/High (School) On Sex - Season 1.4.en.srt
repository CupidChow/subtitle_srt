1
00:00:08,896 --> 00:00:10,021
That's enough!

2
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:12,396
But you were active in the student body.

3
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:13,544
Active?

4
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:14,861
Body?

5
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:18,662
Of course! Wanna go
for three rounds?

6
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:22,021
If there's something you wish
to change, change it now.

7
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:23,562
What's that?

8
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:27,513
What if I need to pee?

9
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:33,062
Hey, what's wrong?

10
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:34,849
What happened to you?

11
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:36,790
Get dressed or you'll miss the ride!

12
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,204
Oh, right.

13
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,505
Respect is all I ask.

14
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:40,687
Pretty basic.

15
00:00:40,712 --> 00:00:44,129
You chose that. I didn't ask it of you.

16
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:47,454
Okay? So don't ask for anything extra.

17
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,187
Wait, wait, love. Not there.

18
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,896
- Sorry.
- Move it higher.

19
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:51,479
Huh?

20
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,979
Yeah. Higher.

21
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:54,879
Higher? Isn't that the fire exit?

22
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:57,729
Fuck me more, Hunter.

23
00:00:57,729 --> 00:00:58,729
Shit.

24
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:00,396
You feel so good, Gia!

25
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,077
It's like you're squeezing me down there!

26
00:01:03,537 --> 00:01:04,771
Like this?

27
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,499
I'm gonna go use the bathroom.

28
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:48,562
@PinayPort your video
has been reposted 983 times.

29
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,021
Go faster.

30
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:51,146
Deeper.

31
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:52,146
Like that.

32
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,028
Just like that.

33
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,066
Fuck you!

34
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,312
I thought you were a girl?

35
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:00,062
Yes! I am!

36
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:01,575
Shithead!

37
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:36,021
They bothered with a teaser, huh?

38
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,942
Hey! You're early today.

39
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,588
Issa, is something wrong?

40
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:16,701
Nothing.

41
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,913
Doesn't look like nothing.

42
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:20,786
Like I don't know you.

43
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:23,951
What's wrong?

44
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:25,534
Why are you crying?

45
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:27,159
I said it's nothing.

46
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,741
Issa, if somebody's hurting or threatening
you, you have to tell me, alright?

47
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:32,617
Didn't we agree to tell all?

48
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:36,388
Gibo.

49
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:39,034
I have no intention of lying to you.

50
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,779
I just don't want to
talk about it right now.

51
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,201
All right, then.

52
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,675
Tell you what.

53
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,151
You don't need to say or do anything,

54
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,867
but just let me do my thing.

55
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,659
Look here.

56
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:56,492
You better watch yourself
or I'll take care of you!

57
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Your tears.

58
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:00,576
Your eyes are puffy.

59
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,912
Let me have a good look.

60
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,076
Oops.

61
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:15,567
Does it still hurt really bad?

62
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:17,593
It's just on the first day.

63
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,435
Are you okay?

64
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,867
Yes. Gibo, this is
nothing. It's normal for me.

65
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:30,951
You don't need to do all this.

66
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:34,159
I don't, but I want to.

67
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:36,992
I don't want to see you in pain.

68
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:40,756
Don't worry, I'm right beside you.

69
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,534
Nurse, please check on Karla.

70
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,909
What are you feeling?

71
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:51,828
Sir! Sir!

72
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,992
When's our next lecture?

73
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,117
And the next remedial?

74
00:05:57,492 --> 00:05:58,492
Remedial?

75
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,899
We don't have one scheduled.
Why do you want a remedial?

76
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:03,284
Is that what you're hoping for?

77
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,159
Of course, sir!

78
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:07,826
You're a great teacher. Isn't he?

79
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,302
- You totally are, sir!
- You totally are, sir!

80
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:10,201
You think so?

81
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:11,201
- Yes.
- Sir.

82
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:13,201
Sir?

83
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:20,617
Excuse me. Speaking
of lectures, I have to go.

84
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,509
Okay po. Thank you, sir.

85
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:23,995
Thank you, thank you.

86
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,846
Sir…

87
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,367
- Okay. Go, go, go.
- Hold my bag. Hold my bag.

88
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:38,967
Okay.

89
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:40,367
That's it! Work it, girl!

90
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:42,742
Oh, yes! More! Give me more!

91
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:45,017
Project, girl! Oh, fabulous!

92
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,865
Show me! Show me!

93
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:49,467
Strut! Strut!

94
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,435
That's what I'm talking about!

95
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,599
Strut! Did you get that?

96
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,005
Morning, love!

97
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,857
It really is a good morning
now that you're here!

98
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,298
Kiss, please!

99
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:05,060
I gotta go. I'll leave
you two lovebirds, okay?

100
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:06,950
But why?

101
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,909
No reason. So you can
have each other to yourselves.

102
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:13,419
I'm not a prude, I do not intrude. Okay?

103
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:15,284
Come on.

104
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,851
Max, love? Do we have an
issue with us being BFFs?

105
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:22,451
To prove that you have
nothing to be jealous about,

106
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:25,076
he's been on top of me
in bed so many times,

107
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:25,851
but nothing happened.

108
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:26,876
Swear to God!

109
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,242
Okay. Yeah? We're good?

110
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,838
No, it's okay. Stay here.

111
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,301
- No issue, no issue.
- Okay, okay.

112
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,326
Told you!

113
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,060
Yeah! Let's go.

114
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:56,701
What about your notes?

115
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,592
Are you done writing them?

116
00:07:58,617 --> 00:07:59,342
Not yet.

117
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:04,242
And here's the star of
the scandal of the sem!

118
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,857
Miss! How much is your
going rate per video now?

119
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:09,799
It skyrocketed for sure after this.

120
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:15,453
Watch out, Harmon's got a new champion.

121
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:19,092
Harmon's 'bout to get wreck'dt.

122
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:21,534
Boom! Nice one...

123
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,492
- Listen here, you pigs.
- Don't bother, Gibo.

124
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,266
What? Gonna throw another punch, are you?

125
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:25,999
Huh?

126
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:27,034
Itching for a smack?

127
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:28,851
Go on, so you finally get suspended.

128
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,024
You wanna go?

129
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,301
Huh? Bring it on!

130
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:33,367
Just one slap. Bring it.

131
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:36,092
- Think you're tough?
- What? Come on! Hey!

132
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:37,180
Show us what you got!

133
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:39,872
Guess he's a little bitch after all.

134
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:41,825
Wipe that smile off your face.

135
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:43,524
Roundhead!

136
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:45,454
Nolasco, Jr.

137
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,828
Gilberto Nolasco, Jr.?

138
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:04,255
Here you go.

139
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,706
Why aren't you asking me?

140
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:10,538
About what?

141
00:09:10,643 --> 00:09:11,643
The videos?

142
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:14,497
I don't wanna add to its views count.

143
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:18,076
Cut the shit.

144
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,570
I mean it.

145
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:21,789
Are you crazy?

146
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:25,409
Of course I’m not gonna watch that.
We're friends, remember?

147
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:26,909
I'm an honest guy.

148
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:30,992
Alright, fine. If you're serious
about our friendship, tell me this.

149
00:09:31,742 --> 00:09:34,242
Did it ever cross your mind to try me out?

150
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:36,151
You're a guy.

151
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,412
All guys are horny.

152
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:40,241
And like you said the other day,

153
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:41,937
let's use each other.

154
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:43,278
So what is this?

155
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:44,826
Some transaction?

156
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:47,451
Your little charade
until I give in to you?

157
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,426
Issa, I'm telling you,
ever since we were kids...

158
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:54,313
Ever since we were kids, the whole street
knows my mom's a whore!

159
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:56,742
What if that's all there is?

160
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:58,617
Like mother, like daughter.

161
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,259
You never thought you
could get me easy? Not once?

162
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:04,034
No! Because you're not meant
to be used, or tried out, Issa.

163
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,092
You're not just a phase or a quick shag.

164
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:10,125
No one's supposed to just leave you
because they're going abroad.

165
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,826
Moving on, or moving up!

166
00:10:14,742 --> 00:10:15,867
Sure, I'm horny.

167
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:17,892
But I use my head up here more often

168
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,688
and I know that being kind and
being there for you is what's right.

169
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,718
It's what I should do.

170
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:27,727
Push me away all you
want if you don't believe it.

171
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,396
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,492
I lashed out because I got scared.

173
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,367
It's okay.

174
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,034
I'm right here.

175
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:52,242
Whoever did this,
I'm gonna make them cry!

176
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:57,467
Shit, man, I got something new.

177
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:59,551
- A new video, damn.
- Check this out.

178
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,884
Bro, send it to me.

179
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,759
Bang. Fetish.

180
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:04,367
Hey, look here.

181
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,617
- Hey, you gotta see this. Seriously.
- The hell is up with you.

182
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:08,476
You fucking killjoy.

183
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,034
Get that out of my face.

184
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:13,451
What's your problem?

185
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:16,134
It's got great editing, too.

186
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,159
Let's forward it.

187
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:20,534
I know you wanna see it.

188
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,576
Ken, delete that.

189
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,155
Look at you!

190
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:33,367
Dude, are you defending that bitch?

191
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:34,909
Huh?

192
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:36,159
What's going on?

193
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,263
You drunk on her pussy or something?

194
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:42,034
Huh? This motherfucker.

195
00:11:42,346 --> 00:11:43,679
Dude, you fuck!

196
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,576
Hey!

197
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,601
Fuck you, man.

198
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,909
Hunter, what the heck
is your problem?

199
00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:54,076
You're supposed to be on our team.

200
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:58,201
The fuck's happened to you?
You in love with her?

201
00:11:58,721 --> 00:11:59,721
Huh?

202
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:02,075
Get second helpings or something.

203
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,451
Losing your shit over some bitch.

204
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:26,576
Okay, go.

205
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,414
What the fuck, Hunter?

206
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,576
Why did you do that to Ken?

207
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:42,326
What about you,
why did you pull that shit?

208
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:46,284
If somebody did the same
thing to you, how would you feel?

209
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:47,409
What?

210
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:50,576
You're crossing a line, Gia.

211
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:52,884
This sort of thing ruins lives.

212
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:54,784
The video's reached other schools.

213
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:58,176
It's not my fault everything
online is uncontrollable.

214
00:12:58,201 --> 00:13:00,284
So you're admitting it?

215
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:00,951
That it was you?

216
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:01,867
Don't even bother answering.

217
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:03,184
I saw it on your phone.

218
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,701
Pinay Port.

219
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:10,867
And so what if it's me?

220
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:12,659
Huh?

221
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:13,924
What are you gonna do about it?

222
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,875
Think you can take us down?

223
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:20,884
Without the Kens, without me,
without your reputation,

224
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,711
you're nothing, Hunter.

225
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:27,117
And you're actually nice.
If only you followed through.

226
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:34,201
Lem!

227
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:35,784
Sir Lem!

228
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:36,992
Miss Sanchez.

229
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:41,576
If you have any concerns,
please just address it to the school forum.

230
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:43,784
Lem, can we talk?

231
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:46,622
Karla.

232
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:48,127
Can't you see I'm busy?

233
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:50,992
Lem, please.

234
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,076
I'm just going through something right now.

235
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:55,409
If you don't wanna talk, that's fine.

236
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:57,909
But can I please just
stay with you for a while?

237
00:13:58,242 --> 00:13:59,659
I don't want to be on my own.

238
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:02,284
Karla, I need my space.

239
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:07,784
I only not enjoy, but I
work better alone. Okay?

240
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:09,951
What about me?

241
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:11,701
What the heck, Lem?

242
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:13,784
Do I have to beg?

243
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,492
Karla, you know what you need?

244
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:19,617
You need to be more independent.

245
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:21,909
So you can be comfortable
in your own skin.

246
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:24,117
Now, if you really want this to work,

247
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:26,242
we need to give each other enough space.

248
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:27,763
Okay?

249
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:29,826
Space?

250
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,569
What if 'space' doesn't work on me?

251
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:35,117
That's part of it.

252
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:36,772
It's called independence, right?

253
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,471
We can't predict what's going to happen.

254
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:40,867
You know what, Karla?

255
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:43,076
I think…

256
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:45,195
We need to cool off for a bit.

257
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:47,968
It's for your own good.

258
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,762
I'm actually doing this for you.

259
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:53,179
Okay?

260
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:05,266
Don't want to go yet?

261
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:06,651
Let me just walk you home.

262
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,211
Or let's hit the mall.

263
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,534
Since we missed class already.

264
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:13,951
I don't want to.

265
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:16,242
We can leave when everyone's gone.

266
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,409
You can go if you like.

267
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:20,451
No, I'm fine right here.

268
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,037
Bummer, I wanted to cut class.

269
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,583
I never should've come to school.

270
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:32,719
Why did I think people
would be good or considerate.

271
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:36,003
I should stop expecting.

272
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,617
It's so hard to believe in kindness.

273
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:48,034
Hey.

274
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:49,951
Don't bother covering up.

275
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:52,507
Everyone's already seen it.

276
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:55,257
Mavic!

277
00:15:55,742 --> 00:16:00,258
Oh! Sorry! But I'm right, aren't I?

278
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:04,281
I gotta say, though. You're
sexy in that video, friend.

279
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:06,131
Did the video really show everything?

280
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:08,177
Oops. I'm not saying
what happened was okay.

281
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,885
- No, stop it, Gibo!
- But you were very pretty.

282
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,827
Look at my fingers! They're all pudgy
from reporting that video!

283
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,367
Thank you!

284
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:18,784
Is that all?

285
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:20,154
Actually, no.

286
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:23,659
Mads wants you in her office.

287
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,717
Somebody told her you guys were in here.

288
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:28,797
Why didn't you just sneak out?

289
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:30,492
That's what I told you.

290
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:33,576
Well, off to the
principal's office with you.

291
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,534
But first, take this off.

292
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:41,117
Stop sulking!

293
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,284
You're so beautiful.

294
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,409
Be proud.

295
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:45,434
Okay?

296
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:47,576
I will be with you in spirit.

297
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:50,534
You should go.

298
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:58,034
Go, girl!

299
00:16:58,312 --> 00:16:59,312
Go, girl!

300
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:09,422
Good a.m., Ms. Sanchez. Please come in
for more confirmatory test ASAP.

301
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:16,932
Issa.

302
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,467
I've heard the news.

303
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:22,659
And for me to take further action…

304
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:27,453
Is that you in the video?

305
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:31,128
Forgive me.

306
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:33,492
You don't have to answer that right now.

307
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:35,992
But if it's you,

308
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:39,801
I want you to know that my door is open

309
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,141
if you ever need someone to listen.

310
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,801
We can't brush these things aside.

311
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:46,159
Someone must be held responsible.

312
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:49,076
That's me on the video.

313
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:51,576
Who did this?

314
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:56,117
It's Gia…

315
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,492
It was Giana, Mads.

316
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,328
Loop, too,

317
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:01,904
and Jude.

318
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:06,159
You mean Lupe Caringal
and Jude Manapat?

319
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:09,367
For me to make this official,

320
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:11,100
I need to know facts.

321
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:15,717
Was there someone else
who saw what happened?

322
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:17,076
Or witness.

323
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,430
Yes, Mads.

324
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:21,123
Gibo!

325
00:18:21,148 --> 00:18:22,617
- Karla.
- Hey.

326
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:33,945
Wait, before anything else,
I want to say sorry

327
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:37,634
for last time, when Mama
drove me to school?

328
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,784
You were right. I was
acting like a bitch.

329
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,242
I wanna make it up to you.

330
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,914
Sure. Next time.

331
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,645
Ah, no. Do it right now.

332
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,102
Sorry, I'm being weird. But…

333
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,034
I kinda need a favor.

334
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,492
It's for Issa.

335
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:00,242
Karla, please.

336
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:03,587
Your statement will really help her.

337
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,990
Issa might get in trouble for this.

338
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,625
It's not just her scholarship on the line.

339
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:11,034
She might get kicked out.

340
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:17,409
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet.

341
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:20,597
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,

342
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,467
Retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title

343
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:26,534
Romeo, doff thy name; And for that name,

344
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:30,076
which is no part of thee, take all myself.

345
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:33,701
Thank you, Nicholas, for that very
elementary choice of your poetry.

346
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:38,409
Sorry, sir. I just feel like I resonate
with it more now than before.

347
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:41,809
So, any feedbacks on his deliberation?

348
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:42,634
Class?

349
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,367
Yes? What is it this time?

350
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:49,143
I just want to signify that my
preferred pronouns are 'she' and 'her'.

351
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,992
You're teaching me pronouns?

352
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,940
No disrespect, sir.

353
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:55,009
But they're not pronouns in general.

354
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:56,492
They're my pronouns.

355
00:19:56,534 --> 00:20:00,654
Oh. So what about my nouns?
Pronouns? Adjectives?

356
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,304
And my whole vocabulary?

357
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,480
I am in front for a reason.

358
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:07,992
That being I am better than you.

359
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:11,742
I may call you whatever
I want, however I want,

360
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:15,729
and you are compelled
to respond and follow.

361
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:19,367
This is my final word,
Mr. Nicholas Bernardo.

362
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,992
Oh! The exuberance of the youth!

363
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:23,836
You love thinking of new gimmicks.

364
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:25,607
So easily bored.

365
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,521
You love to think of making
your own rules

366
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:31,074
and expect everyone to follow
just because you say so?

367
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,229
For instance,

368
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:33,854
you put on a makeup,

369
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:36,884
and I am compelled
to call you 'miss'?

370
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,242
Erase that, please!

371
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:39,492
Yes, sir.

372
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:40,890
Right now?

373
00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:42,206
Yes, sir.

374
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:45,224
May I step out?

375
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,237
To the boys' bathroom, you mean?

376
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:50,617
At loss for words now, are we?

377
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:53,589
How about those pronouns of yours?

378
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:58,034
Oh, come on. Stop
making a big fuss out of it.

379
00:20:58,205 --> 00:20:59,247
It's just a name.

380
00:20:59,272 --> 00:21:00,272
Right?

381
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:04,451
Thank you for joining us, Karla.

382
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:07,159
I'm sure you already know why you're here.

383
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,409
Now, I know how bullying goes.

384
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:16,534
The bullies will usually
turn on the informant next.

385
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:18,284
So I just want you to know,

386
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:21,701
for your courage to report
what you saw that night,

387
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:23,351
I promise you will not get in trouble.

388
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:24,926
And I will make sure of that.

389
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,992
Am I right?

390
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:28,017
Giana, Jude, Loop.

391
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:30,083
Yes, Mads.

392
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,239
Karla,

393
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:36,076
what did you see
that night at the retreat?

394
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:39,186
You mean them?

395
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:41,616
About what happened to Issa.

396
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:45,193
Nothing.

397
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:46,972
I’m sorry?

398
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,538
I ddin't see anything.

399
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,688
Karla, you know how
grave the situation is.

400
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:54,747
Are you sure you saw nothing?

401
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:58,842
Okay.

402
00:21:58,867 --> 00:21:59,951
You may go.

403
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:01,742
Rest of you stay.

404
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:04,048
Sumaguing, you're up.

405
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,073
Yes, master?

406
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:06,467
Just sir, please.

407
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,492
Why?

408
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:09,467
You said we should follow you blindly.

409
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:10,857
So I should call you 'master', Master.

410
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:12,618
Don't get smart on me now.

411
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:14,077
Great Leader?

412
00:22:14,592 --> 00:22:15,467
Mr. Sumaguing!

413
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:16,701
Strongman? Dictator?

414
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:18,217
Stop that!

415
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:19,951
Why so riled up?
It's just a name, right?

416
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:22,509
Nothing to make a fuss about?

417
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,490
Get out of my class.

418
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:32,867
Fine, but wait. I have a speech.

419
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:36,117
A name is not just a name.

420
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,409
A name is something to make a fuss about.

421
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,904
It is how we view ourselves,
how we identify with,

422
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:47,679
and a name spoken by another person
is an acknowledgement of our being.

423
00:22:47,704 --> 00:22:51,162
So if you want to be a real gentleman,

424
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:53,134
and be called 'sir',

425
00:22:53,159 --> 00:23:02,784
I suggest you address your students
properly whomever he or she may be.

426
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:12,992
I will show myself to
the principal's office, sir.

427
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:22,492
Anything else you want to add?

428
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:23,826
No, Mads.

429
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:26,409
Nothing more, Mads.

430
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:29,867
Mother Superior, I just want to reiterate.

431
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,451
We are innocent.

432
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:35,467
I don't know what you heard,

433
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:37,909
but that's my take.

434
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:40,117
If I wasn't so forgiving,

435
00:23:40,142 --> 00:23:44,912
I'll personally sue
the liar who accused us.

436
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:46,051
That's enough.

437
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:47,992
This is very disheartening.

438
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:50,142
I'm sorry this happened to you, Issa.

439
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:56,109
On top of it, this is what I hate most,
women taking their fellow women down.

440
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,509
Girls, the world is not kind to us!

441
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:00,492
So let's not put each other down!

442
00:24:00,654 --> 00:24:02,034
You remember that.

443
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,142
And Issa,

444
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:04,842
don't worry.

445
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:07,659
This won't reflect on your records.
I'll make sure of that.

446
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:09,842
You don't have to stay
today for your extra duties.

447
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,034
You can go home.

448
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:12,592
Thank you, Mads.

449
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,617
Dismissed.

450
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,201
And Gia, please stay.

451
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:18,367
What?

452
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:19,259
Why?

453
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:22,284
I'm impressed by what
you said, you being forgiving.

454
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:26,052
So please join me
in praying the rosary.

455
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:30,451
Hi, Mads!

456
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:32,143
Is there a long line outside?

457
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,951
Might as well have a class here!

458
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,034
Lord, help me!

459
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:42,990
Karla!

460
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,390
Why didn't you tell the truth?

461
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:48,576
Didn't you say you wanted
to keep this under wraps?

462
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:50,312
That you'll figure something out?

463
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,989
I keep my word.

464
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:54,396
But you saw me and what Gia!

465
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:55,421
So?

466
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,987
How was I supposed to
know your plans changed?

467
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:00,492
I don't assume, Issa.

468
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:04,114
I can't believe that you denied it!

469
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,963
Karla! If you knew I was
doing you a great favor...

470
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:10,613
I know about you and sir Lem.

471
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,052
So tell everyone!

472
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:17,367
Issa, don't give me B.S.

473
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:21,076
Are you keeping quiet for my sake
or for the sake of someone else?

474
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:24,826
Who are you really trying to
protect by keeping it secret?

475
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:27,117
You are you shielding from hurt?

476
00:25:38,034 --> 00:25:39,826
Wait, wait... Wes!

477
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:50,742
Hi.

478
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:54,076
I'm Nick from class.

479
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:56,393
Miss Nick. Okay?

480
00:25:57,354 --> 00:25:58,354
Yes.

481
00:25:58,914 --> 00:26:02,037
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did earlier.

482
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:05,456
I hope you don't get
sanctioned heavily for it.

483
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:08,287
Oh, that.

484
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:10,951
Just a novena with Mads.
It's no big deal.

485
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:12,492
Oh, it certainly is.

486
00:26:12,642 --> 00:26:14,617
At least for me, it's a big deal.

487
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:16,201
So, please…

488
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,659
let me pay you back.

489
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:19,492
- Huh?
- Anything you want. Please.

490
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:20,701
Hey, you know what...

491
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,534
Let me give you this.

492
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:27,451
I'll treat you the way
you should be treated.

493
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:28,552
Okay?

494
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,630
Why?

495
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:31,606
No reason.

496
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,646
Just my little way to make up

497
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:37,818
for all the fucked up things
fucked up people did to you.

498
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:40,786
So? Let's go?

499
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:43,492
My place.

500
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:48,701
Miss Nick!

501
00:27:00,013 --> 00:27:04,992
Sorry for today.
Sorry if people are unkind.

502
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:15,058
Hey, Issa!

503
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,995
Quit moping.

504
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:21,177
Get in before those perverts get to you.

505
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:22,742
I'm fine!

506
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:24,114
I don't wanna hear it!

507
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:28,294
Get in so we can run
over those shitheads.

508
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:30,534
Max?

509
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:31,576
Sure!

510
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,270
I'll get that.

511
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:41,081
All right.

512
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:45,409
Whose the flower from?

513
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:52,409
When you said 'make-up',

514
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:55,169
I didn't think you meant it literally.

515
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:59,201
Well, I like make-up

516
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:03,787
and it makes everything
about you… pop!

517
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:05,242
Wish I heard that more!

518
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:09,427
Usually it's wipe that off,
you're calling attention to yourself,

519
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:11,800
or you look like a christmas tree.

520
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:13,671
That's what they think.

521
00:28:13,732 --> 00:28:14,732
That's the point!

522
00:28:15,457 --> 00:28:17,154
And I'm telling you,

523
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:22,034
you should never make yourself
smaller for the sake of other people.

524
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:24,801
Do not dim your colors.

525
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:25,826
Okay?

526
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,584
You seem very confident.

527
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,839
I'm sure everyone's been supportive of you.

528
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,771
Yeah. Here, these are my parents.

529
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,953
Oh my god, you guys are so cute!

530
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,390
Thank you!

531
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,242
You see, if you were raised
by a queer couple like me,

532
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,919
you're certain to grow up feisty.

533
00:28:48,116 --> 00:28:51,826
Imagine having to
defend that we're a family!

534
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:54,301
So when it comes to trash-talking,

535
00:28:54,326 --> 00:28:55,534
I'm game.

536
00:28:56,283 --> 00:28:58,286
Does it have to get to that?

537
00:28:59,365 --> 00:29:05,884
I guess for now you really
need to fight for your ideals.

538
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:08,201
So that the day comes when
they're not contested anymore.

539
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:13,367
The day when respect becomes a standard,
not a matter of luck.

540
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:14,815
See?

541
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:22,951
Sorry.

542
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:24,674
It's okay.

543
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:28,669
Miss Nick,

544
00:29:29,623 --> 00:29:33,628
if you're going to kiss me,
don’t apologize for it. Okay?

545
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:37,244
Do it proud. Do me proud.

546
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:51,826
I said this should only take five minutes
then we can review.

547
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:55,576
But it's been ten minutes
and you're still focused on that.

548
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:57,284
Stressed?

549
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:02,271
Did you hear about the video scandal?

550
00:30:04,617 --> 00:30:06,419
Yes, I've heard.

551
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:11,763
I don't get how your generation goes about

552
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:17,677
sending nude photos and videos
like it's the most normal thing.

553
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:21,287
As if we're the first generation to do it.

554
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:24,551
You have a point there.

555
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:26,201
From my experience,

556
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:30,426
it's not exclusive to your generation.

557
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:33,284
Didn't your husband ever send n00dz?

558
00:30:33,787 --> 00:30:35,417
What do you mean?

559
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:37,092
What is that?

560
00:30:37,117 --> 00:30:38,419
Alien language?

561
00:30:38,444 --> 00:30:40,617
You've never heard of n00dz?

562
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:41,951
Give me your phone.

563
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:43,201
I'll type it for you.

564
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,542
It's like magic. Check it out.

565
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:48,701
There.

566
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,409
Read it.

567
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:52,717
You see it?

568
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:53,659
I see it!

569
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:54,684
Right?

570
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:56,521
Now I get it.

571
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,021
Yes, he's into that.

572
00:31:02,122 --> 00:31:05,099
He even took a video
of me once, but...

573
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:06,290
Not my thing!

574
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:08,304
I get so conscious.

575
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:10,551
I think it's crass.

576
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:11,861
What about you?

577
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:13,992
Me?

578
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:15,659
I don't mind it.

579
00:31:16,145 --> 00:31:19,498
Mainly because I've
tried taking a vid of myself.

580
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:23,326
But I don't see it as crass or indecent.

581
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:27,034
I think it requires a
certain level of acceptance.

582
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,492
For you to capture yourself on camera.

583
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:31,083
Like for example,

584
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:34,826
when you're looking at
yourself in the mirror, naked.

585
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:37,487
You're studying your own body.

586
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,213
And you think to yourself,

587
00:31:40,956 --> 00:31:42,706
Shit! Who's this fine specimen?

588
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:44,396
He's so sexy.

589
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:47,974
Kind of like self-love?

590
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:51,076
I think 'vulnerability'
is the word you're searching for.

591
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:52,742
That's the word.

592
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:54,284
Vulnerability.

593
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:58,659
Haven't you ever looked at
yourself closely in the mirror?

594
00:31:58,951 --> 00:31:59,992
Naked?

595
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:01,617
God, no!

596
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:12,185
Why don't you give it a try?

597
00:32:15,326 --> 00:32:16,909
Appreciate yourself.

598
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:18,742
Your body.

599
00:32:19,943 --> 00:32:23,659
Because if you saw
what I'm seeing right now,

600
00:32:24,952 --> 00:32:26,752
I'm sure it'll put a
smile on your face, too.

601
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,784
So, tomorrow?

602
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:36,617
I meant what to do with us.
Moving forward.

603
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,284
I get it. It's okay.

604
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:46,576
Nick, it's not you. It's me.

605
00:32:47,237 --> 00:32:48,320
Seriously?

606
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:55,884
Yeah. I'm just not in the 'mode' to be
in a long-term relationship right now.

607
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:58,810
And I feel like that's what you're
looking for. Not just a fuck buddy,

608
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:01,284
but a real relationship.

609
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:03,072
Honestly!

610
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,201
I wasn't even thinking beyond tomorrow.

611
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:06,677
But you are correct.

612
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:08,909
Sorry!

613
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:12,326
Honestly, I had fun, Wes.

614
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,617
You gave me something I've never received
from anyone before.

615
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,919
To be fully appreciated.

616
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,199
To not be scared to get
beaten up for being myself.

617
00:33:22,674 --> 00:33:23,966
No strings attached.

618
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:30,326
So if one day is all I get?

619
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:31,351
Good enough?

620
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:35,576
Hey, I hope you're not settling because
that shouldn't be your bare minimum.

621
00:33:36,198 --> 00:33:37,406
I know that!

622
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:39,326
You made me realize that.

623
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,117
Now. More than ever.

624
00:33:42,784 --> 00:33:43,951
Thank you for this treat.

625
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:45,826
Welcome.

626
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,534
Shet, Melona!

627
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:55,451
Slow down, Gibo. Don't get too excited.

628
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,090
She can still change her mind.

629
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:59,217
- Can you see all of me?
- Be cool.

630
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:01,895
I think there's more to show.

631
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:05,739
Show me everything, ma'am!

632
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,518
I'm so ready for this class presentation!

633
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:12,607
Oh my god.
Was that a G-string?

634
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:18,967
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

635
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:21,201
It's standing in attention now, ma'am!

636
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:27,265
Shit, dreams do come true.
We're actually doing it.

637
00:34:56,935 --> 00:34:58,393
I'm going to put it in now.

638
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:09,159
Wait, somebody might see us.
But damn, it's so tight! So good!

639
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,926
Here goes nothing.

640
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:13,005
I'm coming!

641
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:36,973
You've grown so big!

642
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:41,473
I'm going to burst!

643
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:50,866
How's it going down there, love?

644
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:52,616
Can you feel anything yet?

645
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:55,557
I don't know what's wrong.

646
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,294
I can't do it.

647
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:01,992
Geez.

648
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:05,627
Are you alright?

649
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,706
What's going through your head?

650
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:21,534
Nothing! Too much! Probably just pressured
with all the school work.

651
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,176
My poor baby!

652
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:26,701
That's okay, we can just tell stories.

653
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,992
We can do it next time.

654
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:30,967
Okay? Bonding time.

655
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:35,021
Okay, love. I'm really sorry
for being low on battery.

656
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:41,013
That's okay, I just remembered
I have something fully charged.

657
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:45,492
Is this yours?

658
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,551
No, it's the neighbor's.

659
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:48,576
Oh?

660
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:51,409
Of course it's mine!

661
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,159
You know, when I'm feeling alone.

662
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:59,076
Do you feel alone right now
because of my…?

663
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:01,034
No, I'm not.

664
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:03,867
But we can be alone together.

665
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:06,534
Come on, put it in.

666
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:12,217
Okay.

667
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:13,809
- How's that?
- Yeah.

668
00:37:16,428 --> 00:37:17,428
Shit!

669
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:22,579
Ah, love!

670
00:37:22,604 --> 00:37:23,604
That's it!

671
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,034
Faster, please!

672
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:30,634
Love, pull it out!

673
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:31,467
Pull it out right now!

674
00:37:31,492 --> 00:37:33,842
- I'm good!
- You're squeezing around it.

675
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:34,367
Shit!

676
00:37:34,392 --> 00:37:35,513
Fuck, love!

677
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:39,742
Two points! Oh my gosh!

678
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:41,201
There's more?

679
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,693
It's stuck!

680
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,912
Love!

681
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:48,162
Love!

682
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:50,617
Fuck!

683
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:11,049
Karina?

684
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:13,154
Is that you?

685
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:16,509
Are you the little girl
who once told me...

686
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:17,659
Marry me?

687
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,492
Yes, that's me, you meanie.

688
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:23,701
It's Karla now.

689
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:25,242
Lem.

690
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:29,705
Teach me?

691
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:28,492
You didn't tell me I was your first.

692
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:30,429
Is that a problem?

693
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,318
Not really.

694
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:44,722
I love you.

695
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:46,448
Sorry…

696
00:39:58,492 --> 00:40:01,492
Is this your space for growth? Asshole!

697
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:06,092
Babe, please. Maybe we
can still patch things up.

698
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:07,534
Hey.

699
00:40:10,913 --> 00:40:12,091
Hey.

700
00:40:13,018 --> 00:40:14,247
Who's babe?

701
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:17,239
Ah, my ex.

702
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:19,367
You guys back together?

703
00:40:20,522 --> 00:40:21,522
No.

704
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,836
I mean... Not yet.

705
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:25,601
I really don't know.

706
00:40:25,677 --> 00:40:28,992
It's only a question.
About the name.

707
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:33,951
I haven't changed her name
in my contacts.

708
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:40,551
I tried to, but I couldn't get used to it.
Feels odd, since...

709
00:40:40,576 --> 00:40:43,617
Relax. You don't need to explain.

710
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:45,659
You're too obvious.

711
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,294
You're the one with baggage on this.

712
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:57,552
Sounds like you're the one
who needs unburdening.

713
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:00,560
Can't I just forget about it?

714
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:04,922
If you still have something for this girl,

715
00:41:05,206 --> 00:41:06,623
ask yourself...

716
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:09,426
Do you feel safe with her?

717
00:41:09,536 --> 00:41:11,890
Like how you made me feel?

718
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:17,534
Not really.

719
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:21,159
Or maybe I'm just scared
she'll hurt me again.

720
00:41:21,184 --> 00:41:24,451
Well then, who do you
feel that way towards?

721
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:29,999
Someone you feel safe with,
makes you happy with yourself…

722
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:38,552
Shit. No, I can't.

723
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:39,577
No one.

724
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:41,492
I'm still thinking about it.

725
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:44,507
Sure. Take your time.

726
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:49,301
Even I went through so many mental hoops
to manage what you wanted me to do.

727
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:53,701
I think the reason why I never thought
of taking a video of myself

728
00:41:53,726 --> 00:41:58,892
is because no one's ever
looked at me the way you did.

729
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,286
At least not in a long time.

730
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:04,815
You looked at me with genuine concern,

731
00:42:05,013 --> 00:42:08,576
no pain, no judgment…

732
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:13,576
And my wish is you find someone
who will look at you the same way.

733
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:17,409
I hope so, too. May our pleasures
extend beyond the sheets.

734
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:27,458
I hope you never lose faith.

735
00:42:27,826 --> 00:42:30,451
Harmon! Who here thinks
they can take on me?

736
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,755
I challenge you!

737
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,333
DJ!

738
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:57,367
Drop that bass!

739
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,823
I'm going to confess my true feelings.

740
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:02,378
Claiming the truth!

741
00:43:03,425 --> 00:43:05,284
Who left this open?

742
00:43:16,448 --> 00:43:19,226
Emergency! Emergency!

743
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:21,089
It's Max!
