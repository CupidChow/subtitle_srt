(Chairman)

An'an.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,959
How come you are here?

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,599
I thought you were going to the bank.

22
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:30,920
Ms. Lu.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,000
Mr. Huo said there was

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,159
an account discrepancy.

25
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,120
I found out that

26
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,840
the missing amount
was the sum from the card.

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,319
But I know you're

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,280
donating it to

29
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,000
the overseas children's foundation.

30
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:45,840
Yeah.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,439
I think

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,200
she has mentioned it to me.

33
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,680
Yeah.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,040
An'an is doing

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,040
such a great job

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
in keeping our accounts in order.

37
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,480
Good job, An'an.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,799
Your way of doing things

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,080
shows that you're
the daughter of Gu Wenran.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,159
I'm just doing my job.

41
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,960
Ms. Lu, I'll head back to my room now.

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,400
An'an, why did you lie to Mr. Huo?

43
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Ms. Lu, I know
you have a plan about the money.

44
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,680
I simply

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,240
did what I should do

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,199
as Siwen's fiancée.

47
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,560
It's good that

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,039
you see it this way.

49
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,360
Rest assured, Ms. Lu.

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,719
I know my place.

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
I won't let you down.

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,560
I will be upstairs.

53
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,759
She's a smart woman.

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,719
But unfortunately, she lacks courage.

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,120
But it's good.

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,439
She poses no threat to us.

57
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,199
So should we...

58
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,360
It's fine.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,680
She merely wants to regain control

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,439
over the Gu Group.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,439
We don't need to bother

62
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,120
with her petty tricks.

63
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,639
Mom, rest assured.

64
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,919
No matter what

65
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,240
Gu An'an's plotting,

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,159
it's just a petty trick to us.

67
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,080
The show is just beginning.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,159
That was close.

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,159
Thankfully, we got over it.

70
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,360
By the way, how did you know Lu Yuzhu

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
would bait me with the transfer?

72
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,919
Twenty-five years ago,

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,919
my mom was a maid in the Huo family.

74
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,680
My dad got attracted

75
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
by her beauty

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,919
and I was born.

77
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,000
My mom

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,319
was especially naive.

79
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,840
She just wanted

80
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,319
a peaceful life in the Huo family.

81
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,840
But Lu Yuzhu wouldn't let us be.

82
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,439
She got my mother drunk
and tricked my dad

83
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,759
into believing that

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,680
my mom had an affair
with the housekeeper.

85
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,600
Just like that,

86
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,160
my mom and I were driven out.

87
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,560
Then my mom died of illness.

88
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,680
My dad found out
that I was indeed his son

89
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,160
and took me back in.

90
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,399
Lu Yuzhu is harder to deal with
than we imagined.

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,319
Your mom would be proud of you

92
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,680
if she knew who you'd become.

93
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,959
Who I'd become?

94
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:51,000
A penniless and powerless
illegitimate child?

95
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,879
No.

96
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,879
You're a man who can take care

97
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,439
of himself and others.

98
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,279
I will show my mom the best of me.

99
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,959
After all these,

100
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
I don't think Lu Yuzhu would see me

101
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,879
as an enemy for the time being.

102
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,560
She may be cunning,

103
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,199
but I'm sure

104
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
we can bring her down.

105
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,519
Trust me.

106
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,360
I believe in you.

107
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,279
Why are you here?

108
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,680
No one saw you

109
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,279
coming in, right?

110
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,720
Ye Linna, how many times
have I told you?

111
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,839
Don't come to my house.

112
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,360
If my dad finds out,

113
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,680
all our efforts will be in vain.

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,399
Don't worry.

115
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,439
No one saw me

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
coming in.

117
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,879
I just missed you, that's all.

118
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,519
Did you do the job

119
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,560
for me?

120
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,959
Rest assured.

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,279
I've settled it

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,160
with the help of my dad.

123
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Good.

124
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:14,959
Well done.

125
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,160
In that case,

126
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,000
your dad wouldn't find me worthless

127
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:19,839
next time

128
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,519
he sees me, right?

129
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,680
Of course not.

130
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,439
So, how do you plan to repay me?

131
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,399
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

132
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,879
Where are you taking me?

133
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,120
You'll see.

134
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,959
Let's go.

135
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,319
Sorry about that.

136
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,879
What are you doing?

137
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,319
Huo Siting, let me go.

138
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,040
What are you doing?

139
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:56,959
Let me go.

140
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,680
Huo Siting?

141
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,319
Interesting.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,600
Dad.

143
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,680
I saw them
holding each other on the balcony

144
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,040
with my own eyes.

145
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,800
Huo Siting was all over Gu An'an.

146
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,199
They did that right before our eyes.

147
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,160
Can we allow

148
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,120
such a woman in our family?

149
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,560
An'an, what happened?

150
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,480
I went out for some air.

151
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
But your son here

152
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,839
had improper thoughts about me.

153
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,759
Improper thoughts?

154
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,639
I think you were having an affair
and made up this lie

155
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,720
because we caught you.

156
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Ye Linna, why don't you tell us

157
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,000
what you're doing here at this hour?

158
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,879
Aren't you here for Siwen?

159
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,399
Huo Siting.

160
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,240
How dare you

161
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,519
harass your soon-to-be sister-in-law?

162
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,240
I should never have agreed
to let you come back.

163
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,199
Enough.

164
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,000
Siting, explain it.

165
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,160
"Soon-to-be."

166
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,839
They're not married yet.

167
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,079
Anyway, Gu An'an

168
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,639
is going to marry into our family.

169
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,199
Why should he get the benefit?

170
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,279
Don't you have shame at all?

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,399
Everyone knows that
Gu An'an is my fiancée.

172
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,600
Whether I marry her or not

173
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,920
is up to me.

174
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm telling you.

175
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,279
I'm marrying Gu An'an.

176
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,279
Mark my words.

177
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,600
Honey, please handle this properly.

178
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,639
If you break the rules

179
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,600
just because Siting is your son,

180
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,840
then I'm afraid

181
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,159
that everyone in this house

182
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,039
will begin to follow suit.

183
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,879
I'm the elder son.

184
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,200
I'll take care of it.

185
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
Dad, please go rest.

186
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,960
Look at you.

187
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,480
My brother.

188
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,120
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

189
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,039
Go ahead.
