=Episode 20=

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,599
Are you happy now?

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,120
Yeah.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,239
What exactly do you want?

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,040
You know he's reckless.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,040
Why would you provoke him?

23
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,040
Then what should I do?

24
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,640
Watch you accept his proposal?

25
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,519
I can't do that.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,680
Gu An'an.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,879
Don't you like me even a little bit?

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,560
Yes.

29
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,200
I do like you.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,719
But what's the point?

31
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,280
It's not the time
to start a relationship.

32
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,120
Figure out how to appease Meng Xiao.

33
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,840
Rest assured.

34
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,920
I know what to do.

35
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:03,680
(Muhai Boxing)

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,240
How do you know he's here?

37
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,639
It's a secret.

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,800
I'll make him

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,639
keep participating
in the resort project.

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,719
Join me?

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,159
Sure.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
Huo Siting, make your move.

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,360
I will not.

44
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:37,960
Gu An'an.

45
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,319
It's not like I can't live without you.

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,520
Since you've made your choice,

47
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,759
I will respect it.

48
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,120
Huo Siting.

49
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,759
If I see you mistreating An'an,

50
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,000
I will not let you off.

51
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,279
What's wrong?

52
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:36,920
It was my dad.

53
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,560
He said that Lu Yuzhu
went abroad for a vacation.

54
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,560
Why?

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,199
Her son was convicted.

56
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,000
She must be in a bad mood.

57
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,639
Get in the car.

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,839
Can you stop moving?

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,040
Good for you,

60
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,560
sharing a room with me again.

61
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,519
We're married.
We can't sleep in separate rooms.

62
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,839
Even if it's an act,
we have to go all out.

63
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,399
If my dad finds out the truth,

64
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,560
we'll be in trouble.

65
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,399
What's on your mind?

66
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,439
Do you remember

67
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,199
the first time we lived together?

68
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,720
Of course.

69
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,759
You took my log cabin, my blanket,

70
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,600
my bed,

71
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,240
and...

72
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,120
Don't.

73
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,480
Why did you kick me?

74
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,480
Don't you like to reminisce?

75
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,519
I'm just helping you.

76
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,000
Speaking of memories...

77
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,360
Gu An'an.

78
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,639
You said you liked me that day.

79
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,199
Why bring this up?

80
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,519
How much do you like me?

81
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,480
How did you feel

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,639
when I kissed you that day?

83
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,519
True.

84
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,879
I'm such a nice guy.

85
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
It's only right to like me.

86
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,959
Don't be shy.

87
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:06,879
Shut up.

88
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,399
So were you already into me

89
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,000
when I kissed you?

90
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,120
Or you wouldn't have

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
let me kiss you so many times.

92
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,199
Who said I was into you?

93
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,519
Let me kiss you again to see

94
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,759
if you feel anything.

95
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,319
All you want

96
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,519
is to kiss.

97
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,879
It's so late.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,199
Will you let me sleep?

99
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,600
Let's sleep.

100
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,040
Mr. Chen.

101
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,439
What's wrong?

102
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,720
Miss Gu.

103
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,839
Have you found the USB drive?

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,920
Not yet.

105
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,560
But don't worry.

106
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,079
I'll keep looking for it.

107
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't feel overwhelmed.

108
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,199
The top priority

109
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,800
is to take care of Mrs. Gu.

110
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,439
Once she wakes up,

111
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,160
everything will come to light.

112
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,639
Okay.

113
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,800
I see.
