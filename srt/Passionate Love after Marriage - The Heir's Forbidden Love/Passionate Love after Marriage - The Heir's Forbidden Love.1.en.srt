(High Voltage Danger, No Entry)

19
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,760
Will you marry me?

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,640
I will.

21
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,599
(Marrying into the Huo family?)

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,799
(You're not worthy.)

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,519
(My dear sister,)

24
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,840
(your mother is still unconscious.)

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,120
The Gu Group will be our Ye family's.

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,319
You're awake.

27
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,879
Did you kidnap me?

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm afraid you got the wrong person.

29
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,599
If it weren't for me,

30
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,319
you would probably be dead
by now, Miss Gu.

31
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,400
As the distinguished daughter
of the Gu family,

32
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,599
you know full well
my elder brother is unfaithful,

33
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,000
yet you still want to marry him.

34
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,520
It seems like you're not

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
so out of reach like I imagined.

36
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,759
You sent me the video last night, right?

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,199
What do you want?

38
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,319
I want to discuss cooperation with you.

39
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,039
What cooperation?

40
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,919
I know your father

41
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,919
kicked you out of the Gu Group.

42
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,520
You're so eager
to marry into our family,

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,919
merely wanting
to rely on our family's power

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,120
to gain control of the Gu Group.

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,719
You already know my elder brother

46
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,759
and your younger sister's affair.

47
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,400
Even if you marry into the Huo family,

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,639
you will still be looked down upon.

49
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,479
You'd better work with me.

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,520
After all,

51
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,000
I am better looking than my brother.

52
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,919
Huo Siting,

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,159
you're Huo Jinyun's illegitimate son
who can't make a public appearance.

54
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,400
What right do you have?

55
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,599
The eligible one may not
necessarily want to marry you.

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,199
You want to regain control
of the Gu Group,

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,639
and I want to establish a firm footing
in the Huo family.

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,759
Let's each take what we need.

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,240
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,560
I have no interest
in cooperating with you.

61
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,959
Do you intend
to wear this to the wedding?

62
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,759
That's not for you to ask.

63
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,000
Get out of my way.

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,360
What if I won't?

65
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,199
Do you believe
I could kill you right now?

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,519
For people like you and me,

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
what's to be afraid of?

68
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,360
We should be ruthless enough.

69
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,399
It seems like you're not as fearless
of death as you pretend.

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,879
Rest assured.

71
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,560
I will call a doctor for you.

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,720
Dad,

73
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,680
please give us your blessing, will you?

74
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,720
You good-for-nothing!

75
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,319
As the eldest son of the Huo family,

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,839
you take marriage as child's play.

77
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,160
Do you know?

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,920
Out there

79
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,120
are my friends
from all sectors of society.

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,560
You can't just call off the wedding
on a whim.

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,360
That'll be a huge humiliation to me.

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,879
Enough, honey.

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
Just calm down.

84
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,639
After all, Siwen is still young.

85
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,439
It's true love between Siwen and me.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,519
Enough. Shut up.

87
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,240
Mr. Huo, look at this commotion.

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,519
I know An'an

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,920
has an engagement agreement
with your son.

90
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,519
But Linna

91
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,079
is also my daughter.

92
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,680
How about we

93
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,160
just bless them as their parents?

94
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,480
Has the Huo family
started using a counterfeit too?

95
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,560
I wondered why someone
was impersonating me to get married.

96
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
So it was you.

97
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
An'an, can you let me have him?

98
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,959
- An'an!
- An'an!

99
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,439
What are you doing?

100
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,720
Are you out of your mind?

101
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,199
Are you alright?

102
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,240
Let you have him?

103
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,279
You knew I had a marriage arrangement
with Huo Siwen.

104
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,759
And yet you still came here
in a wedding dress to snatch the groom.

105
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,920
She's your sister.

106
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,639
How could you bring yourself to hit her?

107
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,720
You...

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,920
Sister?

109
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,959
For the past 20 years,

110
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,959
how come I never knew

111
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,240
I had a sister?

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,439
Don't think you can
bring your illegitimate daughter

113
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,079
into the Gu family
just because my mother

114
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,000
is currently unconscious.

115
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,240
Your words are getting harsher.

116
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,519
I am your father, after all.

117
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,959
I have even harsher words.

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,040
You've been enduring
in our family for so many years.

119
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,879
Now you finally got a chance.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
It wasn't easy, right?

121
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,199
Mr. Huo,

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,199
the whole city knows that the Huo
and Gu families are marrying today.

123
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,720
Does your family
treat marriage as a child's play?

124
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,120
In this matter,

125
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,759
our family indeed did wrong.

126
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,480
It seems
that today's wedding won't happen.

127
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,319
Tell me, what are your demands?

128
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,199
I will try my best to satisfy you.

129
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,759
Xinshan Resort

130
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,319
was our family's business originally.

131
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,279
Now my mother is in a coma,

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,480
and that's why your family
took over the project.

133
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,560
My demand

134
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,639
is 70% of the shares.

135
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,240
How much? 70%?

136
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,680
Are you out of your mind?

137
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,959
Don't you think you are too greedy?

138
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,000
Dad, you can't agree to her.

139
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,879
That's the true purpose

140
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,120
of her marrying into our family.

141
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,560
- Dad.
- Shut your mouth.

142
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,639
Miss, do you understand

143
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,240
what 70% of the shares mean?

144
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,759
The resort is certainly important.

145
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,759
But I wonder how it compares
to the reputation of the Huo family.

146
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,040
If you have something to say,
just say it.

147
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,839
I think you would be
very interested in this video.

148
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,319
How could this happen?

149
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,920
If I don't stop it,

150
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,480
this video will soon appear
on the trending searches.

151
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,560
Honey...

152
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,839
Okay.

153
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,240
I agree to your terms.

154
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,279
Dad!

155
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,240
Shut up.

156
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,240
Come to my company
to sign the contract tomorrow morning.

157
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,079
Since you have agreed, Mr. Huo,

158
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,040
I have another demand.

159
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,000
What is it?

160
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,519
For the reputation of both our families,

161
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,160
the romance
between Huo Siwen and Ye Linna

162
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,879
cannot be made public within a year.

163
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,800
Okay.

164
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,639
However, this thing...

165
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,279
Mr. Huo,

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,320
after all, it's not me
who will be embarrassed.

167
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,720
I really don't care

168
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,279
about this video.

169
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,080
Kneel down.
