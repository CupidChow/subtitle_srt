18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,040
Where are you going so late?

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,200
None of your business.

20
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,879
Running away with the money, huh?

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,640
We are just going out for a walk.

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,840
For a walk?

23
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,840
Is that why you sold the shares

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,040
on the black market?

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,599
Do you know that this is illegal?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,760
How do you know?

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,159
That was you...?

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,879
That's right.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,159
The person who bought
the shares from you

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,480
was me.

31
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,719
Well played, guys.

32
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,040
Thank you for being
so eager to cash out.

33
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,560
It gave us the chance.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,719
The Gu Group no longer
belongs to you, Ye Tingfeng.

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,760
An'an.

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,959
I'm your dad.

37
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,400
You know me.

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not one to stick to my guns.

39
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,319
It was all her idea.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,520
R-Really.

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,520
I'm begging you.

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,479
Give me another chance.

43
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,319
Just once.

44
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,199
Forgive me, okay?

45
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,400
Ye Tingfeng, how do you have the nerve?

46
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,360
You lied to my mom about being a tycoon.

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,639
I never knew
you were such a useless wimp.

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Let me tell you.

49
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,319
You'll always be

50
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,800
in debt to me and my mom.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,360
Shut up.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,360
She stole Huo Siwen from you.

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,039
She planned to hit you with a car.

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,424
Take revenge on her now.

55
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:36,000
What a loser!

56
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,039
Don't even think about pinning it on me.

57
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,280
I don't care whose idea it is.

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
You two are in cahoots.

59
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,360
I will send you both to prison.

60
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,479
Please don't.

61
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,280
After all, I'm your dad.

62
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,639
Drop the charges.

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,840
Sue her if you want.

64
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,639
As a father,

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,599
I'm absolutely

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,639
fair and impartial.

67
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,560
Drop the charges?

68
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,159
So you can run off with the money

69
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,719
to enjoy your life abroad?

70
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,680
Ye Tingfeng.

71
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,599
You're not taking

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
a single cent from my family.

73
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,199
Unbelievable!

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,800
Ungrateful!

75
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,719
Unfilial!

76
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,960
You...

77
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,680
What do you want?

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,439
The Gu family owns this house now.

79
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,800
Will you leave on your own?

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,159
Or do I have to kick you out?

81
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,000
Gu An'an, don't get cocky.

82
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,120
You just bewitched a man

83
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,159
and made him do everything for you.

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,719
Huo Siting, be careful.

85
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,479
Maybe one day,

86
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,039
this woman will leave you with nothing.

87
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,159
You think you can
take something with you?

88
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,919
Don't forget that I didn't take

89
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,360
a single cent when I left.

90
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,520
You two deserve even less.

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,599
Gu An'an, you are really something.

92
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,199
You've lost your mom.

93
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,680
And now you're kicking your dad out.

94
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,280
You don't deserve to have a family.

95
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,639
You don't.

96
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,840
Step aside.

97
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,159
Why didn't you play along?

98
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,639
How is that my fault?

99
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,599
Ye Tingfeng.

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,039
So unreasonable.

101
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,599
What now, Huo Siting?

102
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,919
You want to hit me?

103
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,759
If you dare to say anything

104
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,159
that hurts Gu An'an again,

105
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,040
I will make you pay.

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,639
It hurts.

107
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,879
Okay, I won't say anything

108
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,079
like that again.

109
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,160
You are An'an's father.

110
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,240
I will let you off.

111
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,079
But I need your help with something.

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,480
What is it?

113
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,800
Tell me.

114
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,000
What happened to Mrs. Gu?

115
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,560
I have no idea.

116
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,040
I can make a deal with you.

117
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,240
Tell me everything you know.

118
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,959
I'll give you some money

119
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,879
to live abroad.

120
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,920
Why don't you ask Gu An'an?

121
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,279
I'm negotiating terms with you.

122
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,000
No more questions.

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,319
I really have no idea.

124
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,120
After she fell off the cliff,

125
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,720
An'an took her for treatment alone.

126
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,959
So only one person knows where she is.

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
And that's Gu An'an.

128
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,319
Also, how much money will you give me?

129
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,519
Five million.

130
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,120
Five...

131
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,920
Well, I have a lot to say about this.

132
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,120
My wife's accident

133
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,759
is not as simple as one might imagine.

134
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,720
Are you happy?

135
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,160
I thought I'd be happy
once I drove him out

136
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,360
and reclaimed the Gu Group.

137
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,519
But after all, he is my dad.

138
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,360
I don't know

139
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,879
what my mom will think once she sees

140
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,800
this broken family.

141
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,600
She will be proud of you.

142
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,639
I hope so.

143
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:58,800
An'an.

144
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,879
You've taken back what's yours

145
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,680
and I've claimed what I wanted.

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,240
So

147
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
what are your plans?

148
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,720
My plans?

149
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
You kept saying

150
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,800
that you wouldn't start a relationship

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,759
without reclaiming the Gu Group.

152
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,879
But the problem is resolved now.

153
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,879
Shouldn't you

154
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,519
consider our relationship?

155
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,959
Give me some time.

156
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,519
I still have things

157
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,879
to deal with.

158
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,480
Is it about Mrs. Gu?

159
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,920
Siting.

160
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,199
Do you know that it's just the tip

161
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,720
of the iceberg?

162
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,160
Many things are not
as simple as they seem.

163
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,959
You still don't believe

164
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
that I'll be with you

165
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,639
no matter what happens, right?

166
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,519
I believe that.

167
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
But that's exactly why

168
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,480
I don't want to get you involved.

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,399
My mom is in the hospital.

170
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,600
And my dad...

171
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,120
My dad ended up like this.

172
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,680
You are the only family I have now.

173
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,639
An'an.

174
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,040
I hope you can tell me

175
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,120
everything

176
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,240
without holding back.

177
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,199
Everything will come to an end.

178
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,879
When the time comes,

179
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,519
I will tell you everything.

180
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,519
Give me some time.

181
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:13,879
Okay?

182
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,279
Alright.

183
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,399
I'll wait for you.

184
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,120
After all this,

185
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,519
I'm indeed a bit tired.

186
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,600
I'll stay at home and rest.

187
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,160
I'll be with you.

188
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,160
Okay.

189
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
Good morning, Miss Gu.

190
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,079
I had the housekeeper
prepare breakfast for you.

191
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,839
Have some.

192
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,560
Also, these are the clothes
I prepared for you.

193
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,160
For me?

194
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,759
I have clothes.

195
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,240
The clothes you usually wear

196
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,319
don't match your current status at all.

197
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,279
You are married into the Gu family.

198
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,040
In that case,

199
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,639
we can't treat you poorly.

200
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,800
Am I embarrassing you?

201
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,680
Is there a problem?

202
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,759
I have lived like this

203
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
for over twenty years.

204
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,000
But someone has lived
in a convenience store for a few days.

205
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,639
I'm unshaken by honor or disgrace

206
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,040
thanks to my adaptability.

207
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,320
Any plans for this afternoon?

208
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Not really.

209
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,679
What about you?

210
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,600
I'd like to visit

211
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,080
the places where you grew up.

212
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,919
Okay.

213
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,679
Why did you bring me here?

214
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,039
To climb the wall.

215
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,080
Who goes first?

216
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,000
Climb the wall?

217
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,559
You'll climb the wall

218
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,799
in that dress?

219
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,080
It's a piece of cake.

220
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,559
Back when we had PE classes,

221
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,200
we often climbed this wall for practice.

222
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,919
You climbed over to skip class, right?

223
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
So much babbling.

224
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,639
Be careful.

225
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,320
You know?

226
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
I was good at sports

227
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,720
when I was in school.

228
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,799
I always won

229
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,799
the sprint races.

230
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I can tell.

231
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Stop!

232
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
Did you climb over the wall?

233
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,559
Gu An'an?

234
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,200
Mr. Li.

235
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,960
I saw someone climbing over the wall.

236
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,159
Turns out it was you.

237
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,000
I wondered who had such nerve.

238
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,440
You used to climb over
to buy snacks all the time.

239
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,919
This is Mr. Li, our security.

240
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,320
You heard him?

241
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,399
I always went out to buy snacks and kept

242
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,399
getting caught.

243
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:10,000
That was how we got close.

244
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,360
Hello, Mr. Li.

245
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,440
You must be An'an's boyfriend, right?

246
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,984
No.

247
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:15,080
I am her fiance.

248
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
Perfect match.

249
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,759
You look like the right guy for her.

250
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,320
Gu An'an

251
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,960
has always been naughty.

252
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,759
It's so good to see a young man
accompanying her

253
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,600
when she

254
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,159
goes around making trouble.

255
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,480
Mr. Li.

256
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,120
An'an and I are getting married.

257
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,320
Come to our wedding.

258
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,679
Okay, I will.

259
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,480
I have work to do.

260
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,960
See you around.

261
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,919
Take your time.

262
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,720
Go ahead.

263
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,960
Enter from the main gate next time.

264
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,039
Okay.

265
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,120
Are you really grown-ups?

266
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,279
Who said I would marry you?

267
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,679
It's not up to you.

268
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,200
Come on.

269
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,679
Let's look around.
