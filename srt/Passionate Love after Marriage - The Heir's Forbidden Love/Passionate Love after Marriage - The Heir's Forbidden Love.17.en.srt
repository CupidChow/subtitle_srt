18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,760
It seems that

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,680
it's two against one tonight.

20
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,719
I never get drunk.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,920
People call me the Wine God of Bincheng.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,120
An'an.

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,760
As long as I have fun tonight,

24
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,640
I'll naturally sign the contract.

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,400
Okay.

26
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,159
I'll drink with you.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,159
Let's get wasted.

28
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:43,920
Let's get wasted.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't go.

30
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,599
Why are you so close to me?

31
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,039
I've never seen you drunk before.

32
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,879
How many more sides of you are there?

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,159
What did you say?

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,560
Go.

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,919
Pour me a drink.

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
One more drink.

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Actually, with me here,

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,840
you don't need to try so hard.

39
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,400
What's wrong, Mr. Meng?

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,960
I drank too much

41
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,719
and forgot everything.

42
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,639
Were you drunk?

43
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,719
No.

44
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,279
Huo Siting didn't

45
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,360
do anything to you, right?

46
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,240
Don't talk nonsense.

47
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,519
Thank goodness

48
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,399
you're okay.

49
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,319
Isn't it Mr. Meng who never gets drunk?

50
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,399
Good morning.

51
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,199
You pulled some tricks last night, huh?

52
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,160
Drink less
if you can't hold your liquor.

53
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,879
Why are you blaming it on me?

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Who can't hold his liquor?

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,040
That's enough.

56
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,319
Stop arguing.

57
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,680
Mr. Meng, have you had breakfast?

58
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,279
Not yet.

59
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,680
Since Mr. Huo is here,

60
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,439
why don't you prepare breakfast for us?

61
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm not hungry.

62
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,560
Even if you're not,

63
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,680
An'an must be hungry.

64
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,000
Hurry up.

65
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,360
An'an.

66
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,160
Actually,

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
I'm not so interested

68
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
in the resort project.

69
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,759
As you know,

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm the only heir to the Meng family.

71
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,839
If you want,

72
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
I can transfer all my shares

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,800
to you.

74
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,879
That's huge.

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,040
Stop joking with me.

76
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm not joking.

77
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,160
Of course,

78
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
I have a request.

79
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,759
I'm listening.

80
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,399
Can you

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,560
date me for a day?

82
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,199
Just the two of us.

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,399
Don't get me wrong.

84
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,519
I know

85
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,480
I'm crossing the line here.

86
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,079
But it's not what you think.

87
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,360
If...

88
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,120
Okay.

89
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,240
No problem.

90
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,639
I understand.

91
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,040
I won't get it wrong.

92
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,199
Really?

93
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,160
What about Mr. Huo?

94
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,319
I'll send him to do research tomorrow.

95
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,319
Rest assured.

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,639
He won't disturb us.

97
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,040
That's great.

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,439
I'll prepare for it.

99
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,216
Okay.

100
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,439
Mr. Huo.

101
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,439
Why aren't you

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,800
preparing breakfast?

103
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,519
Do you want a fist-sized bun?

104
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,480
No need.

105
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm not hungry anymore.

106
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,519
Forget it.

107
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,360
Keep the fist-sized bun for yourself.

108
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,319
(Date him for a day)

109
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,279
(and I'll get his shares of the resort.)

110
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,399
(Gu An'an,)

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,680
(if it was this easy,)

112
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,079
(why bother anymore?)

113
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,600
What do you need?

114
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
Can you do some paperwork

115
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,759
in the city tomorrow?

116
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,480
I've sent the files to your email.

117
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,800
Is there really paperwork to do

118
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,199
or you're trying

119
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,439
to be alone with him?

120
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:44,839
What do you mean?

121
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,519
Why did you agree to date him for a day?

122
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,439
You eavesdropped on us?

123
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,079
Answer my question.

124
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,480
Yes.

125
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,680
I agreed to go on a date with him.

126
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,920
But it's just for a day

127
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:56,600
and he said...

128
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,560
What if he's lying?

129
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,439
I don't care.

130
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,560
I have to give it a try.

131
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,519
Doesn't it benefit both of us?

132
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,399
Have you forgotten

133
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,439
our original intention?

134
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,839
Benefit both of us?

135
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,519
You're the one who forgot

136
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,120
our original intention.

137
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,759
Anyway, I said yes.

138
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,879
An'an, you look amazing today.

139
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,320
Do I usually look awful or something?

140
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,759
No, no.

141
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,360
You're just prettier than usual.

142
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,360
You're going out?

143
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,639
I just went jogging

144
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,639
and bought some water.

145
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,600
Here.

146
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,120
Don't thank me.

147
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,639
That's nice of you.

148
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,000
Mr. Meng, what's wrong
with your car tire?

149
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,759
It's okay.

150
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,639
I have Plan B.

151
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,200
An'an.

152
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,240
Please.

153
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,159
Mr. Huo.

154
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,840
We don't have a seat for you.
