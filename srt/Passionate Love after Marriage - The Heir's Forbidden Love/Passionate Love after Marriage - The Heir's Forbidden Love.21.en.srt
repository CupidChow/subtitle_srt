18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,680
Good morning.

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,840
What a hearty breakfast.

20
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,719
You are my wife.

21
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,319
I'll naturally give you the best.

22
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,280
Sit.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
It's just a contractual marriage.

24
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,400
Contractual marriage?

25
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,840
Well, I don't care.

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,879
You are my wife.

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,639
You...

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,719
Fine, you win.

29
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:15,759
Then

30
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,400
call me dear.

31
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,879
Dear sir.

32
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:46,016
(Gu Group's new financial scandal
drops stock price to a new low)

33
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,039
Looks like it's time
to fulfill my promise.

34
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,199
Rest assured.

35
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,360
I will help you

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,439
get your things back.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,159
I'll take your word for it.

38
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,479
I am a man of my word.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,960
Dig in.

40
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,360
Always putting on makeup.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,280
Who are you

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,560
putting on makeup for?

43
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,599
None of your business.

44
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,800
It's not for you.

45
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,000
If you have nothing better to do,

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,520
find a job somewhere.

47
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,000
Who says I have nothing to do?

48
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,879
Aren't you staying at home, too?

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
This is my house.

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,840
Where is Ye Tingfeng?

51
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,080
He was just here.

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,919
Working out?

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,719
Yeah.

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,879
Thirty-eight.

55
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,919
Thirty-nine.

56
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,960
Forty.

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,120
When will you pay off the debt?

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,919
Next month

59
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,479
when I get my wage.

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,919
A CEO like you gets a monthly wage?

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,319
Our boss wants

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,480
two fingers of yours

63
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,240
for each day you delay it.

64
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,879
No.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,680
No.

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,000
I will repay the money.

67
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,959
How about this?

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,920
I'll repay it by tomorrow.

69
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,399
See if there's
anything valuable in the house.

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,800
Take whatever you want

71
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,240
and give me one more day.

72
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,920
I will pay you back tomorrow.

73
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,120
Okay?

74
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,199
You want her?

75
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,360
Fine.

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,839
Take her away.

77
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,399
Ye Tingfeng, you loser!

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,759
Even a tiger doesn't eat its cubs!

79
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,560
How can you sell out your own daughter?

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,439
That's where your value lies.

81
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,600
They didn't want me.

82
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,839
Why me?

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,959
Why don't you go with them?

84
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,879
Why me?

85
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,800
- I...
- Enough.

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
Be quiet.

87
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,560
We're still here.

88
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,680
Okay then.

89
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,439
Tomorrow.

90
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,319
Sir.

91
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:08,839
Gentlemen.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,519
Tomorrow.

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
I will pay off the debt tomorrow.

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,399
If I fail,

95
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,319
take her...

96
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,279
Cut off my fingers.

97
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,199
Tomorrow at the latest.

98
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,920
Alright, sir?

99
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,480
This is your last chance.

100
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,000
Tomorrow.

101
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,639
Take care.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,279
The door isn't locked.

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,600
Sir.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,959
You dagger.

105
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,000
Take care.

106
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,879
Mind your steps.

107
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:40,920
Take care.

108
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,920
Who told you to open up?

109
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,680
How would I know they are loan sharks?

110
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,120
Why did I give birth to you?

111
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,639
I shouldn't have brought you
from the village.

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,720
Pack your things.

113
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,639
Go back to the village.

114
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,360
Now.

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,720
Ye Tingfeng, I'm telling you.

116
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,680
If you dare to kick me out,

117
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,519
I'll expose all those dirty deeds

118
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,439
you've done.

119
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,079
Let's see how you can stay
in the Gu family.

120
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,279
I...

121
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,079
What? Want to hit me?

122
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,319
Go ahead.

123
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,360
Instead of hitting me,

124
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,920
think about how
to repay your loan sharks.

125
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,920
Why don't you help me with that?

126
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,199
Aren't you still the chairman

127
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,439
of the Gu Group?

128
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,959
So what?

129
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,279
Gu Wenran is alive.

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,240
I'm just an acting chairman.

131
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,079
I can't sell the shares.

132
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,680
Then let her die.

133
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,519
Let her die?

134
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,199
But I have to know

135
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,759
where she is right now.

136
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,439
I didn't tell you to kill her.

137
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,920
Gu An'an won't let her mom show up.

138
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,399
No one knows if Gu Wenran

139
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,199
is dead or alive.

140
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
That's right.

141
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,360
Dear media friends,

142
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,879
I assume you have heard

143
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,600
that Gu Wenran,

144
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,519
the chairwoman of the Gu Group,

145
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
who is also my wife,

146
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,399
fell off a cliff three months ago.

147
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,720
Over the past three months,

148
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,199
we have carried out active treatment.

149
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,000
However...

150
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,240
She has left us forever.

151
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,439
Therefore,

152
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,879
I have decided

153
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,560
to act as the chairman of the Gu Group.

154
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,319
Please rest assured.

155
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,160
I will uphold my wife's legacy

156
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,399
and make the Gu Group bigger and better.

157
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,839
Despicable man!

158
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,600
He's eager to take over the group

159
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,319
when my mom's still alive.

160
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,399
I must go find him.

161
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
An'an, calm down.

162
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,680
As long as your mom appears publicly,

163
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,560
your father's lie will collapse.

164
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,600
He knows I won't let my mom show up.

165
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,160
That's why he's taking the risk.

166
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,319
An'an.

167
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,560
What happened to your mom?

168
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,559
She didn't just fall off a cliff, right?

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,720
As I said,

170
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,360
I'll tell you about this one day,

171
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,759
but not now.

172
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,320
So fast?

173
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,720
Your father is cashing out his shares

174
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,759
in secret.

175
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,360
You have the mood to watch TV?

176
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,080
Check the latest flights.

177
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,799
Check the flights? What happened?

178
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
What happened?

179
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,440
We're going to get rich.

180
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,879
Get rich?

181
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,840
From what?

182
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,240
I sold the shares of the Gu Group

183
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,399
on the black market.

184
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,320
Guess what?

185
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,480
Someone bought them immediately.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So soon? Could it be a scammer?

187
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,080
No way.

188
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,159
I've received the money.

189
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,000
Really?

190
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:41,759
Yeah.

191
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,440
So we're becoming

192
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,879
real billionaires.

193
