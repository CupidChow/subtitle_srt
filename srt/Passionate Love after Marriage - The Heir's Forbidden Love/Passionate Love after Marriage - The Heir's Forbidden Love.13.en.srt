What will you do?

19
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm checking your seat belt.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,799
Why don't you just tell me?

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,319
You think I stopped the car

22
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,239
to do what?

23
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,599
Sir, your room card.

24
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,280
Thank you.

25
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,159
My room is next to yours.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,760
You have such a fine hotel

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,719
in your resort.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,200
Of course.

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,079
The resort was only half-built

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,159
when you took over.

31
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,519
I haven't even stayed here.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
You took huge advantage of us.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,519
Rest assured.

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,480
It will be yours sooner or later.

35
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,280
The Meng Group people haven't arrived.

36
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:10,919
Would you

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,599
care for a ride?

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,400
Sure.

39
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,919
It's really pretty here.

40
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,319
Yeah.

41
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,680
And the air is so fresh.

42
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,039
Yeah.

43
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,960
I'd also love to ride a bike by the sea.

44
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,280
Go ahead.

45
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,479
But I can't ride a bike.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,199
Who would've thought
that the mighty Miss Gu

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,919
couldn't ride a bicycle?

48
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,199
Get down.

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,680
I'll do it.

50
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,319
Alright.

51
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,199
Can you do it? I'll help you.

52
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,280
To the left.

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,400
To the right.

54
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,360
To the right.

55
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,639
Left. Right.

56
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,199
Forget it.

57
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm done. You do it.

58
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,479
Hop on.

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
I had enough.

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,639
You're in charge of this project.

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,000
How can you

62
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,120
manage this project

63
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,120
if you don't even know this place?

64
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:21,919
Hop on.

65
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,159
What a beautiful sea.

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,520
Let's look around.

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,280
Go slower.

68
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,479
Do you really know how to ride?

69
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,439
I'm much better than you.

70
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,439
Let me show off

71
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,319
my skills.

72
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,000
If I fall,

73
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
I'll drag you down with me.

74
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,759
Hold on tight.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Go slower.

76
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,039
What's on your mind?

77
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,039
We had a driver

78
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,680
when I was a kid.

79
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,000
But one day,

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
I saw all the other kids

81
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,319
riding bicycles

82
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,000
and wanted to learn.

83
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,159
So my mom bought me a bike.

84
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,199
But

85
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,800
I was afraid of falling

86
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,159
and never learned.

87
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,599
So I had to sit on the back

88
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,520
when she rode it.

89
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,279
It's just that she's in hospital now.

90
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,160
I can't lean on her back

91
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,040
for a ride again.

92
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,959
She will definitely get better.

93
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,240
Let's hope.

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,360
Let's go.

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,199
Where are we going?

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,079
Continue our ride.

97
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:36,800
Let's go.

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,279

I want to stay a bit.

I'll be with you.

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,519
No need.

Alright.

117
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,399
Stay safe.

118
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm off then.

119
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,079
Go back.

120
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,360
Why did you pull me down?

121
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,199
You are so pretty.

122
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,920
Lunatic.

123
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,079
Scoundrel.

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,519
Don't you remember me?

125
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,879
Your pick-up line

126
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,920
is a bit cliché.

127
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,680
You're back.

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,560
What happened?

129
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,079
I fell into the pool.

130
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,480
Why did you fall into the pool?

131
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,680
You think I wanted that?

132
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,079
No, it's just that...

133
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,720
Now you think I'm a burden?

134
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,839
That's not what I meant.

135
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,759
You're so annoying.

136
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,519
What's so annoying about me?

137
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,240
Good morning.

138
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,079
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,519
I was in a bad mood yesterday.

140
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,399
It wasn't directed at you.

141
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,839
I didn't mind it at all.

142
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,240
Are you hungry?

143
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,759
Have some breakfast.

144
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,519
Still not feeling well?

145
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,559
Just a bit dizzy.

146
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,639
Don't go to the dinner meeting.

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,440
I got this.

148
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,960
That won't do.

149
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,039
The Mengs finally agreed to invest.

150
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,440
If I don't attend
our first formal meeting,

151
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,720
who knows what they'll think?

152
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,039
Can you stop trying to be tough?

153
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm not that soft.

154
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,360
Fine.

155
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,600
Come back if you feel unwell.

156
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,519
I can handle it.

157
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay.

158
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,559
Take your medicine.

159
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,039
Sleep some more.

160
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,919
Mr. Meng.
