18
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,719
Please get in, Mom.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,480
Son, are you into An'an?

20
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,079
Mom.

21
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,959
I can't hide anything from you.

22
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,840
An'an is indeed a good girl.

23
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,920
But she is already engaged to Huo Siwen.

24
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,040
You'd better

25
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,560
forget about her.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,239
Come on, Mom. Get in the car.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,519
We have done everything we could.

28
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,480
Now let's wait and see if Lu Yuzhu

29
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,680
will take the bait.

30
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,480
Rest assured.

31
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,000
She will.

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,000
Actually, you look quite good

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
when you're ruthless.

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
You too.

35
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,159
Thanks for your hard work

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,840
these days.

37
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,159
That was unexpected.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,319
I bet you have missed your mom.

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,840
I lived here with my mom
when I was a kid.

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,039
We couldn't pay the electric bill

41
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,360
and had no electricity at night.

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,599
We would look at the stars.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,759
My mom said that the stars represent

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,319
the people we miss the most.

45
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,280
What about you?

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,240
I heard on the news

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,000
that your mom had been in a coma
from falling off a cliff.

48
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,520
How is she doing?

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,039
It's not for you to ask.

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,080
What's wrong?

51
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,159
Rest assured.

52
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,840
I will get you what you want.

53
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,639
You have dealt with Mrs. Meng.

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,879
Next up is the real protagonist,

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Lu Yuzhu.

56
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,919
Let's see if you can

57
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,960
handle her.

58
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,800
Mr. Zhu, long time no see.

59
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,560
Long time no see.

(Lu Yuzhu's Birthday Buffet Dinner)

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
It's been so long
since we last met, right?

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,439
You guys...

63
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,639
Okay, thank you.

64
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,639
What have you been working on?

65
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,800
The same family affairs.

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,479
Don't forget.

67
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,319
Siwen.

68
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,479
Excuse me.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,639
What's wrong, Mom?

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,360
Simon is about to go on stage.

71
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,879
Double-check the procedure

72
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,439
with him now.

73
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,240
Mom.

74
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,479
The resort project

75
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,039
is already a done deal.

76
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
Why did you waste money

77
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,240
on bringing in a designer?

78
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,759
What do you know?

79
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm counting on him
to make this birthday banquet perfect.

80
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,680
Okay, I see.

81
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,800
Happy birthday, Ms. Lu.

82
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,360
Thank you, Zhao.

83
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,839
Where's my phone?

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,800
Is anyone there?

85
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,639
Hello.

86
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,439
Hello, may I help you?

87
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,800
I'm out of paper.

88
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,199
Can you get me some paper?

89
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,399
Sure.

90
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,839
Just a second.

91
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,639
Thank you.

92
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:02,409

(Laxatives)

94
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,439
Excuse me.

95
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,800
Excuse me.

96
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,600
Alright.

97
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,720
How's it going?

98
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,800
Is Simon ready to go on stage?

99
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,800
I looked around

100
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,319
but couldn't find him.

101
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,800
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on him?

102
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,879
I saw him here a second ago.

103
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,680
But he just disappeared.

104
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,839
He didn't answer the call either.

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,480
Come on, Mom.

106
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,639
He's just a designer.

107
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,800
What's the big deal?

108
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,959
It's your birthday.

109
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,879
Cheer up.

110
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,560
You fool.

111
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,000
Let me tell you.

112
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,000
In five minutes,

113
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,319
if you can't find Simon,

114
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,839
from now on,

115
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,399
you will be grounded

116
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,399
at home.

117
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,519
"Grounded at home."

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,720
Hurry up. Go find him.

119
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,279
Hurry up.

120
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,199
- Fine.
- Find him.

121
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,399
Ms. Lu.

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,439
I can help you.

123
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,759
Miss Gu.

124
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,079
What a small world.

125
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,800
Like-minded people

126
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,279
are drawn to each other.

127
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,399
I've done

128
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,600
a lot of investigation

129
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
on the Xinshan Resort project.

130
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,720
I am confident

131
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
to present it on Simon's behalf.

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,920
Why should I trust you?

133
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
I've conducted much research

134
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,120
and planning on this project.

135
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,079
How do I know

136
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,639
that you are not here

137
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,240
to sabotage our project?

138
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,480
Isn't it more awkward

139
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,160
to have no one on the stage?

140
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,319
You wouldn't

141
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,120
want to miss this opportunity either.

142
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,759
How about we take a gamble?

143
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,639
(Lu Yuzhu's Birthday Buffet Dinner)
Thank you so much for taking the time

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
to attend my birthday banquet.

145
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,839
Next, let's welcome

146
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,160
the person in charge of
our resort project on stage.

147
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,439
She will brief you about

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,199
the current status of the resort.

149
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,720
- Okay.
- Okay.

150
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,240
Nice to meet you. I'm Gu An'an
from the Gu Group.

151
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,199
I'll be presenting
this resort project today.

152
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,040
Now let me introduce

153
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,000
the basic situation of our resort.

154
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,519
Mom, why did you let her go on stage?

155
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,560
Because you fool failed

156
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,879
to keep an eye on Simon.

157
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:42,839
Come on.

158
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,199
You can't let her on stage, anyway.

159
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,839
You know what she's thinking, right?

160
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
You don't know, huh?

161
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,360
She's tried

162
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,439
every means and has managed

163
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,480
to see me several times.

164
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,920
See?

165
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,680
This outfit I'm wearing today

166
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,360
is from her.

167
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,759
You've met several times?

168
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,800
I'll kick her off.

169
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,240
What's the rush?

170
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,680
I'd like to see

171
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,399
what tricks she can pull off

172
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,519
right under my nose.

173
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
That's about

174
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,160
the resort's design proposal.

175
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,199
Thank you for attending this banquet.

176
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,800
Let us welcome the protagonist

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,439
Lu Yuzhu to the stage

178
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,959
with the warmest applause.

179
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,080
- Alright!
- Alright!

180
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,399
Some irresponsible media
has been spreading rumors

181
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,480
about my relationship
with the Huo family.

182
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,639
But I believe rumors stop with the wise.

183
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
My wedding with Siwen
has only been postponed.

184
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,279
Now, let us raise our glasses

185
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
to wish my mother-in-law
a happy birthday.

186
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,879
- Happy birthday, Ms. Lu.
- Happy birthday, Ms. Lu.

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,759
Happy birthday, Ms. Lu.

188
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,879
Thank you.

189
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,919
Happy birthday.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,840
