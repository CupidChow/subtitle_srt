Keep following up on the project.

19
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,599
Make no mistake.

20
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,599
Understand?

21
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,200
Okay.

22
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,280
Huo Siting.

23
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,719
What is this?

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,400
Do you know what day it is?

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,799
Why do I care?

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,519
It's my mom's death anniversary.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,959
As the lady of the Huo family,

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,719
please offer her an incense.

29
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,599
I'll offer incense to this lowlife?

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,879
Watch your mouth.

31
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,000
Lowlife.

32
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,879
I swear I could set all of you on fire

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
to keep her company.

34
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,239
You mad dog.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,439
I'm telling you.

36
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,400
I won't allow the photo

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,920
of this lowlife in my house.

38
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,360
What do you want?

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,039
How dare you?

40
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,680
Huo Siting, you just wait.

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,759
I will tell your dad

42
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,800
what you have done today.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,400
An'an, let's go.

44
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,520
Just you wait.

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,560
Seriously.

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,840
That was outrageous.

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
He's like a mad dog

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,199
biting everyone.

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,120
An'an,

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,599
my silly child.

51
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,360
That madman has lost it.

52
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,840
What if he hurts you?

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,159
It's nothing, Ms. Lu.

54
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,879
You have shown me kindness.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,039
I can get hurt

56
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,560
as long as you are safe.

57
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,599
With Huo Siting in my house,

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,680
I can never be at ease.

59
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,560
Keeping him by your side

60
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,360
only causes endless trouble.

61
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,199
I know what to do

62
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,560
about him.

63
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,680
As for you, An'an.

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,000
You'd better

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,039
stay away from that madman.

66
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,919
If you really get hurt,

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,879
I wouldn't know

68
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,080
who to entrust the project to.

69
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,960
Don't worry, Ms. Lu.

70
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,520
Time waits for no one.

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Work is the priority.

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,800
An'an.

73
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,120
You're such a good girl.

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,879
Ms. Lu.

75
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,840
Please don't hesitate

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,039
to assign me tasks.

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,319
There's a final payment from last month.

78
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,439
Wire it to this overseas account for me.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,680
You know what to do, right?

80
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,280
Rest assured.

81
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,759
What's with the knife?

82
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,319
Ever since he barged in,

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,959
I've been having nightmares.

84
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,279
Why did you come at this hour?

85
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,160
I got you into this whole mess.

86
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,720
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,560
Isn't it

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,959
a bit too late for that?

89
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,439
Why didn't you hit me earlier?

90
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,120
I couldn't.

91
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,319
Do you know

92
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,800
that a move of yours

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
might render all my efforts

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
completely futile?

95
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,040
Huo Siting.

96
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,279
When did you become

97
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,160
so indecisive?

98
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,199
Should I just

99
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,240
watch you get hurt?

100
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,959
Compared to my mom's injuries,

101
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,000
that would be nothing.

102
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,800
If you can't even pay

103
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
such a small price,

104
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,920
then I've been

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,800
wrong about you.

106
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,600
I see.

107
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,040
It won't happen again.

108
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,199
Lu Yuzhu gave me a card.

109
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,040
She wants to wire money

110
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,839
to an overseas account.

111
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,720
The same mysterious beneficiary.

112
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,920
I think it's our chance

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,439
to bring her down.

114
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,560
She's transferring money so openly.

115
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,079
It's probably not so simple.

116
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,392
(Secretary Wu)

117
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,759
Hello, Secretary Wu.

118
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,279
Ms. Lu.

119
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,000
Miss Gu came to the company.

120
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,199
What? She went to the company?

121
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,759
Yeah.

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,519
I think she's here for Mr. Huo.

123
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,319
Okay, I see.

124
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,079
Don't you owe me

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,720
an apology for what happened?

126
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,279
What are you doing here?

127
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,920
It's my father's company.

128
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,439
I'm free to come.

129
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,839
You almost hurt An'an.

130
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,319
I haven't told your father.

131
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,000
Yet you're demanding an apology?

132
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,000
Be sensible.

133
00:07:59,279 --> 00:07:59,920
Go away.

134
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,879
Huo Siting.

135
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
You'd better show me some respect.

136
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,639
Otherwise,

137
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,360
I won't go easy on you.

138
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,360
How?

139
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,800
Are you going to

140
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
kick me out just like back then?

141
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,519
Lu Yuzhu, listen.

142
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
This time, I will not leave.

143
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,680
Your days are coming to an end.

144
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,319
What do you mean?

145
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,360
What do I mean?

146
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,600
You framed my mom
for cheating with a servant.

147
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,759
My dad got enraged

148
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,480
and drove us out.

149
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,759
I even suspect

150
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,519
that my mom didn't die of illness.

151
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,399
You sent someone to kill her.

152
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,440
Don't talk nonsense.

153
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,919
You know better

154
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,159
if I'm talking nonsense.

155
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,200
This time,

156
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,480
I will kick you out by myself.

157
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,759
Fine.

158
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,559
I'd like to find out

159
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,840
who will remain in this family

160
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,039
in the end.

161
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,159
Madman.

162
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,000
Good day, Ms. Lu.

163
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,320
Good day, Ms. Lu.

164
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,799
- Ms. Lu.
- Ms. Lu.
