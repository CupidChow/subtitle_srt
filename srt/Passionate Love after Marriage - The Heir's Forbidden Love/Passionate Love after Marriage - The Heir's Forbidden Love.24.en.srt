An'an is a good girl.

You should treat her well.

Don't you want An'an's mother

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,719
I know her mother is injured

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,799

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,599
I see. Thank you, Dad.

35
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,360
Don't be so distant.

36
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,680

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,800
Why did you bring me here?

39
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,919
Do you remember
when you first came here?

40
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,159
Of course.

41
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,080
You gave me advice every day

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,520
and fought with me for the bed.

43
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,039

130
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,720
You really know how to save money.

131
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,439

132
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,439
My honeymoon is

133
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,199
a two-week cabin tour.

134
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,160
There are lots of places

135
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,559
you have visited.

136
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,759
But I went to those places alone.

137
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,360
You weren't there.

138
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,320

141
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,919

142
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,279

144
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,159

145
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,720
Maybe he can introduce you.

146
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,840
No need.

147
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,759
Why?

148
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,120
I've consulted this doctor.

149
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,720
I know what to do

150
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,759

151
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,080
Alright.

152
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,720
Do as you wish.

153
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,200
We've stayed here for so long.

154
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
It's time to go back.

155
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,440
Then let's go back.
