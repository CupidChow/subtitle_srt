=Episode 6=

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,159
Thank you for stepping in, Miss Gu.

19
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,560
Thank you

20
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,760
for giving me this opportunity.

21
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm afraid I didn't

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,319
give you the opportunity.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,079
How did our designer

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,599
simply disappear?

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,280
Nothing escapes your discerning eye.

26
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,599
That's right.

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,079
I planned everything

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,079
meticulously.

29
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,599
You're quite direct, aren't you?

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,760
Go ahead, what do you want?

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,680
I know it's hard to marry
into a wealthy family.

32
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,079
Just like you.

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,159
You held a birthday banquet

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
to pave the way for the resort project.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,640
Ms. Lu.

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,400
I planned all these

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,799
just to prove to you

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,400
that I am the best choice for Huo Siwen.

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,400
It doesn't matter who my son marries.

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,680
What matters is

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,799
whether she can help him in his career.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
Of course, I understand.

43
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,000
The marriage alliance

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,319
between the Huo and Gu families
is a done deal.

45
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,879
I know you've always wanted
to work with the Meng family.

46
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,520
If I marry your son,

47
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,800
the Meng family

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,639
would naturally work with you.

49
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,120
In that case,

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,879
compared to Ye Linna,

51
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,960
I can offer greater help

52
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,560
to your family.

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,520
You are very clever.

54
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,479
You know how to
demonstrate your capabilities.

55
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,479
But

56
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,879
what are your terms?

57
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
Nothing much.

58
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,520
I know the resort project

59
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,599
is a juicy opportunity.

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,000
I just want to earn

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,199
my first pot of gold

62
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,000
to help me take back

63
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,240
what's mine from the Gu family.

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,120
An'an.

65
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,000
This is a meeting gift.

66
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,439
I hope it's not too late.

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,599
You're well-prepared, right?

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,840
Huo Siwen.

69
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,120
Gu An'an is still your fiancee.

70
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,840
You'd better sever ties with Ye Linna.

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,840
Gu An'an.

72
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,759
How did you bewitch my mom?

73
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,159
Ms. Lu, I'll be heading back.

74
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,159
Let's call it a day.

75
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,000
Listen to your mom.

76
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,120
Congratulations.

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,159
Congratulations to you too.

78
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,800
Your plan is working.

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,560
Keep me updated

80
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,599
once you move in with them.

81
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,919
I have my plans.

82
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,599
I will dig up dirt on Lu Yuzhu.

83
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,840
Don't forget.

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,360
We have an agreement.

85
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,719
Rest assured.

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,840
I also honor contractual obligations.

87
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,759
I know you will

88
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,080
dig up dirt on her.

89
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,599
But I'm worried about

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
your safety.

91
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,600
Huo Siting.

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Don't fall in love with me.

93
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,720
What will happen

94
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,439
if I do?

95
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,680
You'll be hurt.

96
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,040
It may sound cruel

97
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,120
but those who don't know human nature

98
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,560
are destined to be hurt.

99
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,160
But I'm not afraid.

100
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,079
Here's the key.

101
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,199
Feel free to come here whenever

102
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,240
you're in trouble.

103
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,959
Thank you.

104
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,160
I will keep it with me.

105
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,600
From now on,

106
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,199
no one will snatch your bed.

107
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,879
You can finally sleep comfortably.

108
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,040
Tomorrow,

109
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,759
I will take you to do the shopping.

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,360
What do you think?

111
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,839
Not pretty.

112
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,879
How about this one?

113
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,199
Not pretty, either?

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,480
Nothing looks good.

115
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,160
I want them all.

116
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,240
Pay up.

117
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,560
Why do you need so many ugly clothes?

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,720
Ugly?

119
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,399
They look pretty to me.

120
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,879
Don't tell me

121
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,240
you can't even afford these few clothes.

122
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,120
Fine.

123
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,120
Here.

124
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,360
Buy whatever you like.

125
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,600
Welcome.

126
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,319
Check, please.

127
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,480
- Be quiet.
- What happened?

128
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,160
You did that on purpose.

129
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,199
That's right.

130
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:58,920
You just...

131
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,920
Took advantage of you.

132
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,600
Sorry about that.

133
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,360
Siwen is becoming

134
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,000
more and more ill-mannered.

135
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,199
Siwen has been
running around for the resort lately.

136
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,839
He must be stuck in traffic.

137
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,600
Is he so dedicated to his work?

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,480
Dedicated to what?

139
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,879
- Look, he's back now.
- I'm exhausted.

140
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,360
Tired, son?

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,079
- Dig in.
- Okay.

142
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,199
Honey.

143
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,920
There is your favorite fish today.

144
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,160
An'an, is it ready?

145
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,360
Coming.

146
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,920
Mr. Huo, please try it.

147
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,600
Honey, An'an made all these dishes

148
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,959
on the table.

149
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,480
I know my incident with Siwen

150
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,839
has given you a lot of trouble.

151
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,319
I made outrageous demands

152
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,720
to retaliate due to my impulsiveness.

153
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,240
I know you like fish.

154
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,959
I caught it myself.

155
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,000
I hope you like it.

156
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,920
That's how you brush us off?

157
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,800
Do you think it's so easy

158
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,480
to marry into our family?

159
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,199
A willing fish rises to Jiang Ziya's

160
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,399
hookless and baitless line.

161
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,160
So I am the one

162
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,839
willingly marrying into the Huo family.

163
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,959
Willingly?

164
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,959
Alright.

165
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,040
That's fine.

166
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,399
Let me see.

167
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,519
Let me see how willing you are.

168
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,840
Willingly, huh?

169
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,600
Take a bite.

170
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,480
Willingly? Eat.

171
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,480
What are you doing?

172
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,840
Stop messing around.

173
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,039
She said she's doing it willingly.

174
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,679
Dad, I'm back.

175
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,919
Sorry I'm late.

176
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,200
What a feast.

177
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,360
I haven't eaten at home for so long.

178
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,840
Pigs might fly.

179
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,960
When did you ever come to our place

180
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,559
to have dinner with us?

181
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,600
Dad, I was immature.

182
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,639
How dare an illegitimate child
dine with us?

184
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,519
My surname is Huo.

185
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,919
If you call me illegitimate,

186
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,440
then you are not only insulting me.

187
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,480
Want trouble?

188
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,720
Enough. Good to have you back.

189
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,360
An'an.

190
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,879
Settle in first.

191
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
As for your wedding,

192
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,840
we'll discuss it later.

193
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
Come on, sit down and eat.

194
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,440
I'm done.

195
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,200
This fish

196
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,000
isn't purebred.

197
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,120
I don't want it.

198
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:32,879
You...

199
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Dad, don't be mad.

200
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,879
Let him be.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,720
This is your favorite dish.

202
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,960
Here, take a bite.

203
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:45,919
Okay.

204
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,679
Come on, dig in.
