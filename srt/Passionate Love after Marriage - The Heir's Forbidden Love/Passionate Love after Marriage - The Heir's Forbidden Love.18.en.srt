Mr. Meng.

20

An'an.

21
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,159
Don't call me Mr. Meng.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,719
Just call me Xiao.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,560
Xiao.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,599
Do you think our project...

25
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,319
An'an.

26
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,920
Let's not talk business today.

27
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,319
Do you have to work later?

28
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,239
Sorry, I was a bit distracted.

29
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,840
Oh, right, An'an.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
I prepared a surprise for you.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,840
A surprise?

32
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,840
What is it?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,159
I can't tell you yet.

34
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,920
You'll find out at eight o'clock.

35
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,280
Is there something you want to tell me?

36
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,840
An'an.

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,240
You know?

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,039
I fell in love with you

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,319
the moment I saw you.

40
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,639
I know.

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,759
I may sound

42
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,319
not serious enough to you,

43
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,400
but I always

44
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,879
speak my mind.

45
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,240
I've met countless girls,

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,159
but you are different.

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,479
How am I different?

48
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,240
You aren't afraid of me.

49
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,680
Afraid of you?

50
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:31,840
Yeah.

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,159
Other girls

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,039
either flatter me deliberately

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,360
or avoid me entirely.

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,439
But you are different.

55
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,240
I can tell

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,759
what you like

57
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,560
and what you hate by your looks.

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,719
Doesn't that mean

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,080
I need to work on my acting skills?

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,639
An'an.

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,280
Today, I'd like to

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,439
tell you something.

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,840
Are you alright?

64
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
Are you okay?

65
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm fine.

66
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,680
An'an.

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,199
I want to tell you...

68
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,439
Well...

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,879
An'an, dig in.

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,479
Give me a second.

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,599
I'm going to the bathroom.

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,960
Be right back.

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,719
Okay.

74
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,520
You caused all the trouble, huh?

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,800
So what if it was me?

76
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,360
I can't let a sheep
walk into a tiger's den.

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm not a sheep.

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,919
Nor is he a tiger.

79
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,360
Leave before he comes back.

80
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,520
What if I don't?

81
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,360
What do you want?

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,240
Didn't I tell you?

83
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,879
I have to secure

84
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000

Sorry about that.

99
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,000
You missed the fireworks

100
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
he arranged for you.

101
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,720
I'll make it up with a better one.

102
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,040
I actually don't like fireworks.

103
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,680
You don't?

104
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,480
Clouds scatter easily.

105
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,920
So do fireworks.

106
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,199
They are both momentary.

107
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,480
What do you like then?

108
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,000
I like stars.
[*"Star" sounds like "gorilla".]

109
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,279
What's your problem?

110
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:47,519
But stars

111
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,319
are only visible at night.

112
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,120
It's not the same.

113
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,000
I like stars

114
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,079
because they shine

115
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,959
from light-years away.

116
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,800
No matter whether we see them or not,

117
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,240
they are always there.

118
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,399
The stars are right there.

119
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,279
As long as you look up,

120
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,600
you can see them.

121
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,160
Do you still

122
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,240
want to go back?

123
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,720
What's the point of going back now?

124
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,279
Huo Siting, I'm telling you.

125
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,879
If you sabotage my plans again,

126
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,360
I will disappear for good.

127
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,639
Fine.

128
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
I won't do that again.

129
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,319
Gu An'an, aren't you going to explain?

130
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,360
Why did you run away?

131
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,639
I waited for you

132
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,639
till dawn.

133
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,759
Where did you go?

134
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,439
Well, I...

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,399
You're a terrible girlfriend.

136
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,240
How will you

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,839
make it up to me?

138
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
Actually, I also had diarrhea yesterday.

139
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,879
You too?

140
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Yeah.

141
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,839
I was thinking

142
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,040
that it was our first date.

143
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,639
I couldn't lose face in front of you.

144
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,360
Right?

145
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,720
It seems that

146
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm quite important

147
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,519
to you.

148
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,800
It still hurts a bit.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Give me a second.

150
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,000
Go on.

151
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,360
Mr. Meng.

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,720
Mr. Meng.

153
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,000
What's wrong?

154
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,360
Bad news, Mr. Meng.

155
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,360
The farmers are

156
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,560
causing trouble downstairs.

157
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,120
Come out.

158
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,800
- Come out.
- Come out.

159
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,040
Calm down.

160
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,360
Just a second.

161
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,120
What's going on?

162
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,759
Calm down.

163
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,560
Stop shouting.

164
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,120
Give us an explanation.

165
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,160
Let's talk things through.
Don't make trouble.

166
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,279
- Give us an explanation.
- Give us an explanation.

167
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,079
Shut up.

168
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,120
Give us an explanation today!

169
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,279
You said you'd use our land
for construction.

170
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,279
Look what happened.

171
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,279
You profiteers
have made a fortune out of it.

172
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,800
"Profiteers"?

173
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,079
Didn't we spend money on the labor

174
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,439
and materials?

175
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,240
Mr. Huo.

176
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,959
We can tell that the resort

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,720
is doing better

178
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,240
and it will make huge money.

179
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,240
You know.

180
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,320
You acquired the land

181
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,679
at an extremely low price.

182
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,960
Fine.

183
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,200
How much do you want?

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,799
Ten million.

185
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,200
- Yeah. Ten million.
- Ten million.

186
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,039
Not a cent less.

187
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,120
Ten million?

188
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,399
You're going back on your word

189
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,720
and making crazy demands.

190
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,799
If you don't agree,

191
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
we will smash this hotel!

192
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,039
- Smash it!
- Smash it!

193
