=The Heir's Forbidden Love=

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,806
=Episode 23=

18
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:12,879
This park used to be

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,519
my second favorite place
apart from the school.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,879
I was quite popular.

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,439
The kids loved to play with me.

22
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,000
I loved the swing the most.

23
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,959
Because it felt like

24
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,159
the swing took all my troubles away.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
What was bothering the little An'an?

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,200
My mom was striving for her career,

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,000
but my dad was cheating on her.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
I came to the park

29
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,640
to avoid seeing them argue.

30
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,439
They thought I didn't know,

31
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,560
but I knew everything.

32
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,519
Don't you remember
anything else about this park?

33
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,760
Like what?

34
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,319
So you don't remember

35
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,719
everything from childhood.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,159
Quail Egg.

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,560
Quail Egg?

38
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,039
How do you know?

39
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,759
I have my way.

40
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,199
Confess to earn

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,360
some leniency.

42
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:17,960
Tell me.

43
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,960
Or I'll kill you.

44
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,759
Tell me your secret in exchange.

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,919
I'm going to the swing.

46
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,599
Did you have fun with the program today?

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,439
It was full of fun.

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,240
Of course.

49
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,240
I have lived a splendid life
since childhood.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,159
You didn't have to go through this.

51
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,360
I shouldn't have

52
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,960
dragged you into this.

53
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,159
What does it have to do with you?

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,319
It's a test of fate for me.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,840
It's proven

56
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,719
that I can face everything.

57
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,479
Isn't it?

58
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,240
Alright, I have to go home.

59
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,960
Go ahead.

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,240
An'an.

61
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,160
Don't push me too far.

62
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,360
Or you will have a tough time too.

63
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,000
I still see you as my dad.

64
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,279
It's time to stop.

65
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,199
You see me as your dad?

66
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,040
So who took me to court?

67
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,279
Who kicked me out of the Gu family?

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
Don't pretend that you care.

69
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,040
Do you hear me?

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,079
What a...

71
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,160
What a loser.

72
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,120
Gu An'an.

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
You better not blame me.

74
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
You made me do this.

75
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,160
Ye Tingfeng.

76
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,439
Huo Siting.

77
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,120
You guys...

78
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,079
Huo Siting.

79
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,480
Are you okay?

80
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,040
Are you alright?

81
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm fine.

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,600
What should we do?

83
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:41,345
(Operating Room)

84
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,872
(During the operation)

85
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,680
Doctor, how is he doing?

86
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,920
He's fine.

87
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,560
The wound is a centimeter away

88
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,000
from his kidney, thankfully.

89
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,360
Or he'd be in trouble.

90
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,399
Miss Gu.

91
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
Go ahead and complete
the admission procedures.

92
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,639
The patient can't get out of bed yet.

93
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,839
He needs care.

94
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,759
Okay, I see.

95
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
Thank you, doctor.

96
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,399
You're welcome.

97
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,720
You woke up. I'll get the doctor.

98
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,800
Wait.

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,639
Stay here with me.

100
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,279
Okay.

101
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,600
Rest assured.

102
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm not going anywhere.

103
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,120
An'an, I have something to tell you.

104
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Do you know how I found out

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
about that nickname?

106
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,279
I used to go to that park
when I was a kid, too.

107
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,439
Once, some kids were bullying me.

108
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,279
You rushed out to protect me

109
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,199
and drove them away.

110
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,160
Since then,

111
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,680
you've been like a shining star to me.

112
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,399
But I had an inferior complex

113
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,519
and could only watch you from afar.

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,360
Why didn't you tell me?

115
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,000
Because when we met again,

116
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,279
I wasn't strong enough

117
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,560
to protect you the way you protected me.

118
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,040
Enough.

119
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,800
From now on, I'll always be with you.

120
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,680
I will do whatever you say.

121
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,680
Do you mean it?

122
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,480
What do you want?

123
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,720
Here's the chicken soup.

124
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,800
Feed me.

125
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,800
Feed you?

126
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,800
Yeah.

127
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,600
How can I drink like this?

128
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,320
Did you hurt your kidney or your hands?

129
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,919
You promised me.

130
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,080
Fine.

131
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,200
Tastes good?

132
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,080
Yeah.

133
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,600
What's wrong?

134
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,840
My leg...

135
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,759
It's hurting?

136
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,840
I'll get a doctor.

137
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:18,960
No need.

138
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,639
It's just a bit numb.

139
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,240
A massage will do.

140
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,600
Huo Siting.

141
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,279
Don't go too far.

142
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,720
You promised me.

143
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,039
Fine.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's quite comfortable.

145
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,039
I didn't expect you
to be a good masseuse.

146
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,799
I've studied the acupoints.

147
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,679
Wherever it hurts shows a problem.

148
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,159
- Really?
- Let me check.

149
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,039
Is it comfortable?

150
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,399
It doesn't hurt.

151
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,399
It doesn't?

152
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,600
What if I press it a bit more?

153
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,480
That's enough.

154
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,279
My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

155
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,039
An'an.

156
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,840
An'an.

157
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,600
An'an.

158
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,360
What now?

159
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,679
My back is itchy.

160
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,039
Can you scratch it for me?

161
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,679
A little lower.

162
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,679
Here?

163
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,720
Right there.

164
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,840
Right there.

165
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,080
I haven't bathed in days.

166
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,679
Will you help me take a bath?

167
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
You're really crossing the line.

168
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Should I boil some water,

169
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,480
pluck your hair, and cook you?

170
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,720
No need.

171
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,320
Take a rest.

172
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,919
Siting.

173
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,480
Dad.

174
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,679
Is it still hurting?

175
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,720
I'm much better, Dad.

176
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,600
Ye Tingfeng has been arrested.

177
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,000
Leave the rest

178
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,440
to me from now on.

179
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Thank you, Dad.

180
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,480
An'an, you've worked hard.

181
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,600
It's all right, Uncle.

182
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,840
It's what I should do.

183
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,039
Look at you.

184
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,279
You're getting closer and closer.

185
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,879
We must speed up
with the wedding preparations.

186
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,320
Don't worry, Dad.

187
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,039
The IV is ending.

188
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,440
I'll get the doctor.

189
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,879
An'an.

190
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,919
Do you truly love Siting?
