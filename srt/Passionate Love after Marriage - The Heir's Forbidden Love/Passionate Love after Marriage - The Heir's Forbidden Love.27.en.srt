00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,039
Dad, it's all done.

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,479
Dad.

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
What's the good news?

21
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,560
Take a look.

22
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,879
Someone sent me a short video.

23
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,360
Look at the raging waves.

24
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,319
No one

25
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,960
can survive this.

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,960
We've cleared all the obstacles

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,800
in our way.

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,479
I can finally have some peace.

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,639
Dad.

30
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,080
I only did what I should do.

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,319
But this video...

32
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,159
Siting.

33
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,159
From now on,

34
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,879
you are the sole successor
of our family.

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,919
I don't want to lose you again.

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,120
Rest assured.

37
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,159
It's a secret between us.

38
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,199
Got it.

39
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:37,440
(Mr. Huo)

40
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,279
Mr. Huo, what can I do for you?

41
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,800
I need your help.

42
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,959
I never thought you'd ask for my help.

43
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,040
But why should I help you?

44
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
If you still want to be with An'an,

45
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,839
do as I say.

46
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,160
What's happened to her?

47
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,360
Come in.

48
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,439
Dad.

49
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,680
Siting.

50
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,519
The resort's kick-off ceremony
is coming up.

51
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,759
How's the preparation going?

52
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Everything is ready.

53
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,439
There are a few documents
for you to stamp.

54
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,040
Leave them there.

55
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:29,568
(All Recordings)

56
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:45,773
(Quarterly Financial Report)

57
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,000
Dad, why don't you
give me the key so that I can

58
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,680
stamp on the papers myself?

59
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,720
Siting, this safe doesn't just

60
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,319
keep the official seal of our Huo Group.

61
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,040
My life depends on it.

62
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,800
What now?

63
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,279
Do you also

64
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,360
want my life?

65
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,720
Yes, I do.

66
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
How ruthless.

67
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,439
However,

68
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,600
my life

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,680
is not for anyone to take.

70
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,399
Dad, at this point,

71
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,319
can you tell me what happened?

72
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,720
Our Huo family

73
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,240
has led the hotel industry
for so many years.

74
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
We do have some business acumen.

75
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,800
But the roots of our wealth

76
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,279
and all our secrets

77
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,560
lie in here.

78
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,399
So Mrs. Gu got hold of

79
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,399
the evidence to incriminate us.

80
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,680
Business is like a war.

81
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,040
That bad woman collected evidence

82
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,360
just to take us down.

83
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,000
It was a matter
of life and death between us.

84
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,800
Siting.

85
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,399
Dad has taken down
the Gu family for you.

86
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,920
From now on, you have

87
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,120
no rivals in Bincheng.

88
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,759
Totally.

89
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,720
We only killed two people.

90
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,639
You turned out

91
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,160
to be more ruthless than me.

92
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,879
You even killed the woman you loved.

93
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,440
I had the best teacher.

94
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,600
Meng Xiao.

95
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,519
How come it's you?

96
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,480
I...

97
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,759
What's going on?

98
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,000
Why am I here?

99
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,879
I went swimming

100
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
and found you and your mom by the pool.

101
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,679
So I brought you two back.

102
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,480
Me and my mom by the pool?

103
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,840
Why were you swimming at night?

104
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,759
Forget it.

105
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,320
I have something for you.

106
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,799
(Our Huo family has led
the hotel industry for so many years.)

107
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,240
(We do have some business acumen.)

108
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,360
(But the roots of our wealth)

109
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,840
(and all our secrets)

110
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,120
(lie in here.)

111
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,919
(So Mrs. Gu got hold of)

112
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,960
(the evidence to incriminate us.)

113
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,960
(Business is like a war.)

114
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,240
(That bad woman collected evidence)

115
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,679
(just to take us down.)

116
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,200
(It was a matter
of life and death between us.)

117
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,240
(Dad has taken down
the Gu family for you.)

118
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,759
(From now on, you have)

119
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,200
(no rivals in Bincheng.)

120
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,080
It's the evidence I've been looking for.

121
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,879
It's the resort's
kick-off ceremony tomorrow.

122
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,639
All the media will be there.

123
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,639
As long as we seize the opportunity,

124
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,240
we can bring down Huo Jinyun.

125
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,879
Right.

126
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,120
How did you get these statements?

127
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,879
I-I know a private detective.

128
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,200
I hired him to investigate this.

129
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,440
If you knew such an expert,

130
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,840
why wouldn't you tell me earlier?

131
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,759
I wasted so much effort

132
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,919
and even married
that despicable Huo Siting.

133
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,080
Are you hungry?

134
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,759
I'll get you something to eat.

135
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,320
Next, please welcome Huo Jinyun,

136
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
the Chairman of the Huo Group, on stage.

137
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,120
Welcome.

138
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,200
Thank you all for coming.

139
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,320
It's the kick-off ceremony
of the resort.

140
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,360
Thank you for coming

141
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,080
to witness the new era

142
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,720
that belongs to us, the Huo Group.

143
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,440
- Great!
- Great!

144
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,519
Huo Jinyun.

145
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,519
Aren't you celebrating too early?

146
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,840
Gu An'an.

147
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,639
Your good days are over.

148
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,919
You must be very confused.

149
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,639
Because you've already "killed" me.

150
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,039
What?

151
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,720
"Killed"?

152
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,720
Stop talking nonsense.

153
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,799
I'm not talking nonsense.

154
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,120
You pushed my mom
off the cliff, didn't you?

155
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,399
And now you want to kill me.

156
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
You're really ruthless.

157
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,559
Y-You're framing me.

158
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,200
This is slander. Pure slander.

159
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,480
She's not slandering him.

160
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,159
I can testify

161
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,399
that you orchestrated all of this.

162
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,720
- Huo Siting.
- Dad.

163
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,840
I once thought

164
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
if I worked hard,

165
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,960
you would acknowledge

166
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,039
me and my mom.

167
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,519
But I was wrong.

168
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,679
You appreciate no one but yourself.

169
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,519
I'm calling you Dad for the last time.

170
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,639
From now on,

171
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,279
we are no longer father and son.

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,480
How ungrateful!

173
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,440
For...

174
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,320
For this woman,

175
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,360
you...

176
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,600
You conspired to frame me.

177
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,720
It's empty talk.

178
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,559
Where's the evidence?

179
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,039
I recorded our dialogue.

180
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,279
I've handed it to the police.

181
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,639
It seems to be true.

182
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,679
Are you Huo Jinyun?

183
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,039
You are suspected of homicide.

184
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,320
Please come with us.

185
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,000
- Let's go.
- Officer.

186
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,559
- Officer.
- Let's go.

187
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,240
Officer.

188
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,039
I am innocent.

189
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,679
