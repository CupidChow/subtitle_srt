=Episode 2=

18
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,640
Why is it you again?

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,040
It seems that the stab wound
isn't too serious.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,480
It's just a minor injury.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,439
I am in very good health.

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,359
You are not here

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,560
to discuss your health with me, right?

24
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,640
As expected, you didn't go

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,239
to the wedding venue to get married.

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,040
But are you content
with the shares of the resort?

27
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,400
I don't believe your appetite
is that small.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,879
By cooperating with me.,

29
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,000
you will gain more.

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,719
Your appetite is too big.

31
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,879
I'm afraid you would devour me.

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,159
You're very smart.

33
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,000
However, cooperating with me

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,039
is your only choice now.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,159
Mr. Huo,

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
I've seen your sincerity.

37
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,199
But if you persist,

38
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,159
it would be unseemly.

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
You stabbed me,

40
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,159
and I kissed you.

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,039
Now we're even.

42
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:55,639
A stab

43
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,120
is not worth my kiss.

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,599
Moreover,

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,919
that was a stab by your own hand.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,879
Gu An'an,

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,159
we will meet again.

48
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,639
Mom,

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,080
since you've been in a coma,

50
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,479
Dad has taken control over the Gu Group.

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,639
He even brought his illegitimate child

52
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,879
into our family.

53
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
But rest assured.

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,520
I've got everything
at home under control.

55
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,319
Mr. Chen,

56
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
thank you for your help
during this time.

57
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,519
Miss Gu,

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,759
you're too kind to say so.

59
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,519
Mrs. Gu has been gracious to me.

60
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,000
Now that the Gu family is in trouble,

61
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,720
I won't just stand by.

62
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,120
This private hospital
is run by a friend of mine.

63
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,000
No one else knows.

64
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,600
So just rest easy.

65
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,879
But there's one more thing

66
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,199
that I'd like you
to help me with as a lawyer.

67
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,399
I know.

68
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,120
The incident of Mrs. Gu
falling off the cliff

69
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,199
is too suspicious.

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
If I find something,

71
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,600
I will notify you immediately.

72
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,240
Okay.

73
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,639
Then I'll leave it to you.

74
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm leaving now.

75
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,399
(Mom,)

76
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,680
(rest assured.)

77
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,000
(I will take back everything)

78
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,759
(that belongs to our family.)

79
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,720
An'an! An'an!

80
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,680
You're finally back.

81
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,879
Quick, help us.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Look at us.

83
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,759
Who are you?

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,319
Who allowed you into our home?

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,839
Miss Gu,

86
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,720
we are here to collect the debt.

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,279
Collecting the debt?

88
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,560
This is trespassing.

89
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,959
I will call the police right now.

90
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,720
No, don't call the police.

91
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,360
Don't.

92
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,279
They will kill us

93
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,720
before the police arrive.

94
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,959
How much does my father owe you?

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
30 million?

96
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,439
An'an, please save me.

97
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,879
I'm sorry. I did something wrong.

98
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,759
Miss Gu,

99
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,519
I won't make it difficult for you.

100
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,800
You're running a big company.

101
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
You can afford
this amount of money, right?

102
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,160
Pay the debt,

103
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,120
and I will spare the two of them.

104
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,600
Or...

105
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
I don't have money.

106
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,079
But you must have shares, right?

107
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,600
It's okay if you have no money.

108
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,920
You can offset the debt
with some shares.

109
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,040
Shares?

110
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,399
I won't give you any shares.

111
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
The Gu Group's money
belongs to all shareholders.

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,360
As for the two of them,

113
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,519
whether to beat or kill them

114
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,680
is up to you.

115
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,759
Wait.

116
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,199
How about this?

117
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,240
I can't give you all the shares.

118
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,759
If you kill one of them,

119
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,160
I will give you half of the shares.

120
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,079
Once you've finished the kill,

121
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,639
we'll sign the contract right after.

122
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,800
How about it?

123
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,399
Then kill me.

124
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
I beg you to kill me.

125
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,199
I'm old already.

126
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,160
Kill me.

127
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,839
An'an,

128
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,879
it's all my fault.

129
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,240
I shouldn't have fought over Siwen.

130
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,800
You should kill me.

131
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,680
No, Linna.

132
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,600
You are still young.

133
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,319
If someone has to be killed,
let it be me.

134
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,879
What great drama
of a father-and-daughter bond!

135
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,839
Ye Tingfeng, do you take me for a fool?

136
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,800
If something happens to you,

137
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,560
you'd be the first
to use your own daughter as a shield.

138
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,879
You wouldn't be so loving.

139
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,279
So stop acting in front of me.

140
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,240
Gu An'an, you...

141
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,040
You are truly ruthless.

142
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,439
You turned a blind eye
to your father 'in danger'.

143
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,959
Alright, fellas.

144
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,680
Don't just stand there.

145
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,120
Get her.

146
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,800
Stop!

147
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,600
Stop!

148
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,439
Don't run.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Stop!

150
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,800
Get in the car.

151
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,600
Don't run.

152
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,079
Stop!

153
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,959
Stop!

154
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,560
What place is this?

155
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,519
A safe place.

156
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,480
Did you follow me again?

157
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
You are really ungrateful.

158
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,920
I just saved you.

159
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,800
And now you're doubting me.

160
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,720
Consider that I owe you a favor.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
Now that's more like it.

162
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
This is your home?

163
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,200
You must have heard.

164
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,759
When I was young, my mother and I
were kicked out of the Huo family.

165
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,879
And we've lived here ever since.

166
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,159
I didn't expect that you

167
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,320
would actually live in such a place.

168
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,440
As a daughter of the Gu family,

169
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,039
you're now residing in such a place too.

170
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,720
Who...

171
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,000
Who said I'm going to live here?

172
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,320
I'm just here to have a look.

173
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,759
You won't want to go back, right?

174
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,360
Aren't you afraid

175
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,519
that they will hurt you if you go back?

176
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,639
Will I be safe

177
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
if I stay here?

178
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,200
It's up to you.

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,120
Your wound is bleeding.

180
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,279
Didn't you say
it was already taken care of?

181
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,679
It's getting late.

182
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,919
If you want to leave,

183
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,600
the car keys are on the table.

184
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,279
If you're not leaving...

185
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,240
Interesting.

186
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,039
You're not that ungrateful after all.

187
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,559
I'm not someone who owes others favors.

188
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,200
You saved my life.

189
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
And I also saved yours.

190
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:23,960
We're even now.

191
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,440
For the next few days,

192
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,840
remember to take your medicine.

193
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,519
Thank you.

194
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
It's getting late.

195
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,360
If you don't mind,

196
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,679
stay here for tonight.

197
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,399
You're awake.

198
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,600
Look at you.

199
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,159
That expression again.

200
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Relax.

201
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,279
I was afraid
you would sneak out last night.

202
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,320
For your safety,

203
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,639
I had to do that.

204
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,360
This way, you would listen to me.

205
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,240
I know you want

206
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,840
to take back control of the Gu Group.

207
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,120
But the waters of the Huo family

208
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,039
are deeper than you imagine.

209
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,080
By then, my father
won't have to lift a finger.

210
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,480
Many other people

211
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,200
will force you to spit out the shares.

212
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,039
So cooperating with me

213
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,879
is your best choice.

214
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,759
Do you understand?

215
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,759
Pleasure doing business,

216
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,759
Miss Gu.
