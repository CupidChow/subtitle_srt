Huo Siting.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,560
Why are you here?

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,400
Huo Siting.

21
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,920
Don't be reckless.

22
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,560
Huo Siting.

23
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,879
I've offended you, Mr. Meng.

24
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,959
I'm here to apologize.

25
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,560
Why don't we write off

26
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,719
all the grudges between us?

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,239
What grudges?

28
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,159
You disagree?

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,719
I agree.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,280
I agree.

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,280
Then let me peel an apple for you.

32
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,840
No.

33
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,400
Keep the skin.

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,200
It's healthier.

35
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,800
Then I'll leave you to rest.

36
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,639
Miss Gu, let's not disturb him.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,039
I'll check on you again.

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,439
An'an.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,439
Stop dragging me.

40
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,439
Can you let go now?

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,479
Look who's talking to me.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,800
Are you happy now?

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,840
You're quite something.

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,000
One has to be a scoundrel
to deal with a scoundrel.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
You are equally childish, okay?

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,960
Childish?

47
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,759
I apologized. Why am I still childish?

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,680
Am I supposed to praise you?

49
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,280
"You saw the bigger picture

50
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,759
and stopped quibbling with Meng Xiao.

51
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,199
Well done. Keep it up."

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,319
With my intelligence,

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,520
Meng Xiao is no match for me.

54
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm only looking after him

55
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,840
because of the resort project.

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
But I can't stop him from fancying me.

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,520
Can you promise

58
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,759
not to cause any trouble

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
before we settle everything?

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,120
Fine.

61
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,800
I'll try my best.

62
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,039
I have a condition, too.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,680
Spill it.

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,280
Keep me informed on

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,960
whatever you do with Meng Xiao.

66
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,639
Don't go behind my back.

67
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,479
Fine.

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,280
I'll also try my best.

69
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,599
Come in.

70
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,639
An'an.

71
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,319
I was inspecting the resort

72
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,879
and the sunflowers reminded me of you.

73
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,000
So I picked one for you.

74
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,719
Thank you.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,919
That's a bit too casual, isn't it?

76
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,719
A farmer just reported

77
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,479
that someone

78
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,600
stole from his sunflower field.

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,959
I knew it would be you.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,600
Mr. Meng.

81
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,879
You'd better pay him.

82
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,480
An'an.

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,399
Don't accept this stolen flower.

84
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,879
I bought these flowers.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,480
An'an, don't listen to him.

86
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,120
It's not about the money,

87
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,600
but the intention.

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,160
An'an, what do you think?

89
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,439
An'an.

90
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,720
An'an.

91
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,079
They're both nice.

92
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,519
I'll buy a flowerpot.

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,759
Childish.

94
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,439
Get in the car.

95
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,600
Where is Mr. Meng?

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
Who knows? Let's go by ourselves.

97
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,416
(Tire Pressure
Be aware of tire malfunctions)

98
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,439
An'an.

99
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,639
Let's go in my car.

100
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,639
Mr. Huo's car is broken.

101
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,920
Mr. Meng.

102
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,040
I need a ride, too.

103
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:28,879
An'an.

104
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,199
I built this on my own.

105
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,040
What do you think?

106
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,040
Not so good.

107
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,199
It's oppressing.

108
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,279
This place is quite nice.

109
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
It's quite leisurely and refined.

110
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,000
When I'm bored,

111
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,279
I go there to row boats.

112
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,040
It's even prettier in the mountains.

113
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,360
Let's take a look.

114
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,048
Let's go.

115
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,279
An'an.

116
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,639
I just inquired with the farmers here.

117
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,120
There is an abandoned cellar.

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,519
I think we can turn it into

119
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,519
an underground maze.

120
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,800
Why haven't I heard of it?

121
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,160
There's a lot you haven't heard of.

122
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,279
Want to check it out?

123
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,680
An'an.

124
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,759
Come with me.

125
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
The view is better there.

126
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,240
But the farmer can't wait for us.

127
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,839
How about I go with Meng Xiao first...?

128
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,319
An'an.

129
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,800
Huo Siting.

130
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,920
Don't say anything improper.

131
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,639
We're trying to sign

132
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,800
the contract tonight.

133
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,759
Got it.

134
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,079
Miss Gu.

135
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,399
You've arrived.

136
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,639
Sorry, I'm late.

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,319
My apologies.

138
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,839
Nice dishes.

139
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,040
Why did you invite me to dinner today?

140
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,279
Mr. Meng.

141
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
We've done plenty

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,120
of inspections these days.

143
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,519
I'll be the host today.

144
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,279
Let's sign the contract.

145
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,160
The contract doesn't matter.

146
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,720
Happiness is what matters.

147
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,199
Come on.

148
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,879
Let's drink first.

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,360
An'an.

150
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,240
Mr. Meng.

151
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,120
I'll drink on her behalf.

152
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,279
I'm toasting to An'an.

153
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,639
It's okay.

154
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,720
We've become friends these days.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,759
I have to

156
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,079
drink this.

157
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,679
Let me toast to you, Mr. Meng.

158
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,440
Impressive.

159
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
It seems that

160
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,240
it's two against one tonight.

161
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,080
I never got drunk.

162
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,240
People call me the Wine God of Bincheng.

163
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,559
An'an.

164
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,159
As long as I have fun tonight,

165
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,960
I'll naturally sign the contract.

166
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:26,840
Okay.

167
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,600
I'll drink with you.

168
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,679
Let's get wasted.

169
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,759
Let's get wasted.
