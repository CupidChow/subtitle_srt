=The Heir's Forbidden Love=

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,806
=Episode 25=

18
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,519
Let's talk in our room.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,560
This is your third time
near my father's study.

20
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,239
Tell me. What do you want from us?

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,200
Nothing.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,079
I just went out for a walk.

23
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,159
Just a walk?

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,560
Always to my dad's study?

25
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,079
It's too much of a coincidence.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,200
Alright.

27
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,920
I'll tell you.

28
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,520
I moved into your house

29
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,680
to get a USB drive.

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,280
USB drive?

31
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,360
It has information about our Gu Group.

32
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,240
So you've tried hard to be one of us

33
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,639
not just to get

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
control of the Gu Group,

35
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,039
but also get that USB drive.

36
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,840
But why would it be in my dad's study?

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,159
This is all I can tell you.

38
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,759
But I hope you can

39
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,639
keep it secret.

40
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,840
An'an, I am very happy

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,439
that you shared your secret with me.

42
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,639
But you know

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,800
that I want to know more.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,280
I don't want to end up like Huo Siwen.

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,080
Please believe me.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,120
I didn't marry you for ulterior moves.

47
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,599
When the time comes,

48
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,240
I will tell you everything.

49
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:08,840
Go to sleep.

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,280
Come in.

51
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,439
What's wrong, Dad?

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,759
Siting.

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,800
How's the wedding preparation
coming along?

54
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,080
Everything is ready.

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
Your mother passed away early.

56
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,639
If you manage to marry An'an,

57
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,039
I believe your mom can rest in peace.

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,159
Thank you, Dad.

59
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,719
I hope the grievances of our generation

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,680
won't affect you.

61
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,159
Yeah, I owe you and your mom too much.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,759
I hope it's not too late to make amends.

63
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,800
Right, have you mentioned
that neurologist

64
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,080
to An'an?

65
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,000
He's available at any time.

66
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,759
An'an said she had already seen him.

67
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,879
No way.

68
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,560
That doctor has been abroad

69
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,560
and hasn't ever returned.

70
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,279
All the mothers would want

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
to witness their daughters' weddings.

72
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,600
Don't you want to surprise An'an

73
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,079
at the wedding?

74
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,680
Surprise her?

75
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,920
I'm thinking.

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,759
It's not like An'an doesn't
want her mother

77
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,120
at your wedding.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,439
She simply doesn't believe
that we can cure her mom.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,959
It's understandable.

80
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,560
After all, we were competitors.

81
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,160
But now you're married.

82
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,600
We're relatives by marriage.

83
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,600
My silly child.

84
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,519
Loving a woman

85
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,879
sometimes

86
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,519
requires you to use some tricks.

87
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,360
I see.

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,279
Dad.

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,079
Alright, go back to work.

90
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,199
Siting, I put your clothes there.

91
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,120
Get changed.

92
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,560
Siting.

93
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,279
Okay.

94
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,240
Siting.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,639
How do I look? Am I pretty?

96
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,160
You look gorgeous.

97
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,360
Hurry up.

98
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,439
Get changed.

99
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,360
Let me help you.

100
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,000
So thoughtful.

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,439
You're pressing on my hair.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,600
An'an.

103
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,160
An'an, I'm sorry.

104
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,519
The secretary just

105
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
called me to the company

106
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,959
about work.

107
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,079
Go ahead and pick the wedding venue.

108
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,160
You have a taste. I trust you.

109
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,240
Alright then.

110
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,360
Go ahead.

111
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,720
I'll come when I'm done.

112
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,519
Okay.

113
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,120
Hello.

114
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,839
Is this Gu An'an?

115
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,920
Yes, it's me.

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,000
Your mom is not doing well.

117
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,680
Many of her organs have failed.

118
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,519
It's urgent.

119
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,680
Come over now.

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,040
What did you say?

121
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,800
Dr. Wang.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,399
Miss Gu, how come you're here?

123
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,839
Is my mom alright?

124
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,240
She is fine.

125
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,680
Don't worry.

126
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,160
She's doing well

127
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,519
and is likely to wake up.

128
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
One more thing.

129
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,120
Did you call me just now?

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,959
Just now?

131
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,000
No, we didn't.

132
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,439
Okay.

133
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

134
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,639
You're welcome.

135
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,480
Hello, Mr. Chen.

136
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,320
I think it's time
to get my mom transferred.

137
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,240
Please take a look.

138
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,320
It looks just fine.

139
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,879
Please check the other indicators.

140
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,360
Take a look.

141
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,480
Hello.

142
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,200
- Hello.
- Excuse me.

143
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,159
Is there a patient
called Gu Wenran here?

144
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,000
Give me a second.

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,919
Well.

146
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,879
There isn't a patient by that name.

147
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,200
What about Gu An'an?

148
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,480
Gu An'an?

149
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,600
Not here either.

150
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,480
Thank you.

151
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,639
It's nothing.

152
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,039
Those indicators were all fine.

153
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,080
Please check again.

154
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,320
It really is you.

155
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,960
An'an.

156
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,679
How come you're in my car?

157
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,080
I'm the one who should ask questions.

158
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,919
You lied about my mom

159
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,840
to follow me here.

160
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,000
I just want to help.

161
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,480
Really?

162
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,600
So you set a trap for me.

163
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,200
You're so selfish.

164
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,480
I just hope that your mom can wake up

165
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,159
to see our wedding.

166
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,000
An'an.

167
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,759
You won't let me see your mom.

168
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,879
Why is that?

169
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,159
If you love me,

170
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
stop asking about it.

171
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,919
Like I said,

172
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,279
I will tell you everything

173
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,320
once it's settled.

174
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,600
Why not now?

175
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,679
What's there to hide?

176
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,759
Don't push me.

177
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,960
For my mom,

178
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,840
I can give up everything.

179
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,320
Including me?

180
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,879
Including our relationship?

181
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes.

182
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,080
So what am I to you?

183
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,480
How much do you really love me?

184
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,639
If you had gone through
what I've been through

185
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,080
you would know

186
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,879
that falling in love with you

187
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,960
was already insane for me.
