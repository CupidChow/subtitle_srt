(Police)

19
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,359
Thank you

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,040
for being my witness.

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,200
I owe you an apology.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,319
My family owes you that much.

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,640
I had no choice but to do what I did.

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,120
I hope I didn't hurt you.

25
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:27,920
I know.

26
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,200
I don't blame you.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,760
We...

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,480
We'll both have a better future.

29
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,159
Yeah.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,200
We'll both have a better future.

31
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,200
I wish you the best

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,120
from now on.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,879
Same to you.

34
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,879
Goodbye.

35
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:56,920
Goodbye.

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,520
It's finally over.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,560
Yeah.

38
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,199
I heard that your mom woke up.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,000
She's still recovering, though.

40
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,560
That's great.

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,360
An'an.

42
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,039
Do I still have a chance?

43
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,879
Meng Xiao.

44
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,159
I've always seen you
as my elder brother.

45
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,960
There are so many good girls.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
You don't have to waste your time on me.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,479
I was kidding.

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,039
I know you well.

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,599
There's something

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
I've been hiding from you.

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,800
I think

52
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
it's time to tell you the truth.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,599
What is it?

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Actually, it was

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,000
Huo Siting who gathered the evidence.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,280
He thought you might suspect him,

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,599
so he told me

58
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,120
to hand over the evidence to you.

59
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,960
It's time to let her go.

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,879
Give her the evidence.

61
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,759
Also,

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,360
take care of her.

63
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,800
An'an.

64
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,680
You can deceive yourself for a moment,

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
but not for a lifetime.

66
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,280
Don't regret it

67
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,560
when it's too late.

68
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,840
He's flying tonight.

69
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,680
You're on your own

70
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:09,960
to make him stay.

71
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,199
Why would I make him stay?

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,199
Why do I care where he's going?

73
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,079
I'm going home.

74
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,319
She's still talking tough.

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,400
(Shizu convenient store)

76
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,519
I must secure

77
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,439
this resort project...

78
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,319
An'an, will you marry me?

79
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,160
An'an, I love you.

80
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,879
I want to protect you forever.

81
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,439
Hello, may I use your bike?

82
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,360
Nice bike.

83
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,399
Is delivering food your new job?

84
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,079
Stop smiling.

85
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,399
Why didn't you answer my call?

86
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,399
I left my phone in the car.

87
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,759
What time is the flight?

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,639
The flight?

89
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,600
Aren't you going abroad?

90
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,560
Who said that?

91
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,439
Meng Xiao.

92
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,040
So,

93
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,920
you came to ask me to stay?

94
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,319
Don't flatter yourself.

95
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,399
I just came to say goodbye.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,439
I do plan to study abroad.

97
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,519
But if you ask me to stay,

98
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I might consider it.

99
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,800
Gu An'an.

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,399
I'm now a divorced man.

101
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,120
It's not so easy
to find a girlfriend again.

102
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,920
What should I do?

103
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,120
Why should I care?

104
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,639
You are the one who wanted the divorce.

105
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,160
It was my fault.

106
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,920
But it was a critical moment.

107
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,120
I had no other choice.

108
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,360
Can...

110
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,839
Can you forgive me?

111
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,040
No.

112
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,639
Don't brush me off.

113
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,600
Think about how to apologize.

114
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,600
Got any plans?

115
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,519
Yeah.

116
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,960
Tomorrow.

117
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,080
Tomorrow?

118
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,840
You better not arrange
any candlelight dinner,

119
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,120
flowers, or rings.

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,559
No.

121
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,320
You don't like it?

122
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,279
It depends on who prepares it.

123
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,200
If it's from Meng Xiao,

124
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,399
I will surely like it.

125
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,759
But you...

126
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,720
You don't have a good image.

127
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Everything you do
seems a bit premeditated

128
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,039
and lacking sincerity.

129
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,399
Then what's the rush?

130
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,200
You'll find out tomorrow.

131
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,279
Good night.

132
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
In the end,
you decided to bring me here?

133
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,120
Why? Are you scared?

134
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,440
Why would I be scared?

135
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,639
There's no one in sight here.

136
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,559
Aren't you scared

137
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,399
that I'll push you down?

138
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,080
If I fall,

139
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,399
I'll take you down with me.

140
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,320
I can't fall yet.

141
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,519
I still have things to do.

142
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,200
You can't fall, either.

143
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,440
You have to be my witness.

144
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,919
What else do you have to do?

145
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,960
To own you.

146
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,559
To own everything about you.

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,559
An'an.

148
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's get married again.

149
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:34,519
Hello.

150
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,159
What? My mom is missing?

151
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:53,713
(To be continued)
