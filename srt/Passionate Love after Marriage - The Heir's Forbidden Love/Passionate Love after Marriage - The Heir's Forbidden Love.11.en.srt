18
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,920
Thank you so much

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,400
for taking time to attend

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,439
this banquet.

21
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,359
From now on,

22
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,480
I will do my best
to fulfill my duty as the president.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,560
I'd really appreciate

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,480
your support.

25
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:58,280
Thank you.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,200
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

27
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,079
I'd like to

28
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,959
make another announcement here.

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,280
Miss Gu An'an

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,840
and I will

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,719
hold our wedding soon.

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,599
I'd appreciate it
if you could come to our wedding.

33
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,479
Thank you.

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,199
- Nice!
- Nice!

35
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,159
Perfect match.

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,960
What a great couple.

37
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,879
Wonderful.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,360
They make a great couple.

39
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,639
That's what you want, huh?

40
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,120
Congratulations, Mr. Huo.

41
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,879
Please take care of us.

42
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,560
Of course.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,080
Yeah.

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,000
Did you enjoy the meal?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,639
Looking forward to working with you.

46
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,639
Sorry, I won't walk you out.

47
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,280
See you around.

48
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,319
Bye-bye.

49
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,360
Bye-bye.

50
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,120
Bye.

51
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,879
See you around.

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,840
Siwen.

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,159
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,800
It's big news that

55
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,800
you've been elected.

56
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,439
Why didn't you tell me?

57
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,919
Why should I tell you?

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,639
Since you're elected,

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,639
that makes me the president's wife.

60
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,680
Siwen, when are you going to marry me?

61
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,280
Linna.

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,639
I think you misunderstood something.

63
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,719
When did I ever agree to marry you?

64
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,000
Huo Siwen, what do you mean?

65
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,919
You said you would marry me!

66
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,280
Things have changed.

67
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,280
You're right.

68
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,240
I did love you once.

69
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,240
But not anymore.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
Huo Siwen.

71
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,280
Didn't you promise to marry me?

72
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,800
Go home and take a look in the mirror.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,919
You're worthless.

74
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,719
Huo Siwen.

75
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,800
I've been smoothing things over for you.

76
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,800
And you just turned your back on me?

77
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,919
Huo Siwen, you cheater!

78
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,800
I'll expose everything about you.

79
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,639
I'll show people
how you got this position.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,279
Huo Siwen!

81
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,279
(Where is the USB drive?)

82
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,759
(Weird.)

83
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,000
(Why is she in the study again?)

84
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,120
Huo Siting.

85
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,519
Why are you sneaking around here?

86
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
You cut the power, huh?

87
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,480
What are you doing

88
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,560
in the dead of night?

89
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,199
I just got back home

90
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
and saw him bent over,

91
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,399
cutting wires at the electrical box.

92
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,639
Why do we have to suffer this?

93
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,920
What have we done wrong to you?

94
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,879
Don't you even care about
your dad's reputation?

95
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,480
You're cutting wires?

96
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,439
Are you going to

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,800
burn down this house, too?

98
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,800
Siting.

99
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,839
Your auntie asked you to move out

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,120
for your own good.

101
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,000
But look what you've done.

102
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't accept this.

103
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,519
Why should they

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,240
live luxuriously in this villa

105
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,240
while I have to move out?

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
They can't tolerate me.

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,879
I won't go easy on them, either.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
Nonsense!

109
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,160
Keep talking nonsense
and I'll break your legs!

110
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:01,920
Housekeeper.

111
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,800
Mr. Huo.

112
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,120
Drive Siting back to his place.

113
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:05,959
Okay.

114
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,519
Enough.

115
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,759
Go to bed.

116
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,879
Lunatic.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Isn't that childish?

118
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,680
Send him back.

119
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,879
Sir, please.

120
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,399
Ms. Lu.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,800
You wanted to see me?

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,920
An'an.

123
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,600
After the power cut,

124
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,959
the housekeeper

125
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,399
went to look for you

126
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,680
but you weren't in your room.

127
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,959
I might have gone downstairs.

128
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,680
Take a seat.

129
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,639
An'an.

130
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,319
There is a living fossil
in the animal kingdom,

131
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,439
called chameleon.

132
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,519
I heard that

133
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,639
their history traces back
to the age of dinosaurs.

134
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,759
Do you know

135
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,319
how they managed to survive?

136
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,120
They are good at

137
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,720
camouflaging themselves

138
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,920
in times of danger.

139
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,439
That's right.

140
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,040
But no matter how much they disguise,

141
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,639
they'll reveal
their true colors one day.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,720
Ms. Lu.

143
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,279
Did I do something

144
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,480
that made you misunderstand?

145
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,559
Take it easy.

146
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,039
I wasn't talking about you.

147
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,440
Of course.

148
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,919
Any "chameleon" will be exposed

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,159
under your discerning eyes.

150
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,559
An'an.

151
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm telling you this story

152
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,480
to show you that

153
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,399
if you want to survive

154
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,279
in a large family like ours,

155
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,320
disguising and evading

156
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,799
will only put you in a passive position.

157
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,639
If you want to succeed,

158
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
you must have guts.

159
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,679
Look.

160
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,000
You're engaged to Siwen.

161
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,879
I see you as one of our own.

162
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,559
I really appreciate it.

163
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,799
I will do my best to help Siwen.

164
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,879
An'an.

165
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,360
Here's the final payment for a project.

166
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,399
Wire it to this account.

167
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,639
Okay, I see.

168
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,399
Have some tea.

169
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:59,712
(Wenzhou Bank)

170
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,960
Everyone's here?

171
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,200
Mr. Huo, Ms. Lu.

172
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,240
What's going on?

173
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,919
You're quite bold.

174
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,000
You dare come back?

175
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,279
What do you mean?
