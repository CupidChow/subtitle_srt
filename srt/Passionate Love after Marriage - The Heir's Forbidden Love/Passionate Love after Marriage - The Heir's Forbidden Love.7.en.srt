18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,719
Gu An'an.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
Why were you lurking
outside my father's study?

20
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,640
I came out for some fresh air

21
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,719
and got lost on my way back.

22
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:33,959
Really?

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

24
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,079
I can't do much if you don't believe me.

25
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,599
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,879
Even if you get into my father's study,

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,000
you won't find anything useful.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
He locks all the important files

29
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,040
in the safe.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,040
It's German-made.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,599
You can't even blast it open.

32
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,239
Why are you telling me this?

33
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,599
You want to get into our family

34
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,519
for a purpose.

35
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,319
I won't ask

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,560
if you don't tell.

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,039
But I hope you can
remember our agreement.

38
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,120
I hope you can behave

39
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,800
before finishing our task.

40
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't ruin my plan.

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,800
Are you done?

42
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,680
Here, ma'am.

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,360
Thank you, An'an.

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,080
Mrs. Meng.

45
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,159
Thank you for taking the time

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,719
to visit me.

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
An'an invited me in person.

48
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,479
How could I not come?

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,879
Mrs. Meng.

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,159
I invited you here

51
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,080
to consider

52
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,800
joining our resort project.

53
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,000
An'an.

54
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,360
As you know,

55
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,039
I've been working

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,080
with your mom on this project.

57
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,680
If she wakes up,

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
how should I explain it to her?

59
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,960
Mrs. Meng,

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,159
right now,

61
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,159
I'm on this project

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,639
on behalf of the Gu family.

63
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,039
Don't worry about it.

64
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:27,919
Alright then.

65
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,360
Looking forward to working with you.

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,159
Mrs. Meng, that's great.

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,840
We are family from now on.

68
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,319
Who said you can come in?

69
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,360
We can't meet yet.

70
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,360
We'll get in trouble.

71
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,279
Get out.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,720
Chill.

73
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,160
The Huo family
will be mine sooner or later,

74
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:36,959
including you.

75
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,879
Alright.

76
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,879
I shall wait for the day
you take full charge.

77
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,040
When that day comes,

78
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,839
I will definitely applaud you.

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,439
The Mengs and the Huos
are working together.

80
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,920
Aren't you afraid that
Lu Yuzhu will kick you out?

81
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:03,920
Yes, I am.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,959
But it's the only way

83
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,759
to win her trust.

84
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,959
Every step you take now

85
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,160
is a risky move.

86
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,279
My mom once said,

87
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,160
"Business is like a war.

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
Every move is a gamble."

89
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,959
People of your background

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,240
wouldn't get it.

91
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,519
Alright.

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,079
I'd like to see

93
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,279
how you will play the game.

94
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,879
Before Lu Yuzhu signs the agreement,

95
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,600
we must speed up.

96
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
It's just that
you might have to suffer a bit.

97
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,120
How will I suffer?

98
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,199
The enemy of an enemy is a friend.

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,600
We must be at odds with each other

100
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,360
to make her at ease.

101
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,319
She hasn't let her guard down
but you're already

102
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,120
so confident?

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,399
Indeed.

104
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,399
None of these is sufficient

105
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,879
to make her let down her guard.

106
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,639
But I'm counting on you

107
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,279
to make her trust me.

108
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,279
Counting on me?

109
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,040
Gu An'an.

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,759
Open up.

111
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,439
I just moved in.

112
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,480
Don't be reckless.

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,839
What do you want?

114
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,680
What were you doing?

115
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,279
Gu An'an.

116
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,120
What are you doing?

117
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,759
Aren't you a bit too cozy here?

118
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,600
Who allowed you to lock the door?

119
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,439
This is my room.

120
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,079
Go crazy where you're alone.

121
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,399
Your room?

122
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,279
This is my house.

123
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,399
Don't you want to marry me?

124
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,079
Stop pretending.

125
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Nice pajamas.

126
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,959
You wore them for me?

127
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,040
Have you no shame?

128
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,040
Can't you say something nice?

129
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,279
You don't have to
please my mother anymore.

130
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,480
Since you want to marry me so badly,

131
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,279
let's make it a done deal.

132
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,079
It's a win-win, right?

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,319
You wouldn't dare.

134
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,959
Why not?

135
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,439
So tender.

136
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,040
See if I dare.

137
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
Let me go.

138
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,600
Let...

139
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,560
Let go of me.

140
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,000
Let me go.

141
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:18,959
Let go of me.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,639
What are you doing?

143
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,120
I'm going to kill you.

144
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,720
You are?

145
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,559
Go ahead.

146
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,600
Go ahead.

147
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,399
Go ahead.

148
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,879
If you kill me,

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,879
what will you tell my mom?

150
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,200
What if I call her here

151
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,960
and she sees me die in front of you?

152
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,279
Fine, you win.

153
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,360
My wife is really tough.

154
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,200
He is just a coward.

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
After all, I am his fiancée.

156
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,360
Don't risk coming to see me again.

157
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,600
You're my wife.

158
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,679
I will see my wife

159
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,919
whenever I want.

160
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,480
Right.

161
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,399
You said that I had to help you

162
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,279
win Lu's trust.

163
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,399
What do you mean?

164
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I need your help

165
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
with something.
