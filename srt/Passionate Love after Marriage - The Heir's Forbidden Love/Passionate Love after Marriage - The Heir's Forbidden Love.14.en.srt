00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,040
Mr. Meng.

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,079
Hello.

20
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,680
I am Meng Xiao from the Meng Group.

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,359
I am here on behalf of the Meng Group.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,879
Hello, Mr. Meng.

23
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,040
I am Huo Siting from the Huo Group.

24
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,159
This is Gu An'an from the Gu Group.

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,000
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,000
Miss Gu.

27
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,280
I've heard so much about you.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,560
We've heard so much about you, too.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,239
I'm having a cold.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,560
Let's spare the handshake.

31
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,319
Have a seat.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,519
Please.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,840
Miss Gu works despite being sick.

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,719
That is truly admirable.

35
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,400
After all, you are

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,680
our important partner.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
We're counting on you

38
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,479
to make sure that

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,120
the resort project proceeds smoothly.

40
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,599
So, I'm so important.

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,879
Mr. Meng.

42
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,120
I'll be the host today.

43
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,719
I hope we work well

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
on this project.

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,439
You are too kind, Mr. Huo.

46
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,159
With Miss Gu here,

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,199
I believe that our resort expansion

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,439
will be a huge success.

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,599
Right?

50
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,639
Miss Gu.

51
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,479
You know each other?

52
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,199
No.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,800
Mr. Meng and I...

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,680
We don't just know each other.

55
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,280
We've been through life and death.

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,719
Mr. Meng.

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,840
Why don't we

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,120
talk about the resort?

59
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,439
Of course.

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,432
Of course.

61
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,520
Go ahead.

62
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,759
I've sent the design proposal

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,680
to your email.

64
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,639
What do you think about it?

65
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,840
I carefully assessed the proposal.

66
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,520
It attached

67
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,759
great importance

68
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,719
to the women's and children's market,

69
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,439
which was an excellent job.

70
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,400
It's clearly structured
by a female leader,

71
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,599
perhaps a beauty like Miss Gu.

72
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
Just call me An'an.

73
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,800
An'an.

74
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,280
An'an.

75
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,599
Mr. Meng, please don't mind

76
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,520
the humble dinner.

77
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,639
Not at all.

78
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,919
Miss Gu honored us with her presence.

79
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,439
How could it be humble?

80
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,360
Mr. Meng.

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,360
See you around.

82
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,479
Aren't you coming up?

83
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,000
We have things to discuss.

84
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,080
Miss Gu.

85
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,519
I'm in Room 6719.

86
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,120
Feel free to visit me whenever you want.

87
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,000
How do you know Mr. Meng?

88
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,160
We...

89
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,240
Why do you care?

90
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,560
I don't.

91
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,360
I'm just curious.

92
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,639
And you wore matching outfits?

93
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,920
Why?

94
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,720
Are you jealous?

95
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,199
I will never

96
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,759
be jealous of him.

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,959
I don't know him.

98
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,120
Mind your own business.

99
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,600
Gu An'an.

100
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,279
We are partners.

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,839
I hope you don't

102
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,279
hide anything from me.

103
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,560
This is about work

104
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,360
and mutual trust.

105
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,920
He pretended to be drowning yesterday

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,000
for me to save him.

107
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,079
So you caught a cold because of him?

108
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,120
He may sound glib

109
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,720
but he's cool to work with.

110
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:19,759
Alright.

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,319
Take your medicine.

112
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,480
Rest early.

113
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,720
Coming.

114
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:40,800
An'an.

115
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,399
It's you, Mr. Huo.

116
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,000
What's wrong?

117
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,399
Did something happen to An'an?

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,519
Miss Gu is fine.

119
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,720
I'm worried that you might be bored.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,920
I can take you out for a stroll.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
If An'an asks me to go out,

122
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,360
I might consider it.

123
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,399
You're interested in Miss Gu?

124
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,000
Of course.

125
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,199
Who wouldn't be interested

126
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,839
in a girl like An'an?

127
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,519
Mr. Huo.

128
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,120
Tell me.

129
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,279
What kind of guys does she like?

130
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,079
I've heard that you're a good swimmer.

131
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,160
How about this?

132
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
Let's have a competition.

133
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,519
If you win,

134
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,120
I'll tell you.

135
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,759
Interesting.

136
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,720
Let's compete.

137
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,959
Mr. Huo.

138
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,079
You might have

139
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,120
challenged the wrong person.

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,480
I was on the university swim team

141
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,920
and I won second place
at the national sports meeting.

142
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,600
I won't make it so unfair.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,959
You'll decide what to compete.

144
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,680
I'm just a landlubber

145
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,759
with amateurish swimming skills.

146
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,079
Since you're so confident,

147
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,000
why don't we

148
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
compete in something else?

149
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,199
Like what?

150
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,879
Let's see who can

151
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,279
hold his breath longer.

152
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,639
Okay.

153
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,519
Let's do as you say.

154
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,399
But since it's a competition,

155
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,879
there will be rewards and punishments.

156
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,519
If you win,

157
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm at your disposal.

158
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,759
If you lose,

159
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,639
you have to apologize to Miss Gu
for what happened yesterday.

160
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,560
Rest assured.

161
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,560
I won't lose.

162
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,000
Hu Siting, what are you doing?

163
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,079
Stop it.

164
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,920
Are you drowning him?

165
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,759
You must be kidding.

166
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,399
Nobody can drown

167
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,720
in such a shallow pool.

168
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,800
Mr. Meng just choked
on some water, that's all.

169
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,959
Are you alright, Mr. Meng?

170
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,199
Come on, keep going.

171
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,560
Come on. That's it.

172
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,360
I got you a towel.

173
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,440
Thank you.

174
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,039
Are you feeling any better?

175
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm fine.

176
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,639
I just choked.

177
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,639
I won second place
in the national swimming contest.

178
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,480
It was an accident.

179
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,720
Thankfully, you're fine.

180
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,200
I apologize to you on behalf of Mr. Huo.

181
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,679
It was his fault today.

182
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,399
Since you have said so,

183
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,799
I won't hold a grudge.

184
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm going back to rest.

185
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,399
What's wrong?

186
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,840
I think I caught a cold.

187
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,559
I feel a bit dizzy.

188
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,200
Have a hot bath now.

189
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,879
An'an.

190
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,159
What if I pass out while showering

191
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,159
alone in the bathroom?

192
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,159
Alright, then I'll wait for you outside.

193
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,519
Okay?

194
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,320
Really?

195
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,080
Will you go?

196
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,879
Yeah.

197
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,039
Wait for me.

198
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,440
Don't leave.
