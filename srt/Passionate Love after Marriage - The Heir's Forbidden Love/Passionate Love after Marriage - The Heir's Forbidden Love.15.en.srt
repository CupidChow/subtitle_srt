Look who's back.

Stop being sarcastic.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,120
You look like a drowned rat.

21
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,760
A drowned rat?

22
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,719
I won, okay?

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,760
Childish.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,760
Do you know who he is?

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
Our resort is finally doing better.

26
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,280
Why did you do that?

27
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,040
I did it to get back at him. So what?

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,120
He has rich parents. So what?

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,480
Are you so protective

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,799
because you're into him?

31
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,280
You're unreasonable.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,680
I apologize.

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,200
How will you forgive me?

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,519
Apologize to Meng Xiao.

35
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,640
No way.

36
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,239
How are you not siding with him?

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,200
He drowned

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,079
and you walked him

39
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,120
to his room with concern.

40
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,040
But you didn't say anything to me.

41
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,200
You deserve it.

42
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,159
Step aside.

43
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,319
(Meng Xiao)
(I've got a bad cold.)

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,872
(An'an: Chill. You'll be fine.)
(Come and take care of me.)

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,680
(Or I'll withdraw my investment.)

46
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,759
(It's up to you.)

47
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,479
Won't you ask

48
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,680
if I was alright last night?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,080
Surely you would take care of yourself.

50
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,680
So heartless.

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,400
Don't you know me?

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,120
You're going to him again?

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,039
He's ill. I'll take care of him.

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Is there a problem?

55
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:18,919
An'an.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,639
You really came.

57
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,080
You threatened to withdraw funding.

58
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,080
I had to come.

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
If I didn't say that,

60
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,000
would you come?

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,240
You're not even pretending.

62
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,719
Cold drinks?

63
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,080
I really have a fever.

64
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,000
Feel for yourself.

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,400
Stop teasing me.

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,520
What have you decided on the resort?

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,560
An'an.

68
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,919
Why do I see two of you?

69
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,400
You really have a fever?

70
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,319
It's burning.

71
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,279
I'm not lying to you.

72
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,279
I just want some cold drinks

73
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,759
to cool down.

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,959
Let me help you to bed.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,744
Let's go.

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
(He just choked on some water.)

77
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,879
(Does she have to be so concerned?)

78
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,079
(I got an idea.)

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,439
You knocked on my door?

80
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,480
What?

81
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,040
What's wrong?

82
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,120
Did you get sick?

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,439
I feel awful.

84
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,759
Why is it burning?

85
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,720
It's fine.

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm strong and healthy.

87
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,519
I'll be fine very soon.

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,600
Don't worry.

89
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,160
Both you and Mr. Meng

90
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,399
are so delicate.

91
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,680
If not for the resort project...

92
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,160
Never mind.

93
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I'll get you some medicine.

94
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,480
Mr. Meng?

95
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,000
He's got a fever too?

96
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,800
Yeah.

97
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,519
Oh no.

98
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,399
That guy played it so well this time.

99
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,360
What did you say?

100
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,319
Nothing.

101
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,000
I said that

102
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,040
all medicines contain toxins.

103
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,319
I don't want to be poisoned.

104
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,560
I don't want any medicine.

105
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,279
No way.

106
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,319
You have to.

107
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,519
I'll get it for you.

108
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,639
How dare he pretend

109
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,480
to have a fever?

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,560
Plan A didn't work. I've got Plan B.

111
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,584
It's okay.

112
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,000
You found it?

113
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,279
Thank you.

114
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm just drinking water to cool down.

115
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,279
Keep drinking.

116
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,439
Gu An'an...

117
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,079
Childish.

118
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,519
Let...

119
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
Let me explain.

120
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm doomed.

121
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,959
Checking on Meng Xiao again?

122
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,600
Why do you care?

123
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,920
He's so pretentious.

124
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
Why do you trust him so much?

125
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,800
Do you think everyone
is as shameless as you?

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,800
Gu An'an.

127
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,879
Do you have to

128
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,079
be mad at me because of him?

129
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,800
You still haven't realized

130
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
your problems?

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Apologize to him

132
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,279
or I won't talk to you.

133
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,639
Dig in.

134
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,559
What are you waiting for?

135
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,159
Feed me.

136
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,840
Don't you have hands?

137
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,480
They're sore.

138
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,679
I can't lift them.

139
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:17,879
Then don't eat.

140
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,159
I'll get hungry

141
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,159
if I don't eat.

142
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,159
If I'm hungry,

143
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,000
I get dizzy.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,919
If I get dizzy,

145
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,000
I won't be able to

146
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,919
work on the project.

147
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,600
Fine, I'll feed you.

148
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,720
Gu An'an, show some sincerity.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
I came to take care of you

150
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
as you requested.

151
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:56,879
When will you

152
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,000
decide on the investment?

153
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,200
Let me tell you the truth.

154
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,639
I know nothing about this resort.

155
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:03,960
You know nothing?

156
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,679
Stop joking.

157
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm not joking.

158
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,639
I have no business mind.

159
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,679
I invested in whatever my dad

160
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,519
told me to invest in.

161
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,519
He always said I was useless.

162
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
I just wanted to prove myself.

163
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,600
Gu An'an.

164
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,480
I believe in you.

165
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,679
Design the resort

166
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,879
however you want.

167
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
You trust me?

168
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,639
What if I lose all your money?

169
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,879
You're so smart

170
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,679
and so kind-hearted.

171
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,919
Anyway, I just trust you.

172
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,840
Huo Siting.

173
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,279
Why are you here?

174
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,080
What's with the knife?
