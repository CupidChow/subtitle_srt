Hello, Mr. Chen.

24
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
Miss Gu, Mrs. Gu is missing.

25
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,120
What did you say?

26
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,800
Huo Jinyun!

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,240
Where did you hide my mom?

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,039
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,479
Stop pretending.

30
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,479
You knew

31
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,120
why I moved into your house all along.

32
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
You've been scheming for so long

33
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
to find out where my mom is

34
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,840
through your beloved son.

35
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,120
An'an.

36
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,000
It seems you have
a huge misunderstanding about me.

37
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,520
From what you're saying,

38
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,120
Mrs. Gu is missing?

39
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,840
An'an.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,879
What happened?

41
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:10,919
I should be

42
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,400
the one asking that.

43
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,719
You really are just like your dad.

44
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Tell me. Where is my mom?

45
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,120
An'an, calm down.

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,839
There must be a misunderstanding.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,759
Misunderstanding?

48
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,079
Is it also a misunderstanding
that your dad

49
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,240
pushed my mom off the cliff?

50
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,160
What did you say?

51
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,040
My mom

52
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,079
was going to expose
all your dad's misdeeds,

53
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,319
so he lured her to the cliff

54
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,720
and pushed her down.

55
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,920
He tried to destroy the evidence,

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,199
but I found my mom
below the cliff before he did.

57
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,759
Dad.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,439
Is that true?

59
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,519
How is that possible?

60
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,160
I'm the Chairman
of the distinguished Huo Group.

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
How could I try to commit murder?

62
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,399
An'an.

63
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,079
Slander is a crime.

64
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,480
Crime?

65
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,720
How many crimes

66
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,600
have you committed all these years?

67
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,879
Tell me where my mom is.

68
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,319
And I can write off
what happened in the past.

69
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,759
Otherwise,

70
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,000
I will make sure to send you to prison.

71
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,319
Fine.

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,360
I will sit and wait here.

73
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,519
Right.

74
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,439
Your mom is missing.

75
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,399
You'd better hurry up and look for her.

76
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,160
If anything happens...

77
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,199
If you dare to lay a finger on my mom,

78
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,560
I will tear you to pieces.

79
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,160
Dad.

80
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,319
Was it really you?

81
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,600
Do you believe I could do such a thing?

82
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,279
Siting.

83
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,199
It seems this girl

84
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,399
harbors too much hostility towards us.

85
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,319
For you

86
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,839
and our family,

87
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,560
I don't think you should continue

88
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,360
this marriage.

89
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,639
Dad, I get it now.

90
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,839
Don't worry.

91
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,240
I know how to handle it.

92
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,279
Alright.

93
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,399
I moved into your house

94
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,439
to get a USB drive.

95
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
Hello, Mr. Chen.

96
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,839
Any news about my mom?

97
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,120
Okay, keep me updated.

98
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,759
Why are you here?

99
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,560
You're not welcome.

100
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,240
Tell me where my mom is

101
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,000
or I won't let you off.

102
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,439
My dad said

103
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,079
that he had nothing to do with it.

104
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,759
Do you still believe his lies?

105
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,680
Huo Siting, you are really beyond help.

106
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,959
Yes, I am beyond help.

107
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,160
I thought you had
fallen in love with me.

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,560
But in the end,

109
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,800
you're just using me.

110
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,879
My dad tries to use me.

111
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
So do you.

112
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,679
You both treat me like a tool.

113
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,440
But have you ever

114
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,960
cared about my feelings?

115
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,799
When have I ever used you?

116
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,159
Then what were you
looking for in our house?

117
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,799
I guess

118
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,919
that the USB drive

119
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,559
contains evidence against my dad.

120
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,360
That's right.

121
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,240
I tried my best to get into your house

122
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,320
just to find that USB drive

123
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,600
and send your dad to prison.

124
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,440
You're finally telling me the truth.

125
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,639
But Huo Siting.

126
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,759
I've never

127
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,039
thought of using you.

128
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,039
Let's get a divorce.

129
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,159
You hate me so much.

130
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,879
The only thing I can do

131
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,159
is to divorce you.

132
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,279
Okay.

133
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,000
After all, our marriage

134
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,799
was wrong from the very beginning.

135
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,440
Starting from tomorrow,

136
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,600
we will

137
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,279
no longer be married.

138
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,759
Thank you for being so cooperative.

139
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,039
And thank you for showing me

140
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,000
who you really are.

141
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,480
You must have

142
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,519
found me unworthy from the very start.

143
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,679
Can I ask you one last favor?

144
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,480
Go ahead.

145
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:18,919
Please.

146
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,080
Do not hurt my mom.

147
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,919
Tomorrow morning,

148
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,600
let's do the paperwork.

149
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,600
If only you had believed me

150
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,799
from the start.

151
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,399
Gu An'an.

152
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,480
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,879
Who is it?

154
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,000
Dad.

155
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,600
Siting.

156
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,000
It's so early.

157
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,120
What's wrong?

158
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,200
What...

159
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,799
Dad, I caught Gu An'an.

160
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,240
What did you do?

161
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,240
I didn't want her to ruin your plan.

162
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,600
So I caught her.

163
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,919
You kidnapped her
and brought her back home.

164
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,120
W-What do we do about her?

165
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,120
Dad, rest assured.

166
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,200
I'll handle this.

167
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,639
You won't be implicated.

168
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,080
Since you've made up your mind,

169
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,159
then go for it.

170
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,039
Remember, make it neat.

171
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I know that you're doing

172
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,240
all this for me.

173
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,600
Dad, rest assured.

174
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,519
I'm doing this voluntarily.

175
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,159
Compared with our Huo Group,

176
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,679
Gu An'an

177
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,679
is nothing but a woman I liked.

178
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,360
No risk, no story.

179
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,080
But I have someone

180
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
in the same condition.

181
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,960
I got this.

182
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,399
That's my boy.

183
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,039
(So it was you.)
