=The Heir's Forbidden Love=

17

=Episode 4=

18
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,560
The condition

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,760
is that we get married immediately.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,760
Get married?

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,079
Are you sure?

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,359
What?

23
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:19,879
Are you scared?

24
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,439
What do I have to be scared of?

25
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,519
It's not like I'm at a loss.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,519
Don't rush to agree just yet.

27
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,519
We need to sign a prenup.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,400
The content of the prenup

29
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,879
is that once we divorce,

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,200
our assets will be divided equally
between the two of us.

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,519
I can't trust a single one

32
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,079
of the Huo family.

33
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,840
The Huo family's assets

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,200
are much more
than those of the Gu family.

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,599
So, Mr. Huo, how much
do you currently hold

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,599
in your hands?

37
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,799
I think your purpose
of marrying into our family

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,079
is more than that.

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,280
But I will agree

40
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,719
to this condition.

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,239
Then I hope you won't hold me back
in the future.

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,240
Babe, how much for one night?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,159
What do you take me for?

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,879
Get lost!

45
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,360
What are you pretending for?

46
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,039
What's so great about you?

47
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,360
If you don't want to die, get lost!

48
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,000
I said, I'm not for sale.

49
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,520
Siwen, why are you dressed like this?

50
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,360
Stop that.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Haven't you learned the lesson?

52
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,879
What if those people take photos

53
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,800
of us again?

54
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,560
If my dad finds out
that we're still in touch,

55
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,960
he will have my legs broken.

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,879
It must be that wretch Gu An'an
who's playing tricks.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
Siwen, you won't mind my past, right?

58
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,840
Sit.

59
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,439
What are you doing?

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,120
Have you forgotten what I said?

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,439
I thought about it before.

62
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,280
I can't always
let you be the secret lover.

63
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,960
I have to give you a status regardless.

64
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,120
If

65
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,120
you can be helpful to me in my career,

66
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,159
that would be great.

67
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,439
That way, my dad will definitely agree
to our marriage.

68
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,680
Rest assured.

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,280
I'll do whatever you say.

70
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,759
Really?

71
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
That's my good girl.

72
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,080
Let's eat.

73
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,039
Let's eat.

74
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,840
It seems that Huo Siwen
holds the power in the Huo family,

75
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,479
but all this is thanks

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,759
to his mother, Lu Yuzhu.

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,719
Whether Huo Siwen can be overthrown

78
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,919
depends on

79
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,319
whether you can overthrow her.

80
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,159
You can follow my hints

81
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,319
to ingratiate yourself with Lu Yuzhu.

82
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,120
That way, you can quickly return
to the Huo family.

83
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,240
Are your hints reliable?

84
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,439
You will know once you give it a try.

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,080
Lu Yuzhu will go to the tailor shop
to buy clothes tomorrow.

86
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,879
This dress

87
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,199
is the only one in the entire Bincheng.

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,599
Give it to Lu Yuzhu.

89
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,519
The only one in the entire Bincheng?

90
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,800
Then how did you get it?

91
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,199
You want to know?

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,680
What are you doing?

93
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,319
You asked me how I got this dress.

94
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,560
This is how I got the dress.

95
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,079
As expected, you are not a good person.

96
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,240
I will take this one.

97
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:25,920
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,519
This dress is the only one
in all of Bincheng.

99
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,600
It's already been reserved.

100
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,920
It's been reserved?

101
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,360
Ms. Lu.

102
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
Miss Gu, your dress is ready.

103
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,439
Thank you.

104
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,279
This is the dress you ordered?

105
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,560
But I ordered it

106
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,279
for you.

107
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,600
For me?

108
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,000
Just the dress isn't enough.

109
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,800
We must press our advantage.

110
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,639
And this too.

111
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,680
I think this pearl necklace

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,000
is the perfect match

113
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,959
for your red dress.

114
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,000
Gu An'an,

115
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,800
you've given me the dress

116
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,959
and the jewelry.

117
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,240
What exactly are you up to?

118
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,839
Ms. Lu, don't overthink this.

119
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,680
I heard that it's about your birthday.

120
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,360
These are just a small token
of affection from me.

121
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,680
I hope you will accept them.

122
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,560
Alright then.

123
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,000
Then I will take them.

124
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,279
Thank you.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,920
What are you doing?

126
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,720
I'm preparing the shower water for you.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,759
For me?

128
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,079
Aren't you taking a shower?

129
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,800
I certainly won't take a shower here.

130
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,600
Tomorrow Lu Yuzhu has an appointment
with Mrs. Meng at the café.

131
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,279
Do you want to go there smelling?

132
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,079
Alright then.

133
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,480
Go back to your room.

134
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,399
And close the door.

135
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,720
Mrs. Huo,

136
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
you asked to meet me in the café

137
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,279
not just for a casual chat, right?

138
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,800
If there's something, just say it.

139
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,879
Mrs. Meng...

140
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,120
Mom.

141
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,199
Is this Mr. Meng?

142
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,439
This is my son.

143
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,519
He's always late

144
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,160
and goofing around.

145
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,399
I brought him out today
for some experience.

146
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,680
Mr. Meng is a talented young man.

147
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,600
He has great potential in him.

148
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,519
No need to flatter him.

149
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,240
Where were we just now?

150
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,959
Actually, I asked you out today

151
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,319
to talk to you

152
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,160
about our resort project.

153
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,560
Our family has full sincerity

154
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,040
to collaborate with you.

155
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,759
As you know, we've been cooperating

156
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,160
with Gu Group on this project.

157
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,839
But now

158
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,920
Mrs. Gu has fallen into a coma.

159
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,399
If we interrupt our collaboration

160
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,279
with the Gu family at such time,

161
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,279
wouldn't people say

162
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,559
we are fair-weather friends?

163
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,559
Mrs. Meng.

164
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,960
- An'an?
- Mrs. Meng.

165
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,039
What brings you here?

166
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,759
An'an, I was planning
to visit you in a few days.

167
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,519
I didn't expect to run into you here.

168
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,279
Ms. Lu?

169
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,639
What a coincidence!

170
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,159
You are...

171
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,679
I asked Mrs. Meng out
to talk about something.

172
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,799
Mrs. Meng, I heard
that you like jade necklaces.

173
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,320
I just bought one these days.

174
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,639
I'll send it to you in a few days.

175
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,919
I can't accept it.

176
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
Please don't be polite with me.

177
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,240
We don't need to be too formal.

178
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,480
Just treat me like your own daughter.

179
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,480
Okay.
