Those people were ruthless.

19
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,200
It's okay. I'm not dying yet.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,439
Knock on wood. Don't talk nonsense.

21
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,799
Are you afraid that you'd be a widow

22
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,480
if I die?

23
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,760

all my money

25
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,760

Who said I'd marry you?

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,040
Sooner or later, you'll be mine.

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,719
Speaking of which,

30
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,200
if it weren't for me
standing in front today,

31
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,560
you might have

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,680
taken this punch.

33
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,760
What do you say?

34
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,400
Am I manly enough?

35
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:05,280
Will you consider
entrusting yourself to me?

36
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,280
Meng Xiao.

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,240
I have no feelings for you beyond work.

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,840
I agreed to be your girlfriend for a day

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,759
just to get a share of the resort.

40
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,520
I don't have

41
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,599
the energy to start a relationship.

42
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,199
An'an.

43
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,879
What you said

44
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,599
hurt me more than that punch.

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,199
Meng Xiao.

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,159
You deserve a better girl.

47
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,919
To me,

48
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,719
you are the best girl.

49
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,639
You don't want a relationship now.

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
I'll wait for you

51
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,919
until you change your mind.

52
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,680
I swear I will

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,919
win you over.

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,039
Rest early.

55
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,400
I'll go back first.

56
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,439
Come on, stay a bit.

57
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,520
You feel for him?

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,639
Good people don't get good returns.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,400
He asked for it.

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,759
What are you doing here?

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
I settled it with

62
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,719
the villagers.

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,520
Thank you.

64
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,599
I told you.

65
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,919
That guy will only hold us back.

66
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,080
He never thinks

67
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,360
before acting.

68
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,919
He asked for it.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,599
Meng Xiao is injured

70
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,159
and you're mocking him.

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,280
Am I wrong?

72
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,879
He can't even handle a trivial matter.

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,719
You have no sympathy.

74
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,240
Don't you

75
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,800
have something to say?

76
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,360
No.

77
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,879
Anything else?

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,879
I'm going to rest now.

79
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,759
I'm a bit tired.

80
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,280
Why are you avoiding me?

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,599
I'm not.

82
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,919
Because I kissed you?

83
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,919
What are you talking about?

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,719
You've changed ever since

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,199
I kissed you.

86
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,479
You're the one who's changed.

87
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,720
I told you we were just

88
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,439
business partners.

89
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,360
Nothing else.

90
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,439
You used to bare your claws.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,560
What's wrong?

92
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,279
You got scared by one kiss?

93
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm not scared.

94
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,279
Do I have to kiss back to prove I'm not?

95
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:30,759
Fine.

96
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,959
I'm ready.

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,920
Lunatic.

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,240
Alright.

99
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,000
Since you say I have no sympathy,

100
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,399
I'll check on Meng Xiao.

101
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,759
What do you want from him?

102
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,040
If you're worried,

103
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,879
come with me.

104
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,399
What are you doing?

105
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,079
I'm checking on you, Mr. Meng.

106
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,040
Are you feeling better?

107
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,680
Rest assured.

108
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,319
I can make it back to sign the contract.

109
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
Good to know.

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,519
I thought you forgot

111
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,000
your promise to An'an.

112
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,920
I am a man of my word,

113
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,879
unlike someone.

114
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,160
Huo Siting.

115
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,079
Did you come here just to fight?

116
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,040
Of course.

117
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,000
What can we talk about
with his intelligence?

118
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,680
Hurry up and leave.

119
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,879
You're staying?

120
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,439
What does it

121
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,600
h-have to do with you?

122
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,399
Mr. Huo, please leave.

123
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,079
We have nothing to talk about.

124
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,560
But An'an and I

125
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,079
talk about everything.

126
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,360
Right?

127
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,199
Since you don't like me,

128
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,920
why are you staying?

129
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,000
Am I not welcome?

130
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,000
Of course, you are.

131
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,040
It's just that

132
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,959
everyone knows

133
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,959
that you're avoiding Mr. Huo.

134
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,240
I'm not avoiding him.

135
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,600
I...

136
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
I just don't want to fight with him.

137
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,240
Fine.

138
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,079
As long as you believe what you say.

139
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,199
Mr. Meng.

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,519
From now on,

141
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,920
we are family.

142
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,120
I hope that

143
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,319
we can be a real family.

144
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,839
An'an.

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,879
I will fulfill

146
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,839
my promise to you.

147
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,079
Today,

148
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,560
I've decided

149
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,519
to transfer all my shares
in the resort project

150
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,800
to Miss Gu An'an.

151
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,160
- That's a lot of money.
- What happened?

152
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,360
Mr. Meng, this is no trivial matter.

153
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,600
So much money.

154
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,240
An'an.

155
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:31,959
I told you

156
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,160
I'm serious about us.

157
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,439
Wait.

158
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,360
You misunderstood something.

159
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,120
Miss Gu An'an

160
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,040
is my wife.

161
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,079
They're married?

162
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,480
What's going on?

163
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,680
Miss Gu, what is going on?

164
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,360
Mr. Meng.

165
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,839
Are we being played

166
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,879
by the Huo Group?

167
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,920
Huo Siting.

168
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,199
Gu An'an.

169
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,920
I want to hear you say.

170
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,399
Are you married?

171
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,759
The condition

172
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,920
is that we get married immediately.

173
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,959
Get married?

174
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,639
Yes.

175
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,360
What a grand play you have put on.

176
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,840
No one has ever

177
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,159
played me like this before.

178
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,519
To think that
I opened up my heart to you...

179
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,399
I was a fool.

180
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,200
I can explain.

181
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,440
W-What's going on?

182
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
W-What should we do?

183
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,200
What a mess.
