18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,879
Everyone's here?

19
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,239
Mr. Huo, Ms. Lu.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,519
What's going on?

21
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,599
You're quite bold.

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,760
You dare come back?

23
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,280
What do you mean?

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
What do I mean?

25
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,439
Gu An'an.

26
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,640
You wired our money out
without permission.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,599
Impressive.

28
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,719
What did you say?

29
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,599
When did I

30
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,680
do something like that?

31
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,239
Why did the money disappear
from the card I gave you?

32
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,319
But Ms. Lu,

33
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,840
you gave me the account

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,959
to make the transfer.

35
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,959
That's right.

36
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,280
But I didn't ask you to

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,239
transfer it to our competitor's account.

38
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,200
But I had no idea
who I was wiring money to.

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,719
So many excuses.

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Honey.

41
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,680
Gu An'an

42
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,159
has wired our money

43
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,840
to Mr. Wang's account.

44
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,680
Mr. Huo.

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,840
I did take the card from Ms. Lu.

46
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,760
And I did go to the bank.

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,199
But I didn't make that transfer.

48
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,680
If you don't believe me,

49
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,319
check the bank's surveillance.

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
Still so stubborn.

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,800
Fine.

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,919
Look.

53
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:22,960
(Transfer Records)

54
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,879
Your transfer records.

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,039
You see?

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,759
Here's the time.

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,199
So tell me.

58
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,400
Was the card

59
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,680
in your possession at that time?

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,199
Dad, look.

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,800
Mr. Huo, I'd like to emphasize again

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
that I don't know

63
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,879
the person you're talking about.

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,800
If you don't believe me,

65
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,360
check all my records.

66
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,479
Here's a kindly reminder.

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,840
Maybe you should stay alert

68
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,840
about your "honey".

69
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,479
Me?

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,560
How dare you frame me?

71
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,159
Honey.

72
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,280
We can't

73
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,840
keep her in our house.

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
I swear

75
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,080
I haven't used

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,199
a single cent of yours.

77
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,048
Come on.

78
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,840
We have evidence.

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,719
- You...
- Enough.

80
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,919
Say no more.

81
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,400
An'an.

82
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,759
No matter what,

83
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,960
we did suffer

84
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,919
tangible losses.

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,479
I think

86
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,039
you should move out for now.

87
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,319
That's not fair.

88
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,520
Dad.

89
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,520
Huo Siwen is the one
who embezzled the money.

90
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,000
Nonsense!

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,879
Come on.

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,960
Huo Siting.

93
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,080
You're never home.

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,159
Don't start framing me once you're home.

95
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,159
"Framing" you?

96
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,759
Why don't you tell us how you became

97
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,800
the president?

98
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,800
Do the shareholders

99
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,599
really think that you are talented?

100
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,319
What's your problem?

101
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,159
Dad.

102
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,319
Huo Siting.

103
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,840
Everything should be
based on solid evidence.

104
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,479
Or I could sue you, you know?

105
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,360
Sue me?

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,240
You're not going to confess, are you?

107
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,560
Dad.

108
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,560
I have the letters from

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,840
those chairmen who took bribes.

110
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,080
These will show you

111
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,000
where the money went.

112
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,959
Mr. Huo.

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,279
Long time no see, Mr. Wang.

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,680
You're...?

115
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,480
Waiting for you.

116
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
Waiting for me?

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,720
Mr. Wang, who wired you

118
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,439
that money in your card?

119
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,000
What do you mean? I don't get it.

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,040
You don't?

121
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,480
Then I won't go easy on you.

122
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,560
You know how I like to do things.

123
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,240
Honey.

124
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,759
Siwen was eager to prove himself to you

125
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,920
and made a mistake.

126
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,720
Please forgive him.

127
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,879
(Letter of Apology)
Shut up.

128
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,240
You spoiled him.

129
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,759
Look what he has become now.

130
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,319
Does it really

131
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,920
have nothing to do with you, Ms. Lu?

132
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,199
My mom doesn't know anything.

133
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,856
Dad.

134
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,680
I did this all by myself.

135
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,279
Huo Siting.

136
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,160
Spill it.

137
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,399
What do you want?

138
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,360
What do I want?

139
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,720
The police

140
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
will decide what to do with you.

141
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,199
Honey.

142
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,439
A child can change
after making a mistake.

143
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,720
But after all, he is our son.

144
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,759
You can't let the police take him.

145
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,199
Do you take the law as a joke?

146
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,399
Even if Dad forgives him,

147
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,839
the criminal law won't.

148
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,560
Huo Siting.

149
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,160
You are ruthless.

150
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,079
I am far from

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,480
matching you, Ms. Lu.

152
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,439
Mr. Huo.

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,399
The truth has come to light.

154
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,800
I think I can take part
in this resort project

155
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,399
as a stakeholder now,

156
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,639
right?

157
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,600
It seems

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,800
that there won't be

159
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,600
a wedding for you.

160
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
Okay, I permit it.

161
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,199
Siting.

162
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,120
You will take over this project.

163
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,480
Thank you, Dad.

164
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,639
Thank you.

165
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,680
And congratulations

166
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,519
on becoming the successor.

167
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,439
This is the way the world is.

168
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,319
My dad favors me today.

169
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,160
Everyone sees me

170
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
as the future master.

171
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,800
But if Lu Yuzhu and Huo Siwen

172
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,079
hadn't lost power,

173
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,439
everyone would think that

174
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,439
I was inferior to them.

175
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,000
Of course,

176
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,839
I know how it feels.

177
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,800
When my mother was around,

178
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,600
everyone treated me

179
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,800
as a princess.

180
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,000
Ever since she fell into a coma,

181
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,480
everyone avoided me

182
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,399
as if I were a plague.

183
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:28,959
Rest assured.

184
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,360
No one in the Huo family

185
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,680
will dare to look down upon you.

186
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,319
Actually, I don't care

187
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
about what others think.

188
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,560
What about me?

189
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
Do you care about

190
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,120
what I think?

191
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,160
We're going to the resort tomorrow,

192
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,639
but I haven't packed.

193
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,199

Of course.

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,879
we'd be sharing a ride so peacefully.

199

You're a talented music student.

204
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,120
Yeah.

205
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,360
I've always loved the piano.

207
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,679
My mom didn't want me

208
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,919
to go to the music academy.

209
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,960
We had a huge fight about it.

210
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,759
She taught me music

211
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,360
to cultivate my temperament.

212
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,799

whether I should have studied

finance and business.

217
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,080
Then I wouldn't be completely clueless

218
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,080
and had to learn from scratch

219
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,919
after she fell off the cliff.

220
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,080
Luckily, you studied music.
