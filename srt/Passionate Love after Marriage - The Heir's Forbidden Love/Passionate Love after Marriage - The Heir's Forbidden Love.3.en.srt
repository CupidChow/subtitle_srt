18
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:12,920
Pleasure doing business,

19
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,079
Miss Gu.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,200
You tied me up first.

21
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,079
It is not be too much
that I knocked you out, right?

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
(Maike Center)

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,920
Mr. Huo,

24
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,959
sorry, I am late.

25
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,239
How come you are here?

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,959
Miss Gu,

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,680
although you were engaged
to our family first,

28
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,439
I think,

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,840
as parents,

30
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,680
we should give the young people
some freedom.

31
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:15,719
That's right.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,599
Since Siwen and Miss Ye
are truly in love,

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
I think we should support them.

34
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,280
Mr. Huo,

35
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,719
what do you mean by this?

36
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,479
Mr. Huo means

37
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,240
he agrees to my marriage with Siwen.

38
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,560
Can't you get that?

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,319
As the grand Huo Group's head,

40
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,439
you go back on your word
and break the agreement.

41
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,479
I'm afraid this will cause

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,319
a huge public opinion impact.

43
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,199
An'an,

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
Linna is your sister after all.

45
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,319
And what the public
is concerned about now

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,000
is our marriage alliance
with the Huo family.

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,840
As for who is getting married,

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,039
it's not that important.

49
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,840
For the aspect of public opinion,

50
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,280
there are naturally professionals
handling it.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,000
You can do whatever you want
with that video.

52
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,680
After all, Siwen and I
are in love out of free will.

53
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,439
If you spread it recklessly
and get sued later on,

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
it will be on you.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,479
Hello, I'd like to have a room.

56
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,639
Miss, we only
have standard rooms available.

57
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,280
I'll take one.

58
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,919
Miss, this card cannot be used.

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
It shows it's been frozen.

60
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,400
Frozen?

61
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,319
Hello, Mr. Chen.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,439
Have you found out anything
about my mom's incident?

63
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,080
I found out that before the incident,

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,159
Mrs. Gu put some information
on a USB drive.

65
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,639
That information is very likely

66
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,639
the incriminating evidence
against Huo Group.

67
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,199
I suspect this USB drive

68
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,919
is very likely in Mr. Huo's hands.

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,919
A USB drive?

70
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,800
Okay, I see.

71
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,000
Miss Gu,

72
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,279
I heard your assets

73
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,040
have been frozen by the Gu Group.

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,959
If you need money,

75
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,199
I have some here.

76
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,480
No need, Mr. Chen.

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,800
You've already been supporting
my mother's medical expenses.

78
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,160
I can handle my own part.

79
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,439
Thank you.

80
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,720
Okay.

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,160
A USB drive?

82
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,439
(I suspect this USB drive)

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
(is very likely in Mr. Huo's hands.)

84
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:00,384
(Chairman)

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,040
Hey,

86
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,160
why hasn't the general manager's office
been cleaned?

87
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,319
I'm asking you.

88
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,160
Miss Ye,

89
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,279
what are you doing here?

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,759
The meeting is about to start.

91
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,839
Mr. Huo is already waiting
for you in the meeting room.

92
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,040
Isn't the meeting
in the chairman's office?

93
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,800
Meetings are never held
in the chairman's office.

94
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,000
They're held in the meeting room.

95
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,920
I'll take you there.

96
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,639
What are you doing here?

97
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,199
Miss Gu, why are you dressed like this

98
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,360
in the Huo Group?

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,399
It's none of your business.

100
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,040
Why did you go to my dad's office?

101
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,959
Do you know that with all the cameras

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,040
in the Huo Group,

103
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,399
you'd be very likely to be caught?

104
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,800
I should be the one asking you.

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,519
Why is it always you?

106
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,839
Is there a problem
with me coming to my own company?

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,519
Would the Huo family
let you attend the meeting?

108
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,399
Like I said,

109
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,279
I can help you.

110
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,439
You don't need to take risks alone.

111
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,759
And like I said,

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,199
I don't need your help.

113
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,399
You really are persistent.

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,879
I wonder if you need the gift

115
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,560
on the trending from me.

116
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,496
(Ye Tingfeng's Illegitimate Daughter
Was Once a Bar Girl)

117
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,240
Is this also your token of sincerity?

118
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,360
What do you think?

119
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,879
Miss Gu, are you satisfied with this?

120
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,600
You exposed such a scandal
about Ye Linna.

121
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,600
Gu Group stock price is bound to fall.

122
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
Gu Group is the work
of my mother's half a lifetime.

123
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,839
You're really ruthless.

124
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,320
The stock price drop is only temporary.

125
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,200
What's important
is that, given my dad's temperament,

126
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,559
he will draw clear boundaries
with Ye Tingfeng and his daughter.

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Without the support of the Huo family,

128
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,320
how many people

129
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,879
will still support Ye Tingfeng?

130
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,120
Miss Gu, where are you staying now?

131
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
You seem to be in a bit of a plight.

132
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
A convenience store.

133
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,960
Are you interested?

134
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,639
Compared to a convenience store,

135
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,679
I can provide you
with a safer place to stay.

136
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you for your kindness.

137
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,279
But I'd prefer you

138
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,200
to stop following me.

139
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
Right now, your plan
to get your first pot of gold

140
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,000
through the Huo family's resort project

141
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,039
has already fallen through.

142
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,080
Other than working with me,

143
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,639
you have no other options.

144
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,720
I can work with you.

145
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
But I have one condition.

146
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,720
What condition?

147
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,759
The condition

148
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,080
is that we get married immediately.

149
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,039
Get married?
