Let's see what you've got.

20
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,560
Sure.

21
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,959
An'an, are you feeling better?

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,480
Go on.

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,760
Okay.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,680
So.

25
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,079
You have only one choice.

26
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,000
Leave immediately before I get

27
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,680
really upset.

28
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,080
In your dreams.

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,439
Siwen.

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Let's not risk killing him.

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,639
An'an.

32
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,599
Let's call it a day.

33
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,719
Huo Siting.

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,199
If you dare to touch An'an again,

35
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,360
we won't let you off so easily.

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,960
The Huo family
will be mine sooner or later,

37
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,599
including this woman.

38
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,439
- You...
- Huo Siwen.

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,319
What's wrong?

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,159
You feel for him?

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,680
Ms. Lu.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,240
Siwen and I
are getting married for sure.

43
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,680
Rest assured.

44
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,759
Don't bother with him.

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,319
Let's go to rest.

46
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:50,960
(Water and medicine are at the door.)

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,319
(Water and medicine are at the door.)

48
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,600
How can Siting be so stubborn?

49
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,959
It wasn't a big deal last night.

50
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,879
We've called him so many times.

51
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,519
But he just wouldn't come for breakfast.

52
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,360
Dad, I confess.

53
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
I was a bit too harsh
with my brother yesterday.

54
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
But then again,

55
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,160
wouldn't anyone

56
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,959
get angry with what he said?

57
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,920
You're not mad, right?

58
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,199
Hit me if you want.

59
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,279
You boys are trying hard to enrage me?

60
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,959
Enough, my son.

61
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,959
Don't be immature like Siting.

62
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,160
Stop messing around.

63
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,319
Come on, get up and eat.

64
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,920
I won't until Dad forgives me.

65
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:23,839
You...

66
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,319
Honey.

67
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,319
Alright, get up.

68
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,240
Thanks, Dad.

69
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,240
Seriously,

70
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,519
we've been through

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
quite a lot these couple of days.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,439
It's partly my fault

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,839
as a mother.

74
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,000
Siting didn't

75
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,399
grow up in our Huo family.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,439
We have so many family rules.

77
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,120
It must have been hard on him.

78
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,920
I've thought about it.

79
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,959
How about this?

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,560
Why don't we let Siting move out?

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,199
Let's do as you say.

82
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,000
Dad, after all that has happened,

83
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,079
I have deeply reflected on myself.

84
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,199
I think that, as your eldest son,

85
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,600
I must prioritize my career.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let me brief you.

87
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,480
I am the newly appointed president
of our Bincheng Chamber of Commerce.

88
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,040
I think it will be greatly beneficial

89
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,079
to our resort project.

90
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,199
That's my mom's position.

91
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,879
How did you take it?

92
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,360
Mrs. Gu has held this position

93
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,839
for about a decade, right?

94
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,279
But where is she now?

95
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,839
She's gone.

96
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,759
So.

97
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,399
I won the title.

98
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,600
Dad, here's what I think.

99
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
I'd like to host a banquet

100
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,199
for the chamber members tomorrow.

101
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,120
First, we can share resources.

102
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,879
Second, it can boost communication
so that the members

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,040
can learn from each other.

104
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,959
What do you think?

105
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,639
Our Siwen has made so much progress.

106
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,199
Alright.

107
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,560
You can

108
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,879
take care of it.

109
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,600
Thank you, Dad.

110
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,160
Dig in.

111
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,040

112
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,639

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,240
to the room of a lower class?

115
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,720
At this point,

116
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
are we afraid of being exposed?

117
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,360
At worst,

118
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,199
you'll take another beating.

119
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,560
Then you might never see me again.

120
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,439
