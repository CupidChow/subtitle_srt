What do you like the most?

3
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,625
I like everything.

4
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:31,791
They say a house reflects the owner.

5
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,208
And what kind of my house is?

6
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,000
Cute, I guess.

7
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,208
I’m not going back. I’m sleeping here.

8
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,625
No matter what, you’re not sleeping with me.

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,333
My house has a guest room, kid.

10
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,375
How did you get here, P' Win?

11
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,166
My name is Win. I’m Ja’s boyfriend.

12
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:05,166
Jack, go back first. I have something personal to discuss with him.

13
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,041
I have something I want to talk to you.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,708
And I can’t wait any longer.

15
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,625
There hasn’t been a single day, Ja,

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,291
that I truly felt happy.

17
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,166
Because I’ve been missing you all along.

18
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,583
I was the coward back then.

19
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,708
Can I ask for another chance?

20
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,541
Kwang: Let’s have dinner together tonight. I need to talk to you.

21
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:11,416
Here you go.
Enjoy the meal guys! This is my new dish.

22
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,583
Please enjoy. Thank you.

23
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,000
What would you like?

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,791
Uh…

25
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:24,041
Pook said it’s time for you to move out of the Likay troupe.

26
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,208
The buzz is enough.

27
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,625
The dancing too.

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,125
You can move back to your condo now.

29
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,000
So you’ll be ready for work.

30
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,041
The new series is about to launch.

31
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,916
You need to prepare for PR.

32
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,125
Okay.

33
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,208
Why do you look so down?

34
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,125
Is something wrong?

35
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,708
Even if I told you,

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,291
you wouldn’t understand.

37
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,375
Because you’re in love.

38
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,000
What did you hear?

39
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,291
Delete it from your cerebrum.

40
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,791
It’s nothing. It’s nonsense.

41
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,875
Did you get heartbroken?

42
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,750
Forget it.

43
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:28,416
Uh..Why did you bring me here?
Have you been here before?

44
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,291
I-I saw good reviews. It looked popular.

45
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,541
Hey, babe.

46
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,375
Hey, boss.

47
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:45,916
Please, have a seat.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,708
You eat here too, Boss?

49
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:56,416
Mae Pia just opened a new branch. I came to check it out for her.

50
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,541
Mae Pia?

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,708
Fern’s mom?

52
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,375
Yes.

53
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:10,333
So, I think we met sooner than I expected.

54
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,375
Babe.

55
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,375
Do you miss me?

56
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,916
Is that why you’re eating here?

57
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,541
Babe my ass.

58
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:34,416
Wait… P'Kwang and Boss?
I’m seeing things I’ve never seen between you two.

59
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,166
Take your time thinking, babe.

60
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,375
You still have plenty of time.

61
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,916
Starting tomorrow, the troupe and I will be out of town for days.

62
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,208
When I’m back,
I’ll come straight to your place for an answer.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,875
I’m glad

64
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,916
that I’m going with the troupe tomorrow.

65
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,541
If I went with the others today,

66
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,541
I wouldn’t have seen you tonight.

67
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,166
Seeing you before work

68
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,916
cheers me up.

69
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,291
Boss, can I ask you something?

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,083
What do you like about Kwang?

71
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:31,750
Everything. And I’ve liked him for a long time.

72
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:42,125
How did you dare to confess?
Weren’t you afraid of getting hurt?

73
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,083
Why be afraid? If you feel it, say it.

74
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,125
Better than suffering alone.

75
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,916
You tell them so they know,

76
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,875
and so you can move forward too.

77
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:07,625
At the very least, let them know

78
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,791
that in this world,

79
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,750
there’s someone watching over them.

80
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:32,750
Boss, thank you so much.
I’ll head back first. See you.

81
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,416
Hey, where are you going?

82
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,541
- See you.
- Hey!

83
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:41,291
Huh..It's great though.
Now it’s just the two of us.

84
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,000
Hmm

85
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,958
Even plain water tastes sweet.

86
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,541
Sweet my ass.

87
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,750
I just happened to notice that you’re way too cute.

88
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,583
And if I were to walk up and tell you that I like you,

89
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,875
I’m just afraid it wouldn’t end well.

90
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:25,291
It’s probably too difficult for me to flirt with you,

91
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,958
But my heart has already fallen for you completely.

92
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,291
So I can only ask for a little kindness.

93
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:36,500
Please have mercy on me, Let me be the one to take care of you.

94
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:42,916
I’m completely weak when it comes to you, Just one smile and my heart overflows.

95
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:48,041
Please have mercy on someone ordinary like me.

96
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:54,250
Let me be the one in the heart of someone like you.

97
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,125
Can I be the one? Can I be the one?

98
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,750
Can I be the one? Please let me be the one.

99
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:05,625
Let me be the one living in your heart.

100
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:10,625
It’s probably too difficult for me to flirt with you,

101
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,125
But my heart has already fallen for you completely.

102
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,458
So I can only ask for a little kindness.

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,125
Please have mercy on someone ordinary like me.

104
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:28,333
Let me be the one in the heart of someone like you.

105
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,833
Let me be the one in your heart —

106
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:40,375
if your heart still has some space for me.

107
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,416
"Leave A Mark"

108
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,500
Park here, please.

109
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,416
You can charge the linked card.

110
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:06,708
Ja.

111
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,166
Ja, stop first.

112
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,375
Ja.

113
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,125
Ja.

114
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,083
Ja.

115
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,958
P' Man, park the car, please.

116
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,958
What were you thinking, Jack?
That was dangerous.

117
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:45,000
I have something to tell you.
Even if you have a boyfriend, I have to say it.

118
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:57,083
Do you know what it feels like?
Like something inside me is about to burst.

119
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,708
Every time I look at you,

120
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:08,291
my heart beats fast like crazy.
Sometimes, it beats painfully slow.

121
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:19,625
When you told me about your dreams,
I don’t know why you want them for,

122
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:29,375
but damn… I really want to be by your side
the day you achieve them.

123
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,875
And when you keep calling me a kid,

124
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,916
but this kid has plenty of time

125
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,083
to stay with you for a lifetime.

126
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,958
I want to be with you through every moment.

127
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,958
Be with you when you cry,

128
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,291
and stand by you when you smile.

129
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:17,041
I kept asking myself why I felt this way,
until I realized

130
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,541
how much I like you.

131
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,500
You once asked me what my dream was.

132
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,625
I’ve found it now.

133
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,333
It’s you, P' Ja.

134
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,166
You’ve become my dream.

135
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,041
Let me just mark my spot first.

136
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,583
I have to go now.

137
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,041
Let’s talk when I’m back.

138
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,583
You don’t have to worry.

139
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,416
Win and I broke up a long time ago.

140
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,291
But my heart kept wandering.

141
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,375
Yes.

142
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,708
Yes.

143
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:32,875
Yes.
