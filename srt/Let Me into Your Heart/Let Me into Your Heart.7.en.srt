2
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,916
It's you, P'Ja. You've already become my dream.

3
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:28,625
Oh, Win.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,916
Today…

5
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,375
I really meant to come and watch you perform Likay, Ja.

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,583
I’m here now.

7
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,625
You don’t want to be my boyfriend, right?

8
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,291
That might be right.

9
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:55,041
Please don’t push me or expect anything from me yet.

10
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,250
About the status between us…

11
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,375
Can we not talk about it right now?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don’t understand.

13
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,333
If one day we’re truly clear about our feelings,

14
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,000
why don't you want me to focus on our status?

15
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,833
Does this have something to do with your ex?

16
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,208
I’m asking you.

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,833
You don’t want to be my boyfriend, right?

18
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,000
I really don’t understand.

19
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,875
Can you please explain it clearly to me?

20
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,333
I don’t know how I’m supposed to act.

21
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:39,583
I don’t understand.

22
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,041
I don’t understand.

23
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,458
Can you please explain it clearly to me?

24
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,666
I don’t know how I’m supposed to act.

25
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,583
Does this have something to do with your ex?

26
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,166
Please don’t push me or expect anything from me yet.

27
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,416
Ja.

28
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,125
P’Win.

29
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,208
What are you doing here, P’Win?

30
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,625
Oh.

31
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,625
My partner happens to be a sponsor for Viva.

32
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,208
So they invited me to come talk business here.

33
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,166
I didn’t expect…

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,208
that I’d run into you here too.

35
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,041
If there’s nothing else, I’ll excuse myself first.

36
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,166
Ja.

37
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,208
I went home and thought about it.

38
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,750
About you asking for more time.

39
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:42,375
But I’m sorry, Ja. I can’t wait any longer.
Can we talk now?

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,166
Then can you wait for me a bit?

41
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,166
I still have a media interview.

42
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:53,833
Once I’m done

43
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,416
I’ll come talk to you right away, P’Win.

44
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,166
Please excuse me.

45
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,916
Earlier, we’ve already talked about the series
with all the actors.

46
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,833
So now I’d like to open the floor
for the media to ask questions.

47
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:19,041
Both Nong Jack and Khun Ja,
let’s focus on them today.

48
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,458
still curious,
so if you're ready, please raise your hand and ask.

49
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:26,291
Like everyone saw in the clip, when Nong Jack
surprised Khun Ja at a provincial Likay stage,

50
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,250
could you explain what that was about?

51
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:33,041
I happened to be free that day,
so I went to surprise everyone in Sroisangsuriya troupe.

52
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:38,958
Yeah. Actually, Jack even asked Nong Mona to come too,
but she had work so she couldn’t.

53
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,666
And the reason Jack put a ring with a twenty-baht bill on you, Khun Ja?

54
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,583
Did it mean something?

55
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,083
Oh wow, I was waiting to see who would ask that question.

56
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:53,333
If you’re asking whether it has any special meaning,
I can say for sure, yes, it does.

57
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:58,458
But what it means… I’ll have to ask everyone to follow our series.

58
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,416
So you’re confirming that Jack and Khun Ja
don’t have a deeper relationship?

59
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,125
Uh…

60
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,083
No. Definitely not.

61
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:10,416
Since Jack came to my troupe,
Jack and I haven’t been close as just the two of us.

62
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:15,541
Jack is also close with many of the seniors in Sroisangsuriya troupe.

63
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,125
So I want everyone to focus on Jack’s work,

64
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,583
and Khun Mona’s,

65
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,541
I’ll say the same thing again.

66
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,541
Jack and I…

67
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,000
we’re not anything.

68
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:42,333
I think that should be enough.
I believe everyone has their answer now.

69
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:47,583
Alright, I’d like to invite the media to take solo photos of Nong Jack now.

70
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,000
Jack, center please.

71
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:50,958
Thank you, thank you.

72
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,625
Look at this camera, please. Smile.

73
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,500
Very handsome. Very handsome.

74
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,916
All set, Khun Kwang?

75
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,708
Then I’ll take my leave now. I have something else to attend to.

76
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,000
All done. Thank you so much, Khun Ja.

77
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,333
Thank you as well.

78
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,291
I just happened to notice that you’re way too cute.

79
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,125
And if I were to walk up and tell you that I like you,

80
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,416
I’m just afraid it wouldn’t end well.

81
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,833
It’s probably too difficult for me to flirt with you,

82
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,500
But my heart has already fallen for you completely.

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,833
So I can only ask for a little kindness.

84
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:55,041
Please have mercy on me, Let me be the one to take care of you.

85
00:05:55,416 --> 00:06:01,458
I’m completely weak when it comes to you, Just one smile and my heart overflows.

86
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:06,583
Please have mercy on someone ordinary like me.

87
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:12,791
Let me be the one in the heart of someone like you.

88
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,666
Can I be the one? Can I be the one?

89
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,291
Can I be the one? Please let me be the one.

90
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:24,166
Let me be the one living in your heart.

91
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,166
It’s probably too difficult for me to flirt with you,

92
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,666
But my heart has already fallen for you completely.

93
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,000
So I can only ask for a little kindness.

94
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:40,666
Please have mercy on someone ordinary like me.

95
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:46,875
Let me be the one in the heart of someone like you.

96
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:52,375
Let me be the one in your heart —

97
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:58,833
if your heart still has some space for me.

98
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,916
“With Love, and Goodbye.”

99
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,958
I’m truly sorry, Ja.

100
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,500
Even though I was the one who told you not to rush,

101
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,875
in the end, I was the one who pressured you for an answer.

102
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,083
I understand, P’Win.

103
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,250
You’ve already given me so much time.

104
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,416
But even if you gave me more time,

105
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:34,750
I don’t know if I’d truly be able to find the answer.

106
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,458
It means...

107
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,083
you still don’t have an answer?

108
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,250
Because of Jack?

109
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,083
Jack and I… we just have good feelings for each other, that’s all.

110
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,750
Is it because of this, Ja?

111
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,666
Is that why you can’t give me an answer?

112
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,875
It’s not all of it, P’Win.

113
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,458
Because of me too?

114
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,125
This might sound selfish,

115
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,083
Yeah.

116
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,833
Like you once told me…

117
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,666
no one understands me more than you do.

118
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,958
And I still believe that now.

119
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,166
I’m asking you seriously, Ja.

120
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,750
Do you still love me?

121
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,916
Thank you so much, everyone. I think that’s enough for now.

122
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:57,958
We’ll let them rest for a bit,
and then do separate interviews with each outlet.

123
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,541
Thank you.

124
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,625
Thank you.

125
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,291
I’ll be right back.

126
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,708
Where are you going?
Hurry back, okay?

127
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,875
I understand.

128
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,416
I’m sorry, Ja.

129
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,500
P’Ja…

130
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,166
I don’t know either…

131
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,916
what I’m supposed to do.

132
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,041
Then let me sit here, okay?
