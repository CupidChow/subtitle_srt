May I take a photo as the very last fan, please?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,541
Could you please take off your glasses for a moment? Just for a second, Ja.

4
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,583
Let me help you.

5
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:43,291
And just in case… I have one more tea to spill.

6
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:48,625
The story behind the hashtag JackAndJa,
which is currently the number one trending right now.

7
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,500
I feel like I don’t belong there at all.

8
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,416
So I sat down and reflected on it.

9
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,125
Whether I’d really thought it through,

10
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,416
before accepting this job.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,291
Sroisangsuriya Likay Troupe.

12
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,166
I’m here to see Ja.

13
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,541
I have something to talk to him about.

14
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:34,916
But I called and he didn’t pick up.

15
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,375
Ja’s tied up with something else right now.

16
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,833
You can wait in the lounge first.

17
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,625
By the way…

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,916
What are you doing here?

19
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,791
Just checking out the swords.

20
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, really?

21
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,791
I thought you came to check out my muscles.

22
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,791
You crazy!

23
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,875
Are these swords the props Jack has to use?

24
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,000
Why so many questions? You never cared before.

25
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,875
Of course I need to know
whether the props Jack has to use meet safety standards.

26
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,791
Are they certified? If Jack gets hurt, who’s responsible?

27
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,041
And has Jack gotten a tetanus shot yet?

28
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,000
If he has, he won’t die.

29
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,875
Still crude, savage, and uncivilized as ever.

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,708
Why?

31
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,541
Hey! wait.

32
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,666
I mean, you’re shirtless holding a sword, anyone would be scared.

33
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,750
This is my place.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,916
I can do whatever I want.

35
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,708
What are you going to do?

36
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,208
Not right now.

37
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,416
But I’m...thinking about stripping you shirtless…

38
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,875
…and turning you into a fellow savage, just like me.

39
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,833
Have you figured it out yet?

40
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,166
What I told you to think about.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,833
Why I keep coming onto you.

42
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,083
No idea.

43
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,416
Haven’t thought about it.

44
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,166
Yeah.

45
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,666
And one more thing

46
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,833
Stop calling me “Khun” all the time.

47
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,166
My name’s Thanu.

48
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,458
Thanu, like a bow used for hunting.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,958
Just so you know

50
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,208
This bow…

51
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,500
never misses his target.

52
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,375
If a “deer” like you doesn’t believe it,

53
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,291
I can prove it to you.

54
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,375
I just happened to notice that you’re way too cute.

55
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,208
And if I were to walk up and tell you that I like you,

56
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,500
I’m just afraid it wouldn’t end well.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,916
It’s probably too difficult for me to flirt with you,

58
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,583
But my heart has already fallen for you completely.

59
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,916
So I can only ask for a little kindness.

60
00:04:55,416 --> 00:05:00,125
Please have mercy on me, Let me be the one to take care of you.

61
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,541
I’m completely weak when it comes to you, Just one smile and my heart overflows.

62
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:11,666
Please have mercy on someone ordinary like me.

63
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:17,875
Let me be the one in the heart of someone like you.

64
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,750
Can I be the one? Can I be the one?

65
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,375
Can I be the one? Please let me be the one.

66
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:29,250
Let me be the one living in your heart.

67
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,250
It’s probably too difficult for me to flirt with you,

68
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,750
But my heart has already fallen for you completely.

69
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,083
So I can only ask for a little kindness.

70
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:45,750
Please have mercy on someone ordinary like me.

71
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,958
Let me be the one in the heart of someone like you.

72
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,458
Let me be the one in your heart —

73
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:04,250
if your heart still has some space for me.

74
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,916
“At the First Step of Falling in Love.”

75
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,875
A super-hot star and a Likay lead, sweet and juicy.

76
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:10,666
So what role does Mona play in this drama? #JackandJa

77
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,458
Jack and Ja are getting shipped this hard, even though Jack already has an established ship. Isn’t that weird? #JackandJa

78
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,208
Seriously, are Jack and Ja actually something? #JackandJa

79
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,708
Ooh!

80
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,000
All done!

81
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,833
A Bollywood-style shoot.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,750
It’s that thin, huh?

83
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,291
Wait, so is it thin or thick?

84
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,791
No. Nothing. Not thick

85
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,458
With glasses on, Jack looks like someone who has a life plan. #NothingNotThick

86
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,500
How can someone cook and be this cute? Is he still my little baby. My hands are shaking. #JackFooddddd

87
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,583
That smile is so perfect, can you post a clip every day? #TeamTeeradollSon

88
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:46,416
Night falls, moonlight spills…

89
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:55,250
I get to gaze into sweet eyes…

90
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:13,125
I’m sorry, for what happened.

91
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,291
The hashtag JackAndJa…

92
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,583
I made it disappear.

93
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,375
Do you remember?

94
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:50,791
Where you stand and where I stand, it feels like two different worlds.

95
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:02,250
Sometimes, the same story can affect two sides in completely different ways.

96
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,166
But I’m truly grateful to you.

97
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:11,041
For trying to take responsibility for what you did.

98
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,208
Go get some rest.

99
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,000
I’ll keep working.

100
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:22,791
No.

101
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:32,291
P'Ja, from now on, can you let me get to know your world better?

102
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,041
You want to know my world?

103
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,458
Then go change your clothes.

104
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:07,750
Night falls, moonlight spills…

105
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:15,250
I gaze into your sweet eyes…

106
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:22,500
Please don’t get annoyed yet,

107
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:30,541
I just feel like I need to be close.

108
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:40,250
Come, speak those sweet, syrupy words,

109
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:47,916
Let me hear your tender lines.

110
00:09:48,833 --> 00:10:00,625
I hope you’re not a playboy… I might just give it a try.

111
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:08,458
If you and I become a pair,

112
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:17,208
You’ll live in the four chambers of my heart.
