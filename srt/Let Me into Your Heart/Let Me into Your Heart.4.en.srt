1
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,875
You hugged me twice already.

2
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,958
You hugged me tight both times.

3
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:51,458
Because you’re the reason I had to sleep here.

4
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,416
Do you know how hard it was to carry you here?

5
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,166
How much trouble it was?

6
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,250
And when I tried to get up and leave…

7
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,541
You grabbed me and hugged me.

8
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,250
No matter how much I struggled, I couldn’t get free.

9
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,541
Next time, I won’t let you get drunk.

10
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,333
So that means…

11
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,083
You took care of me all night?

12
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:27,250
Not because I wanted to. I’m just scared Viva will sue me…

13
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:31,458
…for leaving their actor sleeping in the hallway.

14
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:33,625
Mm.

15
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,208
True.

16
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,750
Do you remember what you said last night?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,583
Ugh, I don’t remember.

18
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,625
What did I say…? Did I yell at you?

19
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:58,875
No. You didn’t say anything bad. And I’m not taking it personally.

20
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:02,041
Drunk people say things without thinking.

21
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:11,250
True… but when drunk people talk, they’re talking from how they feel.

22
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,166
I’m going. I won’t bother you.

23
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,166
Wait.

24
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,166
Do you have work tomorrow?

25
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,541
Yeah. I’m shooting a commercial.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,791
Oh, our troupe is doing a livestream tomorrow. I want you to watch.

27
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,375
Want me to cancel my job?

28
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,916
No, it’s fine. You can watch the replay.

29
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,083
Aww…

30
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,041
Being a celebrity is such a pain.

31
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,541
Then I’m gonna tell P’Kwang…

32
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,000
…I’m quitting being a celebrity.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,833
Hey.

34
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:46,875
Don’t be ridiculous.

35
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,708
You can’t do that.

36
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:58,250
But… since you took care of me last night, I want to pay you back.

37
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,291
Is there anything you want?

38
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,375
Mm… I don’t want anything.

39
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,125
Come on, just one thing.

40
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,458
Well… whatever you want. I’m good with anything.

41
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,833
You said it yourself, whatever I want.

42
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,666
Then… let’s go on a date.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,791
Hey!

44
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,041
You can do that?

45
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,375
That’s totally cornering me!

46
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,166
Damn.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,750
That’s one priceless gift.

48
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,541
A one-on-one date with Jack Theeradol.

49
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,583
This privilege..

50
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,125
I’m giving it to you.

51
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:36,958
Promise.

52
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:42,708
Alright. But you’ll have to match your schedule with mine.

53
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,833
For me, anything works.

54
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,791
Okay, deal.

55
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,458
Thank you.

56
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,375
You said it! You said it! You said it!

57
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:02,708
You crazy kid.

58
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,458
Moo-moo, baby.

59
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,458
Don’t be crazy too.

60
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:32,875
You little punk.

61
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,125
So artsy, huh, my friend.

62
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,958
After the livestream, you sit and play guitar.

63
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,375
Writing a song.

64
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,583
Even making it into a poem.

65
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,375
Ugh.

66
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,791
I’m just writing whatever, man.

67
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,333
You don’t even say hi to me.

68
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:50,833
Huh?

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,208
What kind of sitting posture is that?

70
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,250
They said it’s “building a scene,” bro.

71
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:54,916
Oh yeah?

72
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,375
Yeah. Now give me the snacks.

73
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,666
All snacks, no drinks.

74
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:02,083
Want a drink? Go buy it yourself. The 7-Eleven is damn far.

75
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,500
Good, I’m starving.

76
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:05,833
Oh.

77
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,000
What song were you writing just now?

78
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,375
Why do you care?

79
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,458
Hey, Team let me ask you something.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,250
You’re good at writing songs and singing,
don’t you ever want to be a musician or singer beyond being a ranat player?

81
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,041
Me? What could I even be… but honestly, I do have a dream.

82
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,166
I wanna…

83
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,333
…have one huge concert of my own, at least once.

84
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:32,750
Mm.

85
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,500
Like setting up a stage at Rajamangala Stadium, right?

86
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,333
No, that’s not my house, is it?

87
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,666
Wanna go spit your tongue out first?

88
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,875
Rajamangala Stadium.

89
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,166
That big?

90
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,875
Bigger than that, the biggest possible.

91
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,375
Fine, but if you have a concert, don’t forget to sing my “Kai Ja” song.

92
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,333
Yeah, I'll can sing the song I wrote for you too.

93
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,125
What’s your dream?

94
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,458
My dream?

95
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:58,958
Yeah.

96
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,500
I’m doing it right now.

97
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,791
My dream is to do what I love.

98
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,833
And most importantly, to be free from other people’s expectations.

99
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,250
Why are you so deep all of a sudden, bro?

100
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,250
I dreamed it last night. I’m not just talking.

101
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,791
You’re pouting like a Mae Klong mackerel.

102
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,333
And you, sweetie?

103
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,208
Do you have a dream too?

104
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,333
Huh?

105
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,333
Don’t wanna do anything.

106
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,250
My dream right now?

107
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,458
A rich husband.

108
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,833
Then you’ve got no chance, my friend.

109
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:41,916
Yeah, zero chance.

110
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,125
None of us is rich.

111
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,208
Even if you two were rich,

112
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,375
I still wouldn’t take you.

113
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,041
Like anyone would take you, huh?

114
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,000
You're such a full of yourself, girl.

115
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,416
Big talk.

116
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,916
I said I want a rich husband because

117
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,875
I want him to pay for my mom’s medical bills.

118
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,208
Honestly, my real dream…

119
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,000
…is to see my mom get better.

120
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
I asked a question and it turned into a deep talk.

121
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,875
Oh come on, why are you guys getting all gloomy?

122
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:20,875
Come here.

123
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,541
Let’s eat snacks instead.

124
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,416
Don’t be sad, friend.

125
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,000
You were sulking recently.

126
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,416
Cheer up, okay?

127
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,458
Thanks, here.

128
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,291
Here, eat chocolate.

129
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,250
Why are you smiling?

130
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,125
Guess.

131
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,250
I won't.

132
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,291
What are you smiling at?

133
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,458
I matched our schedules for us already.

134
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,416
Today’s a big shoot day, and they just canceled my call time.

135
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,041
Seriously?

136
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,791
You promised me.

137
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,000
Let me see.

138
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:17,916
Mm.

139
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,041
Okay, okay.

140
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,083
Fine, let’s go.

141
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,833
Why are you so loud? You’ll wake the neighbors then we’ll get yelled at.

142
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,583
I don’t care.

143
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,166
Yes—yes!

144
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:35,750
Jack.

145
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:37,875
Lower your voice.

146
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,791
You’ll wake everyone up.

147
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,166
You mess up my hair?

148
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,041
Oops.

149
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,666
I’m sorry.

150
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,333
You don’t like it?

151
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,333
I like it.

152
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,083
Can you do it again?

153
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,708
What are you, a dog?

154
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:55,666
Yeah.

155
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:56,916
A puppy too.

156
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,625
Go to bed. Get upstairs.

157
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,958
I’ll go home after I finish this.

158
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,916
Good night.

159
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,583
Good night to you too.

160
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,083
Ja.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,791
Have you disappeared or what, Khun Kwang?

162
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,791
P’Ja.

163
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:50,916
Hey!

164
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,291
How did you get here?

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,833
Jack, Can you go back first.

166
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,916
P’Ja, pull over.

167
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,000
P’Ja.

168
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,333
Praying that someday it will come true.

169
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,791
Because I can’t forget you at all.

170
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,375
I’ll love only you, no matter how time flows by.

171
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:30,291
Let love guide the way—
no matter how long it takes, I’ll keep waiting.

172
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:34,416
For the day when we can love each other again.
