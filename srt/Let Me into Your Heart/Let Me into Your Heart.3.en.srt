2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,916
My troupe has a show in another province today.

3
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:25,625
I’m going too.

4
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,125
Hey!

5
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,458
Get out of here.

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,625
I can’t take this anymore!

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,083
Everyone, let’s head back.

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,416
I’m sorry.

9
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:37,458
I couldn’t control my fans. P’Yot, you can punish me however you want.

10
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,250
Thanu, bring the cane.

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,041
Likay troupes these days aren’t the same as before.

12
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,333
The world of stars.

13
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,458
Hey.

14
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,458
Do you want to try?

15
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,958
Really?

16
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,166
Slowly slide that lever up.

17
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Is it starting?

18
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,458
Yeah.

19
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,833
You are the one who open the show.

20
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,000
Boss.

21
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,125
This is called the opening ritual. Before a Likay performance, it always starts this way.

22
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:38,166
It’s like a signal to let the audience know the show is about to begin.

23
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,416
Hes-la mana lan-la, la-la la-la.

24
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:51,291
La-la la-la la-la.

25
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,041
Seeing is believing.

26
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:53,750
Seeing is believing.

27
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,375
Words can deceive some people.

28
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,791
Our hero shines, our heroine is famous.

29
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,666
Beautiful voices, even the clown isn’t mediocre.

30
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,125
Seeing is believing.

31
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,375
So now, do you understand how people here live and work?

32
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,458
I understand now.

33
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:28,750
No matter how rich or famous you are,
you can’t gain this kind of experience anywhere else.

34
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,791
Kiddo.

35
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:45,708
In this scene, please welcome Dew Sroisangsuriya.

36
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,458
Tonight, he plays the Crown Prince, divine and noble.

37
00:04:53,583 --> 00:05:00,375
At the training grounds.

38
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,666
Training in every discipline.

39
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:11,208
Until mastery is achieved.

40
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:17,958
Never once have I known fear.

41
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,375
And now, the moment everyone has been waiting for.

42
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:29,375
Please welcome the nation’s beloved leading man.

43
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,916
Jamakorn Sroisangsuriya.

44
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,083
A big round of applause, please.

45
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:56,583
With bowed heads and palms pressed together,

46
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,791
I offer these humble words to all.

47
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:05,208
I entrust both my body and my heart,

48
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:09,041
To everyone before me.

49
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,291
Thank you all for your kindness.

50
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,375
This is him, Jamakorn Sroisangsuriya.

51
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,875
The number one likay star of the nation.

52
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,708
And please give a big round of applause for Nong Pang Sroisangsuriya.

53
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,166
Let’s go out and have some fun.

54
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,583
Go out?

55
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,083
– Sure.
– Are you crazy? Come on, hurry up.

56
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:43,458
And now, please welcome our young and beautiful heroine.

57
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,500
Nong Fern Sroisangsuriya,

58
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,541
Playing Princess Ketsuda.

59
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,958
Joined by our heroine Nong Pie Sroisangsuriya,

60
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,166
Playing Princess Pawinee.

61
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:16,750
A royal princess indeed,

62
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:23,250
A gentle and graceful princess,

63
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,333
Every virtue must be complete.

64
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,791
– Thank you to all the award sponsors…
– Thank you so much.

65
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:39,666
In this scene, please welcome hero Nong Beer Sroisangsuriya.

66
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,541
Princess Ketsuda and Pawinee,

67
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,500
Pay their respects to Their Majesties.

68
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,958
Please welcome our villain, Keng Sroisangsuriya.

69
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,250
Hey!

70
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,666
It's my turn, I get to laugh alone.

71
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,416
Help!

72
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,000
Help!

73
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,125
Whose voice is that?

74
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,833
There’s a thief! He tried to assault me!

75
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,083
A thief?

76
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:20,916
Oh!

77
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,041
Who are you?

78
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:33,666
Ah!

79
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,875
Your Highness, are you hurt?

80
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,000
That concludes today’s performance.

81
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:52,750
Thank you to our hosts, audience, and all fans for watching until the end.

82
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,208
Starting to fall in love with Likay now, aren’t you?

83
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:05,708
Love,
Ja
