1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,291
Hey, Nong Kwang.

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:18,291
Let me go see Nong Jack for just a second,
I brought La Baguette croissants from Pattaya.

3
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,791
They just arrived, fresh and hot!

4
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,916
After this, we’ll move out quickly, right?

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,458
-Yes.
-Please.

6
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:32,250
Sorry, security is really strict this time,
so I can’t let anyone backstage.

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,875
Kwang, you know I spend more on Jack
than any other fan does.

8
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,208
Can’t I ask for something a little special?

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,375
I’m really sorry, Mommy,
but I truly can’t let you in.

10
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,833
Just let me pass this time, okay?

11
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,666
Everyone, get ready—we’re going in.

12
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,250
Let’s go. We’ll get in anyway.

13
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,916
Ready, ready—hold the signs and line up.

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,666
Hey!

15
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:02,958
You again?

16
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:04,833
You savage.

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,541
La Baguette croissants.

18
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,291
Oops—oops!

19
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,833
Ah! Hot, hot, hot! Ouch!

20
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,333
You have no manners!

21
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,375
None at all!

22
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,250
Hey!

23
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,250
That’s right.

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,750
No manners.

25
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,333
Because it’s the same thing you ladies do to other people too.

26
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,625
You know?

27
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,750
Instead of letting Khun Kwang bring Jack to meet others quickly,

28
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,291
he has to waste time dealing with you.

29
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:34,833
Wow.

30
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:39,833
If Jack saw his fan group behaving like this,

31
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,583
how do you think he’d feel?

32
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,291
What should we do…

33
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,125
I really knows how to stir the pot.

34
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,166
Ugh, move, go, go!

35
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,458
You savage.

36
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,333
Then I’ll go upstairs and clear things up, okay?

37
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,625
Okay.

38
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,875
What the hell were you doing?

39
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,250
It’s tasty. I was trying to help you, wasn’t I?

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,916
I can’t figure you out.

41
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:14,541
Last time you acted like you hated me, insulted me and embarrassed me.

42
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,041
What are you really thinking?

43
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,583
Go think again.

44
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,666
Smart guy like you,

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,250
you’ll figure it out.

46
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,250
Here. Eat.

47
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,583
Mm.

48
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,458
It’s good.

49
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,583
But today you did really well.

50
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:00,791
And thank you for helping me.

51
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,583
P’Theme.

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,041
Mm?

53
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,083
Talk to me for a sec.

54
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:22,791
Yes?

55
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,375
By the way,

56
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,083
Where did this cat come from?

57
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:27,875
This one?

58
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,375
He’s our troupe’s resident cat.

59
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,416
His name is Suthee.

60
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,458
He kept following me, so I just picked him up.

61
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,916
Guess he came to the right room.

62
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,250
Hungry?

63
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,666
Here you go, Suthee.

64
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,416
Uh, I’m doing a cat-food commercial shoot.

65
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,250
Oh.

66
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,625
So the production prepared products for me to practice holding.

67
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,416
Want some?

68
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,250
Whoa.

69
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:02,916
Come on, come on.

70
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,583
Whoa!

71
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,833
He’s really eating.

72
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,125
How is it, Suthee? The good stuff, right?

73
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,583
Next time you’re hungry, come by this room.

74
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,833
Go on! go for a walk.

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,041
So, P’Theme, why did you come to see me?

76
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,333
I listed some questions, can you help answer them?

77
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,500
What do you need them for?

78
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,958
Someone asked me to write a song.

79
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:54,625
Oh, I know who, hard to guess wrong.

80
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,666
Sure. I’ll write answers back.

81
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,708
I'm counting on you.
I’m going then.

82
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,000
Wait.

83
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,958
Since I’ve been with the troupe,

84
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,916
I haven’t really talked with you much.

85
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,375
What do you want to talk about?

86
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,083
Well,

87
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,875
Have you known P’Ja for a long time?

88
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:21,541
Since we were kids, I guess.
My dad played the ranat for the troupe,

89
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,791
so I’ve been with P’Ja since we were little.

90
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:31,416
But there was a period when P’Ja moved abroad…

91
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,666
P’Ja lived overseas?

92
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:42,833
Yeah, and when he suddenly came back,
his personality changed like he was a different person.

93
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,125
How so?

94
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:48,250
He used to be super cheerful.

95
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:55,375
Once, everyone surprised him for his birthday,
and he scolded us for it.

96
00:05:56,041 --> 00:06:00,791
Because he hates surprises,
even though he used to love them.

97
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:03,791
Why do you ask?

98
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,000
Nothing.

99
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,208
Alright, I’ll write the answers back for you.

100
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,416
Mm. Thanks a lot.

101
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,250
Ohhh, netizens~

102
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,125
Prik Khing is here with some piping-hot gossip!

103
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:39,583
From yesterday’s launch event for Jack Theeradol’s new series,
“A Playful Kiss in Likay Style,”

104
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:44,625
where we got some serious chemistry from a ghost ship,
a brand-new ship!

105
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,958
Jack and the millionaire Likay leading man,

106
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,791
Jamakorn Sroisangsuriya!

107
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,666
But but but—

108
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,500
There’s one more thing I need to spill today.

109
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:02,083
The origin of the hashtag “JackAndJa,”
which is trending #1 right now!

110
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:08,500
Someone secretly took photos of Jack
sneaking off to cheer P’Ja on,

111
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
and even putting a garland around his neck.

112
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,625
Some fan groups, however, claimed that Jack
had already left earlier.

113
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,916
So then… who is the person in those photos?

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sroisangsuriya Likay Troupe.

115
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,000
So?

116
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,833
Stressed about the Jack–Ja buzz?

117
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah.

118
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,166
But what can we even do?

119
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,750
At most, just stay quiet.

120
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,583
Let their side handle it.

121
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,458
That’s how it has to be.

123
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,666
So don’t stress over the shipping buzz or whatever.

124
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:14,541
Once something new comes along, people forget fast.

125
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:25,041
I’m not worried about that,
I’m worried people will see our troupe in a bad light.

126
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,041
If you’re not eating, I will.

127
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,250
Bad how?

128
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,166
Like…

129
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,791
I honestly don’t know.

130
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,791
How their world sees us.

131
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,000
Eat.

132
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,416
Personally, I don’t care how anyone sees us.

133
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,583
Because to me,

134
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,458
we’re already the best damn troupe there is.

135
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,250
Remember the first day I came to apply here?

136
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:18,416
You said you’d just taken over from your family
and weren’t sure how far you could take this troupe.

137
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:22,416
Whether you could do better than your dad
or P’Yot did.

138
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:30,333
Back then, I honestly thought,
this guy is a terrible leader, absolutely useless.

139
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,041
So why did you accept the job?

140
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,791
Desperate for money?

141
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,791
Very funny.

142
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,416
Hey, I’m joking!

143
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,458
Because you said you’d do anything to make this troupe famous,

144
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,458
and that you wouldn’t let anyone here get hurt.

145
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,166
Back then, I believed you’d do what you said.

146
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,166
And you did.

147
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,666
I don’t know what burdens you’re carrying,

148
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,375
but if you can share them with us,

149
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,541
then share some.

150
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,333
Don’t carry it alone.

151
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:25,541
Yes, boss. Then can you double my pay?

152
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,458
Hey, I’ll kick you!

153
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,500
Hey! I’m kidding, just teasing!

154
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,375
I don’t want you stressed.

155
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,625
I’m worried about you.

156
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,750
Alright, I’m heading out.

157
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,416
Can I be your fan too?

158
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:56,416
Thank you, P’Ja, for showing me
what it feels like to want to be someone’s fan.

159
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,583
I really like it, I like how you teach.

160
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,750
I’ll help you.

161
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:35,250
P’Ja’s boyfriend is named Win.
He works overseas, they’ve been together a long time.

162
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,208
You usually don’t drink, P’Ja?

163
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,541
You don’t know me well enough yet.

164
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,000
P’Ja.

165
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,583
Do you want anything?

166
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,541
Anything’s fine with me.

167
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,375
Then…

168
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,208
Let’s go on a date.

169
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,583
Hey!

170
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,500
Yes!

171
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,791
Jack!

172
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,666
What do you mean…?
