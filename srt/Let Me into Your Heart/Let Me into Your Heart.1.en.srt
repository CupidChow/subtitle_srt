1
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,416
Today I’m going to teach you to dance.

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:15,083
Form a circle with your left hand and turn your palm up.

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,125
Yes.

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,041
And this hand does a finger pose.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,791
Lower it a bit.

6
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,791
That side needs to be at eyebrow level.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:24,916
Okay.

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,125
Keep your posture firm.

9
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:26,708
Okay.

10
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:28,708
Watch me.

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,833
You have to chant “tub ting ting”.

12
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,875
Tub ting ting.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,791
Tub ting ting.

14
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:37,916
After that,

15
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,125
step forward with your left foot.

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,083
Tub ting ting.

17
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,916
Tub ting ting.

18
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,583
Tub ting ting, right.

19
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,166
Tub ting ting.

20
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:47,958
Then switch to the left.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,750
Right at this beat.

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,583
You can start snapping photos.

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,041
Let’s save that beat for later.

24
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,541
Today I’m going to teach you to sing.

25
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,250
Listen to me first so you know how it goes.

26
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:38,750
Okay.

27
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:48,208
My dear, my darling.

28
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:55,375
Oh, my beloved sweet girl.

29
00:01:56,208 --> 00:02:03,958
Your beauty is second to none.

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,625
I’ll love you and never grow tired of you.

31
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:16,750
Other than you,

32
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:27,333
I don’t wish to love anyone else.

33
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,333
Want to give it a try?

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,291
Uh.

35
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,416
Me?

36
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:34,916
Yes.

37
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,333
Sing after me line by line.

38
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:38,958
Okay.

39
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:45,750
My dear, my darling.

40
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,916
My dear, my darling.

41
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,625
Everyone, it’s noon now. You can go have lunch first.

42
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:11,041
In the meantime, I’ll keep teaching Jack and we can continue filming in the afternoon.

43
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,666
Okay, sure.

44
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:13,625
Thank you.

45
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,500
Come on, let’s go eat.

46
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,750
We’ll wait for Ja outside.

47
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,333
Now you can focus better, right?

48
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,708
Yes.

49
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,666
Then sing along with me.

50
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,208
Okay.

51
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:37,500
My dear, my darling.

52
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:43,208
My dear, my darling.

53
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:52,333
Oh, my beloved sweet girl.

54
00:03:52,333 --> 00:04:02,541
Your beauty is second to none.

55
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:11,541
I’ll love you and never grow tired of you.

56
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:16,125
Other than you,

57
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,458
Other than you…

58
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,166
Okay, that’s enough for now.

59
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,083
Okay.

60
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,291
Let’s take a break.

61
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,416
Jack.

62
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,791
Can I ask you something?

63
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,208
What does likay mean to you?

64
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:32,875
Hmm.

65
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:42,583
A performance that’s been around for a long time.
Kinda like a stage play, I guess.

66
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,583
You’re not wrong.

67
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,083
Um.

68
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,750
But it sounds a bit shallow.

69
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,791
As for the way you just sang,

70
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,416
it’s not that it wasn’t good.

71
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,375
It’s just not likay.

72
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,916
I think we can adapt it though.

73
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,916
Especially nowadays.

74
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,666
We don’t have to cling to the old ways.

75
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,291
You’re right about that too.

76
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,500
It can be adapted.

77
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,833
But you have to understand the basics first.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,208
And that takes a long time.

79
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,625
This is my first time singing it. Give me some time.

80
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,708
Then sing a song you’re comfortable with.

81
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,291
Oh baby when you hear this song.

82
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,458
I don’t know how it’ll turn out.

83
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,833
But I want you to hear it.

84
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,166
I hope it makes your heart feel full.

85
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,666
Don’t kill the mood yet. Please listen till the end.

86
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,833
Just relax and let me sing you to sleep.

87
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,791
I think you should talk to your company.

88
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:49,041
Maybe ask them to change it to some other kind of series or musical.

89
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,083
Because your skills are a bit too specialized.

90
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:55,833
So…

91
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,541
When you say that, do you mean you think I can’t sing likay?

92
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,166
If you want an honest answer,

93
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,208
yes.

94
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,000
You’ve only known me for two days.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,791
And you’ve already judged me.

96
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,500
That I can’t improve.

97
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,166
Is that really fair?

98
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:17,000
Jack, I’m speaking from what I see, as someone who’s lived with likay his whole life.

99
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:23,208
So what? You’re using your own experience to judge other people like this?

100
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:27,625
If I told you to dance and sing something new in just two days, could you do it?

101
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,166
I think you’re misunderstanding me.

102
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:34,875
What are you thinking, P’Ja? Do you see me as some kid

103
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:40,416
who has no brain, just a pretty face and industry support?

104
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,375
With no real determination?

105
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,750
You’re really underestimating me.

106
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,500
Fine. Let me apologize then.

107
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:58,250
I don’t want to hear an apology. I want you to answer my question.

108
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,125
Okay. If you want me to answer,

109
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,041
then I’ll say that you’re talented.

110
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,250
But you’re not suited for likay.

111
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,958
That’s just what I see.

112
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,791
But if you insist that you’re not like that,

113
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,666
then defend yourself.

114
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,583
Prove it.

115
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:24,958
Fine.

116
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,875
I’ll prove it to you.

117
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:29,666
Go ahead.

118
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,958
Do whatever you want.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,208
That’s your right.

120
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:39,000
That’s it for today. Class dismissed. Go change and head home.

121
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,166
Everyone, the van leaves in 10 minutes.

122
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,625
Ja, I already put your costume in the car.

123
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,416
Okay, thanks.

124
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,750
P’Jack is here.

125
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,125
P’Jack.

126
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,416
P’Jack.

127
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,125
May I ask what brings you to the likay troupe, Khun Jack?

128
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,875
And you’re even here on your own like this. What does that mean?

129
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,333
Starting today, I’ll be staying here with the likay troupe.

130
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,833
Jack, Mommy is here.

131
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,916
P’ Pen

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,958
Get out.

133
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:58,666
If you can’t deal with these issues yet, then you’re not ready to stay in my likay troupe.

134
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,791
Why are you so pretty?
