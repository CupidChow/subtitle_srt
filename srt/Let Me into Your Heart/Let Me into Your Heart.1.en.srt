The leading man’s name is Jamakorn.

18
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,291
Thank you so much, everyone.

19
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,958
For giving a teenage boy

20
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,541
the chance to receive this award.

21
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Thanks to all my fans.

22
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,000
Thanks to VIVA Entertainment.

23
00:03:53,041 --> 00:04:00,833
And thanks to my parents for helping me, Jack Theeradon, receive this award.

24
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,791
Thank you to everyone who has always supported me.

25
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,666
Without all of you, today’s event wouldn’t have been possible.

26
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,083
I hope we’ll meet again next time.

27
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22,083
Thank you to everyone who came to support me today.

28
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:27,250
Today’s event wouldn’t have succeeded without all of you.

29
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,958
I hope I’ll have the chance to see you again next time.

30
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,458
Thank you.

31
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,875
Thank you.

32
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,000
Everyone, I’ve made my decision.

33
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,333
I’m going to send Jack to study Likay with Jamakorn Sroisangsuriya.

34
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,750
I think that’s a good idea, Khun Karn.

35
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,958
The top new leading man meets the top Likay leading man.

36
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:15,541
It's win-win for VIVA Entertainment, for sure.

37
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:20,708
Then please coordinate this asap. That's all.

38
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,666
Yes.

39
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,125
This is going to be fun.

40
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,375
Hey.

41
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,875
Have you slept enough yet?

42
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,666
How did you get in here, P’Kwang?

43
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,041
What are you going to do?

44
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,708
Let me go.

45
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,500
I’m going home.

46
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,458
I’m going back to my mom.

47
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:12,875
No.

48
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,875
I’ve already made you sign a contract with the company.

49
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,791
It’s only two years.

50
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,666
Just bear with it.

51
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,916
– Let’s go.
– Ouch, I’m not ready.

52
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:19,875
It’s exhausting.

53
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,041
You know I just recorded a clip and it went viral overnight.

54
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,375
But this is too much.

55
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,750
P’Kwang, I don’t want to be a leading man anymore.

56
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,041
Go take a shower.

57
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,625
No!

58
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,458
Hey.

59
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,041
How did you get in here?

60
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,000
Come on.

61
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:52,958
No.

62
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,041
Hey, I’m going back to Hat Yai.

63
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,458
Let go.

64
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:02,416
P’Kwang, I want to go home. I don’t want to be a star anymore.

65
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,708
Why do you keep forcing me like this?

66
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,875
Stop. My patience with you is running out.

67
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,583
If you don’t stop whining.

68
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,625
I’ll tell your mom what you really did with the money she gave you for university.

69
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,708
What you spent it all on.

70
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:20,208
You’re the one who said you’d do anything as long as you get money.

71
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,083
And that you wouldn’t tell your mom.

72
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,875
It’s already written in the contract, and you agreed to sign it.

73
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,541
The company is covering your accommodation, tuition, and all your other expenses.

74
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,625
What more do you want?

75
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,583
What do I have to do today?

76
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:49,208
In twelve minutes, the car will pick you up, so act like the sweet kid we agreed on.

77
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,958
And your secret will disappear with me forever.

78
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,375
From 10 to 11AM, you have a fansign for lucky fans at VIVA.

79
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,458
Will there be photos too?

80
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,500
Only for the 10 top spenders. It won’t take more than 10-15 minutes.

81
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,625
10-15 minutes?

82
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,875
No more than 10-15 minutes. At 12:30, you have a magazine interview.

83
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,833
At 2 PM, you have the first read for the new series.

84
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:20,125
At 4 PM, your outfit will be sent for fitting before the fundraising gala at 6 PM.

85
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,250
But I’ll review the script first and send it back to you before 4 PM.

86
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,208
Are you still human, or have you evolved into an AI?

87
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,000
Are you satisfied now?

88
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,541
Let’s go, Jack Theeradon.

89
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,833
How do you feel, Jack, about winning the Rising Star Award this year?

90
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:55,625
I feel very happy, and thank you so much to everyone who has always supported me.

91
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,000
I promise I’ll do my best.

92
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,750
With such a tight schedule, do you even have time to rest?

93
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,458
I still have time to rest.

94
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,250
I’m more worried about all of you.

95
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,916
I’m scared you won’t get any rest.

96
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,750
Oh wow.

97
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,666
We always have time for you.

98
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,083
With a sweet mouth like that, your fans must be jealous.

99
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,916
Excuse me, I’ll go meet Khun Karn now.

100
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,083
Thank you so much.

101
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,500
Congratulations.

102
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,208
Keep fighting.

103
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:23,958
Thank you.

104
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,666
Did I look cool?

105
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,708
Hey, keep your cool. Reporters are still here.

106
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,125
I’m so proud of you.

107
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:44,916
Yes, sir.

108
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,416
Let’s go discuss work.

109
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,166
Okay.

110
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:50,958
Thank you.
