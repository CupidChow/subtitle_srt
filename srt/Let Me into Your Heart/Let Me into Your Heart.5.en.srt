I made the #JackandJa hashtag disappear.

3
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,500
P’Ja’s boyfriend is Win. They really love each other.

4
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,250
Cheers.

5
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,541
Everyone, please enjoy.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,208
I’m just a loser.

7
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,708
I'm not like P’Win, aren't I?

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,958
Who did you hear that from?

9
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:46,958
Let’s go on a date.

10
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,041
Hey!

11
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,125
I already matched our schedules for us.

12
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:51,833
Ja.

13
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,375
The scene has changed.

14
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,166
Ja.

15
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:22,875
P’Win.

16
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,833
What are you doing here?

17
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,916
I missed you so much, you know.

18
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,500
I’m ready now.

19
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,166
Ready for what?

20
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,833
I want to talk about us again.

21
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,541
Right now?

22
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:48,041
When I’m already used to you not being around?

23
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,416
You’ve been hurting a lot, haven’t you?

24
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,500
I’m sorry, P’Win.

25
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,833
I’m not ready to talk right now.

26
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,750
You should go.

27
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,208
I’m really sorry, Ja.

28
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,625
About what happened that day.

29
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:16,875
Hey!

30
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,916
So you’ve gone, Khun Kwang?

31
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,333
Just relax, bro.

32
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,541
I won’t ruin anything. I promise.
