1
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:14,208
This was all our fault, and it caused all this trouble.

2
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,083
I must apologize to Khun Ja and everyone in the troupe.

3
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:22,208
But I’ve already informed the fanclub that Jack has urgent work in Bangkok.

4
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,250
So the fans will definitely go see Jack off at the airport.

5
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:31,000
In that case I’m not worried anymore.
Khun Kwang, please take it from here. I need to rush back to work.

6
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:37,291
Let’s go, P’Yot.
We’ll grab a quick meal and come back to finish everything.

7
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,666
Thank you, Khun Ja, and I’m sorry again.

8
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,041
I really am sorry.

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,041
I’m sorry.

10
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,083
Hurry and go get changed.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,333
I’ll come after you.

12
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,250
Okay.

13
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,333
I need to talk to you.

14
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:32,875
I’m in a hurry.

15
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,875
Whatever you’re going to say, say it quickly.

16
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,333
I wanted to apologize to you again.

17
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:45,458
And about any damages, you can file a claim for everything.

18
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,458
Do you know

19
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,375
that if the likay troupe doesn’t get to perform today,

20
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,250
where the real damage will be?

21
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:56,500
Right here.

22
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,208
I don’t know

23
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,250
how people live in your world.

24
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:09,583
But from what I’ve seen since yesterday,
when you dragged reporters in to corner Ja into giving you what you wanted,

25
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,208
Don’t you think that’s just a bit selfish?

26
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,458
I honestly don’t know how to explain it so you’ll understand.

27
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,041
But everyone has their own responsibilities.

28
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,083
Right.

29
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,708
Everyone has their own duties.

30
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,125
I do.

31
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:29,916
You do.

32
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,958
And so does every crew member.

33
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,250
Am I wrong?

34
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,583
I just never thought something like this would happen.

35
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,250
Exactly, because you never think.

36
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,458
Where’s that professionalism you talk about?

37
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,666
The people here don’t perform likay just because it’s a job.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,375
They perform likay because it’s their life.

39
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,625
It’s what they chose.

40
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,208
If your company cared about that even a little,

41
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,000
none of this mess would have happened.

42
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,625
Just take your people and go.

43
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,208
What an eyesore.

44
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:33,333
Have you ever met the guy who argued with the fans yesterday?

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,458
The cool guy with the big muscles?

46
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,250
Yeah.

47
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,916
Has he ever said anything bad to you or treated you badly?

48
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,541
Why?

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Did he curse you out?

50
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,041
Seriously?

51
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,708
Since I’ve known you,

52
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,500
you’ve never let anyone talk to you like that.

53
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,833
It’s not like I wanted to let it slide.

54
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,916
But how could I argue back?

55
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,625
We really were in the wrong.

56
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,208
Still, he didn’t have to be that harsh, did he?

57
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:16,000
P’Kwang, you’ve crushed the water bottle flat.

58
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,875
Or maybe…

59
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,083
This is ridiculous.

60
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,041
What, you’ve never seen it?

61
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,250
People who bicker all the time

62
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,416
usually end up together.

63
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,500
You’ve been reading too many series.

64
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,333
The arrogant manager

65
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,708
falls for Mr. Big Muscles.

66
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,916
I should make a proposal deck for Khun Garn.

67
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,041
Maybe he’ll be interested.

68
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,208
Stop.

69
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,291
Or I’m not helping you anymore.

70
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,333
Oh, I’m sorry.

71
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,583
Oh.

72
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,333
Anyway, P’Kwang,

73
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,791
you’ve prepared our plan, right?

74
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,041
It’s all set.

75
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,833
And you still haven’t met yet?

76
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,333
Met who?

77
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:11,666
Wow.

78
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,208
I snuck in pretty smoothly, didn’t I?

79
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:15,750
Hey.

80
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,291
P’Film.

81
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,041
Yeah.

82
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,500
It’s really you, P’Film?

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,791
Why?

84
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,000
It’s me.

85
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:24,916
You scared of me?

86
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,708
Scared I’m more handsome than you?

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,083
No way, P’.

88
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,041
Who would’ve thought

89
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,083
that you’d come help me.

90
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:41,958
My dear junior, you know I’m not doing this job for free, right?

91
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,208
Take a guess what I want.

92
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,291
Oh, I know. For the new series, I’ll give up the lead role

93
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,416
and let you be the lead instead. How’s that?

94
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,625
Hey.

95
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,916
Now that sounds better.

96
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,291
So what’s the story about?

97
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,208
The Arrogant Manager Falls for Mr. Muscles.

98
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,041
Great script.

99
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,458
Hey.

100
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,708
You’d better start getting in shape.

101
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,500
Because the lead in this story needs huge muscles.

102
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,291
Oh, I can’t take this anymore.

103
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,833
So, how was last night, P’Ja?

104
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,250
The first Thai person to sleep with P’Jack.

105
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,708
Do you think I’m an orange or something?
Why are you squeezing answers out of me?

106
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:04,833
Even if you were a durian, I’d still squeeze you. Spill it.

107
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:14,166
There’s nothing. I just fell asleep, that’s all. I never meant to sleep next to him.

108
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:18,208
He said he tried to wake you up, but you didn’t wake.

109
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,875
Is that true, or were you pretending to stay asleep?

110
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,750
P’Ja, I have the most important question in the world to ask you.

111
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,083
Normally, you always have to sleep hugging that old Moo Moo doll of yours.

112
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,416
But last night, Moo Moo didn’t sleep with you.

113
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,041
Yeah, so?

114
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,250
Look.

115
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,666
Moo Moo, my baby.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,875
Right here.

117
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,375
You’re totally attached to this ragged doll.

118
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:54,458
Of course, I hug my baby every night, every day. What about it?

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,041
Because last night Moomoo was on your bed, but you were sleeping on P’Jack’s bed.

120
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,583
So that means

121
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,333
last night you cuddled with P’Jack the whole night?

122
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,333
Hey!

123
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,333
Don’t be ridiculous.

124
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,333
No one was cuddling anyone.

125
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,208
We both just slept. Nothing happened at all.

126
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,000
No need to raise your voice, P’Ja. It’s just that no one said anything.

127
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:31,000
How about this, if anyone still wants to cause drama today, I’ll dock everyone’s pay.

128
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,208
Okay.

129
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,000
P’Yot, you in on this too?

130
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:41,875
No, no. I just lost my appetite, but the story is pretty entertaining.

131
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:48,291
Hey, finish your food and hurry to set up the stage. We’re already way behind.

132
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,416
Everyone.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,041
Let’s head back.

134
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,708
Hey!

135
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,791
We, Jack’s Magic Beans,

136
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,041
move.

137
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,666
Let’s gooo!

138
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:40,708
Everyone, I’ll have to excuse myself now. I need to hurry and do my makeup or I won’t be ready in time.

139
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,208
P’Ja, can I get a photo with you?

140
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:50,333
How about we take photos after the show? I’ll take pictures with everyone, everywhere.

141
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,875
I promise. Please cheer for me today, okay?

142
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,333
Then everyone go grab your seats. I really have to run.

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,416
Go, go, go.

144
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:01,875
Bye.

145
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,708
P’Ja.

146
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,583
P’Ja.

147
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,208
Huh?

148
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,416
You really didn’t see me?

149
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,375
You still haven’t gone back?

150
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,541
I already went back.

151
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,833
And now I’ve come back again.

152
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,625
I don’t have time to play around with you.

153
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,500
I’m not playing, P’Ja.

154
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,041
I really want to see you and everyone perform Likay.

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,083
Please, P’Ja.

156
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,666
Please let me watch the Likay show.

157
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,291
This will be my first time watching Likay.

158
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,250
I heard what you said.

159
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,583
You were right about everything.

160
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,666
If I’d spent more time with the troupe yesterday,

161
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,708
maybe I’d have understood the meaning of Likay the way you described it.

162
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,416
Jack, come with me.

163
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,041
You’re about to gain a whole new group of fans.

164
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,041
P’Yot.

165
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,375
Ja.

166
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,666
I’m really sorry.

167
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,333
I couldn’t control the fans.

168
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,916
Everything turned into a mess.

169
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,875
I sincerely apologize to all of you.

170
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,708
I’m sorry.

171
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,458
P’Yot, you can punish me however you want.

172
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,875
I’ll even accept a beating.

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,333
Thanu, bring the cane.

174
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,708
Yes, P’.

175
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,208
Huh?

176
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,250
Someone’s getting a spanking today.

177
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,875
Turn around and look up.

178
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,625
Do you see any cane?

179
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:23,916
No.

180
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,333
Exactly.

181
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,833
You don’t see it because there isn’t one.

182
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:36,041
If this troupe used beatings, old Fern’s back would’ve been covered in welts long ago.

183
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,666
Hey, why would you say that about me?

184
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,583
Well, isn’t it true?

185
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,291
Listen.

186
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,541
Likay troupes these days

187
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,041
aren’t like they were in the old days.

188
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,708
It’s time you changed the way you think.

189
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:59,333
From now on, if you want to research anything, just ask. Everyone here is happy to help.

190
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,041
And we’ll answer all your questions, right?

191
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,166
Yes, yes.

192
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,291
Welcome to the Sroisangsuriya Likay Troupe for real.

193
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,208
Everyone, give a round of applause for our leading man.

194
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:10,000
You’re curious, right? This part is called the Homrong Sathukan, P’Jack.

195
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,875
Homrong Sathukan.

196
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:15,958
Here.

197
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,541
Oops.

198
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:17,791
Yes.

199
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,291
It’s the first piece that has to be played.

200
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,625
It signals that the performance is about to begin.

201
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,041
It’s played in reverence to our teachers and masters.

202
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:48,666
P’Ja, why doesn’t your troupe hire hair and makeup artists?

203
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,208
Everyone in the troupe does their own makeup.

204
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:58,083
We have shows all thirty days. We can’t afford to hire stylists every day.

205
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,250
The performers here are all pros at doing their own faces.

206
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,000
Look.

207
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,333
P’Ja.

208
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,541
I think P’Geng still needs a lot more practice with makeup.

209
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,333
Why?

210
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,375
I think he’s using the wrong shade of foundation.

211
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,958
Jack, I’m supposed to be this pale. I’m playing the villain.

212
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,250
It’s not even done yet. You’ll see how handsome I am in a bit.

213
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,458
Why do you look so beautiful?

214
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,500
I mean your makeup.

215
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,375
Want to get yours done?

216
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,875
Go let Geng do it for you.

217
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,666
Geng, take care of him.

218
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,166
Come here.

219
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,666
I’m ready.

220
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,375
Uh…

221
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,583
I’d better not.

222
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,625
I don’t want to trouble anyone.

223
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,875
Before every performance,

224
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,375
we pay respect to Pho Kae.

225
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,791
For blessings and good fortune for our troupe.

226
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,166
Put your hands together and Wai.

227
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,416
This show is very important to us.

228
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,583
The audience is always seeing us for the first time.

229
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,083
Let’s go.

230
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,541
Go take your seat.

231
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,791
Would you like this?

232
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,875
Hello, test, test.

233
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,583
What are you looking at?

234
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,291
You want to come in?

235
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,750
If you do,

236
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,583
you’ll have to be my underling.

237
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,125
Sure thing, boss.

238
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,583
Come here.

239
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,666
Want to try running this?

240
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,125
Can I?

241
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,875
Slowly push that slider up.

242
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,375
Has it started?

243
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:45,833
Yeah.

244
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,416
You’re the one opening the show.

245
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,625
Boss.

246
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:16,583
This is the launch event for the new series, A Playful Kiss in Likay Style.

247
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:22,583
Someone managed to snap a shot of Nong Jack secretly going to cheer P’Ja on,

248
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,208
and quietly putting a flower garland around his neck.

249
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,000
I honestly have no idea what their world thinks of us.
