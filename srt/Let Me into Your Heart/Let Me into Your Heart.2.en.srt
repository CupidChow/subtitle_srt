2
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:27,500
I’m going to send Jack to train in Likay with Jamakorn Sroisangsuriya.

3
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,041
I do believe that you've got talent.

4
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,708
But you’re not suited for Likay.

5
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:38,041
What's on your mind, P’Ja?
Or do you just think I’m a clueless kid?

6
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,208
Class is dismissed for today.

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,916
Starting today, I’ll be staying with the Likay troupe.

8
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:58,875
Well..Jack wants to learn about the daily life of a Likay troupe.

9
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,916
He wants to absorb the true essence of Likay.

10
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,250
Not just the basic performance.

11
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,291
That’s why I wanted to consult you, Khun Ja.

12
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,625
But…

13
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:07,416
But…

14
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,791
Jack said you already gave him permission.

15
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,875
Well, you told me to prove myself.

16
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,458
So I came here to prove it in person.

17
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,083
I do believe that you've got talent.

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,958
But you’re not suited for Likay.

19
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,208
But if you insist that you’re not like that…

20
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:31,375
Then prove it.

21
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,708
Khun Kwang.

22
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,375
I think he misunderstood me.

23
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,875
I never told him he could stay in the troupe.

24
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,625
I didn’t say that at all.

25
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,375
Please let P’Jack stay with us.

26
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,500
This is really a perfect chance!

27
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,291
Please.

28
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,833
P’Ja, please grant Fern this one wish.

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,541
May I interrupt for a moment?

30
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,083
Jack is extremely famous right now.

31
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,208
I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for him to stay here.

32
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:11,291
It’s better for him to travel back and forth for his work.

33
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,208
Where did you get that mask from, Geng?

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,208
I’m his fan too.

35
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,208
Love you!

36
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,791
Hey!

37
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,291
The adults are talking.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,916
Please let me stay here.

39
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,833
I thought about what you told me the other day.

40
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,000
About what I must do to improve myself.

41
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,166
I think it’s better if Jack stays here first.

42
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,333
By now, the news must have spread everywhere online.

43
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:44,666
If we deny it now, we’ll have to answer to the media all over again next time.

44
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:51,041
And I don’t want our troupe or Viva Entertainment end up looking unprofessional

45
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:58,666
Fine.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,125
I’ll let you stay here.

47
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,208
But you must follow the rules of our troupe.

48
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,833
We live like Likay performers.

49
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,250
We live like a family.

50
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,750
You must be equal to everyone else.

51
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,208
And you have no special privileges.

52
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,250
No matter how famous you are.

53
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,041
All right. No problem.

54
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,708
Geng, why are you crying?

55
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,208
I’m just happy he’s going to stay with us.

56
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:36,791
Imagine his shoulder brushing mine. I'm so emotional.

57
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,375
P’Ja, today we have a show out of town, right?

58
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,666
Will P’Jack be going with us?

59
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,875
That’s right. Today our troupe has a show upcountry.

60
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,291
Khun Kwang, you can take Jack back first.

61
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,416
I’ll go too.

62
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,375
I want to see how Likay is performed.

63
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:05,375
You don’t have to go. We’re staying overnight.

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,916
It’ll be uncomfortable.

65
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,833
It won’t be. I’ve prepared everything already.

66
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,375
The World of Likay.

67
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,375
There were a lot of people just now.

68
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,583
So I didn’t get to talk to you properly.

69
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,875
You might not understand everything yet.

70
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,041
Of what?

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,125
That you have to be equal to everyone else.

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,291
I just don’t want your presence here causing any trouble for the troupe.

73
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:28,916
P’Ja.

74
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,916
P’Jack.

75
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,083
Hellooo kaaa~

76
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,958
I’m Fern, or you can call me Nong Fern.

77
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:47,166
I’ve been your mommy-fan since you were a baby, you know?

78
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:52,208
Oh my—my sweet P’Jack! Chu chu, chu chu!

79
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:57,208
Sure, you do, Nong Fern.
Thank you so much.

80
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:02,208
This is Fern, the lead actress of the Sroisangsuriya Likay Troupe.

81
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:07,625
Oh, I remember now. I’ve seen you in Likay clips before.

82
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,166
Oh my!

83
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,833
I’m going to faint.

84
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:12,916
Okay, I’m back.

85
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,958
Are you serious?

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is like my first big achievement.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,083
For a big fan like me!

88
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,750
Then Fern

89
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:21,833
Oops.

90
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,583
Jack’s biggest fan

91
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,791
Please take Jack to the car.

92
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,625
Make sure he gets a good seat.

93
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh my!

94
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,041
Don’t you worry!

95
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,666
Honestly…

96
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,708
I’m thinking of buying a new car.

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,916
So we can go places just the two of us.

98
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,875
Without anyone bothering us.

99
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,916
Let’s go, P’Jack.

100
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:41,708
Come on, come on, come on!

101
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,250
P’Ja.

102
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,166
Let’s go. Don’t worry about him.
