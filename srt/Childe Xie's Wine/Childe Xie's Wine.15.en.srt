=Episode 15=

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,800
Go.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,440
Don't push me.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,160
Just go.

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,200
Mr. Zong.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,760
You traveled back in time
to get here, right?

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,960
You're from the modern age.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,800
When I saw you for the first time,

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,480
I doubted the authenticity

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,840
of your stories.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,120
Now that I recall it,

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,120
those were from

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,680
Jin Yong and Gu Long's
martial arts fictions.

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,720
You may fool others,

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,680
but not me.

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,400
Because I traveled in time, too.

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,080
Modern people and the ancient people

19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,600
live a similar life.

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,640
I live here

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,120
because I feel happy here.

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,040
So you are a modern person.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,160
You've blown my cover at last.

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840
Do you know how we get back
to the modern world?

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,000
Miss, here's my advice.

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,120
Don't try to resist fate.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Everything in life is destined.

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,240
Take me for an example.

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,400
I've been here for decades,

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,720
and I never tried
to find a way back home.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,160
I'm still doing well, aren't I?

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
Because

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,160
the people here look up to you.

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,160
They take

35
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,720
your made-up stories seriously.

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,840
So what?

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,400
I'm doing quite well here.

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,240
I won't go back.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,840
You go back if you like.

40
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,360
Wait a minute.

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,120
Mr. Zong.

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,600
If I knew the way,

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,240
I would have gone home, wouldn't I?

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,480
Could you not keep the secret anymore?

45
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Please tell me.

46
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,480
When your time comes,

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,720
fate will take you home.

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,320
Those who traveled in time

49
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,200
will go home eventually.

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,320
Maybe you haven't completed

51
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,200
your mission here.

52
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
When it's completed,

53
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,760
even if you want to stay,

54
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,040
you won't be able to.

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,400
Those who traveled in time

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,320
will go home eventually.

57
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Maybe you haven't completed

58
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,440
your mission here.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,160
When it's completed,

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,040
even if you want to stay,

61
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,680
you won't be able to.

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,120
What mission could it be?

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,200
It smells so good.

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,840
Sure it does.

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,000
Five-addictive Wine

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
is made of five kinds of grains.

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
Sorghum, rice, corn,

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,320
wheat, and sticky rice.

69
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,200
These five grains are mixed up

70
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,320
and fermented

71
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,000
to give off their own unique fragrances.

72
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,880
This is the foundation of good wine.

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,520
Then we've made it, right?

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
Still early.

75
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,400
The fermentation is only the first step.

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
The next step is the most crucial one.

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,000
We distill the fermented liquid

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
to get the raw liquor.

79
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,720
Distill?

80
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm good at it.

81
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,320
There's a big pot in the kitchen.

82
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,280
We put it in the pot.

83
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,200
Distillation isn't steaming.

84
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,520
It requires specific tools.

85
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,800
But we don't have them.

86
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,400
Look, we split up.

87
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,400
Yufan and I

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,920
will make the distillation tools.

89
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,960
Murong, you and Xiaotang

90
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,920
move the grains out.

91
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,920
Don't spill them.

92
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,920
Yufan.

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,880
This is

94
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,440
the sketch I have drawn

95
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,640
based on my memory

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,880
and the information on books.

97
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,560
It is how a distiller
looks like basically.

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,040
But I don't really remember

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,280
where to place the outlet tube.

100
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
We'll make a few attempts.

101
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,480
It's most efficient

102
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,720
if the outlet tube is placed here.

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,000
We can cut and put

104
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,440
a piece of bamboo here,

105
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,920
and let the raw liquor flow out

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,960
through the bamboo tube.

107
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,120
You're a genius, Yufan.

108
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,080
I didn't have the college
entrance exam for nothing.

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,640
College entrance exam?

110
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,920
What is that?

111
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,600
Never mind.

112
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
I can't really explain.

113
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,320
You work on it yourself.

114
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
From a point,

115
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,960
I start to feel that I don't
want to leave this place.

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
But Mr. Zong said

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,360
those who traveled in time
would eventually return home.

118
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,600
I suddenly fear the arrival
of the moment.

119
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,280
Meng Yufan,

120
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,720
you can't be stuck

121
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,080
in the sweet fantasy anymore.

122
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,800
The deeper you sink,

123
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
the more painful it gets

124
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,440
when you leave.

125
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
Murong,

126
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,640
try the wine I mixed.

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,200
You mixed it?

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,520
So sweet.

129
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,920
It has the taste

130
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,080
of honey in it.

131
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,920
I see you drink a cup of honey water

132
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,760
to moisten your throat every morning,

133
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
so I'm sure you like the honey.

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,200
An idea hit me,

135
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,080
and I mixed honey and wine.

136
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,280
This wine

137
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,680
is especially mixed for you.

138
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,840
Especially mixed for me?

139
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,480
You've been working hard lately.

140
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,520
And thank you

141
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,040
for kicking those bad people out.

142
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,880
You were like a hero

143
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,800
in Mr. Zong's stories.

144
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
That's an overstatement.

145
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm embarrassed.

146
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,040
This is some good wine.

147
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,800
Next time,

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,560
please add less honey.

149
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,720
This is too sweet.

150
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,280
But this is my wine cup.

151
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,040
You just…

152
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,200
So-Sorry.

153
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I...

154
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,840
Wait a minute. I'll clean it for you.

155
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,120
No bother.

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,440
I don't mind.

157
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,720
You don't mind, huh?

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Like the rain in a drought.

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,280
Well done,

160
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,440
Meng Yufan.

161
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,440
It looks like

162
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,400
you'll complete the mission soon.

163
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,840
Mr. Zong said

164
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,400
those who traveled in time

165
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
wouldn't return home

166
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,080
until they finish their missions.

167
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,400
What is my mission?

168
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,720
What are you helping Xie Xun with?

169
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,080
Winemaking.

170
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,920
Meng Yufan,

171
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,240
you're the key to the completion
of Five-addictive Wine.

172
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,160
The key to winemaking?

173
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,120
The key?

174
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
The key?

175
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,120
What's the meaning of that?

176
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,760
Yufan.

177
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,880
Yufan.

178
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
I bought the preserved fruit

179
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,280
for you on the market.

180
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
It's very sweet. Try it.

181
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,080
No.

182
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,360
Stop cleaning.

183
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
The table is shiny already.

184
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,200
Follow me.

185
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,000
When you said I was your boyfriend,

186
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
were you serious?

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,080
Sure I was, my boyfriend.

188
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,200
Then why does my girlfriend

189
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
not want others

190
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,360
to see me hold her hand?

191
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,200
I…

192
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,560
I'm not used to it.

193
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,400
Get used to it, then.

194
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm still concerned.

195
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,240
Concerned about what?

196
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
Am I not doing good enough?

197
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,200
No.

198
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,680
You're great.

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,960
It is me
who is not doing good enough.

200
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,200
I only hope

201
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,720
when I'm gone,

202
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
you'll be over me

203
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,960
and embrace your new love.

204
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
Is it because you'll eventually leave

205
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,920
like a shooting star?
