=Episode 5=

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,000
I've made my decision.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,400
From today on, your name will be...

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,200
Xie Tingfeng.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,720
You'll have many fans.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,240
I mean listeners.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,160
Audience.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,680
Xie Tingfeng.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,000
A pavilion by the river,

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,960
breezes swing by.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,200
What an elegant and unique name.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,520
I didn't expect

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,120
that other than
your dancing and singing skills,

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,960
your brilliance in literature
is amazing as well.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,440
Thank you for the name.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,600
Nah, nah.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,680
Xie.

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,720
Ting.

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,680
Feng.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,000
Xie Tingfeng.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,200
Xie Tingfeng.

23
00:00:58,682 --> 00:00:59,342
Um,

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,280
enough.

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,200
Let's move on.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,640
Keep practicing.

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,440
You'll have

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,520
a basic footwork test tomorrow.

29
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,240
Sure, Teacher.

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,960
See you tomorrow, Teacher.

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,040
Goodnight, Teacher.

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,960
(Wuti Tavern)

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,440
Murong,

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,800
what is this about?

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,360
Miss Meng,

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,840
it's been nice knowing you.

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,160
Farewell.

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Where are you going?

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,480
I'm going to leave this tavern,

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,000
this obscene den,

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,440
for another livelihood.

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,240
Obscene den?

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,800
Now,

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,160
the House of Art isn't enough

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,400
for Xie Xun, the lewdster, anymore.

46
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,480
He even

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
brought girls to the tavern.

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,000
What?

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,200
Last night, I personally heard

50
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,800
those nasty sounds

51
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,640
from his room.

52
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,320
Last night?

53
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,200
Last night, it was me

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,080
in Xie Xun's room.

55
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,840
Does

56
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,520
he think Xie Xun and I were…

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Murong,

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,480
the owner went to bed very early.

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,560
Before that,

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,200
he asked me to kill some mosquitos.

61
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,320
So

62
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,840
you must have misheard it.

63
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,760
Miss Meng,

64
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,360
you're a good person.

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Can't believe you're defending him.

66
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,880
I suggest you

67
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,080
get out of here as well.

68
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,560
He doesn't care about this place,

69
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,680
this tavern.

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,920
This tavern

71
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,160
is going to be closed for good
sooner or later.

72
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,120
It will be closed?

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,080
Then I won't be able

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440
to drink Five-addictive Wine again.

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,320
I will get my old look back.

76
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
And I can't have a relationship

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
with Xie Xun anymore.

78
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,880
No.

79
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
I cannot

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,160
let that happen!

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
No.

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,080
It mustn't be closed.

83
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,560
I'll manage the tavern.

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,640
You always wanted

85
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,720
to learn how
to make those chips, right?

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,680
I'll teach you.

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,840
Chips?

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,480
The small golden bars?

89
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,800
Those are yours?

90
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
There are quite some techniques

91
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,480
when making the chips.

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,800
Would you like to learn?

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,320
These potatoes are nice.

94
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
I can tell they were grown
in good soil.

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
While we clean it,

96
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,040
we cannot damage its character.

97
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,960
Use this brush.

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,880
Gently

99
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,720
clean all the crevices.

100
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,600
Gentle

101
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,640
but make sure you clean it.

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
When you grill,

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,440
don't turn them over

104
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,960
until one side is golden brown.

105
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Off the grill, sprinkle some salt.

106
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,080
So that

107
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,360
you get the low-fat, low-salt,

108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,440
crispy and crunchy chips

109
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,520
of the perfect flavor.

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,760
Your invention of that…

111
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,120
That chip thing

112
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
is amazing.

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,000
The texture is crunchy,
and aftertaste is pleasant.

114
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,480
Tomorrow

115
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,200
I'll try the recipe, too.

116
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:25,960
Sure.

117
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
If you have any problem,

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,080
just ask me,

119
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,760
and I'll teach you again.

120
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:34,653
Um,

121
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,840
I'm going back to my room.

122
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,760
Okay.

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,520
Keep it up, Shang.

124
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,560
Keep it up.

125
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,280
Keep it up.

126
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,720
Meng Yufan!

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,080
Get over here.

128
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,960
What's wrong?

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,920
You have four hours.

130
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,040
Chop all the firewood.

131
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,880
Four hours

132
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,000
to chop so much firewood?

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
Are you messing with me,
Xie Tingfeng?

134
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Hold on.

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
Don't call me Xie Tingfeng.

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
You're my dance teacher,

137
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,400
but in normal times,

138
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm still your boss.

139
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,200
Start working.

140
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,120
Xie Xun,

141
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,040
you're the worst!

142
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,280
Thank you.

143
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,720
I like you.

144
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,600
When I saw you for the first time,

145
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,360
my heart raced

146
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,360
like I had a cardiac disease.

147
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
You said you like me,

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,240
but you make bodily contact
with someone else.

149
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,000
I didn't know

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,160
you're such a duplicitous woman,
Meng Yufan.

151
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,920
Why did I think that way?

152
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,760
I won't speak to you again.

153
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,360
You're fired!

154
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,960
Disappear!

155
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
Leave right away!

156
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,720
You don't want me to get tanned?

157
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,640
I don't want the firewood to burn.

158
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,320
I knew it.

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
The firewood you chopped

160
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,840
is crooked

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
and in different sizes.

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
It won't

163
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,960
pile orderly in the firewood room.

164
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,960
You're going to burn it anyway.

165
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,880
I can chop it
however the way I like it.

166
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,080
I'll chop it into the shape of you.

167
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,120
Show me

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
if you can.

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,000
Look at this one.

170
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
Short and thick.

171
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,520
That's your boy Shang.

172
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,160
Shang?

173
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,000
He's like 30 years old.

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,480
Is everybody endearing to you?

175
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,120
I thought
you only gave me a stage name.

176
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,360
He's only 19 years old.

177
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,600
He just doesn't look youthful.

178
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,600
You're jealous, right?

179
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,880
You are.

180
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,000
Nonsense.

181
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,480
No way I'm jealous.

182
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,080
That's what I distaste the most.

183
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,760
Then why do you hold
the umbrella here?

184
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,480
You don't want me
to get a heat stroke.

185
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,000
Still in denial?

186
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,520
It isn't for you.

187
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,880
I, uh,

188
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
read the weather,

189
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,600
and I think it'll rain.

190
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,840
Ridiculous.

191
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,600
Look how bright the sun is.

192
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,800
Unbelievable.

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
It's actually raining.

194
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,120
Thankfully, I was quick.

195
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,120
Or the firewood would be ruined.

196
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,160
Just take your time chopping more.

197
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
What's wrong with your hand?

198
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,760
Let me see.

199
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm okay.

200
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,680
More firewood is waiting for me.

201
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,200
You can beg for my mercy.

202
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,720
I didn't say you had to finish all.

203
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,840
And

204
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,040
it's just a bunch of firewood.

205
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,640
Why so serious?

206
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:09,435
Em…

207
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,680
Shang

208
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,000
said the tavern

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,840
is in deficit again.

210
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,720
If the firewood got wet,

211
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,320
it'd make things worse.

212
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,880
If it goes on,

213
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
the tavern is going
to be closed for good.

214
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,880
Fine.

215
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,760
I don't mind.

216
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,680
I've been meaning to ask you.

217
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,040
You said the tavern

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,640
is a family heritage,

219
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,760
why don't you manage it properly?

220
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,000
It isn't where my aspiration lies.

221
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,320
And this tavern

222
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,320
can't help fulfill my aspiration.

223
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,600
Plus, I hate drinking alcohol.

224
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,720
You never drink?

225
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,720
My grandparents and parents

226
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,000
made their living
through winemaking.

227
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,560
I learned winemaking from them
since I was little.

228
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
When I was older,

229
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,280
I became their wine-taster.

230
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,120
But I never tasted any good wine.

231
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,560
It was either sour

232
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,920
or extremely bitter.

233
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,920
I never tasted the so-called

234
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,080
sweetness in wine.

235
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,280
No.

236
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
Five-addictive Wine is sweet.

237
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,040
I mean…

238
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,720
Five days.

239
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Five days later,

240
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,920
you'll get some sweet liquor.

241
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,960
What I'm trying to say is,

242
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,040
five days later,

243
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,640
you'll finish your dance lessons.

244
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,280
By then, I'll have a way

245
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
for you to realize your dream

246
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,880
in this tavern.
