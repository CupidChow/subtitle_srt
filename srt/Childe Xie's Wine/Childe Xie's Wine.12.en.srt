It's your own choice.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,920
Even if you'll look like a monster,
you'll have to deal with it.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,280
Please enjoy.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,720
Miss Meng,

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,160
look. I've got some

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,440
Shao's Crabs for you.

10
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:40,749
Em,

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,000
you leave them there.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,840
I'll have some when I'm not busy.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,040
(Wuti Tavern)

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,240
Dinner's ready.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,520
We've made some good money,

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,920
so I've cooked some fine dishes.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,040
Hurry. Dinner time.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,560
Check all the delicious dishes.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,760
Miss Meng, quickly, it's dinner time.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,160
I'm not hungry. You enjoy dinner.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
We can't finish all these?

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,240
Did you displease her?

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,000
She seems weird these days.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,080
Her bad mood has nothing
to do with my cousin.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,880
She's wearing a mask every day.

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,960
I guess she's got a cold.

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,360
She's got poor health.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,960
She's been here for several days,

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,640
and she's fallen ill quite some times.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,760
Come to think of it,

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,000
I got her

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,160
some Shao's Crabs.

33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
This size.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,320
She hasn't eaten any.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,120
She'd eat four in a row normally.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,600
Now that you mentioned it,

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,280
I think…

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,720
When I aired the cover yesterday,

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,680
I saw her.

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,840
She didn't wear a mask.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,600
But she ran off in a hurry
when she saw me.

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
She ran off?

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,680
Did she look odd?

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,960
She got some pimples on her face,

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,760
and her skin was not
as fair as before.

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
So making Five-addictive Wine

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,320
causes her to lose her fairy power

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
so that she can't maintain her look?

49
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,360
Hey.

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,600
Cousin.

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Yufan.

52
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,840
Do you still feel unwell?

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,960
I've got some food for you.

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Just eat some.

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,560
You can leave it at the door.

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,120
I'll eat it later.

57
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll leave it at the door, then.

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,960
You don't even want to see me?

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,360
It's not like that.

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,720
I just feel kind of sick.

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,920
You get some rest, then.

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm going to make
yeast rice tonight

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
and I come to ask for your help.

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
Now that you're tried,

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,920
I'll turn to Xiaotang for help.

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,120
I can.

67
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,160
What

68
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
are you doing?

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,920
Since we can't make Five-addictive Wine,

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,760
we'll have to be radical

71
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,240
and start from scratch.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,480
Start from scratch?

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
So my feet need to be washed?

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't get the logic.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
The first step of winemaking

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,960
is the making of yeast rice.

77
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,600
It's traditional

78
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,280
that women stomp
on the yeast rice.

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
Women and yeast rice
are both yin-natured

80
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
while men and sorghum
are both yang-natured.

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,080
So women stomp on the yeast rice

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,640
and men drop the sorghum

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,600
to achieve the combination
of yin and yang

84
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,280
to meet the yin-yang
and five-element standard.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,160
So it has to be me for doing this?

86
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,560
When I was little,

87
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,680
I often saw my mother stomp on
the yeast rice in the backyard.

88
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
The harder you stomp,

89
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,680
the more compacted the rice
and wheat are, the better.

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,480
But I never stomped on
any yeast rice before.

91
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,240
You just entrust

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,560
me with yourself.

93
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,240
I'll hold you.

94
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,840
Like you're taking steps,

95
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,800
you stomp on it hard.

96
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,440
Like this?

97
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,160
Yufan, I'll sleep here tonight.

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,200
I'll add the red yeast rice
tomorrow morning after I get up.

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,520
You go to sleep in your room.

100
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,120
What's the matter with you?

101
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,200
Is something troubling you?

102
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,800
Nothing.

103
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,760
You've been depressed,

104
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,120
and kept hiding from everybody.

105
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,600
I've kept a distance

106
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,040
from Xiaotang intentionally lately.

107
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,760
I don't think

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,440
I did anything wrong, right?

109
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,840
Relax.

110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,920
It's just it's been busy in the tavern,

111
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
and I've got a little tired.

112
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,400
You get some proper rest
in the following days,

113
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,960
I'll do the work.

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,960
The stars are so beautiful.

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Back in my place,

116
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,320
we don't get to see these stars.

117
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,480
Everybody is fast-paced

118
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,080
and busy.

119
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,040
They hide their emptiness inside

120
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
with the indifferent look
on their faces.

121
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Colorful lights illuminate in the city,

122
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,320
but there's no star in the sky.

123
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,720
The stars here feel so real.

124
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,400
The people, too.

125
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,480
I don't know

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
if it's a dream

127
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,400
or reality.

128
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,480
Too bad,

129
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,640
I'm only a shooting star.

130
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,680
I'm only a passer-by

131
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,320
in your life.

132
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,880
I lied to you.

133
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,120
I have an ordinary face,

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,640
and I don't belong here.

135
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,080
I can't let you see

136
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,400
my real face.

137
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm afraid.

138
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,280
I'm scared.

139
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,640
Let's treat it like a dream.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,120
Once we wake up,

141
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,760
our life paths

142
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,520
won't be crossed again.

143
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,600
Forgive me, Xie Xun.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,280
Forget me, please.
