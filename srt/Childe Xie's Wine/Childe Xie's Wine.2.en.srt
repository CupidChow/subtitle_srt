=Episode 2=

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,600
What happened back there?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,760
Was it a dream?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,880
Or a game?

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,440
Or I traveled back in time?

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,040
It was neither of them.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,320
It is your heart-world.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,240
Xie Tuisi?

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,640
You brought me here?

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,080
You wished for a pretty face,

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,360
and a sweet relationship, right?

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,680
Are you willing to let me

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
fulfill your wishes?

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,000
Can you?

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,040
As long as you believe

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,880
that all this is real,

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,280
then your dreams will come true.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,200
Drink a cup of wine

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,280
in every 12 hours

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,480
to maintain your pretty face.

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,360
The sun is out,
but you're sleeping still?

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,600
Get up and get to work!

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,840
I've checked.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
Other than this black thing,

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,240
you've got nothing on you.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,520
But you broke my cousin's vase,

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,440
so you have to pay for it.

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,680
Hurry, start working!

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,760
Washing dishes, sweeping the ground,
chopping the firewood.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,240
The work won't be done by itself.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,680
When your question

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,120
is answered,

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,320
you'll be able to return

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,480
to your world.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,160
I can go back
once the question is answered?

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,480
Is this really me?

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,880
I'm much prettier.

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,560
So…

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,400
Now that I'm pretty,

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,440
next thing will be…

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,600
A romantic relationship?

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
I warn you.

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,360
Get your dirty thoughts
out of your mind.

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,200
If you dare

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
to grow feelings for my cousin,

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,080
I swear I'll…

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,600
Wait a minute!

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,920
I'll go to work.

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,160
At the time,

51
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,000
Shaolin, Wudang, Emei, Kongtong,

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,440
Mount Hua, Mount Song,
South Mount Heng, North Mount Heng,

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,800
Mount Tai, Qingcheng,
Quanzhen, Shushan,

54
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
five mountains and eight sects

55
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,720
got me surrounded.

56
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,200
I cast Water-moon Out of the Cave,

57
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,160
and in an instant…

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,080
Feng. Feng.

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,160
I heard you mention 13 sects?

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,320
It doesn't matter.

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,720
I was cornered.

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,960
I was in peril.

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,400
Chu'er and I

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,200
were driven to the cliff…

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,360
Feng,

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,280
I know the rest.

67
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,280
In order to keep Chu'er safe,

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,440
you chose to be held hostage.

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,240
You then fought them
for seven days and nights.

70
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,800
In desperation, you cast
Water-moon Out of the Cave

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
as you were ready to die with them.

72
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,600
At last, you fell off the cliff
and staggered to this place.

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,920
That's why I find it interesting

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,120
to chat with you, Murong.

75
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,880
Here's a toast to you.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,080
A good chat over a cup of wine.

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,520
Such a wonderful thing in life.

78
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,760
But the wine alone

79
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,800
is kind of tedious.

80
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
If there were some dishes,

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,920
that would be…

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,880
I got it.

83
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,440
Wait a minute.

84
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,640
Feng,

85
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,160
you've seen the world.

86
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,560
Hence,

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,840
I'd like to show you something.

88
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,800
What is it?

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,480
Let me see.

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,680
Do the work

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,960
or eat the chip.

92
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,720
Feng,

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
you know the words?

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,840
These are like small gold bars.

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,920
It may be royal property.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,320
How did you get it?

97
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,200
I… Yesterday, I was…

98
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,040
I was tidying things up,

99
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,480
and it fell to the ground.

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
I saw one was open.

101
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,360
And it smelled so good.

102
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,160
But I didn't dare to eat it.

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,280
The paper bag felt…

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,840
So soft,

105
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,880
but it wouldn't be torn.

106
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,080
It's just amazing,

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,120
so I put it away.

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,400
Royal property

109
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,680
isn't something that we civilians

110
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
get to comprehend.

111
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,240
Just put it back where you found it.

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,360
Those are my chips.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,160
They took them away, too?

114
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,440
Fortunately, I got my cellphone back.

115
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,440
I have to work to pay for the vase?

116
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,360
Then I won't be able
to have a relationship.

117
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,680
No.

118
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,640
I need to go out and find my love.

119
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,280
Could you watch the road?

120
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,640
Xie Tuisi?

121
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,880
It feels so familiar.

122
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,240
I can't be mistaken.

123
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,960
What's your name?

124
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,440
Meng.

125
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,320
Meng Xiaofan.

126
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,040
My name is too lame
for this pretty face.

127
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,280
I'm Meng Yufan.

128
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,160
Nice to see you.

129
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,080
What is he going to do?

130
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,400
Here we go. Here we go.

131
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,120
I don't need to go out?
