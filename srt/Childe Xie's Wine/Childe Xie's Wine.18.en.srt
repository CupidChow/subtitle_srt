00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,840
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,560
Xie Tuisi!

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,360
Why is this happening?

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,880
Why are you so cruel?

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,760
Mr. Zong,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,320
why is it you?

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,800
Looks like your mission

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,040
will be completed.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,320
Only when I enter the Spring

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,120
and return to 2021

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,600
can the Spring well up water

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
and can Five-additive Wine be made,

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,160
right?

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,480
Why?

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,000
Why is there such a cruel rule?

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,520
Who on earth

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,080
is making the rule?

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,360
I came to this place without a reason.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
When I'm in love with a man,

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm now asked to leave.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
You can also stay,

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,120
just like me.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,680
But when you fail
to make Five-additive Wine,

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,600
you have to bear the consequences
with Xie Xun.

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
What will you do?

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,680
You make the decision.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,080
I don't want to go back.

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,000
I have a sweetheart here

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,000
and I have friends

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,320
that I've never had before.

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,320
I'm living a very happy life here.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,360
But I don't want Xie Xun to be executed.

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,000
What do I do?

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,440
Meng Yufan,

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
you've grown up.

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,640
For the rest of your life, you'll face

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,480
countless dilemmas.

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,680
Maybe this is the meaning

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,840
of your trip to this place.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,920
To depart is easier than to meet.

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,040
Flowers fade when spring is gone.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,160
Two worlds are far apart.

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,880
Yufan,

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
why are you here?

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,480
Go back home.

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,640
We're holding dinner for you.

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,680
I don't want you to feel sad as I do.

49
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,120
Nor do I want you to see

50
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,360
how embarrassed I am.

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,280
I hope

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
before I leave,

53
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,640
we can create some memories

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,760
that are beautiful enough

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,200
to support us

56
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,480
when we're apart.

57
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,680
What's wrong?

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,200
Tomorrow,

59
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,640
shall we go out for fun?

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,880
Are you ready to go?

61
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,640
Are you sure we're going out for fun

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,520
instead of making wine today?

63
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,920
We're not going to make wine today.

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
Forget about the spring thing.

65
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,640
Go.

66
00:03:42,294 --> 00:03:48,661
♪Snow over a thousand years

68
00:03:56,084 --> 00:04:02,855
♪Maybe in my dream

70
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,978

00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:22,324
♪Wine frozen over a thousand years

72
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,440
Two bowls of sesame paste for you.

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,200
Thank you.

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,320
Enjoy your meal.

75
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,800
How do you know I like sesame paste?

76
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
I asked Xiaotang about it.

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,000
She said when you were little,

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,280
you loved to eat sesame paste.

79
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,680
But you were so naughty

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,160
that you always got the paste
on your face.

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,960
You often received a beating for that.

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
Then you seldom ate any.

83
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,760
It was a long time ago

84
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,560
and I nearly forgot it.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,640
It doesn't matter.

86
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,720
Now,

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,080
you can eat as much as you want,

88
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,040
even if you get it all over your face.

89
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Why don't you eat any?

90
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
Is it the taste of your childhood?

91
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,960
Yufan,

92
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,080
I have a present for you.

93
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,440
This hairpin is

94
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,000
what my mother left me.

95
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,240
She asked me

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,480
to give this hairpin

97
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,040
to my future wife.

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,040
Does it look good on me?

99
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,840
Yes.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,680
Let's get back home.

101
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,000
I asked Murong to make a lot of dishes.

102
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,800
Let's hurry, or we'll be late.

103
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,200
Go.

104
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,880
I won't give the umbrella to you.

105
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,840
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

106
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,600
Come on. Help yourselves.

107
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,240
Let me taste the dishes.

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,400
Well done, Shang.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
You cook so well

110
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,440
that you can even recruit disciples.

111
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,880
I also think I can have disciples.

112
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,560
Actually, my greatest desire is

113
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,720
to teach people to cook.

114
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,160
After the wine is made,

115
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,680
let's do it, then.

116
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,600
What about you, Xiaotang?

117
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
I don't have

118
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,400
a great ambition.

119
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,000
I just want to have my own family.

120
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,280
Say something, Shang.

121
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,680
You... You'll have it.

122
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,160
What about you, Xun?

123
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,080
Is your dream to extend the stage?

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,680
No.

125
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,120
What is it, then?

126
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,640
I also want

127
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,040
a family.

128
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,120
Do you want it?

129
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,240
Miss Meng.

130
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,920
Don't be shy.

131
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,680
After the wine is made,

132
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,360
let's build our families.

133
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,800
Come on. Cheers.

134
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,120
Right.

135
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,400
Let's do it.

136
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,840
Come on.

137
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,760
Cheers.

138
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,960
But what if

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,960
we can't make the wine?

140
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,760
Don't be discouraged, will you?

141
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,000
Now that you feel so hopeless,

142
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,120
let me tell you the truth.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
Actually,

144
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,040
I've contacted the Third Princess.

145
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,640
So, don't worry too much.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
Maybe when you wake up,

147
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,080
you'll see the spring water.

148
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,080
I knew it.

149
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
I knew you were kidding me yesterday.

150
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,080
I knew you could contact her.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,520
Come on.

152
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,920
Cheers.

153
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,040
Now you can rest assured, right?

154
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,440
I have

155
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,040
a small present for you.

156
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,000
Wait for me.

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,720
Xiaotang, it's for you.

158
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,360
You're outwardly firm
but inwardly gentle.

159
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,320
I hope in the future,

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,720
you can have enough confidence

161
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,920
and live a wonderful life.

162
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,840
Besides,

163
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,200
you've already got a sweetheart.

164
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,560
Stop beating people.

165
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,760
It hurts.

166
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,920
I'll try not to beat people.

167
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,760
And this...

168
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,880
It's a collection of recipes.

169
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,920
Shang, it's for you.

170
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,360
It contains

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
the recipes of delicious dishes

172
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,320
I've ever tasted.

173
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,000
May you become

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,280

and have a chubby son

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,880
as strong and loyal as you.

177
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,800
Yufan,

178
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,880
rest assured.

179
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,600
When we have a son,

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,960

the chef of Wuti Tavern.

182
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,680
The chopsticks are for you.

183
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,240
Happy chopsticks.

184
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,320
They refer to

185
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,640
being happy.

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,920
Use them to taste the wine.

187
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Hope you'll be happy every single day

188
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,320
in the future.

189
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,720
Take them.

190
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,800
That's all?

191
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,520
You've got nothing else to say?

192
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I'm just giving you a present.

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,320
Haven't I said enough?

194
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,680
What else do you expect to hear?

195
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,600
Miss Meng,

196
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
why did you suddenly give us presents?

197
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
It's weird.

198
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah.

199
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,680
It's weird. Really weird.

200
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,520
Meng Yufan,

201
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
are you keeping something from us?

202
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,040
No.

203
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,640
What can I keep from you?

204
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,040
I just want to make you happy

205
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,280
by giving you some presents.

206
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,040
Xiaotang, I've thought of a new game.

207
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,960
Shall I teach you?

208
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,360
Sure.

209
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,800
Shall we play?

210
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,760
You've never played this game before.

211
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,040
Here's a large grassland.

212
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
Let's catch sheep.

213
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,600
One, two, three, four, five.

214
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,360
One.

215
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,080
Watch again.

216
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,120
Here's a large grassland.

217
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,600
