3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,840
Does it feel good to be pretty?

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,120
But soon, I'll regress.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,880
What do I do to maintain the face?

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,600
Find Five-additive Wine.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,200
Don't go.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,800
I have a question for you.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,560
I'm not going anywhere.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,200
I've been waiting for you.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
What are you doing in my room?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,040
Ask yourself.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,640
You've been holding my hand
since last night,

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,360
forbidding me from leaving.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,680
And…

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,400
Last night?

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,600
What happened last night?

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,520
Did we…

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,880
What you did last night

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,120
was eye-opening.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,160
I think I've found a treasure.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
So…

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,920
So

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,560
I'd like

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,440
to ask you this bold question.

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,360
Could you…

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,480
What?

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,960
What is he going to do?

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,760
Is he going to propose to me?

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,120
But I'm not ready.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,240
Did...

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
we do that thing

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,560
last night?

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,960
(Application for Mentorship)

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,400
Please

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
accept me as your student!

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,480
What?

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
I'll be honest with you.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,040
I don't go to the House of Art

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,560
to see the girls.

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,760
I just want to learn

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,840
their singing and dance skills.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,000
It wasn't until

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
I saw your performance last night

45
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,400
did I know

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,280
that they are nothing

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,600
in comparison with you.

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,280
So why don't I learn
from a good teacher around me?

49
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,800
When I saw you for the first time,

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,680
my heart raced

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
like I had cardiac disease.

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,120
Saw me for the first time?

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,080
It's a wonderful night.

54
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,040
Let's take a picture.

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,360
What is this glowing

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,160
little box?

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,400
A cellphone.

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
What is a cellphone?

59
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,400
How come we're in it

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
but not so quite?

61
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,280
Don't be daft.

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,120
It's a cellphone.

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,840
Just treat it like a mirror.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,560
Come on. Come on.

65
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,640
Mirror? Mirror?

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,960
Come and take a picture.

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,880
Mirror?

68
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,360
Say cheese.

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
So

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,120
he just wants to learn
how to dance from me.

71
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
Meng Xiaofan,
you were being delusional.

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
So,

73
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,960
what's in it for me?

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,920
You'll get paid for sure.

75
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,520
And the broken vase,

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720
we'll write it off.

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Write it off?

78
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,960
This is good.

79
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,520
And

80
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,960
once I'm Xie Xun's tutor,

81
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,400
I can stay by his side.

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
It'll be easy for me
to steal Five-addictive Wine.

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,600
She'll name a big price.

84
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
It's obvious that she is
a greedy woman.

85
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,400
But

86
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,360
as long as

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,920
she's willing to teach me the skills,

88
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,960
it's all worthwhile.

89
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,440
To show my sincerity,

90
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,960
I'll leave the blank lines

91
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,760
in our contract.

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
If you agree to tutor me,

93
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,000
you can fill in whatever you like.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
But I'll make one thing clear.

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
This tavern

96
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,040
is a family heritage.

97
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
The treasure of our family

98
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,080
is the Five-addictive Wine
made by my grandfather.

99
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,640
The winemaking method

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,960
is not to be known by others.

101
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,280
You can choose anything else

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
that your eyes can see.

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
Deal.

104
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,720
Cousin.

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,360
Teacher.

106
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,560
Cousin.

107
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
Do I

108
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,560
have to do this?

109
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
It is your fingerprint

110
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,520
on the paper.

111
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Plus,

112
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm only trying to maximize

113
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,560
the effect of your practice.

114
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,720
With all the clothes on,

115
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,320
how do I observe

116
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,440
the movements of your muscle?

117
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,800
Gosh.

118
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,560
Do I get to see such a beautiful scene

119
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,280
for free?

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,800
No, no, no.

121
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,280
I need to be serious.

122
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:34,597
Um…

123
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,400
No, no.

124
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,880
Your hands.

125
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
You're doing it wrong.

126
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,080
They…

127
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,920
Your hands…

128
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,520
They…

129
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,480
Your arms…

130
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,400
You need

131
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,240
to try your best to…

132
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,600
Open your arms.

133
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,520
Teacher.

134
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,240
My foot…

135
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,880
It hurts…

136
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,052
Um…

137
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,120
Stop dancing.

138
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,920
Fulfill your

139
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
second duty.

140
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,800
Yes.

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,320
It hurts.

142
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,560
This is the first time I do this.

143
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,200
I'll try another spot.

144
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,840
My student.

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,720
You need to change your name.

146
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
Or it'll be awkward for your fans

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
to support you.

148
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,680
They can't hold a board

149
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
with "Xun" on it, can they?

150
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,920
That would be lame.

151
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
You need a stage name.

152
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,840
But I am Xun.

153
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,080
How can you belittle yourself?

154
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,480
My father gave me the name

155
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,920
hoping that I'd be

156
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,120
polite and modest.

157
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,200
And that's

158
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,000
what I've been trying to live up to.

159
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,400
I'd like

160
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,560
to be more and more humble.

161
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,680
No, no, no.

162
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,480
You can be humble

163
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
when doing something else.

164
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,640
On the stage,

165
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
you have to be dynamic.

166
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,320
Do you feel me?

167
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
I've made my decision.

168
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,120
From today on, your name will be...

169
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,840
