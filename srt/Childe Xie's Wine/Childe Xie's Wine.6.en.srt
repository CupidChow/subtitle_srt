=Episode 6=

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,440
Am I going

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,240
to have my first kiss?

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,320
You had a drink?

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,400
I...

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
I had a bowl of rice balls
in sweet wine.

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,560
Don't lie.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,240
I know you love drinking wine.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,160
As long as you don't get sick

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,960
or get hammered,

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,320
you can enjoy some wine.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,880
Luckily, he doesn't know
how Five-additive Wine tastes.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,640
Actually,

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,400
wine brings a lot of inspiration.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,040
Like I said,

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm going to realize your dream

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,720
in this tavern.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,760
Would you like a try?

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,480
What will you do?

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,080
It's a surprise.

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,280
I won't tell you now.

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,960
Oh, Meng Yufan.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,520
She's even more unpredictable
than the weather.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,360
(Tomorrow night, Xie Tingfeng will
give a performance at Wuti Tavern.)

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,155
Who's this man?

27
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:26,320
So cool.

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,880
Cousin.

29
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:28,160
He looks so handsome.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,280
I'm going right away to buy you

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,520
some new clothes and pom-poms.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,880
Slow down.

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
Is that the surprise
you prepared for me?

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,400
What do you think?

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,800
The poster looks good, doesn't it?

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,680
I spent the whole night

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,520
painting it.

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,040
Why did you arrange a performance

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,920
without my permission?

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,320
This isn't a surprise,

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,280
but a shock!

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,680
I won't perform.

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,560
You have to.

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,080
Why do you learn to sing and dance?

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
Just to dance in your room

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,920
for the mirror and yourself?

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,320
You'll perform to the audience
sooner or later.

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,960
You're going to do that one day.

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,800
But I'm not ready.

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,200
You're already doing a great job.

51
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,120
Don't worry.

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,480
You have me. Don't be worried.

53
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
It's not that I have
no confidence in you.

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,320
I just have no confidence in myself.

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,560
Stop bothering about it.

56
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,840
I'll tell you after I'm ready.

57
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Xie Xun. Xie Xun!

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Man!

59
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,600
You made me do this!

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm done. It's your turn.

61
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,840
You!

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,920
Meng Yufan!

63
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,880
How dare you drug me!

64
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,640
You used such a dirty trick

65
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,880
when I was sleeping.

66
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,280
You're so mean!

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
You're shameless!

68
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,320
Let go of me!

69
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
Today,

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,240
I'll make you get out

71
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
of your comfort zone,

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,720
overcome your psychological barriers,

73
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,600
and perform on the stage bravely.

74
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,680
You're my student.

75
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,480
You have to be the most stylish singer!

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,120
Let go of me!

77
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Let go of me!

78
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,840
What do you want to do?

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
Keep cool.

80
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,960
Why have you prepared so much wine?

81
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,160
Today,

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,760
I'll let you know

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,160
that all difficulties

84
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,360
can be overcome.

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,520
You must learn

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,240
to overcome the devil inside you.

87
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,920
Here.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,640
Drink it up.

89
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,240
Do it!

90
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,440
How does it taste?

91
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
Bitter.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,560
Bitter?

93
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,480
Stay away. Stay away from me!

94
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
I don't want it.

95
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,040
Don't try to dodge!

96
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,040
How does it taste?

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,920
Sour.

98
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,840
Sour?

99
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
Spicy.

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,720
Salty.

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,600
Hot.

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,360
Stinky.

103
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,960
Meng Yufan!

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,400
My heart beats so fast.

105
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,880
Listen.

106
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,400
Listen.

107
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
All right, then.

108
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,320
I won't make you drink the last one.

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
No way! I'll drink it!

110
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,120
You...

111
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,240
It's...

112
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,600
Why is it...?

113
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,360
So beautiful.

114
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,040
What did you say?

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
I said...

116
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,000
You...

117
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,800
Ah, no, no.

118
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,880
I mean the wine...

119
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,280
So sweet.

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,840
It tastes so sweet.

121
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Xie Xun,

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,640
you finally tasted the sweet wine.

123
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,080
I don't know whether it's the wine...

124
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,960
Or...

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,160
Or...

126
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,520
Or whether it's you
that makes my heart beat so fast.

127
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:15,821
Here he comes.

128
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:16,972
He'll perform immediately.

129
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:18,637
Here he comes.

130
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:19,577
