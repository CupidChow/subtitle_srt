131

I also have some new understandings

135
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,240
about making wine.

136
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,040
Simply after smelling,

137
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,160

138

139
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,440

140
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,600
the acidity and water content.

141
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,160

142

Because of you,

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,560

just like the wine!

148
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440

149

can always accompany you,

150
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,960
