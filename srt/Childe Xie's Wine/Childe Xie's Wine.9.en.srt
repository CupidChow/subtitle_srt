=Episode 9=

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,240
Good. Good.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,000
The strips are crispy, but not greasy.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,440
They have a nice aftertaste, too.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,640
And they...

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,240
My Lord, they're chips.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,880
The strips taste so good.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,640
What are they made of?

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,960
For your information,

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,120
the strips are

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,720
made of potatoes.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,880
Simple potatoes

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,000
can be made into such delicious food.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,360
Impressive.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,000
Make some more for me.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,760
I'll take them back for my wife.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,560
Thank you for the compliment.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,640
I've already prepared some for you.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,160
It's considerate of you.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,800
I nearly forgot the business.

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,840
An oral instruction from His Majesty.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,640
The eighth month of this year

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,840
will be His Majesty's birthday.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,480
Wuti Tavern is hereby ordered

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,360
to offer ten jars of Five-additive Wine

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,320
in three months.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,880
Respect this.

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,720
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,200
You may rise.

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,600
Hope you'll do a good job.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,640
Yes, My Lord.

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,320
Don't tarnish

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,040
the reputation of your tavern.

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,440
I'll take my leave.

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,240
Ten jars.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,320
Ten jars of Five-additive Wine.

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,960
How can we offer so many jars
to His Majesty?

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
Don't panic.

40
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,120
There's some in the cellar, isn't there?

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,240
Only one jar.

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,080
It's made by your grandfather.

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,440
Even your father failed to make any.

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,880
My father failed,
but it doesn't mean I can't make it.

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,400
You can make it?

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,440
You can sing and dance.

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,680
But you can't make wine.

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,000
I can't make wine?

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,320
Stop quarreling.

50
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,560
We have one jar, right?

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,480
You haven't tasted it before.

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
Shall we go taste it

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,880
and try to make some?

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,040
Look, she's always reliable.

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,800
Let's get to the cellar immediately.

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,480
She's reliable, not you.

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,760
Are you sure

58
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,800
this is the jar of Five-additive Wine?

59
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm sure.

60
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,200
Why is it empty, then?

61
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,080
Did you drink it on the sly?

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
How is that possible?

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,040
Did Fengren drink it?

64
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,480
He doesn't even know
where the cellar is.

65
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,400
Then you stole it for him.

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,600
Don't think I didn't see that.

67
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,200
You always let him drink on credit

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
and offer good dishes to him

69
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,960
so that he can tell you some stories.

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,200
You...

71
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,080
Come on, girl.

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,520
Why don't you suspect your cousin?

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,040
He doesn't drink.

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,240
If you didn't steal the wine,

75
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,520
someone else did.

76
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,600
Who?

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,760
Meng Yufan.

78
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
It must be her.

79
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,920
She hasn't been seen all day.

80
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,600
She must be hiding out of guilt.

81
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,440
Xiaotang, don't talk nonsense

82
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,360
without evidence.

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah.

84
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,720
Yufan wouldn't do such a thing.

85
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,760
She cares a lot for our tavern,

86
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,400
doesn't she?

87
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,560
She wouldn't steal our treasure.

88
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,560
I also told her

89
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,240
that Five-additive Wine is
of vital importance.

90
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,120
She isn't an unruly girl.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,080
You're just bewitched

92
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,520
by that seductive girl.

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,880
Stop it.

94
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,880
Who stole the wine no longer matters.

95
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,600
Without it, I just can't make more.

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I tasted Five-additive Wine
when I was little.

97
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,360
But I don't remember its taste now.

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
It's a capital crime
when we can't provide the wine.

99
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,120
You'd better leave early.

100
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,280
What about you?

101
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,040
Wuti Tavern is my family business.

102
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,480
In case of any problem,

103
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,800
I'll take responsibility alone.

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm not leaving.

105
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,920
Fine. Very well.

106
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,840
Under such circumstances,

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,720
I won't be dramatic.

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,480
I'm still young.

109
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,040
I don't want to die here with you.

110
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,600
See you.

111
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,600
Murong.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Meng Yufan, come out!

113
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
Why are you wearing a veil?

114
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,280
I feel unwell.

115
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,440
Tell me!

116
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,200
Did you drink up

117
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,160
Five-additive Wine in the cellar?

118
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,280
No.

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
I hope you didn't.

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
Otherwise, you'll be

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
killing my cousin.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,560
And I won't forgive you all my life.

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,120
What happened?

124
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,720
A lord from the Brewing Bureau
came today.

125
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,720
If we can't offer
ten jars of Five-additive Wine,

126
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,400
we'll be executed.

127
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
Cousin has decided

128
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
to take responsibility alone.

129
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,440
Get packed and leave.

130
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,440
What are you hesitating for?

131
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
You've got everything you expected

132
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,360
only because of your face.

133
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,040
Think about your original ugly face.

134
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,920
Can Xie Xun kiss it?

135
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,800
You've already got him in danger.

136
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,600
How dare you still drink the wine?

137
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,760
It's like a Pandora's box.

138
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,320
Just close the box.

139
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,040
Are you going to deceive Xie Xun
all your life?

140
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
But...

141
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,520
I really don't want to lose him.

142
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,880
Then do you want Xie Xun,

143
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,640
Xiaotang, and Murong to be killed?

144
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,160
Don't exaggerate it.

145
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,200
He can make more wine.

146
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,120
But what can you do

147
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,720
to get such a beautiful face?

148
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,040
Stop deceiving her.

149
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,440
A beautiful face is important.

150
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,000
But being a kind person

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,840
can be more important.

152
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,360
Besides, I don't think
I'm worse than you.

153
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,840
Ask yourself.

154
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
Don't you want to be me?

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,400
When you become me,

156
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,080
you'll own everything you have now.

157
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,280
And you'll have Xie Xun.

158
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,520
But when you're only yourself,

159
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,080
you'll have nothing.

160
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,360
Enough!

161
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Who's that?

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,040
It's me.

163
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,680
I didn't see you today.

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,040
Are you all right?

165
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,240
Yufan,

166
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,680
I made some dishes for you.

167
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,000
If it's not convenient for you,

168
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,200
I'll put them outside your room.

169
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,280
Take some rest first.

170
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,240
Wait a minute.

171
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
What's wrong with you?

172
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe

173
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,400
I caught a cold
because of the strong wind last night.

174
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,920
I cough a little.

175
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,480
If you haven't decided to accept me,

176
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,680
it doesn't matter.

177
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,440
I came

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,480
to talk with you about it.

179
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,080
You get it wrong.

180
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,240
I just don't want to get you sick.

181
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm not afraid of that.

182
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,080
You have a cold.

183
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,400
Such dishes are too greasy.

184
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,560
I'll go make some porridge for you.

185
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,720
Wait here for me.

186
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,960
There's only one jar left.

187
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,160
If I don't return it to Xie Xun,

188
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
he'll be executed.

189
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,360
But he didn't ask about it at all.

190
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,720
I won't let him die.
