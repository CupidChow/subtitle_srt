=Childe Xie's Wine=

00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,840
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,120
Are you really leaving?

4
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,680
Only when I leave

5
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,520
can you and the others

6
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,960
be saved.

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,560
I don't understand.

8
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,840
I don't understand your point.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,160
It's Murong's fault.

10
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,680
He keeps telling

11
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,960
ridiculous stories.

12
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,120
But he's right

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,320
about one thing.

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,560
Only when the Third Princess
returns to Heaven

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,040
will there be a good rain

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,760
so that everybody can be saved.

17
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,760
Yufan,

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,480
you don't believe that legend, do you?

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,440
All legends are made up.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
I have to believe it.

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,720
No.

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,320
No.

23
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,200
That's impossible.

24
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,600
Yufan.

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,520
Yufan, trust me.

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,480
Trust me.

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,080
We'll think of another way.

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
Give me some time, will you?

29
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,680
Trust me. We'll think of another way.

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,480
Yufan!

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,880
Don't leave me.

32
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,240
All right.

33
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,400
Stop crying.

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,680
You look ugly.

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,480
Promise me one thing.

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
When I'm away,

37
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,760
you mustn't look at other girls

38
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,240
or visit the Art Service anymore.

39
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,040
Do you hear me?

40
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,080
I promise you.

41
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,000
I promise you.

42
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,760
I'll promise you anything.

43
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
I'll promise you anything.

44
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,840
When you're away?

45
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,920
What does it mean?

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,720
It means

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,640
I'll come back.

48
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,720
The century-old tree
beside the Duck's Egg Spring

49
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,040
is said to be planted

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,800
by the Third Princess of the East Sea.

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,680
Local fishermen

52
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,360
fish for a living for generations.

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
This tree

54
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,800
is like a bright lamp

55
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,760
that shows the way back

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,680
to people from afar.

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,840
What does it mean?

58
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,920
People from afar.

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
The way back.

60
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,040
Are you saying

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
that the tree can get you back?

62
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,840
I'll bury the presents you gave me

63
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,960
under the tree

64
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,480
so that I can trace them down

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,840
and return to this place.

66
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,640
I had planned

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,880
to take away the memories

68
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,440
of us.

69
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,400
But now,

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
I have to deceive you again.

71
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,360
Do you remember

72
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,720
when I saw you dance in the bathroom

73
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,960
for the first time?

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,720
After that,

75
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,480
you forced me

76
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,640
to listen to your secrets.

77
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,520
(Invitation of Mastership)
Then you made me your master.

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,760
"Please accept me as your student!"

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,320
And this...

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,960
You gave me the lip balm

81
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,120
after I stopped drinking
Five-additive Wine

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,680
and then lost my beautiful face.

83
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,440
You accepted me

84
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,000
and encouraged me

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,520
so that I regained confidence.

86
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,680
The lip balm is

87
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,240
of great sentimental value.

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,560
The cups are more important.

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,360
They're the first present

90
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,080
I've ever received from a male

91
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
other than my father.

92
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
They even make a pair.

93
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,360
I really love them.

94
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,000
To be honest,

95
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
I don't want to leave them here.

96
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,720
Can you really come back

97
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,600
by burying them here?

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,360
As long as I have hope in my heart,

99
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,520
my dream will come true.

100
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,160
That's how I came

101
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,280
all the way to this place

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,480
and found you.

103
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,480
Right?

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,800
Oh, come on.

105
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,320
Tell me what you're going to do

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,560
after I come back.

107
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,960
I'll marry you

108
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,720
and make you the hostess of Wuti Tavern.

109
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,120
Fine.

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,440
Deal.

111
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
But under one condition.

112
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,200
When I'm away,

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,960
you must live a good life

114
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,200
and stay healthy.

115
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,280
You mustn't break down.

116
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,760
You should also
run Wuti Tavern carefully.

117
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
Then I'll carry forward

118
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
our dance

119
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,040
so that it'll become
the most popular live house

120
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,880
of the Wu Dynasty.

121
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,120
Good boy.

122
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,760
In this case,

123
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,600
when I'm back,

124
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,800
I'll have a lot of money

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,760
to burn

126
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
and a big house.

127
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,480
What's more...

128
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,040
More?

129
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,000
Of course.

130
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,760
How can a beautiful girl like me

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,240
marry you without preconditions?

132
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,120
You must propose to me.

133
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
Propose?

134
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,640
It means

135
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,480
when a man

136
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,880
wants to marry a woman,

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,240
he has to prepare a ring

138
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,280
so that the woman

139
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,960
will believe his promise.

140
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,440
It's actually a ritual.

141
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,560
Ring?

142
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,400
How can I get a ring?

143
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,640
I'll go prepare it.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,560
Ring...

145
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,080
Look.

146
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,080
Even if it's a blade of grass,

147
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,880
you can loop it into a ring.

148
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,400
Miss Meng, Miss Meng!

149
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,600
Look at the hamburger I've made.

150
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
(To Xie Xun)

151
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,280
Miss Meng has left.

152
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,480
I know.

153
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,840
She has left a letter to you.

154
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,240
Xie Xun,

155
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm glad to write to you.

156
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,600
After I leave,

157
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,760
I guess we'll never meet again.

158
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,160
Please forgive me for leaving
without saying goodbye.

159
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,800
It's not because I'm heartless,

160
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,080
but because

161
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,280
I have to leave hastily

162
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,280
so that my heart will hurt less.

163
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Thank you

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,960
for doing what I expected to do with me.

165
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,360
And thank you

166
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,200
for the days you've spent with me.

167
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,840
We're destined to be apart.

168
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,680
However,

169
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,080
we've spent some days together

170
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,560
that are worth remembering
for the rest of my life.

171
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,040
The Duck's Egg Spring is

172
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,480
no longer dry, I guess.

173
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
After Five-additive Wine is done,

174
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,200
drink some for me.

175
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,080
Don't doubt my love for you.

176
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,000
But we're people

177
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,040
from different worlds.

178
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,680
No matter how much we love each other,

179
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,600
we can't change our destiny.

180
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,440
So,

181
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,640
please do me a favor.

182
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,560
Forget me.

183
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,960
You deserve a girl

184
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,520
who loves you more than I do.

185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,560
With our memories,

186
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,560
I'll bravely face

187
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,200
my future life.

188
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,240
Don't be sad that I have to leave.

189
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
I want you

190
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,120
to live a happy life ever after.

191
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,480
