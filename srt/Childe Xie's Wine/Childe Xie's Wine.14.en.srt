00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,800
(Wuti Tavern)

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,640
Isn't she last year's

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,800
winner of Binhai Beauty Contest?

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,280
I heard she's a special judge this year.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,760
She's really beautiful.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560
Miss Du, your name
has long been heard.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,320
I heard that your skin is fair

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,400
and snow-white.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,800
And it appears to be true.

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,520
I always hold you in esteem.

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,640
I, too, want to compete
in Binhai Beauty Contest.

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
Do you think I have a chance?

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,360
Have some tea, please.

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,000
My premium brocade gown.

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,560
My dad got it for me

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,480
from Jiankang.

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,080
I'll wipe it for you.

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,080
Get lost.

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,200
Get your filthy hand off me.

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
How dare you hit me!

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,320
You deserve it.

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,160
Who the heck are you?

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,840
What did she do to you?

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,760
Why did you hit her?

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,880
She served you with so much respect.

28
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,360
Instead of saying thank you,

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,320
you looked for trouble.

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,120
I'll teach you a lesson.

31
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,840
Get here and apologize.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,920
Let go of me.

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,320
You two ugly women.

34
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,080
I was selected as a
royal concubine candidate this year.

35
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,840
If you do anything to me,

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,680
my dad will end your lives.

37
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,920
You two losers.

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm being bullied here.

39
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,560
Why are you still outside?

40
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,680
Back off!

41
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,040
I was ordered by His Majesty

42
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,480
to pay the tribute of wine

43
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,440
on his birthday.

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,480
If you dare to cause trouble
here at Wuti Tavern,

45
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,880
the tribute will be delayed.

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,280
Once your master

47
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,840
or the magistrate knows,

48
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,040
do you think you still get
to be a royal concubine?

49
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,520
You…

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
How dares to harm Xiaotang?

51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
I'll chop you up!

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,480
Where are you going? Stop!

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,920
Apologize to her!

54
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,360
Sorry.

55
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,120
Louder!

56
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,720
Sorry!

57
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,640
You happy?

58
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,040
Are you okay?

59
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,520
You're wearing light make-up,
aren't you?

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,720
Why would you need it?

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,800
I'm going to help Xiaotang
get her confidence back.

62
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,160
Like Xiaotang,

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,200
my face was mocked, too.

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,760
I didn't even have the guts
to show people my real face.

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,840
After you taught me
how to do make-up that day,

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,280
I realized

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,480
that I wasn't that ugly after all.

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
The make-up helps me
gain confidence,

69
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,000
and confidence is the best filter.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
Can you now get all the concerns

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
out of your mind

72
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,960
and stop keeping a distance from me?

73
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,440
Or

74
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,320
never disappear again.

75
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,640
It depends on

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,600
if you provide me with enough cosmetics.

77
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,840
If not,

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,240
I'll have to shop more.

79
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm going to buy all the cosmetics

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,720
for you for life.

81
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,160
What colors do you want?

82
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,720
Make a list.

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,560
I want the full set of Tom Ford.

84
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,880
I'm happy with today's color.

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,040
Are you here to tease me?

86
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you want to compete

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,480
in Binhai Beauty Contest or not?

88
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,560
This is made of centella.

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,080
It helps remove the bruise.

90
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
Apply it on your face three times a day,

91
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,400
and you'll be fine in two days.

92
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,720
Come on now,

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
get over it.

94
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,840
It's only two days,
and you can still make it.

95
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,840
I never said I'd go.

96
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,520
What?

97
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,880
A few harsh words of hers

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,040
crushed your confidence?

99
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,280
Meng Yufan,

100
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,640
Miss Du called

101
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,840
me ugly.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
What do you think of me?

103
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,680
Ignore her nonsense.

104
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,400
You're not ugly at all.

105
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,360
But I don't have a pretty face.

106
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,200
My fingernails are round.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,160
My fingers don't look nice, either.

108
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,480
What's the big deal?

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,200
Just a little bit of work,

110
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,680
and these problems will all be solved.

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,680
You have a way?

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,680
Leave it to me.

113
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,120
Keep your tummy in.

114
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,200
Lift your hips.

115
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,480
Keep a tight core.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,680
Follow me.

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,680
Breathe in.

118
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,640
Breathe out.

119
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,400
Breathe in.

120
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,520
Breathe out.

121
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Women are crazy.

122
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,200
They're willing to do anything
to get prettier.

123
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,880
Am I right, Murong Shang?

124
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,440
Now that you've learned
how to shape your body,

125
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,200
next, it's the make-up.

126
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,800
It's actually easier.

127
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,640
Here's a quatrain tip for you.

128
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,800
A light base makes you a fairy.

129
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Make sure the eyebrows
are rough and striking.

130
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,920
Keep the cheeks and lips the same color.

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,320
Facial features depend on the shading.

132
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,480
Come in.

133
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,720
Did you cast magic on her?

134
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,080
Let me have a look.

135
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,840
She's a different person now.

136
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,840
Having said that,

137
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,920
after taking a close look,

138
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,200
it's still her eyes,

139
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,840
still her nose,

140
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,520
still her mouth.

141
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,400
How did you pull it off?

142
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,520
Xiaotang is pretty without make-up.

143
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,560
I just highlighted her features.

144
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,600
I didn't completely

145
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,120
cover the freckles on your face

146
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,120
so that you look youthful and skittish.

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,480
Foreigners do freckle removal surgeries.

148
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,320
- Foreigner?
- Foreigner?

149
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,040
Em, I mean…

150
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,480
Westerners.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,560
See? I have freckles, too.

152
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,240
I now love my freckles.

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,120
After hearing so,

154
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
I feel like

155
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,880
I am quite pretty.

156
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,480
It's just that no one

157
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,840
discovered my beauty all along.

158
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,920
Ordinary girls

159
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,200
like me and Xiaotang,

160
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,120
we often lack confidence

161
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,040
because of how people see us.

162
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,400
We even feel stressed and lost.

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But

164
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
he's the one who told me

165
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,280
that everybody has

166
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,640
good qualities

167
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,520
and that we tend to

168
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,320
neglect these real and wonderful things.

169
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,720
When we confidently

170
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,520
show our good qualities,

171
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
you'll find out

172
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
that someone

173
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,920
in this world

It kind of tastes like brandy.

No, I didn't.
