=Episode 17=

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,120
Where's he?

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,240
Did he go to bed so early?

5
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,480
Yufan,

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,000
happy birthday.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,680
But today isn't my birthday.

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,440
I know today isn't your birthday.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,520
I just think

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,120
that I haven't been involved

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,280
in your previous life.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,600
I want to be with you
every single day of your life,

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,000
in the past,

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,440
at present,

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,800
and in the future.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,960
So,

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,960
today we're going to

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,440
celebrate the first twenty birthdays

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,840
of your life.

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
Is it

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,400
the sweet egg custard?

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Isn't it the cake?

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Tastes great.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
It's the most delicious cake

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,320
I've ever tasted.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm glad you like it.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,000
All right.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,160
You've tasted the cake.

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,160
Time to check your presents.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,720
Are these

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,280
all for me?

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,640
This is

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,000
for your twentieth birthday.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,920
That is

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,600
for your nineteenth birthday.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,600
The one beside it is

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,560
for your eighteenth birthday.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,360
Since I was born,

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,920
no one has given me so many presents,

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,680
except for my family.

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,600
These two wine cups

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,200
are the most important.

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,480
They're for your birthday this year.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,720
Xie Xun,

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,080
you're quite tricky now.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,120
You didn't drink any wine before.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,520
Now you've even bought wine cups.

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,760
Without the wine,

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,880
you wouldn't have come to me.

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Without the wine,

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
I wouldn't have been brave enough

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,160
to perform on the stage.

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
You let me know

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
that wine can also make someone

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,400
a nice person.

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,400
I hope you can live a better life here

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
than that in your previous world.

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,000
Humph.

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,840
Cousin,

60
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,240
the first barrel of pulp liquor
has been distilled.

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,400
So strong.

62
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Tastes good.

63
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
Mellow and sweet.

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,240
It's the pulp liquor
of Five-additive Wine.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
Really?

66
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,080
This is great.

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,720
What are we going to do, then?

68
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,960
We're going to blend the wine.

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,480
I remember what my father said.

70
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,360
Ten jars of wine require

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
five jars of additive water.

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,880
That's why

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,440
it's named Five-additive Wine.

74
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,840
Right.

75
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,080
Cousin said

76
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,960
that water was essential for wine.

77
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,560
Let's go find the water, then.

78
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,400
Up in the mountain,

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,880
there's a natural spring.

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,040
Shall we go have a try?

81
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,000
We've tried.

82
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,840
It's not the flavor
of Five-additive Wine, either.

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,240
Can it be the Duck's Egg Spring?

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,840
Duck's Egg Spring?

85
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,960
It sounds so familiar.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,880
Isn't it the holy spring of our town?

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
According to the legend,
the Third Princess brought the water

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
from the East Sea
and formed the Duck's Egg Spring.

89
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
Oh, I remember.

90
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,720
That's the right place.

91
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,800
When I was little, my parents

92
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,920
took me there to get water.

93
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,120
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.

94
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,480
Wait for me.

95
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,320
The Spring is dry.

96
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh, no.

97
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,880
Even God doesn't help us.

98
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,000
We'll be doomed.

99
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,400
We've been trying so hard
to make Five-additive Wine.

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
Do we have to give up now?

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,720
Quit such discouraging words.

102
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,400
What if

103
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,360
things aren't as terrible as we think?

104
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,360
Murong,

105
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,040
you're well-informed.

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,240
Go find out

107
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,480
when the Spring dried up

108
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,560
and where it originated.

109
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,000
All right.

110
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm on it.

111
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,080
Good job.

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,680
You've finally found
the Duck's Egg Spring.

113
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
But the Spring is dry.

114
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,200
There isn't even a single drop.

115
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,920
Because you still need

116
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,880
the last key procedure.

117
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,520
What procedure?

118
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,240
Me?

119
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,400
Meng Xiaofan,

120
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,240
time to make a decision.

121
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,080
I'll be waiting for you.

122
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,080
What does it mean

123
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,360
that I'm the last key procedure?

124
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,800
Can I summon the Spring?

125
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,960
What is the password?

126
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
There's even "open sesame"
for the treasure.

127
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Forget it.

128
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,480
Open sesame, spring out!

129
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,520
Forward this lucky charm

130
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,480
and all bad luck will be gone.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,760
Meng Yufan.

132
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,240
Miss Yufan,

133
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,080
could you do me a favor?

134
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,920
What is it?

135
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,920
Be seated first.

136
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,360
Let me tell you a story.

137
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,720
According to the legend,

138
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,480
a long time ago,

139
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,760
the Third Princess of the East Sea

140
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,640
swooshed

141
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,440
directly

142
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,680
to our town,

143
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,480
just like you.

144
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,800
You call it time...

145
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,440
Time-travel.

146
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,960
Yes, yes, time-travel.

147
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,880
After she came here
through the time-travel,

148
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,280
she fell in love with a mortal.

149
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,280
They two lived a happy life

150
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,720
ever after.

151
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,360
But later, there was a big drought
in the village.

152
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,680
Seeing that her husband

153
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,680
and other villagers would die of hunger,

154
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,600
the Third Princess sacrificed herself

155
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,520
by returning to where she came from

156
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,600
in exchange for a good rain

157
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,480
and then saved everyone.

158
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,880
I just want you to do me a favor.

159
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,640
Now that you also had a time-travel,

160
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,960
could you contact the Third Princess

161
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,280
so that she would also help us

162
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,000
get some spring water?

163
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,320
Shang,

164
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,560
coming to the mortal world
and having a time-travel

165
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,360
can be entirely different things.

166
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,000
Besides,

167
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,600
I don't have her contact information.

168
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,160
Sorry, but I can't help.

169
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,560
It doesn't matter.

170
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,720
We will come up

171
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,160
with some other solutions.

172
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,920
Like you said, we should try hard!

173
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:35,360
Well,

174
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
I'm going back to the tavern.

175
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,800
Come back early.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,320
I'll make you whatever you want to eat.

177
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,840
Hairy crab, fish soup noodles...

178
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,400
I'll cook whatever is available.

179
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,800
The hole of the spring

180
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,560
must be under the ground.

181
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,280
Can it be blocked by the rocks?

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,480
Because you still need

183
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,000
the last key procedure.

184
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,320
Meng Xiaofan,

185
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,880
time to make a decision.

186
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,800
The Third Princess sacrificed herself

187
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,760
by returning to where she came from

188
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,160
in exchange for a good rain

189
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,200
and then saved everyone.

190
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,480
Maybe you've got some mission

191
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,360
to be completed.

192
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,280
When you complete it,

193
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,240
even if you want to stay,

194
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,320
you can't stay.

195
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,680
I get it.
