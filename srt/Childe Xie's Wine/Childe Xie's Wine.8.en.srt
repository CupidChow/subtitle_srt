3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,120
Are you happy today?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,480
So many people applauded you.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,040
You must be overjoyed.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,360
I don't know why,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,200
but I still feel satisfied

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,280
even though I know

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,120
the applause isn't for me.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,160
I feel happy for whatever you've got.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,560
I feel more about you

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,040
than I feel about myself.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,720
Good night, Xie Xun.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,800
Thank you for the beautiful dream
you gave me.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,240
Time to go back for some wine.

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,560
Why are you here alone?

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,280
It's getting cold. I'm going back.

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,320
Could you sit here with me for a while?

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,480
I'm very happy today.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,480
Thank you.

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,040
You're welcome.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,040
When you're successful,

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,920
I also feel happy as your teacher.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,200
Do you

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,720
only take me as your student?

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
If you did,

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
why wouldn't you

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,520
say that to me

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,000
when I was sober?

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,240
You pretended to be asleep?

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,160
You didn't

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,200
answer my question.

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
It sounded disgusting.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,080
I hate it most to be melodramatic.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,880
My point is

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,680
when you performed on the stage today,

37
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,480
you were glittering.

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,440
Congratulations on realizing your dream,

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
doing what you always want to do,

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
and becoming what you expect to be.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,120
I indeed feel happy for you.

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
So, in your eyes,

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,760
am I special?

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,200
I want to tell you

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,480
that you're very special to me.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,920
I didn't like myself,

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,280
I didn't like the wine

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
and I didn't like this tavern.

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,320
I would rather let others think

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm a playboy

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,760
than tell them

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,200
that I'm crazy about music and dance.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,480
But since you appeared,

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,600
you've changed everything.

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,160
I like what I am now.

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
Maybe,

57
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,960
this is the value of my coming.

58
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,080
If the contract

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,800
restrains our relationship

60
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,840
to be teacher and student,

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
from now on,

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,360
I'll redefine our relationship.

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,800
What do you mean?

64
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,120
I've never had a friend.

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
I've never appreciated

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
or understood a friend, either.

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,040
You make me feel that I have a friend

68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
for the first time.

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,760
Or maybe,

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,120
this isn't a feeling for friends.

71
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,240
You look so beautiful.

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,200
I should go back.

73
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,760
Yufan!

74
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,280
Don't follow up.

75
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,360
He doesn't like me,

76
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
but my face.

77
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,840
However,

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
this isn't my real face.

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
I don't belong here, either.
