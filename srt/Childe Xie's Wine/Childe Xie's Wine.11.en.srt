(Wuti Tavern)
His Majesty's order on Wuti Tavern

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,440
is Binhai's honor.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,600
Under the order
of the county magistrate,

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,320
we came to provide
the treasure of Binhai,

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,080
15 kilograms of Binhai Pears.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
They're given to you to make wine

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,400
for tribute.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,760
So many Binhai Pears.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,000
What do we do with them?

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,800
Binhai Pears are succulent.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,280
Also sweet.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,080
Add them into the wine!

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,120
They can balance

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
the wine's acidity and bitterness.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,680
Giving the wine a sweet aftertaste.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,200
Yummy.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:08,280
(Summer Drink New Product Pear Nectar)

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,320
Shang, another ten orders.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Can you cope with all the orders?

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,440
I can handle them.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,520
I got it.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,320
I'll help you wipe the sweat.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,680
Thank you.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,240
Sure thing.

27
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:38,234
Um,

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,760
Table 2 has been waiting
for quite some time.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,240
Work harder.

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,600
Xiaotang, have you seen your cousin?

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,440
No.

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
Xiaotang, where's my pear?

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,360
I don't know.

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,400
But Murong just came by.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,360
Wait a minute!

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,360
What's your problem?

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,520
You almost lost your hand.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,760
Who allowed you to take my pear?

39
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,840
I need to finish the one last order.

40
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,920
That's your order,

41
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,240
you figure it out.

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,440
I warn you.

43
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,360
Don't touch my pear again.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
It's just a pear. Seriously?

45
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
Ridiculous.

46
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,040
What a long day.

47
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm exhausted.

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,680
Wuti Tavern hasn't had so many

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
customers in ages.

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,280
This is a pleasant coincidence.

51
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,920
Hey, look.

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,120
If we make this Pear Nectar

53
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,280
a symbolic product,

54
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
and open a milk tea stand,

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
we'll make a fortune.

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,560
A milk tea stand?

57
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,000
Why have you been restrained

58
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,120
around me lately

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,080
as if you don't want to be seen?

60
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,480
You know Xiaotang likes you, right?

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,680
Xiaotang?

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,480
I only see her as my cousin.

63
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,960
I have no other feelings for her.

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,000
I swear.

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,360
You don't have to.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
I trust you.

67
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,600
It's just I just came to the tavern,

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,080
and I cherish

69
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,160
the friendship with you guys.

70
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,920
I don't want Xiaotang to dislike me

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,040
because of some love triangle.

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
Friend?

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,200
You still see me as a friend.

74
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,880
So…

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,640
What about

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,120
boyfriend?

77
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,040
What's a boyfriend?

78
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,120
You…

79
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,000
Are my boyfriend.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,240
God.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,080
I can't take it anymore.

82
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,320
My heart is going to pop out.

83
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,080
Boyfriend.

84
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,240
I've been working all day long,

85
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,320
and haven't drunk any water.

86
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,240
Have you got some water?

87
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,960
No.

88
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,480
The look in your eyes betrayed you.

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,760
No.

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,560
Are you hiding something from me?

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,240
Show me.

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,040
No, I'm not.

93
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
I've got nothing.

94
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,360
Give it to me.

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm parched,
and you still won't give it to me?

96
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,080
No, you can't eat this.

97
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Pear is for eating.

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,920
You go back and eat other pears.

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,240
But I gave this to you.

100
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,600
Then it belongs to me now.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
Fine. Whatever.

102
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,560
Let's share it, then.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,440
I'd like to try it.

104
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,480
No.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,640
Don't eat it.

106
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,080
Why?

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,520
Back in my place,

108
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,440
we don't do this thing.

109
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,360
We don't share a pear.

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,480
Or a couple would be separated.

111
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
So…

112
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
I don't want to talk about it.

113
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,360
I'm parched.
I'm going back to drink some water.

114
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,840
So you don't want
to be separated from me?

115
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,360
I don't want to be separated
from you, either.

116
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,000
You always say, "back in your place",

117
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,520
where do you come from anyway?

118
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,120
I…

119
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,920
It's nothing.

120
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,600
You don't have to say it.

121
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,760
Maybe Murong is right

122
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,400
about you not being a human girl.

123
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
I'm actually

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
a very ordinary girl.

125
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,280
Maybe someday,

126
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,760
when you see the real me,

127
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,720
you'll be disappointed.

128
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,080
The real you?

129
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,800
How many more faces of yours
that I haven't seen?

130
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,440
