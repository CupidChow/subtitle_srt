00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,720
She came here by herself?

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,800
I don't know.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,640
I didn't see her earlier.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,240
Let's get a doctor here.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,400
She's awake. She's awake.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,840
Ouch, my head.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,400
Where am I?

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,600
Who are these two?

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,360
Was I...

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,080
drugged?

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,600
Miss. Miss.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,800
Who are you?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,240
Where do you come from?

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,840
I…

(Xixi Splendor)

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,480
My name is Meng Xiaofan.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,840
I clearly remember

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,200
that me and my classmates

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,960
were in a role-playing
murder mystery game.

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,360
While I was choosing my costume,

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,200
I met a handsome man.

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,800
His name is…

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,400
His name is…

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,520
(Wuti Tavern)
I'm the owner of the tavern,

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,520
Xie Tuisi.

29
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,960
If you genuinely want
to realize your dream

30
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
and shake off your confusion,

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
drink this wine,

32
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,680
and you'll get what you want.

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,080
Speak your wish to yourself,

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,480
and drink it.

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,480
I want to be pretty.

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,640
I want a sweet relationship

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,600
before I graduate.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Even if it only lasts one day.

39
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I wish to be good enough

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,440
for you.

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,560
The game is on.

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,880
What's on your mind?

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,680
Wait a minute.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,720
Where's Xie Tuisi?

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,800
Where's your boss?

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,680
You mean the owner?

47
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
He went to the House of Art.

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
He won't be back until nightfall.

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,080
Why do you ask to see my cousin?

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,760
Where do you come from?

51
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
House of Art?

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,280
Is it the next dungeon?

53
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,720
Dungeon?

54
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,000
Could she be one
of Xie Xun's ex-girlfriends?

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,880
Miss,

56
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,200
we run a serious

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
business here.

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,600
What's between you and Xie Xun,

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,080
you can take it out of here.

60
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,120
Don't taint our tavern's reputation.

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,840
This way, please.

62
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,880
Okay.

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
Wait a minute.

64
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,800
I don't remember any place

65
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
called the House of Art in the script.

66
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,880
You NPCs haven't given me

67
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,280
the full script, have you?

68
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,360
NP what?

69
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,240
NPC.

70
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,240

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
NPC.

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,800
N what C?

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,480
NPC!

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,880
Oh,

75
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,680
I get it.

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,280
You're here to apply for a job.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,080
We don't need someone
prettier than…

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,240
We don't need you.

79
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,560

The Eighth Year of the Wu Calendar?

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Cousin.

84
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
You came home early.

85
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,240
The top girl wasn't at work,
so I lost interest.

86
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,520
Still not many customers today?

87
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,760
We're closed, then.

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,880
I'm going back to my room.

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
I'll fetch you when dinner is ready.

90
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,880
Miss, we're closed.

91
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,760
I know.

92
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,720
Won't you leave?

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,680
Okay.

(Wuti Tavern)

95
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,040
It isn't right.

96
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
I need to get an answer
from Xie Tuisi.

97
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,760
What is he doing?

98
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,880
Dancing in the bathroom?

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,920
What a weird hobby is that?

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,640
And what am I doing?

101
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,040
Watching him bathe furtively?

102
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,640
No, no, no.

103
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,280
This is perverted.

104
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,240
I don't care.

105
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,160
If I don't get an answer now,

106
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,280
I won't have another chance.

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,480
I'll do it regardless.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,920
Cousin.

109
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,240
What…

110
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,640
Here are your clean clothes.

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,880
Are you finished?

112
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,600
How about I get in
and hand you the clothes?

113
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,400
No, thank you.

114
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,080
Okay.

115
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
I'll leave the clothes outside the door.

116
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,080
Have you enjoyed it enough?

117
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,000
S-Sorry.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,080
But no.

119
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,520
No, it's not what I'm trying to say.

120
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
I mean your abs are so sexy,

121
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,600
and feel so…

122
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,640
The day

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,360
is still bright,

124
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,960
and you watched a man bathe furtively.

125
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,960
What do you want?

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,120
No, I didn't.

127
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,200
I saw the recruitment poster
and came in.

128
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,320
So you're the new waitress.

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,240
No.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,920
You don't remember me?

131
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
I'm the girl in the Han Clothing hall.

132
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
We got into the tavern together,

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
you gave me a cup of wine,

134
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,800
I passed out after drinking it,

135
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,320
and then I woke up in this building.

136
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,200
A beauty who drank with me?

137
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
I'd surely remember that.

138
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,720
But you left no impression on me.

139
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,680
Beauty?

140
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,360
Me?

141
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,120
What is going on?

142
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,960
How come my face looks like this?

143
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,720
Are you asking me?

144
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,840
How am I supposed to know?

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,720
Hey, look.

146
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,720
You and Xie Tuisi look the same.

147
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,640
You must know something.

148
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,720
Who is this Xie Tuisi person?

149
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,200
A load of nonsense.

150
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

151
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,560
Wait.

How are you?

I really don't understand
what you're talking about.
